### [1] [Stable diffusion models reveal a persisting human and AI gap in visual creativity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16814)
*Silvia Rondini,Claudia Alvarez-Martin,Paula Angermair-Barkai,Olivier Penacchio,M. Paz,Matthew Pelowski,Dan Dediu,Antoni Rodriguez-Fornells,Xim Cerda-Company*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This study assessed image creation by comparing human artists, non-artists, and AI under varying conditions, finding humans, especially artists, outperform AI in creativity, and higher human guidance improves AI output.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to understand how image-generating AI models compare to humans in visual creativity, a domain less explored compared to language-centered tasks.

Method: The study evaluated creativity in images produced by humans (artists and non-artists) and an AI image generator under two prompting conditions, with varying levels of human input. Creativity was rated by both human raters and GPT4o.

Result: A clear creativity gradient emerged: visual artists were most creative, followed by non-artists, then AI with human-inspired prompts, and lastly AI with self-guided prompts. Human guidance significantly improved the AI's performance.

Conclusion: Although generative AI can achieve creativity closer to non-artists with guidance, it struggles with the perceptual and contextual nuances that make visual creativity distinctly human.

Abstract: While recent research suggests Large Language Models match human creative performance in divergent thinking tasks, visual creativity remains underexplored. This study compared image generation in human participants (Visual Artists and Non Artists) and using an image generation AI model (two prompting conditions with varying human input: high for Human Inspired, low for Self Guided). Human raters (N=255) and GPT4o evaluated the creativity of the resulting images. We found a clear creativity gradient, with Visual Artists being the most creative, followed by Non Artists, then Human Inspired generative AI, and finally Self Guided generative AI. Increased human guidance strongly improved GenAI's creative output, bringing its productions close to those of Non Artists. Notably, human and AI raters also showed vastly different creativity judgment patterns. These results suggest that, in contrast to language centered tasks, GenAI models may face unique challenges in visual domains, where creativity depends on perceptual nuance and contextual sensitivity, distinctly human capacities that may not be readily transferable from language models.

### [2] [Cognitive BASIC: An In-Model Interpreted Reasoning Language for LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16837)
*Oliver Kramer*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Cognitive BASIC acts as a minimal programming language that lets large language models (LLMs) perform transparent, step-by-step reasoning by simulating simple programs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a structured, interpretable method for LLM reasoning by integrating a BASIC-inspired approach for transparency and multi-step logical execution.

Method: The paper introduces Cognitive BASIC, which uses numbered lines and commands as a cognitive control layer within LLMs. It employs an interpreter file that specifies command meanings, memory updates, and behavior to structure reasoning.

Result: The approach was tested on three LLMs, showing that they could execute Cognitive BASIC programs with strong but varied performance across knowledge extraction, conflict detection, and reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: Cognitive BASIC demonstrates that LLMs can simulate interpretable program-based reasoning, offering potential for structured and transparent AI processes.

Abstract: Cognitive BASIC is a minimal, BASIC-style prompting language and in-model interpreter that structures large language model (LLM) reasoning into explicit, stepwise execution traces. Inspired by the simplicity of retro BASIC, we repurpose numbered lines and simple commands as an interpretable cognitive control layer. Modern LLMs can reliably simulate such short programs, enabling transparent multi-step reasoning inside the model. A natural-language interpreter file specifies command semantics, memory updates, and logging behavior. Our mental-model interpreter extracts declarative and procedural knowledge, detects contradictions, and produces resolutions when necessary. A comparison across three LLMs on a benchmark of knowledge extraction, conflict detection, and reasoning tasks shows that all models can execute Cognitive BASIC programs, with overall strong but not uniform performance.

*Sang Truong,Yuheng Tu,Michael Hardy,Anka Reuel,Zeyu Tang,Jirayu Burapacheep,Jonathan Perera,Chibuike Uwakwe,Ben Domingue,Nick Haber,Sanmi Koyejo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework to identify invalid questions in AI benchmarks using statistical analysis, achieving high precision and reducing manual effort.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual identification and correction of errors in benchmark questions is infeasible, compromising their reliability and hindering AI progress.

Method: The framework uses statistical analysis of response patterns to detect invalid questions, employs expert reviews, and integrates an LLM-judge for initial assessment.

Result: The approach achieves up to 84% precision in identifying problematic questions across nine benchmarks, reducing human effort significantly.

Conclusion: The framework offers an efficient, scalable solution to revise benchmarks systematically, enhancing their reliability and utility in AI evaluation.

Abstract: Benchmarks are pivotal in driving AI progress, and invalid benchmark questions frequently undermine their reliability. Manually identifying and correcting errors among thousands of benchmark questions is not only infeasible but also a critical bottleneck for reliable evaluation. In this work, we introduce a framework for systematic benchmark revision that leverages statistical analysis of response patterns to flag potentially invalid questions for further expert review. Our approach builds on a core assumption commonly used in AI evaluations that the mean score sufficiently summarizes model performance. This implies a unidimensional latent construct underlying the measurement experiment, yielding expected ranges for various statistics for each item. When empirically estimated values for these statistics fall outside the expected range for an item, the item is more likely to be problematic. Across nine widely used benchmarks, our method guides expert review to identify problematic questions with up to 84\% precision. In addition, we introduce an LLM-judge first pass to review questions, further reducing human effort. Together, these components provide an efficient and scalable framework for systematic benchmark revision.

### [4] [Hybrid Differential Reward: Combining Temporal Difference and Action Gradients for Efficient Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning in Cooperative Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16916)
*Ye Han,Lijun Zhang,Dejian Meng,Zhuang Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Hybrid Differential Reward (HDR) to address vanishing reward differences in multi-vehicle cooperative driving tasks. HDR improves convergence speed and policy stability by integrating temporal difference rewards and action gradient rewards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To resolve the inherent issue in multi-vehicle cooperative driving tasks where traditional reward functions lead to low signal-to-noise ratios (SNR), slowing algorithm convergence and degrading performance.

Method: The proposed HDR mechanism includes two parts: Temporal Difference Reward (TRD), leveraging global potential function trends, and Action Gradient Reward (ARG), providing local guidance. This is applied to a Multi-Agent Partially Observable Markov Game (POMDPG).

Result: HDR significantly enhances convergence speed and policy stability in various algorithms (MCTS, QMIX, MAPPO, MADDPG), effectively achieving efficient and safe cooperative driving policies.

Conclusion: HDR successfully addresses the challenges in cooperative driving by enabling agents to learn efficient and safe policies, resolving issues with traditional state-based rewards.

Abstract: In multi-vehicle cooperative driving tasks involving high-frequency continuous control, traditional state-based reward functions suffer from the issue of vanishing reward differences. This phenomenon results in a low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for policy gradients, significantly hindering algorithm convergence and performance improvement. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a novel Hybrid Differential Reward (HDR) mechanism. We first theoretically elucidate how the temporal quasi-steady nature of traffic states and the physical proximity of actions lead to the failure of traditional reward signals. Building on this analysis, the HDR framework innovatively integrates two complementary components: (1) a Temporal Difference Reward (TRD) based on a global potential function, which utilizes the evolutionary trend of potential energy to ensure optimal policy invariance and consistency with long-term objectives; and (2) an Action Gradient Reward (ARG), which directly measures the marginal utility of actions to provide a local guidance signal with a high SNR. Furthermore, we formulate the cooperative driving problem as a Multi-Agent Partially Observable Markov Game (POMDPG) with a time-varying agent set and provide a complete instantiation scheme for HDR within this framework. Extensive experiments conducted using both online planning (MCTS) and Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (QMIX, MAPPO, MADDPG) algorithms demonstrate that the HDR mechanism significantly improves convergence speed and policy stability. The results confirm that HDR guides agents to learn high-quality cooperative policies that effectively balance traffic efficiency and safety.

### [5] [Comparing verbal, visual and combined explanations for Bayesian Network inferences](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16961)
*Erik P. Nyberg,Steven Mascaro,Ingrid Zukerman,Michael Wybrow,Duc-Minh Vo,Ann Nicholson*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This study examines how verbal and visual UI extensions can improve users’ understanding of Bayesian Networks (BNs) during probabilistic reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: BNs are difficult for users to understand, and current UIs do not adequately clarify their reasoning.

Method: Verbal, visual, and combined UI extensions were developed and compared against a baseline UI in a user study examining different types of inference tasks.

Result: The extensions performed better than the baseline for understanding observation impact, paths explaining this impact, and interactions between observations. Combined verbal and visual modalities showed better results for certain tasks.

Conclusion: Enhancing BN UIs with verbal and visual extensions improves user reasoning, and combining these modalities can further enhance understanding in specific cases.

Abstract: Bayesian Networks (BNs) are an important tool for assisting probabilistic reasoning, but despite being considered transparent models, people have trouble understanding them. Further, current User Interfaces (UIs) still do not clarify the reasoning of BNs. To address this problem, we have designed verbal and visual extensions to the standard BN UI, which can guide users through common inference patterns.
  We conducted a user study to compare our verbal, visual and combined UI extensions, and a baseline UI. Our main findings are: (1) users did better with all three types of extensions than with the baseline UI for questions about the impact of an observation, the paths that enable this impact, and the way in which an observation influences the impact of other observations; and (2) using verbal and visual modalities together is better than using either modality alone for some of these question types.

### [6] [DAPS++: Rethinking Diffusion Inverse Problems with Decoupled Posterior Annealing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17038)
*Hao Chen,Renzheng Zhang,Scott S. Howard*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Score-based diffusion is reinterpreted for inverse problems, emphasizing decoupling the diffusion initialization and measurement-consistency to improve efficiency and performance. Introducing DAPS++, it optimizes computational and reconstruction tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address limitations in score-based diffusion methods for inverse problems by reevaluating their practical behavior and improving computational efficiency and reconstruction outcomes.

Method: Proposes DAPS++, which decouples the diffusion initialization and refinement process using an expectation--maximization (EM) framework to enable better likelihood guidance and efficiency.

Result: DAPS++ shows robust reconstruction performance across image restoration tasks with reduced computational steps, fewer NFEs, and measurement-optimization stages.

Conclusion: DAPS++ offers a more computationally efficient and robust solution for inverse problems, improving performance by reframing diffusion's role within an EM-style framework.

Abstract: From a Bayesian perspective, score-based diffusion solves inverse problems through joint inference, embedding the likelihood with the prior to guide the sampling process. However, this formulation fails to explain its practical behavior: the prior offers limited guidance, while reconstruction is largely driven by the measurement-consistency term, leading to an inference process that is effectively decoupled from the diffusion dynamics. To clarify this structure, we reinterpret the role of diffusion in inverse problem solving as an initialization stage within an expectation--maximization (EM)--style framework, where the diffusion stage and the data-driven refinement are fully decoupled. We introduce \textbf{DAPS++}, which allows the likelihood term to guide inference more directly while maintaining numerical stability and providing insight into why unified diffusion trajectories remain effective in practice. By requiring fewer function evaluations (NFEs) and measurement-optimization steps, \textbf{DAPS++} achieves high computational efficiency and robust reconstruction performance across diverse image restoration tasks.

### [7] [MirrorMind: Empowering OmniScientist with the Expert Perspectives and Collective Knowledge of Human Scientists](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16997)
*Qingbin Zeng,Bingbing Fan,Zhiyu Chen,Sijian Ren,Zhilun Zhou,Xuhua Zhang,Yuanyi Zhen,Fengli Xu,Yong Li,Tie-Yan Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'MirrorMind,' a new AI architecture designed to simulate both individual and collective cognitive processes for enhanced scientific reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address limitations in current AI approaches that view scientific discovery as an isolated optimization process and struggle to represent the social and historical nature of knowledge production.

Method: The proposed method, MirrorMind, integrates dual-memory representations using a three-level framework: Individual Level (specific researcher modeling), Domain Level (disciplinary concept graphs), and Interdisciplinary Level (cross-domain orchestration).

Result: MirrorMind demonstrated strong performance in tasks such as cognitive simulation, complementary reasoning, interdisciplinary collaboration, and multi-agent problem-solving, surpassing basic fact retrieval.

Conclusion: MirrorMind bridges the gap between individual cognitive insight and collective knowledge networks, enabling a more structured, personalized, and insight-driven approach to scientific problem-solving.

Abstract: The emergence of AI Scientists has demonstrated remarkable potential in automating scientific research. However, current approaches largely conceptualize scientific discovery as a solitary optimization or search process, overlooking that knowledge production is inherently a social and historical endeavor. Human scientific insight stems from two distinct yet interconnected sources. First is the individual cognitive trajectory, where a researcher's unique insight is shaped by their evolving research history and stylistic preferences; another is the collective disciplinary memory, where knowledge is sedimented into vast, interconnected networks of citations and concepts. Existing LLMs still struggle to represent these structured, high-fidelity cognitive and social contexts. To bridge this gap, we introduce MirrorMind, a hierarchical cognitive architecture that integrates dual-memory representations within a three-level framework. The Individual Level constructs high-fidelity cognitive models of individual researchers by capturing their episodic, semantic, and persona memories; the Domain Level maps collective knowledge into structured disciplinary concept graphs; and the Interdisciplinary Level that acts as an orthogonal orchestration engine. Crucially, our architecture separates memory storage from agentic execution, enabling AI scientist agents to flexibly access individual memories for unique perspectives or collective structures to reason. We evaluate MirrorMind across four comprehensive tasks, including author-level cognitive simulation, complementary reasoning, cross-disciplinary collaboration promotion, and multi-agent scientific problem solving. The results show that by integrating individual cognitive depth with collective disciplinary breadth, MirrorMind moves beyond simple fact retrieval toward structural, personalized, and insight-generating scientific reasoning.

### [8] [Budget-Aware Tool-Use Enables Effective Agent Scaling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17006)
*Tengxiao Liu,Zifeng Wang,Jin Miao,I-Hung Hsu,Jun Yan,Jiefeng Chen,Rujun Han,Fangyuan Xu,Yanfei Chen,Ke Jiang,Samira Daruki,Yi Liang,William Yang Wang,Tomas Pfister,Chen-Yu Lee*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper studies improving performance in tool-augmented agents under explicit tool-call budgets, introducing methods like Budget Tracker and BATS for budget-aware scaling strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations of granting tool-augmented agents larger tool-call budgets without scalability benefits, aiming to improve their efficiency in interacting with external environments.

Method: The authors introduce Budget Tracker for continuous budget awareness and BATS (Budget Aware Test-time Scaling) framework, which dynamically adapts agent strategies based on resource availability.

Result: Methods like Budget Tracker and BATS significantly improve cost-performance scaling in budget-constrained tool-augmented agents, pushing the Pareto frontier.

Conclusion: Budget awareness is essential for effective scaling in tool-augmented agents, enhancing their cost-performance balance and fostering transparency in scaling strategies.

Abstract: Scaling test-time computation improves performance across different tasks on large language models (LLMs), which has also been extended to tool-augmented agents. For these agents, scaling involves not only "thinking" in tokens but also "acting" via tool calls. The number of tool calls directly bounds the agent's interaction with the external environment. However, we find that simply granting agents a larger tool-call budget fails to improve performance, as they lack "budget awareness" and quickly hit a performance ceiling. To address this, we study how to scale such agents effectively under explicit tool-call budgets, focusing on web search agents. We first introduce the Budget Tracker, a lightweight plug-in that provides the agent with continuous budget awareness, enabling simple yet effective scaling. We further develop BATS (Budget Aware Test-time Scaling), an advanced framework that leverages this awareness to dynamically adapt its planning and verification strategy, deciding whether to "dig deeper" on a promising lead or "pivot" to new paths based on remaining resources. To analyze cost-performance scaling in a controlled manner, we formalize a unified cost metric that jointly accounts for token and tool consumption. We provide the first systematic study on budget-constrained agents, showing that budget-aware methods produce more favorable scaling curves and push the cost-performance Pareto frontier. Our work offers empirical insights toward a more transparent and principled understanding of scaling in tool-augmented agents.

### [9] [Patient-level Information Extraction by Consistent Integration of Textual and Tabular Evidence with Bayesian Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17056)
*Paloma Rabaey,Adrick Tench,Stefan Heytens,Thomas Demeester*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to extract patient-level information from electronic health records by combining structured tabular data with unstructured text, using a Bayesian network and neural text classifiers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the challenge of leveraging unstructured clinical text alongside structured EHR data for developing transparent and interpretable clinical decision support systems.

Method: The method integrates tabular EHR features through an expert-informed Bayesian network and textual data using neural text classifiers, combining predictions with a virtual evidence mechanism and a consistency node to improve calibration.

Result: The proposed approach demonstrates improved prediction calibration by resolving inconsistencies and handling missing data, as shown on the benchmark SimSUM dataset.

Conclusion: This technique offers a transparent and probabilistic fusion of tabular and textual patient data, showing promise for more reliable clinical decision support systems.

Abstract: Electronic health records (EHRs) form an invaluable resource for training clinical decision support systems. To leverage the potential of such systems in high-risk applications, we need large, structured tabular datasets on which we can build transparent feature-based models. While part of the EHR already contains structured information (e.g. diagnosis codes, medications, and lab results), much of the information is contained within unstructured text (e.g. discharge summaries and nursing notes). In this work, we propose a method for multi-modal patient-level information extraction that leverages both the tabular features available in the patient's EHR (using an expert-informed Bayesian network) as well as clinical notes describing the patient's symptoms (using neural text classifiers). We propose the use of virtual evidence augmented with a consistency node to provide an interpretable, probabilistic fusion of the models' predictions. The consistency node improves the calibration of the final predictions compared to virtual evidence alone, allowing the Bayesian network to better adjust the neural classifier's output to handle missing information and resolve contradictions between the tabular and text data. We show the potential of our method on the SimSUM dataset, a simulated benchmark linking tabular EHRs with clinical notes through expert knowledge.

### [10] [The Belief-Desire-Intention Ontology for modelling mental reality and agency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17162)
*Sara Zuppiroli,Carmelo Fabio Longo,Anna Sofia Lippolis,Rocco Paolillo,Lorenzo Giammei,Miguel Ceriani,Francesco Poggi,Antonio Zinilli,Andrea Giovanni Nuzzolese*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a formal Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) Ontology that bridges declarative and procedural intelligence, ensuring semantic interoperability and enabling cognitive, explainable multi-agent systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a structured, interoperable knowledge representation for the BDI model, addressing limitations in its existing integration within AI and cognitive systems.

Method: Developed a modular BDI Ontology aligned with foundational ontologies and tested it via experiments: combining with Large Language Models through Logic Augmented Generation and integrating into Semas reasoning platform using Triples-to-Beliefs-to-Triples (T2B2T).

Result: The BDI Ontology enhanced inferential coherence and consistency in integration with LLMs and facilitated bidirectional reasoning between RDF triples and mental states.

Conclusion: The BDI Ontology offers a significant step toward creating explainable, cognitively grounded, and semantically interoperable multi-agent systems.

Abstract: The Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) model is a cornerstone for representing rational agency in artificial intelligence and cognitive sciences. Yet, its integration into structured, semantically interoperable knowledge representations remains limited. This paper presents a formal BDI Ontology, conceived as a modular Ontology Design Pattern (ODP) that captures the cognitive architecture of agents through beliefs, desires, intentions, and their dynamic interrelations. The ontology ensures semantic precision and reusability by aligning with foundational ontologies and best practices in modular design. Two complementary lines of experimentation demonstrate its applicability: (i) coupling the ontology with Large Language Models (LLMs) via Logic Augmented Generation (LAG) to assess the contribution of ontological grounding to inferential coherence and consistency; and (ii) integrating the ontology within the Semas reasoning platform, which implements the Triples-to-Beliefs-to-Triples (T2B2T) paradigm, enabling a bidirectional flow between RDF triples and agent mental states. Together, these experiments illustrate how the BDI Ontology acts as both a conceptual and operational bridge between declarative and procedural intelligence, paving the way for cognitively grounded, explainable, and semantically interoperable multi-agent and neuro-symbolic systems operating within the Web of Data.

### [11] [MIR: Efficient Exploration in Episodic Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning via Mutual Intrinsic Reward](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17165)
*Kesheng Chen,Wenjian Luo,Bang Zhang,Zeping Yin,Zipeng Ye*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper tackles challenges in multi-agent reinforcement learning with sparse rewards by introducing Mutual Intrinsic Reward (MIR) to boost team exploration and performance, validated experimentally in new MARL environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the difficulties in applying intrinsic reward methods to MARL, specifically the issues of joint action trajectory sparsity and lack of team-state consideration.

Method: The paper proposes the Mutual Intrinsic Reward (MIR) mechanism to incentivize agents to explore and influence teammate behavior, enhancing team exploration in MARL.

Result: The proposed MIR approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in modified MiniGrid-MA environments, demonstrating improved algorithm performance in sparse reward settings.

Conclusion: MIR is an effective solution for improving exploration and coordination in multi-agent environments with sparse rewards, addressing significant challenges in MARL.

Abstract: Episodic rewards present a significant challenge in reinforcement learning. While intrinsic reward methods have demonstrated effectiveness in single-agent rein-forcement learning scenarios, their application to multi-agent reinforcement learn-ing (MARL) remains problematic. The primary difficulties stem from two fac-tors: (1) the exponential sparsity of joint action trajectories that lead to rewards as the exploration space expands, and (2) existing methods often fail to account for joint actions that can influence team states. To address these challenges, this paper introduces Mutual Intrinsic Reward (MIR), a simple yet effective enhancement strategy for MARL with extremely sparse rewards like episodic rewards. MIR incentivizes individual agents to explore actions that affect their teammates, and when combined with original strategies, effectively stimulates team exploration and improves algorithm performance. For comprehensive experimental valida-tion, we extend the representative single-agent MiniGrid environment to create MiniGrid-MA, a series of MARL environments with sparse rewards. Our evalu-ation compares the proposed method against state-of-the-art approaches in the MiniGrid-MA setting, with experimental results demonstrating superior perfor-mance.

### [12] [Designing Domain-Specific Agents via Hierarchical Task Abstraction Mechanism](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17198)
*Kaiyu Li,Jiayu Wang,Zhi Wang,Hui Qiao,Weizhan Zhang,Deyu Meng,Xiangyong Cao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper presents a Hierarchical Task Abstraction Mechanism (HTAM) to improve agent performance in specialized, complex domains such as geospatial analysis by restructuring task dependencies into logical hierarchies. A system, EarthAgent, and a benchmark, GeoPlan-bench, are introduced and validated, showing superior performance over existing systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing generalized frameworks such as ReAct are insufficient for rigorous, multi-step workflows needed in specialized fields like remote sensing and geospatial analysis. The inability to handle domain-specific sequential dependencies signifies the need for a domain-aligned design.

Method: The authors propose a Hierarchical Task Abstraction Mechanism (HTAM) that organizes multi-agent systems into a logical task-dependency hierarchy. They implement this as EarthAgent and create GeoPlan-bench for assessing planning and execution efficiency in geospatial tasks.

Result: EarthAgent, utilizing HTAM, significantly outperforms existing single- and multi-agent systems on GeoPlan-bench, measured using new metrics of tool selection, path similarity, and logical task execution completeness.

Conclusion: Aligning multi-agent architectures with the inherent logical structure of a domain's tasks improves performance and reliability, particularly in specialized, multi-step workflows, as demonstrated by EarthAgent's success in geospatial analysis tasks.

Abstract: LLM-driven agents, particularly those using general frameworks like ReAct or human-inspired role-playing, often struggle in specialized domains that necessitate rigorously structured workflows. Fields such as remote sensing, requiring specialized tools (e.g., correction, spectral indices calculation), and multi-step procedures (e.g., numerous intermediate products and optional steps), significantly challenge generalized approaches. To address this gap, we introduce a novel agent design framework centered on a Hierarchical Task Abstraction Mechanism (HTAM). Specifically, HTAM moves beyond emulating social roles, instead structuring multi-agent systems into a logical hierarchy that mirrors the intrinsic task-dependency graph of a given domain. This task-centric architecture thus enforces procedural correctness and decomposes complex problems into sequential layers, where each layer's sub-agents operate on the outputs of the preceding layers. We instantiate this framework as EarthAgent, a multi-agent system tailored for complex geospatial analysis. To evaluate such complex planning capabilities, we build GeoPlan-bench, a comprehensive benchmark of realistic, multi-step geospatial planning tasks. It is accompanied by a suite of carefully designed metrics to evaluate tool selection, path similarity, and logical completeness. Experiments show that EarthAgent substantially outperforms a range of established single- and multi-agent systems. Our work demonstrates that aligning agent architecture with a domain's intrinsic task structure is a critical step toward building robust and reliable specialized autonomous systems.

*Virginia Dignum,Frank Dignum*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper argues for integrating concepts from the AAMAS community to build AI systems with sustained autonomy, reasoning, and interaction, emphasizing transparency, cooperation, and accountability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable AI systems to achieve sustained autonomy, reasoning, and collaboration while maintaining accountability and transparency.

Method: The paper proposes aligning models from AAMAS, such as BDI architectures and communication protocols, with adaptive, data-driven technologies.

Result: Combining structured reasoning models with practical AI techniques can lead to agentic systems that are functional yet transparent and cooperative.

Conclusion: The integration of formal theories (AAMAS concepts) with practical AI methods offers a promising path toward realizing capable and accountable agentic systems.

Abstract: Agentic AI seeks to endow systems with sustained autonomy, reasoning, and interaction capabilities. To realize this vision, its assumptions about agency must be complemented by explicit models of cognition, cooperation, and governance. This paper argues that the conceptual tools developed within the Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS) community, such as BDI architectures, communication protocols, mechanism design, and institutional modelling, provide precisely such a foundation. By aligning adaptive, data-driven approaches with structured models of reasoning and coordination, we outline a path toward agentic systems that are not only capable and flexible, but also transparent, cooperative, and accountable. The result is a perspective on agency that bridges formal theory and practical autonomy.

### [14] [That's not natural: The Impact of Off-Policy Training Data on Probe Performance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17408)
*Nathalie Kirch,Samuel Dower,Adrians Skapars,Ekdeep Singh Lubana,Dmitrii Krasheninnikov*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper discusses strategies for monitoring Large Language Models (LLMs) using probes to detect behaviors like deception, and evaluates the effectiveness of using synthetic/off-policy data across distinct behaviors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind the study is to improve methods for detecting concerning behaviors in LLMs, as natural instances of such behaviors are rare, driving researchers to explore alternative data sources like synthetic or off-policy responses.

Method: The researchers systematically tested linear and attention probes across eight LLM behaviors and multiple models. They analyzed the impact of using synthetic and off-policy data for training probes and their ability to generalize to on-policy data.

Result: Probes generalize better from same-domain off-policy data compared to on-policy data from a different domain. However, significant performance degradation was noted due to domain shifts in training data, and certain behaviors like Deception and Sandbagging struggle to generalize effectively.

Conclusion: Probes trained on same-domain off-policy data are more reliable for monitoring LLMs when on-policy data is unavailable. The study highlights the need for improved methods to mitigate the challenges posed by distribution shifts in LLM monitoring.

Abstract: Probing has emerged as a promising method for monitoring Large Language Models (LLMs), enabling inference-time detection of concerning behaviours such as deception and sycophancy. However, natural examples of many behaviours are rare, forcing researchers to rely on synthetic or off-policy LLM responses for training probes. We systematically evaluate how the use of synthetic and off-policy data influences probe generalisation across eight distinct LLM behaviours. Testing linear and attention probes across multiple LLMs, we find that the response generation strategy can significantly affect probe performance, though the magnitude of this effect varies by behaviour. We find that successful generalisation from off-policy data, to test sets where the model is incentivised to produce the target behaviour, is predictive of successful on-policy generalisation. Leveraging this result, we predict that Deception and Sandbagging probes may fail to generalise from off-policy to on-policy data when used in real monitoring scenarios. Notably, shifts in the training data domain still cause even larger performance degradation, with different-domain test scores being consistently lower than the same-domain ones. These results indicate that, in the absence of on-policy data, using same-domain off-policy data yields more reliable probes than using on-policy data from a different domain, emphasizing the need for methods that can better handle distribution shifts in LLM monitoring.

*Jiaxi Liu,Chengyuan Ma,Hang Zhou,Weizhe Tang,Shixiao Liang,Haoyang Ding,Xiaopeng Li,Bin Ran*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces the SRA-CP framework for cooperative perception, reducing unnecessary bandwidth usage and improving performance in dynamic conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiency of generic cooperative perception methods in communication bandwidth usage and their lack of adaptability to dynamic traffic environments.

Method: A decentralized protocol enabling connected vehicles to assess perceptual risks and engage in selective, bandwidth-efficient information exchange only when safety-critical blind zones are detected.

Result: SRA-CP reduced communication bandwidth usage by 80%, maintained less than 1% average precision loss for critical objects compared to generic methods, and improved performance by 15% over existing risk-blind selective methods.

Conclusion: The proposed SRA-CP framework enhances efficiency and safety in cooperative perception by focusing on risk-aware, selective, and bandwidth-adaptive information exchange.

Abstract: Cooperative perception (CP) offers significant potential to overcome the limitations of single-vehicle sensing by enabling information sharing among connected vehicles (CVs). However, existing generic CP approaches need to transmit large volumes of perception data that are irrelevant to the driving safety, exceeding available communication bandwidth. Moreover, most CP frameworks rely on pre-defined communication partners, making them unsuitable for dynamic traffic environments. This paper proposes a Spontaneous Risk-Aware Selective Cooperative Perception (SRA-CP) framework to address these challenges. SRA-CP introduces a decentralized protocol where connected agents continuously broadcast lightweight perception coverage summaries and initiate targeted cooperation only when risk-relevant blind zones are detected. A perceptual risk identification module enables each CV to locally assess the impact of occlusions on its driving task and determine whether cooperation is necessary. When CP is triggered, the ego vehicle selects appropriate peers based on shared perception coverage and engages in selective information exchange through a fusion module that prioritizes safety-critical content and adapts to bandwidth constraints. We evaluate SRA-CP on a public dataset against several representative baselines. Results show that SRA-CP achieves less than 1% average precision (AP) loss for safety-critical objects compared to generic CP, while using only 20% of the communication bandwidth. Moreover, it improves the perception performance by 15% over existing selective CP methods that do not incorporate risk awareness.

TL;DR: This paper introduces Vorion, a prototype GPU architecture optimized for accelerating 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) rendering and training through dedicated hardware.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the computational inefficiencies of 3DGS which hinder real-time neural rendering and 4D reconstruction on current hardware platforms.

Method: The authors designed Vorion, a scalable GPU prototype with hardware-accelerated 3DGS capabilities, leveraging z-tiling, a hybrid dataflow structure, and minimal changes to traditional rasterizers.

Result: When prototyped using TSMC 16nm FinFET technology, Vorion demonstrates 19 FPS for rendering and 38.6 iterations/s for training with a scaled design.

Conclusion: Vorion offers a promising path towards efficient 3DGS rendering and training, paving the way for incorporating this technology in future GPU architectures.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently emerged as a foundational technique for real-time neural rendering, 3D scene generation, volumetric video (4D) capture. However, its rendering and training impose massive computation, making real-time rendering on edge devices and real-time 4D reconstruction on workstations currently infeasible. Given its fixed-function nature and similarity with traditional rasterization, 3DGS presents a strong case for dedicated hardware in the graphics pipeline of next-generation GPUs. This work, Vorion, presents the first GPGPU prototype with hardware-accelerated 3DGS rendering and training. Vorion features scalable architecture, minimal hardware change to traditional rasterizers, z-tiling to increase parallelism, and Gaussian/pixel-centric hybrid dataflow. We prototype the minimal system (8 SIMT cores, 2 Gaussian rasterizer) using TSMC 16nm FinFET technology, which achieves 19 FPS for rendering. The scaled design with 16 rasterizers achieves 38.6 iterations/s for training.

*Jiaxun Fang,Li Zhang,Shaoyi Huang*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: This paper proposes a layer-wise compression framework for CNN execution to optimize systolic accelerators' energy consumption while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current CNN systolic array accelerators are limited in energy optimization due to the lack of detailed models addressing layer-specific activation and energy characteristics.

Method: The authors developed a layer-aware MAC energy model based on activation statistics and MSB-Hamming distance grouping, paired with an energy-accuracy optimized weight selection and a compression schedule.

Result: Experiments showed up to 58.6% energy savings with only a 2-3% accuracy reduction compared to state-of-the-art approaches.

Conclusion: The framework efficiently improves energy savings by targeting high energy layers without significantly compromising accuracy.

Abstract: Systolic array accelerators execute CNNs with energy dominated by the switching activity of multiply accumulate (MAC) units. Although prior work exploits weight dependent MAC power for compression, existing methods often use global activation models, coarse energy proxies, or layer-agnostic policies, which limits their effectiveness on real hardware. We propose an energy aware, layer-wise compression framework that explicitly leverages MAC and layer level energy characteristics. First, we build a layer-aware MAC energy model that combines per-layer activation statistics with an MSB-Hamming distance grouping of 22-bit partial sum transitions, and integrate it with a tile-level systolic mapping to estimate convolution-layer energy. On top of this model, we introduce an energy accuracy co-optimized weight selection algorithm within quantization aware training and an energy-prioritized layer-wise schedule that compresses high energy layers more aggressively under a global accuracy constraint. Experiments on different CNN models demonstrate up to 58.6\% energy reduction with 2-3\% accuracy drop, outperforming a state-of-the-art power-aware baseline.

Motivation: To address the challenges posed by traditional Von-Neumann architectures’ memory wall and the need for more energy-efficient AI hardware, especially for edge applications like robotics and UAVs.

Method: The study proposes DISCA, a novel digital in-memory stochastic computing architecture leveraging the quasi-stochastic Bent-Pyramid data format to combine simplicity and scalability of analog and digital systems.

Result: DISCA achieves an energy efficiency of 3.59 TOPS/W per bit at 500 MHz using 180nm CMOS technology, substantially outperforming other architectures for matrix multiplication workloads.

Conclusion: DISCA provides a highly energy-efficient solution for matrix multiplication tasks in large-scale AI models, demonstrating its potential to overcome hardware constraints in edge AI applications.

Abstract: Nowadays, we are witnessing an Artificial Intelligence revolution that dominates the technology landscape in various application domains, such as healthcare, robotics, automotive, security, and defense. Massive-scale AI models, which mimic the human brain's functionality, typically feature millions and even billions of parameters through data-intensive matrix multiplication tasks. While conventional Von-Neumann architectures struggle with the memory wall and the end of Moore's Law, these AI applications are migrating rapidly towards the edge, such as in robotics and unmanned aerial vehicles for surveillance, thereby adding more constraints to the hardware budget of AI architectures at the edge. Although in-memory computing has been proposed as a promising solution for the memory wall, both analog and digital in-memory computing architectures suffer from substantial degradation of the proposed benefits due to various design limitations. We propose a new digital in-memory stochastic computing architecture, DISCA, utilizing a compressed version of the quasi-stochastic Bent-Pyramid data format. DISCA inherits the same computational simplicity of analog computing, while preserving the same scalability, productivity, and reliability of digital systems. Post-layout modeling results of DISCA show an energy efficiency of 3.59 TOPS/W per bit at 500 MHz using a commercial 180nm CMOS technology. Therefore, DISCA significantly improves the energy efficiency for matrix multiplication workloads by orders of magnitude if scaled and compared to its counterpart architectures.

Motivation: To address the lack of morphological analysis and language-aware tools for the under-resourced Bantu language Shona.

Method: The paper develops a rule-based morphological pipeline using a curated JSON lexicon and linguistically informed rules, implemented in the spaCy framework for token-level linguistic annotations.

Result: Shona spaCy achieved 90% POS-tagging accuracy and 88% morphological-feature accuracy on both formal and informal Shona corpora.

Conclusion: Shona spaCy provides accessible NLP tools for Shona speakers, promotes digital inclusion, and sets a foundation for creating similar tools for other under-resourced Bantu languages.

### [23] [Bench360: Benchmarking Local LLM Inference from 360°](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16682)
*Linus Stuhlmann,Mauricio Fadel Argerich,Jonathan Fürst*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Bench360, a benchmark for local inference of large language models (LLMs), addressing the challenges users face in determining optimal configurations by integrating system and task performance metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As running LLMs locally becomes commonplace, users encounter difficulty in selecting optimal configurations due to the numerous options available. Existing benchmarks are narrow and do not provide user-focused evaluations of system and task metrics integratively.

Method: Bench360 enables custom task definitions with datasets and metrics, benchmarking multiple LLMs, inference engines, and quantization levels across various usage scenarios. It evaluates both system-level metrics (e.g., latency, energy usage) and task-specific metrics (e.g., accuracy).

Result: The authors tested Bench360 on tasks like QA and summarization using different hardware and inference platforms, revealing trade-offs in performance and efficiency. Their findings emphasize the lack of a single universally best setup.

Conclusion: Bench360 addresses the need for a comprehensive framework by combining multiple metrics for benchmarking local LLM inferences, helping identify trade-offs and supporting user-focused decision-making for optimal model configurations.

Abstract: Running large language models (LLMs) locally is becoming increasingly common. While the growing availability of small open-source models and inference engines has lowered the entry barrier, users now face an overwhelming number of configuration choices. Identifying an optimal configuration -- balancing functional and non-functional requirements -- requires substantial manual effort. While several benchmarks target LLM inference, they are designed for narrow evaluation goals and not user-focused. They fail to integrate relevant system and task-specific metrics into a unified, easy-to-use benchmark that supports multiple inference engines, usage scenarios, and quantization levels. To address this gap, we present Bench360 -- Benchmarking Local LLM Inference from 360°. Bench360 allows users to easily define their own custom tasks along with datasets and relevant task-specific metrics and then automatically benchmarks selected LLMs, inference engines, and quantization levels across different usage scenarios (single stream, batch & server). Bench360 tracks a wide range of metrics, including (1) system metrics -- such as Computing Performance (e.g., latency, throughput), Resource Usage (e.g., energy per query), and Deployment (e.g., cold start time) -- and (2) task-specific metrics such as ROUGE, F1 score or accuracy. We demonstrate Bench360 on four common LLM tasks -- General Knowledge & Reasoning, QA, Summarization and Text-to-SQL -- across three hardware platforms and four state of the art inference engines. Our results reveal several interesting trade-offs between task performance and system-level efficiency, highlighting the differences in inference engines and models. Most importantly, there is no single best setup for local inference, which strongly motivates the need for a framework such as Bench360.

### [24] [Towards Hyper-Efficient RAG Systems in VecDBs: Distributed Parallel Multi-Resolution Vector Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16681)
*Dong Liu,Yanxuan Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces Semantic Pyramid Indexing (SPI), a framework for optimized adaptive multi-resolution indexing in vector databases for RAG systems, achieving faster retrieval speeds, improved efficiency, and enhanced QA performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vector database retrieval methods have limitations in adapting to varying semantic granularities of user queries, leading to trade-offs in retrieval efficiency and relevance.

Method: The paper proposes SPI as a multi-resolution indexing framework employing dynamic query-adaptive resolution through semantic pyramids, avoiding offline tuning and using a lightweight classifier for optimal query resolution.

Result: SPI offers up to 5.7× retrieval speedup, 1.8× memory efficiency gain, and improves QA F1 scores by up to 2.5 points, showcasing enhanced performance and compatibility with FAISS and Qdrant backends.

Conclusion: SPI advances RAG systems by enabling efficient and adaptive retrieval using semantic pyramids. It is deployable in production systems with theoretical quality guarantees and validated components.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems have become a dominant approach to augment large language models (LLMs) with external knowledge. However, existing vector database (VecDB) retrieval pipelines rely on flat or single-resolution indexing structures, which cannot adapt to the varying semantic granularity required by diverse user queries. This limitation leads to suboptimal trade-offs between retrieval speed and contextual relevance.
  To address this, we propose \textbf{Semantic Pyramid Indexing (SPI)}, a novel multi-resolution vector indexing framework that introduces query-adaptive resolution control for RAG in VecDBs. Unlike existing hierarchical methods that require offline tuning or separate model training, SPI constructs a semantic pyramid over document embeddings and dynamically selects the optimal resolution level per query through a lightweight classifier. This adaptive approach enables progressive retrieval from coarse-to-fine representations, significantly accelerating search while maintaining semantic coverage.
  We implement SPI as a plugin for both FAISS and Qdrant backends and evaluate it across multiple RAG tasks including MS MARCO, Natural Questions, and multimodal retrieval benchmarks. SPI achieves up to \textbf{5.7$\times$} retrieval speedup and \textbf{1.8$\times$} memory efficiency gain while improving end-to-end QA F1 scores by up to \textbf{2.5 points} compared to strong baselines. Our theoretical analysis provides guarantees on retrieval quality and latency bounds, while extensive ablation studies validate the contribution of each component. The framework's compatibility with existing VecDB infrastructures makes it readily deployable in production RAG systems. Code is availabe at \href{https://github.com/FastLM/SPI_VecDB}{https://github.com/FastLM/SPI\_VecDB}.

Motivation: To test and optimize AMD hardware capabilities, cluster networking, and modeling approaches for competitive pretraining of MoE models.

Method: Conducted large-scale benchmarking on AMD MI300X GPUs and Pollara interconnects. Developed MI300X-specific transformer sizing rules and described a detailed training framework.

Conclusion: AMD hardware is mature and competitive for large-scale MoE pretraining with clear guidelines for system design and network optimization.

Abstract: We report on the first large-scale mixture-of-experts (MoE) pretraining study on pure AMD hardware, utilizing both MI300X GPUs with Pollara interconnect. We distill practical guidance for both systems and model design. On the systems side, we deliver a comprehensive cluster and networking characterization: microbenchmarks for all core collectives (all-reduce, reduce-scatter, all-gather, broadcast) across message sizes and GPU counts on Pollara. To our knowledge, this is the first at this scale. We further provide MI300X microbenchmarks on kernel sizing and memory bandwidth to inform model design. On the modeling side, we introduce and apply MI300X-aware transformer sizing rules for attention and MLP blocks and justify MoE widths that jointly optimize training throughput and inference latency. We describe our training stack in depth, including often-ignored utilities such as fault-tolerance and checkpoint-reshaping, as well as detailed information on our training recipe. We also provide a preview of our model architecture and base model - ZAYA1 (760M active, 8.3B total parameters MoE) - which will be further improved upon in forthcoming papers. ZAYA1-base achieves performance comparable to leading base models such as Qwen3-4B and Gemma3-12B at its scale and larger, and outperforms models including Llama-3-8B and OLMoE across reasoning, mathematics, and coding benchmarks. Together, these results demonstrate that the AMD hardware, network, and software stack are mature and optimized enough for competitive large-scale pretraining.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the neglect of low-resource languages like Tunisian Arabic in AI, aiming to ensure accessibility and cultural inclusivity in AI interactions.

Method: The authors create a novel dataset comprising parallel Tunizi, Tunisian Arabic, and English translations with sentiment labels, and benchmark popular LLMs on specific language tasks.

Result: The evaluation showed significant performance differences among LLMs, revealing their strengths and limitations in handling Tunisian dialects.

Conclusion: The study emphasizes the need to support low-resource languages in AI to preserve language diversity and foster more inclusive and culturally relevant technologies.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are the engines driving today's AI agents. The better these models understand human languages, the more natural and user-friendly the interaction with AI becomes, from everyday devices like computers and smartwatches to any tool that can act intelligently. Yet, the ability of industrial-scale LLMs to comprehend low-resource languages, such as Tunisian Arabic (Tunizi), is often overlooked. This neglect risks excluding millions of Tunisians from fully interacting with AI in their own language, pushing them toward French or English. Such a shift not only threatens the preservation of the Tunisian dialect but may also create challenges for literacy and influence younger generations to favor foreign languages. In this study, we introduce a novel dataset containing parallel Tunizi, standard Tunisian Arabic, and English translations, along with sentiment labels. We benchmark several popular LLMs on three tasks: transliteration, translation, and sentiment analysis. Our results reveal significant differences between models, highlighting both their strengths and limitations in understanding and processing Tunisian dialects. By quantifying these gaps, this work underscores the importance of including low-resource languages in the next generation of AI systems, ensuring technology remains accessible, inclusive, and culturally grounded.

### [27] [Ellipsoid-Based Decision Boundaries for Open Intent Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16685)
*Yuetian Zou,Hanlei Zhang,Hua Xu,Songze Li,Long Xiao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes EliDecide, which employs ellipsoid decision boundaries instead of spherical ones for better open intent detection in dialogue systems and outperforms state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for open intent detection assume isotropic class distributions, leading to restrictive spherical decision boundaries that fail to capture direction-specific feature variations.

Method: EliDecide uses supervised contrastive learning to train a discriminative feature space, parameterizes ellipsoid boundaries using learnable matrices, and optimizes them with a dual loss balancing coverage of known samples and exclusion of pseudo-open ones.

Result: EliDecide achieves state-of-the-art results on text intent classification benchmarks and a question classification dataset.

Conclusion: Ellipsoid boundaries provide greater flexibility for open-world scenarios, improving open intent detection capabilities and showcasing potential for complex text classification tasks.

Abstract: Textual open intent classification is crucial for real-world dialogue systems, enabling robust detection of unknown user intents without prior knowledge and contributing to the robustness of the system. While adaptive decision boundary methods have shown great potential by eliminating manual threshold tuning, existing approaches assume isotropic distributions of known classes, restricting boundaries to balls and overlooking distributional variance along different directions. To address this limitation, we propose EliDecide, a novel method that learns ellipsoid decision boundaries with varying scales along different feature directions. First, we employ supervised contrastive learning to obtain a discriminative feature space for known samples. Second, we apply learnable matrices to parameterize ellipsoids as the boundaries of each known class, offering greater flexibility than spherical boundaries defined solely by centers and radii. Third, we optimize the boundaries via a novelly designed dual loss function that balances empirical and open-space risks: expanding boundaries to cover known samples while contracting them against synthesized pseudo-open samples. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple text intent benchmarks and further on a question classification dataset. The flexibility of the ellipsoids demonstrates superior open intent detection capability and strong potential for generalization to more text classification tasks in diverse complex open-world scenarios.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents a method to assess if prompts can steer language models to align with human values without modifying the model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of dynamically aligning language models with changing human values and preferences without requiring fine-tuning.

Method: Developed a scoring method to evaluate and quantify the alignment of generated text with specific human values, applying it to the Wizard-Vicuna model and using Schwartz's theory of basic human values.

Result: Demonstrated that prompts, even without altering the model, can effectively steer generated responses towards target human values.

Conclusion: It is feasible to guide language model outputs toward dynamic human values through carefully designed prompts, avoiding the need for model modifications.

Abstract: Large language models are increasingly used in applications where alignment with human values is critical. While model fine-tuning is often employed to ensure safe responses, this technique is static and does not lend itself to everyday situations involving dynamic values and preferences. In this paper, we present a practical, reproducible, and model-agnostic procedure to evaluate whether a prompt candidate can effectively steer generated text toward specific human values, formalising a scoring method to quantify the presence and gain of target values in generated responses. We apply our method to a variant of the Wizard-Vicuna language model, using Schwartz's theory of basic human values and a structured evaluation through a dialogue dataset. With this setup, we compare a baseline prompt to one explicitly conditioned on values, and show that value steering is possible even without altering the model or dynamically optimising prompts.

### [29] [Concept-Based Interpretability for Toxicity Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16689)
*Samarth Garg,Deeksha Varshney,Divya Singh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper addresses the issue of disproportionate attribution of concepts in toxicity detection, proposing novel interpretability techniques and methods for improving model behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this work lies in improving the detection of toxic language in social networks by exploring concept-based explanations, which is less researched compared to traditional toxicity detection methods.

Method: The authors introduce a Concept Gradient (CG) method for interpretability, propose a Targeted Lexicon Set to capture toxic terms leading to misclassifications, and compute Word-Concept Alignment (WCA) scores to measure the impact of concepts on errors. Additionally, they develop a lexicon-free augmentation strategy to analyze attribution patterns without predefined toxic lexicons.

Result: The study demonstrates how the proposed techniques (CG, WCA scores, and lexicon-free augmentation) enhance the understanding and mitigate over-attribution in toxicity detection models, thereby potentially improving classification performance.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that using concept-based approaches, particularly with tools like CG and lexicon management strategies, can offer a more causal understanding of model behavior and reduce errors in toxic language detection.

Abstract: The rise of social networks has not only facilitated communication but also allowed the spread of harmful content. Although significant advances have been made in detecting toxic language in textual data, the exploration of concept-based explanations in toxicity detection remains limited. In this study, we leverage various subtype attributes present in toxicity detection datasets, such as obscene, threat, insult, identity attack, and sexual explicit as concepts that serve as strong indicators to identify whether language is toxic. However, disproportionate attribution of concepts towards the target class often results in classification errors. Our work introduces an interpretability technique based on the Concept Gradient (CG) method which provides a more causal interpretation by measuring how changes in concepts directly affect the output of the model. This is an extension of traditional gradient-based methods in machine learning, which often focus solely on input features. We propose the curation of Targeted Lexicon Set, which captures toxic words that contribute to misclassifications in text classification models. To assess the significance of these lexicon sets in misclassification, we compute Word-Concept Alignment (WCA) scores, which quantify the extent to which these words lead to errors due to over-attribution to toxic concepts. Finally, we introduce a lexicon-free augmentation strategy by generating toxic samples that exclude predefined toxic lexicon sets. This approach allows us to examine whether over-attribution persists when explicit lexical overlap is removed, providing insights into the model's attribution on broader toxic language patterns.

### [30] [Falsely Accused: How AI Detectors Misjudge Slightly Polished Arabic Articles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16690)
*Saleh Almohaimeed,Saad Almohaimeed,Mousa Jari,Khaled A. Alobaid,Fahad Alotaibi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates the ability of AI detection models in differentiating between AI-generated and slightly AI-polished human-authored articles, focusing on the Arabic language.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need to address the reliability of AI detection models in distinguishing original human-authored articles from AI-assisted polished texts in Arabic, as potential misclassification can harm credibility.

Method: Two datasets were created: (1) 800 Arabic articles, half AI-generated and half human-written, evaluated across 14 models; (2) the Ar-APT dataset, with 16400 samples of human-authored articles slightly AI-polished by different settings, evaluated using 8 selected detectors.

Result: All AI detection models struggled with misclassifications, showing significant performance drops when analyzing slightly polished human-authored texts. "Claude-4 Sonnet" and "originality.AI" had substantial declines in accuracy under different conditions.

Conclusion: AI detection tools are not reliable for distinguishing between human-authored and AI-polished articles in Arabic, indicating a need for improved algorithms to address this issue effectively.

Abstract: Many AI detection models have been developed to counter the presence of articles created by artificial intelligence (AI). However, if a human-authored article is slightly polished by AI, a shift will occur in the borderline decision of these AI detection models, leading them to consider it AI-generated article. This misclassification may result in falsely accusing authors of AI plagiarism and harm the credibility of AI detector models. In English, some efforts were made to meet this challenge, but not in Arabic. In this paper, we generated two datasets. The first dataset contains 800 Arabic articles, half AI-generated and half human-authored. We used it to evaluate 14 Large Language models (LLMs) and commercial AI detectors to assess their ability in distinguishing between human-authored and AI-generated articles. The best 8 models were chosen to act as detectors for our primary concern, which is whether they would consider slightly polished human text as AI-generated. The second dataset, Ar-APT, contains 400 Arabic human-authored articles polished by 10 LLMs using 4 polishing settings, totaling 16400 samples. We use it to evaluate the 8 nominated models and determine whether slight polishing will affect their performance. The results reveal that all AI detectors incorrectly attribute a significant number of articles to AI. The best performing LLM, Claude-4 Sonnet, achieved 83.51%, their performance decreased to 57.63% for articles slightly polished by LLaMA-3. Whereas for the best performing commercial model, originality.AI, that achieves 92% accuracy, dropped to 12% for articles slightly polished by Mistral or Gemma-3.

*Boyang Zhou,Johan Lindqvist,Lindsey Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper confirms the findings of a study proposing test-time fine-tuning for language models using nearest-neighbor retrieval, resulting in significant performance improvements across multiple datasets and systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to explore the potential of test-time adaptation in language models to improve performance across diverse datasets, particularly for smaller or untrained models.

Method: The researchers use pre-trained embeddings indexed with Faiss to retrieve neighbors, applying gradient updates during inference to reduce perplexity and improve metrics in models like GPT-2, GPT-Neo, and Qwen2.5.

Result: Test-time training reduced perplexity and improved performance metrics, especially for structured datasets and smaller models, helping them match larger ones. A memory-efficient retrieval system was also developed.

Conclusion: Nearest-neighbor test-time training is robust and adaptable, providing consistent gains across languages and architectures, and is viable with practical memory optimizations for large-scale setups.

Abstract: We reproduce the central claims of Test-Time Training on Nearest Neighbors for Large Language Models (Hardt and Sun, 2024), which proposes adapting a language model at inference time by fine-tuning on retrieved nearest-neighbor sequences. Using pretrained RoBERTa embeddings indexed with Faiss, we retrieve 20 neighbors per test input and apply one gradient update per neighbor across GPT-2 (117M, 774M), GPT-Neo (1.3B), and R1-Distilled-Qwen2.5-1.5B. Our experiments confirm that test-time training significantly reduces perplexity and bits-per-byte metrics across diverse domains from The Pile, with the largest improvements in structured or specialized datasets such as GitHub and EuroParl. We further validate that models not pretrained on The Pile benefit more from this adaptation than models already trained on similar data, allowing smaller models to approach the performance of larger ones. Due to infrastructure limitations, we introduce a memory-efficient retrieval implementation that loads only required line offsets rather than entire files, reducing RAM requirements from over 128 GB per server to 32 GB. We also extend the original study by evaluating R1-Distilled-Qwen2.5-1.5B, showing that test-time training yields consistent gains even for modern reasoning-optimized architectures. Overall, our results support the robustness and generality of nearest-neighbor test-time training while highlighting practical considerations for reproducing large-scale retrieval-augmented adaptation.

### [32] [How Language Directions Align with Token Geometry in Multilingual LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16693)
*JaeSeong Kim,Suan Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study examines how multilingual language models internally structure and represent language information using six LLMs, highlighting patterns of separation and alignment influenced by training data composition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to understand how language information is structured and emerges across layers in multilingual language models, which has been understudied despite their strong performance in diverse languages.

Method: The authors conducted a comprehensive probing study on six multilingual LLMs, analyzing all 268 transformer layers with linear and nonlinear probes, along with a novel Token--Language Alignment analysis for layer-wise dynamics and geometry.

Result: They found that language information becomes sharply separable in the first transformer block and remains linearly separable throughout depth. Language-vocabulary alignment is influenced by training data, evidenced by higher structural imprinting effects in Chinese-inclusive models compared to English-centric ones.

Conclusion: The study concludes that language distinctions in multilingual LLMs arise not from surface-level features but from latent representational structures shaped by the training corpus, offering insights for better data-driven strategies and fairness in multilingual learning.

Abstract: Multilingual LLMs demonstrate strong performance across diverse languages, yet there has been limited systematic analysis of how language information is structured within their internal representation space and how it emerges across layers. We conduct a comprehensive probing study on six multilingual LLMs, covering all 268 transformer layers, using linear and nonlinear probes together with a new Token--Language Alignment analysis to quantify the layer-wise dynamics and geometric structure of language encoding. Our results show that language information becomes sharply separated in the first transformer block (+76.4$\pm$8.2 percentage points from Layer 0 to 1) and remains almost fully linearly separable throughout model depth. We further find that the alignment between language directions and vocabulary embeddings is strongly tied to the language composition of the training data. Notably, Chinese-inclusive models achieve a ZH Match@Peak of 16.43\%, whereas English-centric models achieve only 3.90\%, revealing a 4.21$\times$ structural imprinting effect. These findings indicate that multilingual LLMs distinguish languages not by surface script features but by latent representational structures shaped by the training corpus. Our analysis provides practical insights for data composition strategies and fairness in multilingual representation learning.

*Jonathon Dilworth,Hui Yang,Jiaoyan Chen,Yongsheng Gao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses knowledge retrieval challenges in SNOMED CT due to out-of-vocabulary (OOV) queries, proposing a language model-based ontology embedding method for hierarchical concept retrieval and outperforming baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Knowledge retrieval in SNOMED CT faces challenges such as language ambiguity and OOV queries, requiring effective solutions to improve applicability.

Method: The authors use language model-based ontology embeddings to retrieve hierarchical concepts with OOV queries and evaluate their method against annotated datasets and baselines.

Result: The proposed method showed improved performance compared to SBERT and lexical matching methods for retrieving both direct subsumers and less relevant ancestors.

Conclusion: The method enhances OOV query retrieval in SNOMED CT and is generalizable to other ontologies, with supporting resources provided for further use.

Abstract: SNOMED CT is a biomedical ontology with a hierarchical representation of large-scale concepts. Knowledge retrieval in SNOMED CT is critical for its application, but often proves challenging due to language ambiguity, synonyms, polysemies and so on. This problem is exacerbated when the queries are out-of-vocabulary (OOV), i.e., having no equivalent matchings in the ontology. In this work, we focus on the problem of hierarchical concept retrieval from SNOMED CT with OOV queries, and propose an approach based on language model-based ontology embeddings. For evaluation, we construct OOV queries annotated against SNOMED CT concepts, testing the retrieval of the most direct subsumers and their less relevant ancestors. We find that our method outperforms the baselines including SBERT and two lexical matching methods. While evaluated against SNOMED CT, the approach is generalisable and can be extended to other ontologies. We release code, tools, and evaluation datasets at https://github.com/jonathondilworth/HR-OOV.

### [34] [Detecting and Steering LLMs' Empathy in Action](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16699)
*Juan P. Cadile*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper examines the presence and control of empathy-related behavior in large language models (LLMs) through analysis in activation space. It demonstrates that empathy traits can be detected and steered with variations across different models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how large language models encode and demonstrate empathy-related behaviors and whether these tendencies can be controlled or influenced, irrespective of safety training.

Method: The study uses the Empathy-in-Action (EIA) benchmark to evaluate empathy in task responses. It explores detection through activation probes in model layers and steering by introducing directional interventions in LLM activation space. It tests three models: Phi-3-mini-4k, Qwen2.5-7B, Dolphin-Llama-3.1-8B.

Result: All models show high empathy detection accuracy (AUROC 0.996-1.00). However, steering success varies: Qwen and Phi-3 allow bidirectional control with coherence, while Dolphin demonstrates pro-empathy dominance but fails under anti-empathy steering.

Conclusion: Empathy encoding in LLMs emerges regardless of safety training, but the robustness of controlled steering varies by model, suggesting architecture-specific capabilities. Future work is required for validation across more diverse models.

Abstract: We investigate empathy-in-action -- the willingness to sacrifice task efficiency to address human needs -- as a linear direction in LLM activation space. Using contrastive prompts grounded in the Empathy-in-Action (EIA) benchmark, we test detection and steering across Phi-3-mini-4k (3.8B), Qwen2.5-7B (safety-trained), and Dolphin-Llama-3.1-8B (uncensored).
  Detection: All models show AUROC 0.996-1.00 at optimal layers. Uncensored Dolphin matches safety-trained models, demonstrating empathy encoding emerges independent of safety training. Phi-3 probes correlate strongly with EIA behavioral scores (r=0.71, p<0.01). Cross-model probe agreement is limited (Qwen: r=-0.06, Dolphin: r=0.18), revealing architecture-specific implementations despite convergent detection.
  Steering: Qwen achieves 65.3% success with bidirectional control and coherence at extreme interventions. Phi-3 shows 61.7% success with similar coherence. Dolphin exhibits asymmetric steerability: 94.4% success for pro-empathy steering but catastrophic breakdown for anti-empathy (empty outputs, code artifacts).
  Implications: The detection-steering gap varies by model. Qwen and Phi-3 maintain bidirectional coherence; Dolphin shows robustness only for empathy enhancement. Safety training may affect steering robustness rather than preventing manipulation, though validation across more models is needed.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper discusses JGU Mainz's winning system for the BLP-2025 Shared Task on Bangla-to-code generation. It introduces a multi-agent pipeline combining code generation and debugging, attaining a $Pass@1$ score of 95.4.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve code generation from Bangla instructions by addressing challenges like debugging and program accuracy, aiming to achieve higher performance in this shared task.

Method: The method employs a multi-agent approach: a code-generation agent creates a program from instructions, executes unit tests to identify failing cases, and a debugger agent revises the solution based on error traces, test case results, and current program errors.

Result: The system achieved first place in the BLP-2025 Shared Task, obtaining a $Pass@1$ score of 95.4. Additionally, the authors made their code publicly available.

Conclusion: The combination of code generation and debugging agents proves highly effective for Bangla instruction-based code generation, setting a benchmark with excellent task performance.

Abstract: This paper presents JGU Mainz's winning system for the BLP-2025 Shared Task on Code Generation from Bangla Instructions. We propose a multi-agent-based pipeline. First, a code-generation agent produces an initial solution from the input instruction. The candidate program is then executed against the provided unit tests (pytest-style, assert-based). Only the failing cases are forwarded to a debugger agent, which reruns the tests, extracts error traces, and, conditioning on the error messages, the current program, and the relevant test cases, generates a revised solution. Using this approach, our submission achieved first place in the shared task with a $Pass@1$ score of 95.4. We also make our code public.

*Michael Carl,Takanori Mizowaki,Aishvarya Raj,Masaru Yamada,Devi Sri Bandaru,Yuxiang Wei,Xinyue Ren*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes an alternative framework to traditional representation-based models of mind, introducing the ABC framework which reframes translation as an embodied and dynamic activity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to challenge the dominant representation-based models of the mind and advocate for a dynamic, non-representational understanding of translation.

Method: It introduces the ABC framework, integrating Predictive Processing and (En)Active Inference, focusing on affective, behavioral, and cognitive processes involved in translation.

Result: Translation is conceptualized as an enacted activity where meaning is co-created in real time through dynamic brain-body-environment interactions.

Conclusion: Translation is reframed as a sociocultural practice involving embodied skillful participation, rather than static manipulation of interlingual correspondences in the mind.

Abstract: Building on the Extended Mind (EM) theory and radical enactivism, this article suggests an alternative to representation-based models of the mind. We lay out a novel ABC framework of the translating mind, in which translation is not the manipulation of static interlingual correspondences but an enacted activity, dynamically integrating affective, behavioral, and cognitive (ABC) processes. Drawing on Predictive Processing and (En)Active Inference, we argue that the translator's mind emerges, rather than being merely extended, through loops of brain-body-environment interactions. This non-representational account reframes translation as skillful participation in sociocultural practice, where meaning is co-created in real time through embodied interaction with texts, tools, and contexts.

*Eva Neu,Brian Dillon,Katrin Erk*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper revisits the syntactic classes of intransitive verbs (unergatives and unaccusatives) using interpretable dimensions, challenging recent findings that human ratings poorly predict their behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Verbs' syntactic behavior and their link to agentive and telic properties had been questioned by previous research, motivating a re-evaluation through more objective metrics.

Method: The study uses interpretable dimensions computed from seed words to assess the semantic properties tied to agentive and telic scales, combining them with human judgments.

Result: The findings reaffirm the link between unergative/unaccusative syntax and agentivity/telicity, highlighting the value of interpretable dimensions for semantic evaluation.

Conclusion: Combining interpretable dimensions with human judgments provides valuable insights into semantic properties that evade traditional rating-based approaches.

Abstract: Intransitive verbs fall into two different syntactic classes, unergatives and unaccusatives. It has long been argued that verbs describing an agentive action are more likely to appear in an unergative syntax, and those describing a telic event to appear in an unaccusative syntax. However, recent work by Kim et al. (2024) found that human ratings for agentivity and telicity were a poor predictor of the syntactic behavior of intransitives. Here we revisit this question using interpretable dimensions, computed from seed words on opposite poles of the agentive and telic scales. Our findings support the link between unergativity/unaccusativity and agentivity/telicity, and demonstrate that using interpretable dimensions in conjunction with human judgments can offer valuable evidence for semantic properties that are not easily evaluated in rating tasks.

*Oscar Chew,Po-Yi Lu,Jayden Lin,Kuan-Hao Huang,Hsuan-Tien Lin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a defense strategy named PEPPER to counter backdoor attacks in text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models by rewriting captions to retain visual similarity while mitigating triggers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the vulnerability of T2I diffusion models to backdoor attacks, where malicious prompts can manipulate generated outputs.

Method: PEPPER rewrites the input captions into semantically distant yet visually similar captions and adds subtle perturbations to dilute embedded triggers in the input.

Result: PEPPER demonstrates effectiveness in significantly reducing the success rate of backdoor attacks while maintaining the quality of generation, especially against text encoder-based attacks.

Conclusion: PEPPER offers a robust and flexible defense against backdoor attacks in T2I diffusion models, complementing existing defense methods and ensuring enhanced robustness. The approach shows potential for wide application, and open-source code will be available.

Abstract: Recent studies show that text to image (T2I) diffusion models are vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where a trigger in the input prompt can steer generation toward harmful or unintended content. To address this, we introduce PEPPER (PErcePtion Guided PERturbation), a backdoor defense that rewrites the caption into a semantically distant yet visually similar caption while adding unobstructive elements. With this rewriting strategy, PEPPER disrupt the trigger embedded in the input prompt, dilute the influence of trigger tokens and thereby achieve enhanced robustness. Experiments show that PEPPER is particularly effective against text encoder based attacks, substantially reducing attack success while preserving generation quality. Beyond this, PEPPER can be paired with any existing defenses yielding consistently stronger and generalizable robustness than any standalone method. Our code will be released on Github.

*Seyed Mohssen Ghafari,Ronny Kol,Juan C. Quiroz,Nella Luan,Monika Patial,Chanaka Rupasinghe,Herman Wandabwa,Luiz Pizzato*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes a reference-free metric to evaluate conciseness in language model responses, quantifying redundancy without relying on human annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often generate lengthy, verbose responses with redundant information, reducing clarity, user satisfaction, and increasing operational costs.

Method: The paper introduces a metric combining three calculations: abstractive compression ratio, extractive compression ratio, and word-removal compression, all utilizing LLMs to assess conciseness without gold standard references.

Result: The metric effectively identifies redundancy in LLM outputs, offering a practical tool for assessing response brevity in conversational AI.

Conclusion: This reference-free metric enables efficient evaluation of conciseness in LLM-generated outputs, benefiting developers and improving conversational AI systems.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) frequently generate responses that are lengthy and verbose, filled with redundant or unnecessary details. This diminishes clarity and user satisfaction, and it increases costs for model developers, especially with well-known proprietary models that charge based on the number of output tokens. In this paper, we introduce a novel reference-free metric for evaluating the conciseness of responses generated by LLMs. Our method quantifies non-essential content without relying on gold standard references and calculates the average of three calculations: i) a compression ratio between the original response and an LLM abstractive summary; ii) a compression ratio between the original response and an LLM extractive summary; and iii) wordremoval compression, where an LLM removes as many non-essential words as possible from the response while preserving its meaning, with the number of tokens removed indicating the conciseness score. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed metric identifies redundancy in LLM outputs, offering a practical tool for automated evaluation of response brevity in conversational AI systems without the need for ground truth human annotations.

*Kang Wang,Xiangyu Duan,Tianyi Du*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a training scheme called Soft Concept Mixing (SCM) to enhance the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) by incorporating soft concepts during training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs traditionally reason using discrete tokens, which may restrict their potential for expressing abstract concepts. The study explores the gap between the training of LLMs with discrete tokens and their latent reasoning based on soft concepts.

Method: SCM is a training approach where a soft concept vector is constructed through a probability-weighted average of embeddings. This vector is integrated into the model’s hidden states, and the overall reasoning process is optimized via reinforcement learning.

Result: SCM outperforms baseline methods on five reasoning benchmarks and ensures stable training dynamics for the LLMs.

Conclusion: The study provides evidence that exposing LLMs to soft concept representations during training improves their reasoning ability while maintaining training stability.

Abstract: Unlike human reasoning in abstract conceptual spaces, large language models (LLMs) typically reason by generating discrete tokens, which potentially limit their expressive power. The recent work Soft Thinking has shown that LLMs' latent reasoning via soft concepts is a promising direction, but LLMs are trained on discrete tokens. To reduce this gap between the soft concepts in reasoning and the discrete tokens in training, we propose Soft Concept Mixing (SCM), a soft concept aware training scheme that directly exposes the model to soft representations during training. Specifically, SCM constructs a soft concept vector by forming a probability-weighted average of embeddings. Then, this vector is mixed into the model's hidden states, which embody rich contextual information. Finally, the entire latent reasoning process is optimized with Reinforcement Learning (RL). Experiments on five reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that SCM improves the reasoning performance of LLMs, and simultaneously maintains a stable training dynamic.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to improve the efficiency and performance of Tiny Recursive Models (TRMs) on reasoning tasks with minimal structural changes.

Method: The authors frame TRMs' reasoning as classifier-free guidance and implicit policy improvement, proposing a novel training scheme that provides loop targets, reduces forward passes, and eliminates halting mechanisms.

Result: Their method cuts forward passes by 18x and achieves 24% accuracy on ARC-1 using just 0.8M parameters, outperforming most Large Language Models (LLMs).

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates that enhanced training efficiency for TRMs can maintain quality levels while achieving significant reductions in computational requirements and bypassing larger models in accuracy.

Abstract: Recently, it was shown that small, looped architectures, such as Tiny Recursive Models (TRMs), can outperform Large Language Models (LLMs) on complex reasoning tasks, including the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC). In this work, we investigate a core question: how can we further improve the efficiency of these methods with minimal changes? To address this, we frame the latent reasoning of TRMs as a form of classifier-free guidance and implicit policy improvement algorithm. Building on these insights, we propose a novel training scheme that provides a target for each loop during training. We demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances training efficiency. Our method reduces the total number of forward passes by 18x and eliminates halting mechanisms, while maintaining quality comparable to standard TRMs. Notably, we achieve 24% accuracy on ARC-1 with only 0.8M parameters, outperforming most LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study examines the formation of induction heads (IHs) in language models (LMs) and their association with statistical properties of training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the development of induction heads in language models and their link to data characteristics for improving in-context learning capabilities.

Method: This research explores relationships between IH formation and training data properties using defined statistical metrics (batch size, context size, bigram frequency/reliability) and identifies key factors influencing IH development.

Result: It identifies predictors for IH formation, highlights the importance of bigram frequency and reliability, and reveals a Pareto frontier for IH development influenced by data properties.

Conclusion: Local dependency and appropriate training data statistical patterns (e.g., bigram repetition frequency, reliability) are critical for IH formation; low-quality patterns require additional considerations.

Abstract: Arguably, specialized attention heads dubbed induction heads (IHs) underlie the remarkable in-context learning (ICL) capabilities of modern language models (LMs); yet, a precise characterization of their formation remains unclear. In this study, we investigate the relationship between statistical properties of training data (for both natural and synthetic data) and IH formation. We show that (1) a simple equation combining batch size and context size predicts the point at which IHs form; (2) surface bigram repetition frequency and reliability strongly affect the formation of IHs, and we find a precise Pareto frontier in terms of these two values; and (3) local dependency with high bigram repetition frequency and reliability is sufficient for IH formation, but when the frequency and reliability are low, categoriality and the shape of the marginal distribution matter.

*An Quang Tang,Xiuzhen Zhang,Minh Ngoc Dinh,Zhuang Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces ARQUSUMM, a framework for argument-aware quantitative summarization of online conversations. It focuses on capturing claim-reason structures with quantification of argument strength, outperforming previous models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current summarization models fail to address the deeper argument structure and quantifiable aspects of online conversations, despite the growing necessity due to complex controversial topics.

Method: ARQUSUMM uses few-shot learning with LLMs grounded in argumentation theory to identify claim-reason relationships in sentences. It employs clustering algorithms to aggregate and quantify arguments in summaries.

Result: ARQUSUMM generates summaries with improved representation of argument structures, better textual quality, and higher quantification accuracy than existing models.

Conclusion: The proposed framework advances summarization methodologies by focusing on argument-aware and quantitative aspects, aiding user comprehension and decision-making in online conversations.

Abstract: Online conversations have become more prevalent on public discussion platforms (e.g. Reddit). With growing controversial topics, it is desirable to summarize not only diverse arguments, but also their rationale and justification. Early studies on text summarization focus on capturing general salient information in source documents, overlooking the argumentative nature of online conversations. Recent research on conversation summarization although considers the argumentative relationship among sentences, fail to explicate deeper argument structure within sentences for summarization. In this paper, we propose a novel task of argument-aware quantitative summarization to reveal the claim-reason structure of arguments in conversations, with quantities measuring argument strength. We further propose ARQUSUMM, a novel framework to address the task. To reveal the underlying argument structure within sentences, ARQUSUMM leverages LLM few-shot learning grounded in the argumentation theory to identify propositions within sentences and their claim-reason relationships. For quantitative summarization, ARQUSUMM employs argument structure-aware clustering algorithms to aggregate arguments and quantify their support. Experiments show that ARQUSUMM outperforms existing conversation and quantitative summarization models and generate summaries representing argument structures that are more helpful to users, of high textual quality and quantification accuracy.

### [44] [Supervised Fine Tuning of Large Language Models for Domain Specific Knowledge Graph Construction:A Case Study on Hunan's Historical Celebrities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17012)
*Junjie Hao,Chun Wang,Ying Qiao,Qiuyue Zuo,Qiya Song,Hua Ma,Xieping Gao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores enhancing large language models for extracting and structuring historical cultural information, specifically focusing on Hunan's modern historical celebrities influenced by Huxiang culture. Supervised fine-tuning methodologies significantly improved the models' domain-specific extraction performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study is motivated by the potential of large language models and knowledge graphs to transform historical cultural research, but existing models struggle in low-resource specific domains like Hunan's historical figures.

Method: A supervised fine-tuning approach was used to improve large language models, including tailored instruction templates and parameter-efficient instruction fine-tuning for four models. Evaluation metrics were also developed.

Result: Performance of all models improved significantly after fine-tuning, with Qwen3-8B achieving the best score (89.3866) using 100 samples and 50 iterations.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of domain-specific fine-tuning of large language models for cultural heritage tasks, aiding cost-effective knowledge extraction and graph construction in specialized domains.

Abstract: Large language models and knowledge graphs offer strong potential for advancing research on historical culture by supporting the extraction, analysis, and interpretation of cultural heritage. Using Hunan's modern historical celebrities shaped by Huxiang culture as a case study, pre-trained large models can help researchers efficiently extract key information, including biographical attributes, life events, and social relationships, from textual sources and construct structured knowledge graphs. However, systematic data resources for Hunan's historical celebrities remain limited, and general-purpose models often underperform in domain knowledge extraction and structured output generation in such low-resource settings. To address these issues, this study proposes a supervised fine-tuning approach for enhancing domain-specific information extraction. First, we design a fine-grained, schema-guided instruction template tailored to the Hunan historical celebrities domain and build an instruction-tuning dataset to mitigate the lack of domain-specific training corpora. Second, we apply parameter-efficient instruction fine-tuning to four publicly available large language models - Qwen2.5-7B, Qwen3-8B, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B, and Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct - and develop evaluation criteria for assessing their extraction performance. Experimental results show that all models exhibit substantial performance gains after fine-tuning. Among them, Qwen3-8B achieves the strongest results, reaching a score of 89.3866 with 100 samples and 50 training iterations. This study provides new insights into fine-tuning vertical large language models for regional historical and cultural domains and highlights their potential for cost-effective applications in cultural heritage knowledge extraction and knowledge graph construction.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates vision-language models' (VLMs) ability to grasp visual persuasion, analyzing their limitations and proposing strategies to improve reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if vision-language models truly understand how visual cues influence human attitudes and decisions.

Method: A high-consensus dataset for binary persuasiveness judgment is created, combined with a taxonomy of Visual Persuasive Factors (VPFs). Cognitive steering and knowledge injection methods are also tested.

Result: VLMs exhibit recall bias, weak feature discrimination at lower levels, and strong reliance on high-level semantic alignment. Object-grounded rationales improve model performance.

Conclusion: VLMs struggle to link persuasive objects with communicative intent, requiring refined intervention strategies for improved persuasiveness reasoning.

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have enabled impressive multi-modal reasoning and understanding. Yet, whether these models truly grasp visual persuasion-how visual cues shape human attitudes and decisions-remains unclear. To probe this question, we construct a high-consensus dataset for binary persuasiveness judgment and introduce the taxonomy of Visual Persuasive Factors (VPFs), encompassing low-level perceptual, mid-level compositional, and high-level semantic cues. We also explore cognitive steering and knowledge injection strategies for persuasion-relevant reasoning. Empirical analysis across VLMs reveals a recall-oriented bias-models over-predict high persuasiveness-and weak discriminative power for low/mid-level features. In contrast, high-level semantic alignment between message and object presence emerges as the strongest predictor of human judgment. Among intervention strategies, simple instruction or unguided reasoning scaffolds yield marginal or negative effects, whereas concise, object-grounded rationales significantly improve precision and F1 scores. These results indicate that VLMs core limitation lies not in recognizing persuasive objects but in linking them to communicative intent.

*Yunsung Kim,Mike Hardy,Joseph Tey,Candace Thille,Chris Piech*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper presents AnalyticScore, an interpretable AI-driven automated scoring framework for student responses using principles of Faithfulness, Groundedness, Traceability, and Interchangeability (FGTI).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the lack of transparency and interpretability in automated scoring systems used for real-world assessments.

Method: The proposed method involves extracting identifiable elements from answers, featurizing them via interpretable values using LLMs, and applying an ordinal logistic regression model for scoring.

Result: AnalyticScore achieves comparable accuracy to state-of-the-art methods while aligning with human annotation behaviors, demonstrating the feasibility of interpretable scoring.

Conclusion: AnalyticScore offers a scalable and interpretable solution for scoring student responses, emphasizing its alignment with human assessment and potential for broader adoption.

Abstract: AI-driven automated scoring systems offer scalable and efficient means of evaluating complex student-generated responses. Yet, despite increasing demand for transparency and interpretability, the field has yet to develop a widely accepted solution for interpretable automated scoring to be used in large-scale real-world assessments. This work takes a principled approach to address this challenge. We analyze the needs and potential benefits of interpretable automated scoring for various assessment stakeholders and develop four principles of interpretability -- Faithfulness, Groundedness, Traceability, and Interchangeability (FGTI) -- targeted at those needs. To illustrate the feasibility of implementing these principles, we develop the AnalyticScore framework for short answer scoring as a baseline reference framework for future research. AnalyticScore operates by (1) extracting explicitly identifiable elements of the responses, (2) featurizing each response into human-interpretable values using LLMs, and (3) applying an intuitive ordinal logistic regression model for scoring. In terms of scoring accuracy, AnalyticScore outperforms many uninterpretable scoring methods, and is within only 0.06 QWK of the uninterpretable SOTA on average across 10 items from the ASAP-SAS dataset. By comparing against human annotators conducting the same featurization task, we further demonstrate that the featurization behavior of AnalyticScore aligns well with that of humans.

### [47] [MUCH: A Multilingual Claim Hallucination Benchmark](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17081)
*Jérémie Dentan,Alexi Canesse,Davide Buscaldi,Aymen Shabou,Sonia Vanier*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents MUCH, a benchmark for claim-level uncertainty quantification (UQ) for Large Language Models (LLMs), offering innovations in segmentation, efficiency, and evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The work aims to address reliability issues in LLMs by introducing a benchmark for claim-level UQ that is fair, reproducible, and deployable in real-world conditions.

Method: MUCH was developed with multilingual data across four languages and four LLMs. It incorporates token-level logits to assist white-box methods, features a deterministic algorithm for fast claim segmentation, and is tailored for real-time operation.

Result: MUCH facilitates assessment under realistic constraints, revealing weaknesses in current UQ methods regarding performance and efficiency.

Conclusion: The study emphasizes the need for improved UQ techniques and provides a foundational benchmark for future developments in this area.

Abstract: Claim-level Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) is a promising approach to mitigate the lack of reliability in Large Language Models (LLMs). We introduce MUCH, the first claim-level UQ benchmark designed for fair and reproducible evaluation of future methods under realistic conditions. It includes 4,873 samples across four European languages (English, French, Spanish, and German) and four instruction-tuned open-weight LLMs. Unlike prior claim-level benchmarks, we release 24 generation logits per token, facilitating the development of future white-box methods without re-generating data. Moreover, in contrast to previous benchmarks that rely on manual or LLM-based segmentation, we propose a new deterministic algorithm capable of segmenting claims using as little as 0.2% of the LLM generation time. This makes our segmentation approach suitable for real-time monitoring of LLM outputs, ensuring that MUCH evaluates UQ methods under realistic deployment constraints. Finally, our evaluations show that current methods still have substantial room for improvement in both performance and efficiency.

*Yeqin Zhang,Yizheng Zhao,Chen Hu,Binxing Jiao,Daxin Jiang,Ruihang Miao,Cam-Tu Nguyen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces LLM2Comp, a method leveraging context compression and contrastive learning to adapt large language models for superior text representation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most large language models are optimized for causal tasks, limiting their effectiveness for holistic text representation in clustering, retrieval, and other downstream tasks.

Method: The study uses context compression as a pretext task during unsupervised adaptation of LLMs, allowing compact memory tokens to replace entire contexts, and enhances this approach with contrastive learning.

Result: LLM2Comp achieves better text representations than models trained on token-level pretext tasks, with improved sample efficiency and performance across diverse tasks.

Conclusion: Context compression is shown to be a powerful pretext task, advancing LLM-based text encoders and achieving strong results with less training data.

Abstract: Text representation plays a critical role in tasks like clustering, retrieval, and other downstream applications. With the emergence of large language models (LLMs), there is increasing interest in harnessing their capabilities for this purpose. However, most of the LLMs are inherently causal and optimized for next-token prediction, making them suboptimal for producing holistic representations. To address this, recent studies introduced pretext tasks to adapt LLMs for text representation. Most of these tasks, however, rely on token-level prediction objectives, such as the masked next-token prediction (MNTP) used in LLM2Vec. In this work, we explore the untapped potential of context compression as a pretext task for unsupervised adaptation of LLMs. During compression pre-training, the model learns to generate compact memory tokens, which substitute the whole context for downstream sequence prediction. Experiments demonstrate that a well-designed compression objective can significantly enhance LLM-based text representations, outperforming models trained with token-level pretext tasks. Further improvements through contrastive learning produce a strong representation model (LLM2Comp) that outperforms contemporary LLM-based text encoders on a wide range of tasks while being more sample-efficient, requiring significantly less training data.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces LangMark, a large multilingual dataset for Automatic Post-Editing (APE), and demonstrates how Large Language Models (LLMs) can improve translation quality using this dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a lack of large multilingual datasets specifically designed for training APE systems, which hinders advancements despite progress in neural machine translation (NMT).

Method: The authors developed LangMark, a human-annotated dataset with 206,983 triplets comprising source text, machine-translated output, and human-corrected translations. They also tested the effectiveness of LLMs for APE using few-shot prompting.

Result: Using LangMark, the study demonstrates that LLMs can significantly enhance error correction in translations, outperforming existing machine translation systems.

Conclusion: LangMark is an invaluable resource to advance APE systems by combining scale and linguistic diversity, supporting future research and evaluation.

Abstract: Automatic post-editing (APE) aims to correct errors in machine-translated text, enhancing translation quality, while reducing the need for human intervention. Despite advances in neural machine translation (NMT), the development of effective APE systems has been hindered by the lack of large-scale multilingual datasets specifically tailored to NMT outputs. To address this gap, we present and release LangMark, a new human-annotated multilingual APE dataset for English translation to seven languages: Brazilian Portuguese, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Russian, and Spanish. The dataset has 206,983 triplets, with each triplet consisting of a source segment, its NMT output, and a human post-edited translation. Annotated by expert human linguists, our dataset offers both linguistic diversity and scale. Leveraging this dataset, we empirically show that Large Language Models (LLMs) with few-shot prompting can effectively perform APE, improving upon leading commercial and even proprietary machine translation systems. We believe that this new resource will facilitate the future development and evaluation of APE systems.

*Vy Nguyen,Ziqi Xu,Jeffrey Chan,Estrid He,Feng Xia,Xiuzhen Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces ABCA, a framework for early abstention in LLMs using causal inference to evaluate knowledge reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often generate factually incorrect responses, and existing abstention methods fail to prevent these errors preemptively.

Method: ABCA uses causal inference on internal diversity of knowledge aspects to assess reliability and enable pre-answer abstentions: Type-1 for conflicts and Type-2 for insufficiencies.

Result: Experiments demonstrate ABCA’s improved abstention reliability, state-of-the-art performance, and better interpretability.

Conclusion: ABCA presents a significant step in enhancing LLM reliability and safeguards by enabling early, interpretable abstention decisions.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often produce fluent but factually incorrect responses, a phenomenon known as hallucination. Abstention, where the model chooses not to answer and instead outputs phrases such as "I don't know", is a common safeguard. However, existing abstention methods typically rely on post-generation signals, such as generation variations or feedback, which limits their ability to prevent unreliable responses in advance. In this paper, we introduce Aspect-Based Causal Abstention (ABCA), a new framework that enables early abstention by analysing the internal diversity of LLM knowledge through causal inference. This diversity reflects the multifaceted nature of parametric knowledge acquired from various sources, representing diverse aspects such as disciplines, legal contexts, or temporal frames. ABCA estimates causal effects conditioned on these aspects to assess the reliability of knowledge relevant to a given query. Based on these estimates, we enable two types of abstention: Type-1, where aspect effects are inconsistent (knowledge conflict), and Type-2, where aspect effects consistently support abstention (knowledge insufficiency). Experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that ABCA improves abstention reliability, achieves state-of-the-art performance, and enhances the interpretability of abstention decisions.

TL;DR: The paper presents an Attention-Guided Feature Fusion (AGFF) model combining statistical and semantic features for news text classification, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitations of traditional statistical approaches and modern deep learning models by combining these methods for enhanced context understanding and classification accuracy.

Method: Developed the AGFF model with an attention-based mechanism to dynamically combine and weigh statistical and semantic features.

Result: The AGFF model showed superior performance on benchmark datasets, outperforming traditional and semantic-only models. Ablation studies confirmed the significance of each component.

Conclusion: Integrating statistical and semantic features complements each other, improving accuracy in news classification, making it effective for practical applications.

Abstract: News text classification is a crucial task in natural language processing, essential for organizing and filtering the massive volume of digital content. Traditional methods typically rely on statistical features like term frequencies or TF-IDF values, which are effective at capturing word-level importance but often fail to reflect contextual meaning. In contrast, modern deep learning approaches utilize semantic features to understand word usage within context, yet they may overlook simple, high-impact statistical indicators. This paper introduces an Attention-Guided Feature Fusion (AGFF) model that combines statistical and semantic features in a unified framework. The model applies an attention-based mechanism to dynamically determine the relative importance of each feature type, enabling more informed classification decisions. Through evaluation on benchmark news datasets, the AGFF model demonstrates superior performance compared to both traditional statistical models and purely semantic deep learning models. The results confirm that strategic integration of diverse feature types can significantly enhance classification accuracy. Additionally, ablation studies validate the contribution of each component in the fusion process. The findings highlight the model's ability to balance and exploit the complementary strengths of statistical and semantic representations, making it a practical and effective solution for real-world news classification tasks.

*Ziyang Wang,Yuanlei Zheng,Zhenbiao Cao,Xiaojin Zhang,Zhongyu Wei,Pei Fu,Zhenbo Luo,Wei Chen,Xiang Bai*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AutoLink is a scalable and efficient schema-linking solution for text-to-SQL systems, achieving high recall and execution accuracy on large databases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The current schema linking methods for industrial-scale text-to-SQL struggle with recall, noise trade-offs, cost-efficiency, and scalability, especially when applied to large database schemas.

Method: AutoLink uses an autonomous agent framework where a large language model (LLM) incrementally links schema components without requiring the entire database schema as input, optimizing the process iteratively.

Result: AutoLink achieves state-of-the-art schema linking recall (97.4% on Bird-Dev; 91.2% on Spider-2.0-Lite) and competitive execution accuracy (68.7% EX on Bird-Dev; 34.9% EX on Spider-2.0-Lite, 2nd on leaderboard). It performs robustly on large database schemas with over 3,000 columns.

Conclusion: AutoLink is an effective, scalable, high-recall solution for schema linking in text-to-SQL tasks, addressing previous limitations and enabling its application to large-scale industrial systems.

Abstract: For industrial-scale text-to-SQL, supplying the entire database schema to Large Language Models (LLMs) is impractical due to context window limits and irrelevant noise. Schema linking, which filters the schema to a relevant subset, is therefore critical. However, existing methods incur prohibitive costs, struggle to trade off recall and noise, and scale poorly to large databases. We present \textbf{AutoLink}, an autonomous agent framework that reformulates schema linking as an iterative, agent-driven process. Guided by an LLM, AutoLink dynamically explores and expands the linked schema subset, progressively identifying necessary schema components without inputting the full database schema. Our experiments demonstrate AutoLink's superior performance, achieving state-of-the-art strict schema linking recall of \textbf{97.4\%} on Bird-Dev and \textbf{91.2\%} on Spider-2.0-Lite, with competitive execution accuracy, i.e., \textbf{68.7\%} EX on Bird-Dev (better than CHESS) and \textbf{34.9\%} EX on Spider-2.0-Lite (ranking 2nd on the official leaderboard). Crucially, AutoLink exhibits \textbf{exceptional scalability}, \textbf{maintaining high recall}, \textbf{efficient token consumption}, and \textbf{robust execution accuracy} on large schemas (e.g., over 3,000 columns) where existing methods severely degrade-making it a highly scalable, high-recall schema-linking solution for industrial text-to-SQL systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses limitations in layer pruning by introducing a novel method, \namespace, which improves performance, reduces costs, and speeds up inference while maintaining high accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Layer pruning has gained attention as a hardware-friendly solution for compressing large language models, but current methods face challenges like performance drops, high training costs, and insufficient acceleration.

Method: The paper proposes \namespace, incorporating (1) differentiable mask optimization with a Gumbel-TopK sampler for precise pruning, and (2) entropy-aware adaptive knowledge distillation to improve task performance.

Result: \namespace achieves notable improvements, including 96% accuracy with only a 0.8% drop compared to the original model on MATH-500, surpassing existing methods, and achieving 1.33x inference speedup using only 0.5B tokens.

Conclusion: The framework effectively balances task performance, training economy, and inference efficiency, demonstrating significant advantages in large language model compression compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: With the increasing size of large language models, layer pruning has gained increased attention as a hardware-friendly approach for model compression. However, existing layer pruning methods struggle to simultaneously address key practical deployment challenges, including performance degradation, high training costs, and limited acceleration. To overcome these limitations, we propose \name, a task-\underline{E}ffective, training-\underline{E}conomical and inference-\underline{E}fficient layer pruning framework. \namespace introduces two key innovations: (1) a differentiable mask optimization method using a Gumbel-TopK sampler, enabling efficient and precise pruning mask search; and (2) an entropy-aware adaptive knowledge distillation strategy that enhances task performance. Extensive experiments over diverse model architectures and benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art approaches. Notably, \namespace achieves 96\% accuracy, a mere 0.8\% drop from the original model (96.8\%) on MATH-500 when pruning 25\% layers of Qwen3-32B, outperforming existing SOTA (95\%), with a 1.33$\times$ inference speedup by consuming merely 0.5B tokens (0.5\% of the post-training data volume).

*Sizhe Zhou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents an event-centric memory model for LLM-based conversational agents to improve long-term coherence, surpassing baselines with structured, non-compressive representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing conversational agents fail to maintain coherent, personalized conversation history due to limited memory context and trade-offs between coarse and fine-grained memory representations.

Method: The approach models conversational history using event-like propositions (EDUs), organizes them into a heterogeneous graph, and retrieves relevant information through dense similarity search, LLM filtering, and optional graph propagation.

Result: The event-centric model demonstrates superior performance on the LoCoMo and LongMemEval$_S$ benchmarks while relying on shorter QA contexts.

Conclusion: Event-level memory is a practical and effective foundation for long-horizon conversational agents, outperforming traditional methods in maintaining coherent, long-term dialogues.

Abstract: LLM-based conversational agents still struggle to maintain coherent, personalized interaction over many sessions: fixed context windows limit how much history can be kept in view, and most external memory approaches trade off between coarse retrieval over large chunks and fine-grained but fragmented views of the dialogue. Motivated by neo-Davidsonian event semantics, we propose an event-centric alternative that represents conversational history as short, event-like propositions which bundle together participants, temporal cues, and minimal local context, rather than as independent relation triples or opaque summaries. In contrast to work that aggressively compresses or forgets past content, our design aims to preserve information in a non-compressive form and make it more accessible, rather than more lossy. Concretely, we instruct an LLM to decompose each session into enriched elementary discourse units (EDUs) -- self-contained statements with normalized entities and source turn attributions -- and organize sessions, EDUs, and their arguments in a heterogeneous graph that supports associative recall. On top of this representation we build two simple retrieval-based variants that use dense similarity search and LLM filtering, with an optional graph-based propagation step to connect and aggregate evidence across related EDUs. Experiments on the LoCoMo and LongMemEval$_S$ benchmarks show that these event-centric memories match or surpass strong baselines, while operating with much shorter QA contexts. Our results suggest that structurally simple, event-level memory provides a principled and practical foundation for long-horizon conversational agents. Our code and data will be released at https://github.com/KevinSRR/EMem.

TL;DR: The paper introduces PARROT, a framework to evaluate the impact of social pressure on the accuracy of responses from large language models, showing varying levels of robustness across models and domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the concern of sycophancy, where language models excessively conform under authoritative pressure, degrading their reliability and accuracy.

Method: PARROT uses a double-blind evaluation comparing neutral and authoritative versions of questions, tracks confidence shifts using log-likelihood calibration, and categorizes responses into an eight-state taxonomy.

Result: Advanced models, such as GPT-5, display low susceptibility (<11%) to social pressure while older/smaller models show significant accuracy loss and confidence errors. Certain domains like international law showed greater fragility.

Conclusion: Enhancing resistance to overfitting pressure is critical for real-world deployment of LLMs, alongside accuracy, harm avoidance, and privacy to ensure safe and trustworthy AI systems.

Abstract: This study presents PARROT (Persuasion and Agreement Robustness Rating of Output Truth), a robustness focused framework designed to measure the degradation in accuracy that occurs under social pressure exerted on users through authority and persuasion in large language models (LLMs) the phenomenon of sycophancy (excessive conformity). PARROT (i) isolates causal effects by comparing the neutral version of the same question with an authoritatively false version using a double-blind evaluation, (ii) quantifies confidence shifts toward the correct and imposed false responses using log-likelihood-based calibration tracking, and (iii) systematically classifies failure modes (e.g., robust correct, sycophantic agreement, reinforced error, stubborn error, self-correction, etc.) using an eight-state behavioral taxonomy. We evaluated 22 models using 1,302 MMLU-style multiple-choice questions across 13 domains and domain-specific authority templates. Findings show marked heterogeneity: advanced models (e.g., GPT-5, GPT-4.1, Claude Sonnet 4.5) exhibit low "follow rates" ($\leq 11\%$, GPT-5: 4\%) and minimal accuracy loss, while older/smaller models show severe epistemic collapse (GPT-4: 80\%, Qwen 2.5-1.5B: 94\%). The danger is not limited to response changes; weak models reduce confidence in the correct response while increasing confidence in the imposed incorrect response. While international law and global knowledge at the domain level exhibit high fragility, elementary mathematics is relatively resilient. Consequently, we argue that the goal of "resistance to overfitting pressure" should be addressed as a primary objective alongside accuracy, harm avoidance, and privacy for safe deployment in the real world.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MirageTVQA introduces a benchmark for evaluating VLM performance on multilingual and visually noisy tabular QA.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing tabular QA benchmarks are monolingual and digitally clean, creating a gap between research and real-world complexities.

Method: MirageTVQA includes nearly 60,000 multilingual QA pairs and tables with visual imperfections mimicking scanned documents.

Result: Leading VLMs show 35% performance degradation under visual noise and exhibit an English-first bias in other languages.

Conclusion: MirageTVQA highlights the limitations of current VLMs and encourages development towards more robust models for realistic table reasoning.

Abstract: The impressive performance of VLMs is largely measured on benchmarks that fail to capture the complexities of real-world scenarios. Existing datasets for tabular QA, such as WikiTableQuestions and FinQA, are overwhelmingly monolingual (English) and present tables in a digitally perfect, clean format. This creates a significant gap between research and practice. To address this, we present \textbf{MirageTVQA}, a new benchmark designed to evaluate VLMs on these exact dimensions. Featuring nearly 60,000 QA pairs across 24 languages, MirageTVQA challenges models with tables that are not only multilingual but also visually imperfect, incorporating realistic noise to mimic scanned documents. Our evaluation of the leading VLMs reveals two primary failure points: a severe degradation in performance (over 35\% drop for the best models) when faced with visual noise and a consistent English-first bias where reasoning abilities fail to transfer to other languages. MirageTVQA provides a benchmark for measuring and driving progress towards more robust VLM models for table reasoning. The dataset and the code are available at: https://github.com/anshulsc/MirageTVQA.

TL;DR: This paper proposes a hybrid methodology to predict social media user behavior, focusing both on common and rare actions, evaluated on Bluesky dataset with 6.4M threads and achieving high F1-scores.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from limited exploration of rare but significant social media behaviors, aiming to improve content recommendations and platform design.

Method: The hybrid methodology combines lookup databases, persona-specific LightGBM models, hybrid neural architectures, and text reply generation for diverse action prediction.

Result: The approach achieved an average macro F1-score of 0.64 for common actions and 0.56 for rare actions, illustrating effective modeling of user behaviors.

Conclusion: Effective behavior prediction requires distinct modeling strategies for common versus rare actions, validated by top results in SocialSim challenge.

Abstract: Understanding and predicting user behavior on social media platforms is crucial for content recommendation and platform design. While existing approaches focus primarily on common actions like retweeting and liking, the prediction of rare but significant behaviors remains largely unexplored. This paper presents a hybrid methodology for social media user behavior prediction that addresses both frequent and infrequent actions across a diverse action vocabulary. We evaluate our approach on a large-scale Bluesky dataset containing 6.4 million conversation threads spanning 12 distinct user actions across 25 persona clusters. Our methodology combines four complementary approaches: (i) a lookup database system based on historical response patterns; (ii) persona-specific LightGBM models with engineered temporal and semantic features for common actions; (iii) a specialized hybrid neural architecture fusing textual and temporal representations for rare action classification; and (iv) generation of text replies. Our persona-specific models achieve an average macro F1-score of 0.64 for common action prediction, while our rare action classifier achieves 0.56 macro F1-score across 10 rare actions. These results demonstrate that effective social media behavior prediction requires tailored modeling strategies recognizing fundamental differences between action types. Our approach achieved first place in the SocialSim: Social-Media Based Personas challenge organized at the Social Simulation with LLMs workshop at COLM 2025.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To adapt and evaluate commonsense reasoning benchmarks (WinoGrande) for localized use in Estonian, addressing specific linguistic and cultural challenges.

Method: Translation specialists created a human-translated Estonian dataset. The paper assessed model performance on human and machine translations and investigated prompt engineering for machine translation improvements.

Result: Human-translated Estonian models performed slightly worse than English test sets, while machine-translated data showed significantly lower performance. Prompt engineering had limited impact.

Conclusion: Language specialists are crucial for reliable dataset translations and evaluations, as prompt engineering provides minimal improvement in translation quality/model accuracy.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a localized and culturally adapted Estonian translation of the test set from the widely used commonsense reasoning benchmark, WinoGrande. We detail the translation and adaptation process carried out by translation specialists and evaluate the performance of both proprietary and open source models on the human translated benchmark. Additionally, we explore the feasibility of achieving high-quality machine translation by incorporating insights from the manual translation process into the design of a detailed prompt. This prompt is specifically tailored to address both the linguistic characteristics of Estonian and the unique translation challenges posed by the WinoGrande dataset. Our findings show that model performance on the human translated Estonian dataset is slightly lower than on the original English test set, while performance on machine-translated data is notably worse. Additionally, our experiments indicate that prompt engineering offers limited improvement in translation quality or model accuracy, and highlight the importance of involving language specialists in dataset translation and adaptation to ensure reliable and interpretable evaluations of language competency and reasoning in large language models.

*Koena Ronny Mabokela,Tim Schlippe,Matthias Wölfel*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates the zero-shot sentiment analysis performance of state-of-the-art LLMs on social media posts in English, Sepedi, and Setswana for social challenges in South Africa, showing notable differences between LLMs and the value of combining their outputs for enhanced accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the potential of LLMs in performing sentiment analysis on multilingual social media posts, primarily to detect social challenges in South African languages and assist government departments in addressing these issues.

Method: The study evaluates the zero-shot sentiment analysis capabilities of LLMs like GPT-3.5, GPT-4, LlaMA 2, PaLM 2, and Dolly 2 on social media posts, focusing on emerging topics related to South African government jurisdictions in English, Sepedi, and Setswana.

Result: Findings reveal significant differences in sentiment analysis performance across LLMs, topics, and languages. By merging results from different models, sentiment classification accuracy improved significantly, reducing errors to below 1%.

Conclusion: The fusion of LLMs' outputs yields highly accurate sentiment analysis tools for detecting social challenges across various language groups, enabling reliable assessments of community needs for governmental actions.

Abstract: Sentiment analysis can aid in understanding people's opinions and emotions on social issues. In multilingual communities sentiment analysis systems can be used to quickly identify social challenges in social media posts, enabling government departments to detect and address these issues more precisely and effectively. Recently, large-language models (LLMs) have become available to the wide public and initial analyses have shown that they exhibit magnificent zero-shot sentiment analysis abilities in English. However, there is no work that has investigated to leverage LLMs for sentiment analysis on social media posts in South African languages and detect social challenges. Consequently, in this work, we analyse the zero-shot performance of the state-of-the-art LLMs GPT-3.5, GPT-4, LlaMa 2, PaLM 2, and Dolly 2 to investigate the sentiment polarities of the 10 most emerging topics in English, Sepedi and Setswana social media posts that fall within the jurisdictional areas of 10 South African government departments. Our results demonstrate that there are big differences between the various LLMs, topics, and languages. In addition, we show that a fusion of the outcomes of different LLMs provides large gains in sentiment classification performance with sentiment classification errors below 1%. Consequently, it is now feasible to provide systems that generate reliable information about sentiment analysis to detect social challenges and draw conclusions about possible needs for actions on specific topics and within different language groups.

### [61] [Humanlike Multi-user Agent (HUMA): Designing a Deceptively Human AI Facilitator for Group Chats](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17315)
*Mateusz Jacniacki,Martí Carmona Serrat*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: HUMA introduces a humanlike facilitator for asynchronous group chats utilizing LLMs, capable of simulating realistic participation dynamics. Evaluation shows its performance on par with human moderators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the gap in conversational agents designed for asynchronous, humanlike group interactions within digital platforms to maintain user trust and engagement.

Method: The study introduces HUMA, an LLM-based multi-user facilitator employing an event-driven architecture and realistic response simulation, evaluated in controlled experiments with 97 participants.

Result: Participants in role-play chats evaluated the AI against human counterparts, finding the AI nearly indistinguishable from humans and comparable on metrics like engagement and effectiveness.

Conclusion: HUMA demonstrates that LLM-powered AI can effectively facilitate group conversations with humanlike quality, suggesting its potential in real-world applications.

Abstract: Conversational agents built on large language models (LLMs) are becoming increasingly prevalent, yet most systems are designed for one-on-one, turn-based exchanges rather than natural, asynchronous group chats. As AI assistants become widespread throughout digital platforms, from virtual assistants to customer service, developing natural and humanlike interaction patterns seems crucial for maintaining user trust and engagement. We present the Humanlike Multi-user Agent (HUMA), an LLM-based facilitator that participates in multi-party conversations using human-like strategies and timing. HUMA extends prior multi-user chatbot work with an event-driven architecture that handles messages, replies, reactions and introduces realistic response-time simulation. HUMA comprises three components-Router, Action Agent, and Reflection-which together adapt LLMs to group conversation dynamics.
  We evaluate HUMA in a controlled study with 97 participants in four-person role-play chats, comparing AI and human community managers (CMs). Participants classified CMs as human at near-chance rates in both conditions, indicating they could not reliably distinguish HUMA agents from humans. Subjective experience was comparable across conditions: community-manager effectiveness, social presence, and engagement/satisfaction differed only modestly with small effect sizes. Our results suggest that, in natural group chat settings, an AI facilitator can match human quality while remaining difficult to identify as nonhuman.

*Xiaoyun Jin,Mirjam Ernestus,R. Harald Baayen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper investigates how pitch contours in conversational Mandarin are influenced by word meanings, using a corpus-based approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the effect of semantics on tonal realization in Mandarin, beyond traditional phonetic predictors.

Method: Generalized additive models were applied to decompose pitch contours and analyze various control variables and semantic predictors.

Result: Word meaning (semantics) significantly affects pitch contours in Mandarin, supported by predictive accuracy of contextualized embeddings.

Conclusion: Findings challenge existing tone theories and align with the Discriminative Lexicon Model, suggesting semantics plays a critical role in tonal realization.

Abstract: We present a corpus-based investigation of how the pitch contours of monosyllabic words are realized in spontaneous conversational Mandarin, focusing on the effects of words' meanings. We used the generalized additive model to decompose a given observed pitch contour into a set of component pitch contours that are tied to different control variables and semantic predictors. Even when variables such as word duration, gender, speaker identity, tonal context, vowel height, and utterance position are controlled for, the effect of word remains a strong predictor of tonal realization. We present evidence that this effect of word is a semantic effect: word sense is shown to be a better predictor than word, and heterographic homophones are shown to have different pitch contours. The strongest evidence for the importance of semantics is that the pitch contours of individual word tokens can be predicted from their contextualized embeddings with an accuracy that substantially exceeds a permutation baseline. For phonetics, distributional semantics is a new kid on the block. Although our findings challenge standard theories of Mandarin tone, they fit well within the theoretical framework of the Discriminative Lexicon Model.

*Daniil Ignatev,Ayman Santeer,Albert Gatt,Denis Paperno*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a zero-shot NLI method that uses multimodal representations by grounding language in visual contexts, showing accurate results without fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations in traditional Natural Language Inference methods by incorporating visual modalities to improve robustness against biases and heuristics.

Method: Generate visual representations of premises using text-to-image models, and compare them to textual hypotheses through cosine similarity or visual question answering.

Result: Achieved high accuracy in NLI tasks without fine-tuning and validated robustness using a controlled adversarial dataset.

Conclusion: Visual modality can enhance robust natural language understanding and establishes a promising direction for multimodal approaches in NLI.

Abstract: We propose a zero-shot method for Natural Language Inference (NLI) that leverages multimodal representations by grounding language in visual contexts. Our approach generates visual representations of premises using text-to-image models and performs inference by comparing these representations with textual hypotheses. We evaluate two inference techniques: cosine similarity and visual question answering. Our method achieves high accuracy without task-specific fine-tuning, demonstrating robustness against textual biases and surface heuristics. Additionally, we design a controlled adversarial dataset to validate the robustness of our approach. Our findings suggest that leveraging visual modality as a meaning representation provides a promising direction for robust natural language understanding.

### [64] [Selective Rotary Position Embedding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17388)
*Sajad Movahedi,Timur Carstensen,Arshia Afzal,Frank Hutter,Antonio Orvieto,Volkan Cevher*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces Selective RoPE, an input-dependent rotary embedding mechanism, for both linear and softmax transformers to improve position encoding and task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Position information is crucial for language modeling, and existing methods for encoding such information (e.g., RoPE and selective gating) show limitations that can be improved.

Method: Selective RoPE generalizes Rotary Position Embeddings (RoPE) by enabling input-dependent rotations at arbitrary angles for all transformer types, uncovering new positional structures and mechanisms.

Result: Selective RoPE improves performance in language modeling and challenging sequential tasks (e.g., copying, state tracking, and retrieval).

Conclusion: Selective RoPE enhances the positional encoding capabilities in transformers, leading to better handling of complex sequence-based tasks in comparison to existing methods.

Abstract: Position information is essential for language modeling. In softmax transformers, Rotary Position Embeddings (\textit{RoPE}) encode positions through \textit{fixed-angle} rotations, while in linear transformers, order is handled via input-dependent (selective) gating that decays past key-value associations. Selectivity has generally been shown to improve language-related tasks. Inspired by this, we introduce \textit{Selective RoPE}, an \textit{input-dependent} rotary embedding mechanism, that generalizes \textit{RoPE}, and enables rotation in \textit{arbitrary angles} for both linear and softmax transformers. We show that softmax attention already performs a hidden form of these rotations on query-key pairs, uncovering an implicit positional structure. We further show that in state-space models and gated linear transformers, the real part manages forgetting while the imaginary part encodes positions through rotations. We validate our method by equipping gated transformers with \textit{Selective RoPE}, demonstrating that its input-dependent rotations improve performance in language modeling and on difficult sequence tasks like copying, state tracking, and retrieval.

### [66] [Beyond Multiple Choice: A Hybrid Framework for Unifying Robust Evaluation and Verifiable Reasoning Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17405)
*Yesheng Liu,Hao Li,Haiyu Xu,Baoqi Pei,Jiahao Wang,Mingxuan Zhao,Jingshu Zheng,Zheqi He,JG Yao,Bowen Qin,Xi Yang,Jiajun Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces ReVeL, a framework transforming multiple-choice questions into open-form questions to better evaluate and fine-tune multimodal language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the issues with multiple-choice question answering (MCQA), where accuracy metrics become unreliable due to answer options revealing exploitable signals, resulting in inaccurate performance evaluation and answer guessing during reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT).

Method: ReVeL (Rewrite and Verify by LLM) framework reformulates multiple-choice questions into verifiable open-form questions by categorizing them based on answer types and applying specific rewriting and verification schemes. It also fine-tunes Qwen2.5-VL models using GRPO on these converted questions.

Result: ReVeL showed improved OpenQA accuracy (6% increase) compared to MCQA-based training while maintaining MCQA accuracy. It also revealed inflated scores (up to 20%) in MCQA evaluations, ensuring better data efficiency, robust reward signals, and lower evaluation cost and latency.

Conclusion: ReVeL enhances both the fine-tuning and evaluation of multimodal language models by reducing biases and improving accuracy in OpenQA tasks. Its release will offer an effective alternative to traditional MCQA-based methods.

Abstract: Multiple-choice question answering (MCQA) has been a popular format for evaluating and reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) of modern multimodal language models. Its constrained output format allows for simplified, deterministic automatic verification. However, we find that the options may leak exploitable signals, which makes the accuracy metrics unreliable for indicating real capabilities and encourages explicit or implicit answer guessing behaviors during RFT. We propose ReVeL (Rewrite and Verify by LLM), a framework that rewrites multiple-choice questions into open-form questions while keeping answers verifiable whenever possible. The framework categorizes questions according to different answer types, apply different rewriting and verification schemes, respectively. When applied for RFT, we converted 20k MCQA examples and use GRPO to finetune Qwen2.5-VL models. Models trained on ReVeL-OpenQA match MCQA accuracy on multiple-choice benchmarks and improve OpenQA accuracy by about six percentage points, indicating better data efficiency and more robust reward signals than MCQA-based training. When used for evaluation, ReVeL also reveals up to 20 percentage points of score inflation in MCQA benchmarks (relative to OpenQA), improves judging accuracy, and reduces both cost and latency. We will release code and data publicly.

*Shrikant Kendre,Austin Xu,Honglu Zhou,Michael Ryoo,Shafiq Joty,Juan Carlos Niebles*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Traditional metrics for question-answering evaluations lack in balancing semantics and lexical similarity; the proposed SMILE metric addresses this gap effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create an evaluation metric that balances lexical precision with semantic understanding for better human-aligned assessments in question answering tasks.

Method: Introduced SMILE, a composite metric integrating sentence-level semantic understanding, keyword semantics, and lexical exactness for robust evaluations.

Result: SMILE demonstrated high correlation with human judgments and is computationally efficient, applicable across text, image, and video QA benchmarks.

Conclusion: SMILE effectively combines lexical and semantic evaluation, overcoming the limitations of traditional and current methods like BERTScore and LLM-based evaluators.

Abstract: Traditional evaluation metrics for textual and visual question answering, like ROUGE, METEOR, and Exact Match (EM), focus heavily on n-gram based lexical similarity, often missing the deeper semantic understanding needed for accurate assessment. While measures like BERTScore and MoverScore leverage contextual embeddings to address this limitation, they lack flexibility in balancing sentence-level and keyword-level semantics and ignore lexical similarity, which remains important. Large Language Model (LLM) based evaluators, though powerful, come with drawbacks like high costs, bias, inconsistency, and hallucinations. To address these issues, we introduce SMILE: Semantic Metric Integrating Lexical Exactness, a novel approach that combines sentence-level semantic understanding with keyword-level semantic understanding and easy keyword matching. This composite method balances lexical precision and semantic relevance, offering a comprehensive evaluation. Extensive benchmarks across text, image, and video QA tasks show SMILE is highly correlated with human judgments and computationally lightweight, bridging the gap between lexical and semantic evaluation.

*Zhen Wang,Zhifeng Gao,Guolin Ke*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces MR-RLVR, a method that improves reasoning scalability and performance for language models in mathematical contexts where only outcomes are verifiable.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RLVR struggles with scalability in tasks like theorem proving because intermediate reasoning is often necessary, and token-level supervised fine-tuning results in rote memorization rather than genuine reasoning.

Method: The method involves MR-RLVR, which uses self-supervised tasks such as 'masked-then-fill' and 'step reordering' to create rewards from intermediate reasoning. Training is done in two phases—self-supervised training followed by RLVR fine-tuning.

Result: When applied to specific datasets, the method showed significant improvements in reasoning accuracy across metrics such as Pass@1, Pass@5, and Pass@8.

Conclusion: The findings suggest that using process-level, self-supervised rewards can efficiently improve performance in mathematical reasoning tasks where only final outcomes are verifiable.

Abstract: Test-time scaling has been shown to substantially improve large language models' (LLMs) mathematical reasoning. However, for a large portion of mathematical corpora, especially theorem proving, RLVR's scalability is limited: intermediate reasoning is crucial, while final answers are difficult to directly and reliably verify. Meanwhile, token-level SFT often degenerates into rote memorization rather than inducing longer chains of thought. Inspired by BERT's self-supervised tasks, we propose MR-RLVR (Masked-and-Reordered RLVR), which constructs process-level self-supervised rewards via "masked-then-fill" and "step reordering" to extract learnable signals from intermediate reasoning. Our training pipeline comprises two stages: we first perform self-supervised training on sampled mathematical calculation and proof data; we then conduct RLVR fine-tuning on mathematical calculation datasets where only outcomes are verifiable. We implement MR-RLVR on Qwen2.5-3B and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, and evaluate on AIME24, AIME25, AMC23, and MATH500. Under a fixed sampling and decoding budget, MR-RLVR achieves average relative gains over the original RLVR of +9.86% Pass@1, +5.27% Pass@5, and +4.00% Pass@8. These results indicate that incorporating process-aware self-supervised signals can effectively enhance RLVR's scalability and performance in only outcome-verifiable settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide an objective, interpretable, and statistically certain method for analyzing and distinguishing artistic styles using mathematical tools, overcoming traditional reliance on subjective visual intuition.

Method: The authors employ persistent homology (PH), a topological data analysis technique, to analyze artworks and extract insights about artistic styles, enabling differentiation between human-made and AI-generated art.

Result: The study demonstrates with statistical certainty the ability of PH to differentiate between various artists, artistic currents, and AI-generated art mimicking specific artists.

Conclusion: Persistent homology is shown to be a promising tool for objectively analyzing and discerning artistic styles, offering potential advantages over traditional subjective methods.

Abstract: Art is a deeply personal and expressive medium, where each artist brings their own style, technique, and cultural background into their work. Traditionally, identifying artistic styles has been the job of art historians or critics, relying on visual intuition and experience. However, with the advancement of mathematical tools, we can explore art through more structured lens. In this work, we show how persistent homology (PH), a method from topological data analysis, provides objective and interpretable insights on artistic styles. We show how PH can, with statistical certainty, differentiate between artists, both from different artistic currents and from the same one, and distinguish images of an artist from an AI-generated image in the artist's style.

TL;DR: The paper presents a method using StyleGAN2 for generating diverse macaque facial expressions by addressing data limitations through data augmentation, sample selection, and loss function refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Study animal facial expressions, specifically macaques, widely used in neuroscience and evolutionary research, and tackle challenges posed by limited training data.

Method: The authors augmented datasets with motion transfer techniques, selected samples based on latent representation, and improved loss functions to create realistic macaque facial expressions.

Result: The method successfully generated varied facial expressions and allowed style-based image editing, outperforming models trained on original images.

Conclusion: The model offers a valuable tool for understanding macaque facial expressions and separating motion components via style parameters, aiding neuroscience and evolutionary research.

Abstract: Generating animal faces using generative AI techniques is challenging because the available training images are limited both in quantity and variation, particularly for facial expressions across individuals. In this study, we focus on macaque monkeys, widely studied in systems neuroscience and evolutionary research, and propose a method to generate their facial expressions using a style-based generative image model (i.e., StyleGAN2). To address data limitations, we implemented: 1) data augmentation by synthesizing new facial expression images using a motion transfer to animate still images with computer graphics, 2) sample selection based on the latent representation of macaque faces from an initially trained StyleGAN2 model to ensure the variation and uniform sampling in training dataset, and 3) loss function refinement to ensure the accurate reproduction of subtle movements, such as eye movements. Our results demonstrate that the proposed method enables the generation of diverse facial expressions for multiple macaque individuals, outperforming models trained solely on original still images. Additionally, we show that our model is effective for style-based image editing, where specific style parameters correspond to distinct facial movements. These findings underscore the model's potential for disentangling motion components as style parameters, providing a valuable tool for research on macaque facial expressions.

Motivation: The lack of benchmark datasets for dual-person portrait generation hampers the development of high-quality, personalized results in applications such as preserving memories and wedding photography planning.

Method: The authors created the PairHuman dataset with over 100K images of dual-person interactions and rich metadata, as well as developed DHumanDiff, a baseline model enhancing facial consistency and balancing personalization and scene creation.

Result: Experimental results show that the dataset and DHumanDiff method produce personalized portraits with superior visual quality tailored to human preferences.

Conclusion: The PairHuman dataset and DHumanDiff method advance dual-person portrait generation, providing high-quality, customized results; the dataset is publicly available for further research.

Abstract: Personalized dual-person portrait customization has considerable potential applications, such as preserving emotional memories and facilitating wedding photography planning. However, the absence of a benchmark dataset hinders the pursuit of high-quality customization in dual-person portrait generation. In this paper, we propose the PairHuman dataset, which is the first large-scale benchmark dataset specifically designed for generating dual-person portraits that meet high photographic standards. The PairHuman dataset contains more than 100K images that capture a variety of scenes, attire, and dual-person interactions, along with rich metadata, including detailed image descriptions, person localization, human keypoints, and attribute tags. We also introduce DHumanDiff, which is a baseline specifically crafted for dual-person portrait generation that features enhanced facial consistency and simultaneously balances in personalized person generation and semantic-driven scene creation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel unsupervised machine learning method utilizing autoencoders and wavelet transforms to denoise neutron imaging data impacted by Gaussian and Poisson noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neutron imaging for inertial confinement fusion (ICF) is hindered by mixed noise types, which degrade image quality and make conventional denoising methods insufficient.

Method: The study uses an unsupervised autoencoder combined with a Cohen-Daubechies-Feauveau (CDF 97) wavelet transform in latent space to denoise neutron imaging data.

Result: The proposed method successfully denoises mixed Gaussian-Poisson noise, achieving lower reconstruction error and better edge preservation than traditional filtering methods like BM3D.

Conclusion: The novel approach improves noise reduction and edge preservation in neutron imaging, enhancing analysis of ICF experiments and offering promising future applications in fusion imaging.

Abstract: Neutron imaging is important in optimizing analysis of inertial confinement fusion (ICF) events such as those at the National Ignition Facility (NIF) and improving current and future ICF platforms. However, images of neutron sources are often degraded by various types of noise. Most commonly, Gaussian and Poisson noise often coexist within one image, obscuring fine details and blurring edges. These noise types often overlap, making them difficult to distinguish and remove using conventional filtering and thresholding methods. As a result, noise removal techniques that preserve image fidelity are important for analyzing and interpreting images of a neutron source. Current solutions include a combination of filtering and thresholding methodologies. In the past, machine learning approaches were rarely implemented due to a lack of ground truth neutron imaging data for ICF processes. However, recent advances in synthetic data production, particularly in the fusion imaging field, have opened opportunities to investigate new denoising procedures using both supervised and unsupervised machine learning methods. In this study, we implement an unsupervised autoencoder with a Cohen-Daubechies- Feauveau (CDF 97) wavelet transform in the latent space for mixed Gaussian-Poisson denoising. The network successfully denoises neutron imaging data. Additionally, it demonstrates lower reconstruction error and superior edge preservation metrics when benchmarked with data generated by a forward model and compared to non-ML-based filtering mechanisms such as Block-matching and 3D filtering (BM3D). This approach presents a promising advancement in neutron image noise reduction and three-dimensional reconstruction analysis of ICF experiments.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance object detection, segmentation, and tracking tasks in both images and videos using promptable concept segmentation (PCS).

Method: The authors developed a unified model with an image detector and memory-based video tracker, trained using a high-quality dataset with 4M concept labels.

Result: SAM 3 doubles the performance of existing systems in PCS tasks and enhances previous segmentation capabilities.

Conclusion: SAM 3 improves segmentation performance, introduces a new benchmark (SA-Co), and is open-sourced for broad adoption.

Abstract: We present Segment Anything Model (SAM) 3, a unified model that detects, segments, and tracks objects in images and videos based on concept prompts, which we define as either short noun phrases (e.g., "yellow school bus"), image exemplars, or a combination of both. Promptable Concept Segmentation (PCS) takes such prompts and returns segmentation masks and unique identities for all matching object instances. To advance PCS, we build a scalable data engine that produces a high-quality dataset with 4M unique concept labels, including hard negatives, across images and videos. Our model consists of an image-level detector and a memory-based video tracker that share a single backbone. Recognition and localization are decoupled with a presence head, which boosts detection accuracy. SAM 3 doubles the accuracy of existing systems in both image and video PCS, and improves previous SAM capabilities on visual segmentation tasks. We open source SAM 3 along with our new Segment Anything with Concepts (SA-Co) benchmark for promptable concept segmentation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper addresses the safety-generalization trade-off in vision-language models like CLIP by proposing the SaFeR-CLIP framework, which minimally intervenes in model semantics to improve safety while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve the safety of vision-language models, specifically CLIP, without compromising their generalization performance, which is a common issue in existing safety fine-tuning methods.

Method: The paper introduces SaFeR-CLIP, a fine-tuning framework that redirects unsafe concepts to their semantically closest safe alternatives, preserving the model's existing semantic representation while making it safer.

Result: SaFeR-CLIP achieves up to an 8.0% recovery in zero-shot accuracy compared to prior methods while maintaining robust safety. A new benchmark, NSFW-Caps, is also introduced to evaluate safety under distributional shifts.

Conclusion: Respecting the geometry of pretrained representations allows for achieving a balance between safety and performance in vision-language models, as demonstrated by SaFeR-CLIP.

Abstract: Improving the safety of vision-language models like CLIP via fine-tuning often comes at a steep price, causing significant drops in their generalization performance. We find this trade-off stems from rigid alignment strategies that force unsafe concepts toward single, predefined safe targets, disrupting the model's learned semantic structure. To address this, we propose a proximity-aware approach: redirecting unsafe concepts to their semantically closest safe alternatives to minimize representational change. We introduce SaFeR-CLIP, a fine-tuning framework that applies this principle of minimal intervention. SaFeR-CLIP successfully reconciles safety and performance, recovering up to 8.0% in zero-shot accuracy over prior methods while maintaining robust safety. To support more rigorous evaluation, we also contribute NSFW-Caps, a new benchmark of 1,000 highly-aligned pairs for testing safety under distributional shift.

*Mengnan Jiang,Zhaolin Sun,Christian Franke,Michele Franco Adesso,Antonio Haas,Grace Li Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework to generate multi-view consistent SVGs from a single-view SVG input, ensuring geometric and color consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of generating multi-view consistent SVGs for single objects, which remains unexplored despite SVGs' vital role in modern design.

Method: The framework involves three stages: (1) converting the input into 3D and generating multi-view images, (2) applying a spatial memory mechanism inspired by Segment Anything 2 to clean up paths and colors, and (3) optimizing raster-to-vector conversion for better structure and reduced redundancy.

Result: The framework produces multi-view SVGs with improved geometric and color consistency, reduced redundancy, and preserved structural details.

Conclusion: The approach bridges generative modeling and vector graphics, supporting diverse applications like asset creation and semantic editing.

Abstract: Scalable Vector Graphics (SVGs) are central to modern design workflows, offering scaling without distortion and precise editability. However, for single object SVGs, generating multi-view consistent SVGs from a single-view input remains underexplored. We present a three stage framework that produces multi-view SVGs with geometric and color consistency from a single SVG input. First, the rasterized input is lifted to a 3D representation and rendered under target camera poses, producing multi-view images of the object. Next, we extend the temporal memory mechanism of Segment Anything 2 (SAM2) to the spatial domain, constructing a spatial memory bank that establishes part level correspondences across neighboring views, yielding cleaner and more consistent vector paths and color assignments without retraining. Finally, during the raster to vector conversion, we perform path consolidation and structural optimization to reduce redundancy while preserving boundaries and semantics. The resulting SVGs exhibit strong geometric and color consistency across views, significantly reduce redundant paths, and retain fine structural details. This work bridges generative modeling and structured vector representation, providing a scalable route to single input, object level multi-view SVG generation and supporting applications such as asset creation and semantic vector editing.

*Xiatao Sun,Chen Liang,Qian Wang,Daniel Rakita*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Mesh RAG is a training-free framework designed to improve autoregressive mesh generation by introducing retrieval-based processes for efficiency, quality, and editing capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of using larger models or longer sequences for mesh generation, which result in trade-offs between quality, speed, and editing capabilities in sequential autoregressive methods.

Method: Mesh RAG uses retrieval-based techniques, including point cloud segmentation, spatial transformation, and point cloud registration, to decouple mesh generation from sequential dependencies, enabling parallel inference and editing without requiring model retraining.

Result: Mesh RAG improves mesh quality, accelerates generation speed compared to sequential prediction methods, and enables incremental editing across various autoregressive mesh generation models.

Conclusion: Mesh RAG demonstrates a significant step toward more efficient, high-quality, and versatile mesh generation without the need for retraining, making it useful for numerous 3D mesh applications.

Abstract: 3D meshes are a critical building block for applications ranging from industrial design and gaming to simulation and robotics. Traditionally, meshes are crafted manually by artists, a process that is time-intensive and difficult to scale. To automate and accelerate this asset creation, autoregressive models have emerged as a powerful paradigm for artistic mesh generation. However, current methods to enhance quality typically rely on larger models or longer sequences that result in longer generation time, and their inherent sequential nature imposes a severe quality-speed trade-off. This sequential dependency also significantly complicates incremental editing. To overcome these limitations, we propose Mesh RAG, a novel, training-free, plug-and-play framework for autoregressive mesh generation models. Inspired by RAG for language models, our approach augments the generation process by leveraging point cloud segmentation, spatial transformation, and point cloud registration to retrieve, generate, and integrate mesh components. This retrieval-based approach decouples generation from its strict sequential dependency, facilitating efficient and parallelizable inference. We demonstrate the wide applicability of Mesh RAG across various foundational autoregressive mesh generation models, showing it significantly enhances mesh quality, accelerates generation speed compared to sequential part prediction, and enables incremental editing, all without model retraining.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of EO benchmarks that combine multimodal perception with measurable biophysical variables for progress in scientific reasoning.

Method: Developed REO-Instruct, a unified benchmark incorporating co-registered Sentinel-2 and ALOS-2 images with human AI validated structured annotations for cognitive evaluation.

Result: Evaluation of current VLMs on the benchmark revealed their challenges in numeric reasoning, underscoring gaps for scientific VLM models.

Conclusion: REO-Instruct sets a standardized pathway for advancing geospatial models capable of combining description and scientific inference tasks in Earth Observation.

Abstract: Recent progress in vision language models (VLMs) has enabled remarkable perception and reasoning capabilities, yet their potential for scientific regression in Earth Observation (EO) remains largely unexplored. Existing EO datasets mainly emphasize semantic understanding tasks such as captioning or classification, lacking benchmarks that align multimodal perception with measurable biophysical variables. To fill this gap, we present REO-Instruct, the first unified benchmark designed for both descriptive and regression tasks in EO. REO-Instruct establishes a cognitively interpretable logic chain in forest ecological scenario (human activity,land-cover classification, ecological patch counting, above-ground biomass (AGB) regression), bridging qualitative understanding and quantitative prediction. The dataset integrates co-registered Sentinel-2 and ALOS-2 imagery with structured textual annotations generated and validated through a hybrid human AI pipeline. Comprehensive evaluation protocols and baseline results across generic VLMs reveal that current models struggle with numeric reasoning, highlighting an essential challenge for scientific VLMs. REO-Instruct offers a standardized foundation for developing and assessing next-generation geospatial models capable of both description and scientific inference.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLM benchmarks focus on high-level spatial relationships but neglect precise 3D localization, object affordances, and multi-step spatial reasoning needed for realistic applications.

Method: They developed BOP-ASK, a dataset derived from 6D object poses in BOP datasets, with detailed annotations like grasp poses, trajectories, and spatial relationships. It includes over 150k images and 33M Q&A pairs spanning six tasks. It also features BOP-ASK-core for testing and BOP-ASK-lab for generalization evaluation.

Result: Models trained on BOP-ASK outperform baselines and show emergent capabilities such as precise spatial reasoning, grasp pose estimation, and trajectory planning in cluttered environments.

Conclusion: BOP-ASK is a significant resource for advancing VLMs' ability in fine-grained spatial reasoning. The authors plan to publicly release the datasets and data generation pipeline for future research.

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) have achieved impressive performance on spatial reasoning benchmarks, yet these evaluations mask critical weaknesses in understanding object interactions. Current benchmarks test high level relationships ('left of,' 'behind', etc.) but ignore fine-grained spatial understanding needed for real world applications: precise 3D localization, physical compatibility between objects, object affordances and multi step spatial planning. In this work, we present BOP-ASK, a novel large scale dataset for object interaction reasoning for both training and benchmarking. Our data generation pipeline leverages 6D object poses from the Benchmark for Object Pose Estimation (BOP) datasets from which we derive fine grained annotations such as grasp poses, referred object poses, path planning trajectories, relative spatial and depth relationships, and object-to-object relationships. BOP-ASK comprises over 150k images and 33M question answer pairs spanning six tasks (four novel), providing a rich resource for training and evaluating VLMs. We evaluate proprietary and open sourced VLMs, and conduct human evaluations on BOP-ASK-core, a contributed test benchmark. We also release BOP-ASK-lab, an out-of-distribution benchmark with images not sourced from BOP, enabling testing of generalization. Our experiments demonstrate that models trained on BOP-ASK outperform baselines and exhibit emergent capabilities such as precise object and grasp pose estimation, trajectory planning, and fine-grained object-centric spatial reasoning in cluttered environments. We will publicly release our datasets and dataset generation pipeline.

*Tianyi Shen,Huijuan Xu,Nilesh Ahuja,Omesh Tickoo,Philip Shin,Vijaykrishnan Narayanan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Parts-Mamba improves skeleton action recognition accuracy under occlusion by preserving local and distant context information using hybrid GCN-Mamba architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GCN models struggle with missing context in skeleton action recognition caused by occlusions or missing frames.

Method: Developed Parts-Mamba model combining parts-specific scanning and parts-body fusion to enhance context preservation for distant joints.

Result: Parts-Mamba reaches up to 12.9% accuracy improvement on NTU RGB+D 60 and NTU RGB+D 120 datasets.

Conclusion: Parts-Mamba effectively addresses occlusion limitations in skeleton action recognition, enhancing contextual learning and model performance.

Abstract: Skeleton action recognition involves recognizing human action from human skeletons. The use of graph convolutional networks (GCNs) has driven major advances in this recognition task. In real-world scenarios, the captured skeletons are not always perfect or complete because of occlusions of parts of the human body or poor communication quality, leading to missing parts in skeletons or videos with missing frames. In the presence of such non-idealities, existing GCN models perform poorly due to missing local context. To address this limitation, we propose Parts-Mamba, a hybrid GCN-Mamba model designed to enhance the ability to capture and maintain contextual information from distant joints. The proposed Parts-Mamba model effectively captures part-specific information through its parts-specific scanning feature and preserves non-neighboring joint context via a parts-body fusion module. Our proposed model is evaluated on the NTU RGB+D 60 and NTU RGB+D 120 datasets under different occlusion settings, achieving up to 12.9% improvement in accuracy.

*Aryan Tajmir Riahi,Khanh Dao Duc*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Joint Gromov-Wasserstein (JGW) framework for simultaneous matching of multiple objects, extending beyond pairwise matching limitations in metric spaces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Gromov-Wasserstein (GW) methods are limited to pairwise matching of single objects, which is insufficient for applications requiring multi-object matching capabilities.

Method: Developed the Joint Gromov-Wasserstein (JGW) objective, a non-negative dissimilarity measure for matching collections of objects, integrating algorithms like entropic regularization in Optimal Transport.

Result: JGW outperforms existing GW variants in both accuracy and computational efficiency across synthetic and real-world datasets for tasks involving multiple shape matching.

Conclusion: The JGW framework is highly effective and generalizes GW for multi-object matching, with promising applications in fields like computer graphics and structural biology.

Abstract: The Gromov-Wasserstein (GW) distance serves as a powerful tool for matching objects in metric spaces. However, its traditional formulation is constrained to pairwise matching between single objects, limiting its utility in scenarios and applications requiring multiple-to-one or multiple-to-multiple object matching. In this paper, we introduce the Joint Gromov-Wasserstein (JGW) objective and extend the original framework of GW to enable simultaneous matching between collections of objects. Our formulation provides a non-negative dissimilarity measure that identifies partially isomorphic distributions of mm-spaces, with point sampling convergence. We also show that the objective can be formulated and solved for point cloud object representations by adapting traditional algorithms in Optimal Transport, including entropic regularization. Our benchmarking with other variants of GW for partial matching indicates superior performance in accuracy and computational efficiency of our method, while experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets show its effectiveness for multiple shape matching, including geometric shapes and biomolecular complexes, suggesting promising applications for solving complex matching problems across diverse domains, including computer graphics and structural biology.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study introduces REPA (representation alignment) to improve generative model performance for solving inverse problems like super-resolution, inpainting, and deblurring by aligning internal representations with pretrained encoders like DINOv2, leading to better reconstruction fidelity and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The goal is to enhance generative models for inverse problems by leveraging representation alignment techniques to improve reconstruction accuracy and sample quality during inference.

Method: The researchers apply REPA, which aligns diffusion or flow-based generative models with self-supervised visual encoders (like DINOv2) at inference time, and propose updates to guide model representations toward those of clean images based on approximate target features.

Result: The results demonstrate that REPA significantly improves reconstruction fidelity and perceptual quality in tasks such as super-resolution and deblurring. The approach also reduces the computational effort by lowering discretization steps while maintaining solver performance.

Conclusion: By aligning pretrained visual encoders with generative models, REPA introduces a generalizable framework to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of inverse problem solvers across various tasks.

Abstract: Enforcing alignment between the internal representations of diffusion or flow-based generative models and those of pretrained self-supervised encoders has recently been shown to provide a powerful inductive bias, improving both convergence and sample quality. In this work, we extend this idea to inverse problems, where pretrained generative models are employed as priors. We propose applying representation alignment (REPA) between diffusion or flow-based models and a pretrained self-supervised visual encoder, such as DINOv2, to guide the reconstruction process at inference time. Although ground-truth signals are unavailable in inverse problems, we show that aligning model representations with approximate target features can substantially enhance reconstruction fidelity and perceptual realism. We provide theoretical results showing (a) the relation between the REPA regularization and a divergence measure in the DINOv2 embedding space, and (b) how REPA updates steer the model's internal representations toward those of the clean image. These results offer insights into the role of REPA in improving perceptual fidelity. Finally, we demonstrate the generality of our approach by integrating it into multiple state-of-the-art inverse problem solvers. Extensive experiments on super-resolution, box inpainting, Gaussian deblurring, and motion deblurring confirm that our method consistently improves reconstruction quality across tasks, while also providing substantial efficiency gains by reducing the number of required discretization steps without compromising the performance of the underlying solver.

*Tao Yan,Hao Huang,Yiwei Lu,Zeyu Wang,Ke Xu,Yinghui Wang,Xiaojun Chang,Rynson W. H. Lau*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces NFGlassNet, a novel method for detecting glass surfaces using reflection dynamics observed in flash/no-flash imagery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Glass surface detection is challenging as glass surfaces are transparent and lack apparent features, and prior methods fail to leverage the intrinsic properties of glass.

Method: The approach involves the Reflection Contrast Mining Module (RCMM) for extracting reflections and the Reflection Guided Attention Module (RGAM) for feature fusion, alongside a specially constructed dataset of flash/no-flash image pairs.

Result: Experiments show NFGlassNet surpasses state-of-the-art methods in accuracy for glass surface detection.

Conclusion: NFGlassNet effectively captures intrinsic glass properties through illumination dynamics and establishes a superior performance baseline for glass detection tasks.

Abstract: Glass surfaces are ubiquitous in daily life, typically appearing colorless, transparent, and lacking distinctive features. These characteristics make glass surface detection a challenging computer vision task. Existing glass surface detection methods always rely on boundary cues (e.g., window and door frames) or reflection cues to locate glass surfaces, but they fail to fully exploit the intrinsic properties of the glass itself for accurate localization. We observed that in most real-world scenes, the illumination intensity in front of the glass surface differs from that behind it, which results in variations in the reflections visible on the glass surface. Specifically, when standing on the brighter side of the glass and applying a flash towards the darker side, existing reflections on the glass surface tend to disappear. Conversely, while standing on the darker side and applying a flash towards the brighter side, distinct reflections will appear on the glass surface. Based on this phenomenon, we propose NFGlassNet, a novel method for glass surface detection that leverages the reflection dynamics present in flash/no-flash imagery. Specifically, we propose a Reflection Contrast Mining Module (RCMM) for extracting reflections, and a Reflection Guided Attention Module (RGAM) for fusing features from reflection and glass surface for accurate glass surface detection. For learning our network, we also construct a dataset consisting of 3.3K no-flash and flash image pairs captured from various scenes with corresponding ground truth annotations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. Our code, model, and dataset will be available upon acceptance of the manuscript.

Motivation: Current research in multimodal large language models lacks focus on real-world, complex audio-visual events in video understanding.

Method: The authors design a dataset (R-AVST) using a pipeline for key object extraction, spatial annotations, and manual quality checks, generating 5K+ videos and 27K annotated objects. They propose AVST-Zero, a reinforcement-learning model using multi-dimensional rewards for reasoning.

Result: R-AVST, combined with more than 8K question-answer pairs, provides a benchmark for spatio-temporal reasoning tasks. AVST-Zero demonstrates competitive performance against existing models.

Conclusion: The introduction of R-AVST resolves the gap in real-world audio-visual reasoning datasets. AVST-Zero provides a novel perspective on addressing the challenges in this field.

Abstract: Recently, rapid advancements have been made in multimodal large language models (MLLMs), especially in video understanding tasks. However, current research focuses on simple video scenarios, failing to reflect the complex and diverse nature of real-world audio-visual events in videos. To bridge this gap, we firstly introduce R-AVST, a dataset for audio-visual reasoning featuring fine-grained spatio-temporal annotations. In constructing this, we design a pipeline consisting of LLM-based key object extraction, automatic spatial annotation and manual quality inspection, resulting in over 5K untrimmed videos with 27K objects across 100 types of audio-visual events. Building on this dataset, we define three core tasks for spatio-temporal reasoning in audio-visual scenes and generate more than 8K high-quality, evenly distributed question-answer pairs to effectively benchmark model performance. To further enhance reasoning, we propose AVST-Zero, a reinforcement learning-based model that avoids intermediate supervision, directly optimizing behavior via carefully designed multi-dimensional rewards. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our R-AVST in advancing audio-visual spatio-temporal reasoning, upon which AVST-Zero demonstrates competitive performance compared to existing models. To the best of our knowledge, R-AVST is the first dataset designed for real-world audio-visual spatio-temporal reasoning, and AVST-Zero offers a novel perspective for tackling future challenges in this domain.

TL;DR: The paper proposes 'Warm Diffusion,' a Blur-Noise Mixture Diffusion Model (BNMD), that combines strengths of hot and cold diffusion for enhanced image generation tasks, validated through experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address limitations in existing diffusion paradigms ('hot' diffusion overlooks correlations; 'cold' diffusion neglects noise's role), aiming to leverage their combined strengths for improved image generation.

Method: The authors introduce Warm Diffusion (BNMD), a novel model that jointly controls blurring and noise, using a divide-and-conquer methodology to separate denoising and deblurring for better score estimation.

Result: The proposed Warm Diffusion (BNMD) model demonstrates effectiveness through extensive benchmark experiments, showing improved results in image generation tasks.

Conclusion: Warm Diffusion integrates blurring and noise to exploit image spectral dependency, improving upon both hot and cold diffusion paradigms, and offers a balanced trade-off in model learning dynamics and data representation.

Abstract: Diffusion probabilistic models have achieved remarkable success in generative tasks across diverse data types. While recent studies have explored alternative degradation processes beyond Gaussian noise, this paper bridges two key diffusion paradigms: hot diffusion, which relies entirely on noise, and cold diffusion, which uses only blurring without noise. We argue that hot diffusion fails to exploit the strong correlation between high-frequency image detail and low-frequency structures, leading to random behaviors in the early steps of generation. Conversely, while cold diffusion leverages image correlations for prediction, it neglects the role of noise (randomness) in shaping the data manifold, resulting in out-of-manifold issues and partially explaining its performance drop. To integrate both strengths, we propose Warm Diffusion, a unified Blur-Noise Mixture Diffusion Model (BNMD), to control blurring and noise jointly. Our divide-and-conquer strategy exploits the spectral dependency in images, simplifying score model estimation by disentangling the denoising and deblurring processes. We further analyze the Blur-to-Noise Ratio (BNR) using spectral analysis to investigate the trade-off between model learning dynamics and changes in the data manifold. Extensive experiments across benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our approach for image generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many existing quality assessment datasets and models only provide coarse single-score evaluations, failing to offer insights for targeted improvements in generative models. Realism and plausibility are essential dimensions for advancing AI image generation.

Method: The authors created Q-Real, a dataset of 3,088 annotated AI-generated images, including entity locations, judgment questions, and attribution descriptions. They also developed Q-Real Bench for reasoning tasks and proposed a fine-tuning framework for MLLMs using this dataset.

Result: Experimental results show the dataset's high quality and importance, as well as the benchmark's comprehensiveness, which aids in assessing and improving generative AI models.

Conclusion: Q-Real enables detailed evaluations along realism and plausibility dimensions, facilitating targeted model optimizations and advancing the capabilities of multi-modal AI models. Dataset and code will be released for public use.

Abstract: Quality assessment of AI-generated content is crucial for evaluating model capability and guiding model optimization. However, most existing quality assessment datasets and models provide only a single quality score, which is too coarse to offer targeted guidance for improving generative models. In current applications of AI-generated images, realism and plausibility are two critical dimensions, and with the emergence of unified generation-understanding models, fine-grained evaluation along these dimensions becomes especially effective for improving generative performance. Therefore, we introduce Q-Real, a novel dataset for fine-grained evaluation of realism and plausibility in AI-generated images. Q-Real consists of 3,088 images generated by popular text-to-image models. For each image, we annotate the locations of major entities and provide a set of judgment questions and attribution descriptions for these along the dimensions of realism and plausibility. Considering that recent advances in multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) enable fine-grained evaluation of AI-generated images, we construct Q-Real Bench to evaluate them on two tasks: judgment and grounding with reasoning. Finally, to enhance MLLM capabilities, we design a fine-tuning framework and conduct experiments on multiple MLLMs using our dataset. Experimental results demonstrate the high quality and significance of our dataset and the comprehensiveness of the benchmark. Dataset and code will be released upon publication.

TL;DR: UniModel is a unified generative model for both visual understanding and generation tasks, transforming text and images into a shared visual space and utilizing a single pixel-to-pixel diffusion framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To unify model, tasks, and representations within a single framework, eliminating modality discrepancies and providing a vision-native approach to multimodal learning.

Method: UniModel maps text and images to a shared visual space using painted text images on a pixel-to-pixel diffusion framework, enabling visual understanding and generation tasks. A Unified Diffusion Transformer with rectified flow is trained for bidirectional mappings between natural and painted text images.

Result: The model exhibits strong cross-modal alignment and emergent controllability, achieving tasks such as text-to-image synthesis and image-to-text understanding effectively.

Conclusion: Unifying model, tasks, and representations in a single visual space through UniModel shows promise for developing general-purpose multimodal intelligence.

Abstract: We present UniModel, a unified generative model that jointly supports visual understanding and visual generation within a single pixel-to-pixel diffusion framework. Our goal is to achieve unification along three axes: the model, the tasks, and the representations. At the representation level, we eliminate modality discrepancies by mapping both text and images into a shared visual space: textual prompts are rendered as painted text images on a clean canvas, and all inputs and outputs are treated purely as RGB pixels. This yields a fully vision-native formulation of multimodal learning. At the task level, a broad range of vision-language problems are cast as pixel-to-pixel transformations in this visual space. For understanding tasks, the model takes an RGB image and produces a painted text image that visually encodes the semantic prediction. For generation tasks, painted text images serve as visual conditions that guide realistic and semantically aligned image synthesis. Captioning and text-to-image generation thus become different directions of the same underlying visual translation process. At the model level, we instantiate a single Unified Diffusion Transformer trained with rectified flow in pixel space. A shared backbone jointly learns bidirectional mappings between natural images and painted text images, with lightweight task embeddings to specify the desired direction. Experiments on text-to-image synthesis and image-to-text understanding demonstrate strong cross-modal alignment and emergent controllability such as cycle-consistent image-caption-image loops. Our initial exploration suggests that unifying model, tasks, and representations in a single visual space is a promising paradigm for general-purpose multimodal intelligence.

*Chaoran Xu,Chengkan Lv,Qiyu Chen,Yunkang Cao,Feng Zhang,Zhengtao Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Delta-Denoising (DeltaDeno), a zero-shot method for anomaly generation without using real anomaly samples or training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Anomaly generation methods often require few-shot fine-tuning with anomalous samples, which contradicts the motivation of scarcity for real anomaly samples and tends to overfit.

Method: DeltaDeno uses a contrastive mechanism with two diffusion branches to edit defects without any real anomaly data. Localization maps guide defect generation, while token-level prompt refinement and attention bias enhance stability and control.

Result: DeltaDeno demonstrates effective anomaly generation, improved realism, and boosts anomaly detection performance in experiments.

Conclusion: DeltaDeno is a novel training-free approach to anomaly generation, successfully overcoming limitations of scarcity and enhancing detection capabilities. The code will be shared publicly.

Abstract: Anomaly generation is often framed as few-shot fine-tuning with anomalous samples, which contradicts the scarcity that motivates generation and tends to overfit category priors. We tackle the setting where no real anomaly samples or training are available. We propose Delta-Denoising (DeltaDeno), a training-free zero-shot anomaly generation method that localizes and edits defects by contrasting two diffusion branches driven by a minimal prompt pair under a shared schedule. By accumulating per-step denoising deltas into an image-specific localization map, we obtain a mask to guide the latent inpainting during later diffusion steps and preserve the surrounding context while generating realistic local defects. To improve stability and control, DeltaDeno performs token-level prompt refinement that aligns shared content and strengthens anomaly tokens, and applies a spatial attention bias restricted to anomaly tokens in the predicted region. Experiments on public datasets show that DeltaDeno achieves great generation, realism and consistent gains in downstream detection performance. Code will be made publicly available.

Method: The authors propose DGAF-VSR, which integrates an Optical Guided Warping Module (OGWM) for preserving high-frequency details and a Feature-wise Temporal Condition Module (FTCM) for dense guidance in the feature domain.

Result: DGAF-VSR outperforms state-of-the-art methods in perceptual quality (35.82% DISTS reduction), fidelity (0.20 dB PSNR gain), and temporal consistency (30.37% tLPIPS reduction) based on experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: Focusing on feature domain compensation and improving alignment with high-frequency preservation, DGAF-VSR establishes a new benchmark in VSR performance across perceptual quality, fidelity, and temporal consistency.

Abstract: Diffusion model (DM) based Video Super-Resolution (VSR) approaches achieve impressive perceptual quality. However, they suffer from error accumulation, spatial artifacts, and a trade-off between perceptual quality and fidelity, primarily caused by inaccurate alignment and insufficient compensation between video frames. In this paper, within the DM-based VSR pipeline, we revisit the role of alignment and compensation between adjacent video frames and reveal two crucial observations: (a) the feature domain is better suited than the pixel domain for information compensation due to its stronger spatial and temporal correlations, and (b) warping at an upscaled resolution better preserves high-frequency information, but this benefit is not necessarily monotonic. Therefore, we propose a novel Densely Guided diffusion model with Aligned Features for Video Super-Resolution (DGAF-VSR), with an Optical Guided Warping Module (OGWM) to maintain high-frequency details in the aligned features and a Feature-wise Temporal Condition Module (FTCM) to deliver dense guidance in the feature domain. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that DGAF-VSR surpasses state-of-the-art methods in key aspects of VSR, including perceptual quality (35.82\% DISTS reduction), fidelity (0.20 dB PSNR gain), and temporal consistency (30.37\% tLPIPS reduction).

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces OmniGround, a new benchmark for Spatio-Temporal Video Grounding (STVG) with diverse, real-world scenarios and proposes novel frameworks for annotation and evaluation to solve current limitations, leading to significant performance improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations of current models in handling real-world STVG scenarios involving diverse objects, complex reasoning, and better linguistic robustness due to constrained benchmarks with biases.

Method: The authors propose OmniGround, a large and comprehensive dataset with high-quality realistic annotations, using a Forward-Backward-Refinement pipeline for data labeling and a systematic evaluation framework, DeepSTG. They also introduce PG-TAF, a training-free two-stage framework for improved STVG.

Result: PG-TAF demonstrated significant performance improvement, showing a 25.6% increase in temporal IoU and 35.6% in video IoU on the new OmniGround dataset. Consistent enhancements were observed across four benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: The study identifies critical gaps in existing STVG methods due to incomplete benchmarks and proposes OmniGround along with new evaluation and grounding frameworks, achieving improved results and facilitating advancements in the STVG field.

Abstract: Spatio-Temporal Video Grounding (STVG) aims to localize target objects in videos based on natural language descriptions. Despite recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models, a significant gap remains between current models and real-world demands involving diverse objects and complex queries. We attribute this to limited benchmark scope, causing models to exhibit category bias, oversimplified reasoning, and poor linguistic robustness. To address these limitations, we introduce OmniGround, a comprehensive benchmark with 3,475 videos spanning 81 categories and complex real-world queries. We propose the Forward-Backward-Refinement annotation pipeline that combines multi-directional tracking with intelligent error correction for high-quality labels. We further introduce DeepSTG, a systematic evaluation framework quantifying dataset quality across four complementary dimensions beyond superficial statistics. Evaluations reveal performance average drop of 10.4% on complex real-world scenes, particularly with small/occluded objects and intricate spatial relations. Motivated by these, we propose PG-TAF, a training-free two-stage framework decomposing STVG into high-level temporal grounding and fine-grained spatio-temporal propagation. Experiments demonstrate PG-TAF achieves 25.6% and 35.6% improvements in m\_tIoU and m\_vIoU on OmniGround with consistent gains across four benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MultiPriv benchmark evaluates reasoning-based privacy risks in Vision-Language Models (VLMs), addressing systemic vulnerabilities in privacy inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Assess current Vision-Language Models (VLMs) privacy risks, particularly reasoning-based risks that surpass simple attribute perception.

Method: MultiPriv introduces Privacy Perception and Reasoning (PPR) framework and a unique bilingual multimodal dataset with synthetic individual profiles for nine privacy evaluation tasks.

Result: Evaluation of over 50 VLMs reveals reasoning-based privacy risks, poor predictability from perception-level metrics, and inconsistencies in existing safety measures.

Conclusion: MultiPriv highlights systemic vulnerabilities and provides a robust framework for enhancing privacy preservation in VLMs.

Abstract: Modern Vision-Language Models (VLMs) demonstrate sophisticated reasoning, escalating privacy risks beyond simple attribute perception to individual-level linkage. Current privacy benchmarks are structurally insufficient for this new threat, as they primarily evaluate privacy perception while failing to address the more critical risk of privacy reasoning: a VLM's ability to infer and link distributed information to construct individual profiles. To address this critical gap, we propose \textbf{MultiPriv}, the first benchmark designed to systematically evaluate individual-level privacy reasoning in VLMs. We introduce the \textbf{Privacy Perception and Reasoning (PPR)} framework and construct a novel, bilingual multimodal dataset to support it. The dataset uniquely features a core component of synthetic individual profiles where identifiers (e.g., faces, names) are meticulously linked to sensitive attributes. This design enables nine challenging tasks evaluating the full PPR spectrum, from attribute detection to cross-image re-identification and chained inference. We conduct a large-scale evaluation of over 50 foundational and commercial VLMs. Our analysis reveals: (1) Many VLMs possess significant, unmeasured reasoning-based privacy risks. (2) Perception-level metrics are poor predictors of these reasoning risks, revealing a critical evaluation gap. (3) Existing safety alignments are inconsistent and ineffective against such reasoning-based attacks. MultiPriv exposes systemic vulnerabilities and provides the necessary framework for developing robust, privacy-preserving VLMs.

TL;DR: This paper presents an implicit neural representation (INR) framework to improve dynamic magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) reconstructions by jointly modeling image sequences and motions without prior flow estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this study is to address the challenges in dMRI reconstruction, such as limited sampling and motion-induced artifacts, which degrade quality, particularly when conventional methods use inaccurate pre-estimated optical flow.

Method: The method involves two coupled INR frameworks: one for parameterizing spatiotemporal image content, and another for optical flow. These are synchronized through a physics-based regularization using the optical flow equation and k-space data consistency loss.

Result: The results show that this framework outperforms motion-compensated as well as deep learning approaches, delivering higher reconstruction quality, accurate motion fields, and better temporal fidelity.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that joint modeling of motion and dynamics with flow-based regularization can significantly enhance dMRI reconstruction quality and functionality.

Abstract: Dynamic magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) captures temporally-resolved anatomy but is often challenged by limited sampling and motion-induced artifacts. Conventional motion-compensated reconstructions typically rely on pre-estimated optical flow, which is inaccurate under undersampling and degrades reconstruction quality. In this work, we propose a novel implicit neural representation (INR) framework that jointly models both the dynamic image sequence and its underlying motion field. Specifically, one INR is employed to parameterize the spatiotemporal image content, while another INR represents the optical flow. The two are coupled via the optical flow equation, which serves as a physics-inspired regularization, in addition to a data consistency loss that enforces agreement with k-space measurements. This joint optimization enables simultaneous recovery of temporally coherent images and motion fields without requiring prior flow estimation. Experiments on dynamic cardiac MRI datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art motion-compensated and deep learning approaches, achieving superior reconstruction quality, accurate motion estimation, and improved temporal fidelity. These results highlight the potential of implicit joint modeling with flow-regularized constraints for advancing dMRI reconstruction.

TL;DR: The paper introduces FingerCap, a system for generating detailed finger-level captions for hand motions, supported by a new dataset and evaluation rubric. A novel FiGOP technique addresses limitations in current video models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding detailed finger-level hand motions is crucial for visual perception, intelligence, and communication, yet lacking in existing systems.

Method: The study develops FingerCap, supported by the FingerCap-40K dataset, utilizes HandJudge for evaluation, and proposes FiGOP to capture detailed finger dynamics efficiently.

Result: Experiments on FingerCap-40K reveal challenges in existing models for finger-level reasoning, but the FiGOP-enhanced approach delivers improvements in accuracy and evaluation scores.

Conclusion: FiGOP provides an effective solution to temporal sparsity issues, enhancing fine-grained motion reasoning and captioning abilities for human hand motion analysis.

Abstract: Understanding fine-grained human hand motion is fundamental to visual perception, embodied intelligence, and multimodal communication. In this work, we propose Fine-grained Finger-level Hand Motion Captioning (FingerCap), which aims to generate textual descriptions that capture detailed finger-level semantics of hand actions. To support this task, we curate FingerCap-40K, a large-scale corpus of 40K paired hand-motion videos and captions spanning two complementary sources: concise instruction-style finger motions and diverse, naturalistic hand-object interactions. To enable effective evaluation, we employ HandJudge, a LLM-based rubric that measures finger-level correctness and motion completeness. Temporal sparsity remains a fundamental bottleneck for current Video-MLLMs, since sparse RGB sampling is insufficient to capture the subtle, high-frequency dynamics underlying fine finger motions. As a simple and compute-friendly remedy, we introduce FiGOP (Finger Group-of-Pictures), which pairs each RGB keyframe with subsequent hand keypoints until the next keyframe. A lightweight temporal encoder converts the keypoints into motion embeddings and integrates them with RGB features. FiGOP adapts the classic GOP concept to finger motion, recovering fine temporal cues without increasing RGB density. Experiments on FingerCap-40K show that strong open- and closed-source Video-MLLMs still struggle with finger-level reasoning, while our FiGOP-augmented model yield consistent gains under HandJudge and human studies.

### [95] [Point-Supervised Facial Expression Spotting with Gaussian-Based Instance-Adaptive Intensity Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16952)
*Yicheng Deng,Hideaki Hayashi,Hajime Nagahara*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a two-branch framework for point-supervised facial expression spotting (P-FES), leveraging Gaussian-based intensity modeling for better pseudo-labeling and intensity-aware contrastive loss for enhanced feature learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current facial expression spotting methods heavily rely on fully-supervised learning, which requires costly and time-consuming annotations, motivating the exploration of point-supervised methods.

Method: A novel framework using (1) Gaussian-based instance-adaptive intensity modeling (GIM) for soft pseudo-labeling and (2) a class-aware apex classification branch for distinguishing macro- and micro-expressions. Additionally, an intensity-aware contrastive loss is introduced to improve feature learning.

Result: The proposed framework demonstrates strong performance in spotting facial expressions and distinguishing between macro- and micro-expressions on the SAMM-LV, CAS(ME)^2, and CAS(ME)^3 datasets.

Conclusion: The framework effectively reduces annotation costs while maintaining reliable expression spotting and classification, making it an efficient and practical solution for facial expression analysis.

Abstract: Automatic facial expression spotting, which aims to identify facial expression instances in untrimmed videos, is crucial for facial expression analysis. Existing methods primarily focus on fully-supervised learning and rely on costly, time-consuming temporal boundary annotations. In this paper, we investigate point-supervised facial expression spotting (P-FES), where only a single timestamp annotation per instance is required for training. We propose a unique two-branch framework for P-FES. First, to mitigate the limitation of hard pseudo-labeling, which often confuses neutral and expression frames with various intensities, we propose a Gaussian-based instance-adaptive intensity modeling (GIM) module to model instance-level expression intensity distribution for soft pseudo-labeling. By detecting the pseudo-apex frame around each point label, estimating the duration, and constructing an instance-level Gaussian distribution, GIM assigns soft pseudo-labels to expression frames for more reliable intensity supervision. The GIM module is incorporated into our framework to optimize the class-agnostic expression intensity branch. Second, we design a class-aware apex classification branch that distinguishes macro- and micro-expressions solely based on their pseudo-apex frames. During inference, the two branches work independently: the class-agnostic expression intensity branch generates expression proposals, while the class-aware apex-classification branch is responsible for macro- and micro-expression classification.Furthermore, we introduce an intensity-aware contrastive loss to enhance discriminative feature learning and suppress neutral noise by contrasting neutral frames with expression frames with various intensities. Extensive experiments on the SAMM-LV, CAS(ME)$^2$, and CAS(ME)$^3$ datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Neighbor GRPO, a new technique for aligning deterministic flow matching models with human preferences, avoiding issues with SDE-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome inefficiencies and compatibility issues in SED-based GRPO methods for aligning generative models, especially flow matching models.

Method: Neighbor GRPO uses ODE-based perturbations for candidate trajectory diversity and optimizes through a softmax distance-based surrogate policy, avoiding the stochastic SDE framework.

Result: Neighbor GRPO demonstrates superior efficiency, faster convergence, and better quality compared to existing SDE-based GRPO approaches.

Conclusion: The novel approach preserves ODE sampling benefits while optimizing alignment effectively, making it both cost-efficient and high-performing.

Abstract: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has shown promise in aligning image and video generative models with human preferences. However, applying it to modern flow matching models is challenging because of its deterministic sampling paradigm. Current methods address this issue by converting Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) to Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs), which introduce stochasticity. However, this SDE-based GRPO suffers from issues of inefficient credit assignment and incompatibility with high-order solvers for fewer-step sampling. In this paper, we first reinterpret existing SDE-based GRPO methods from a distance optimization perspective, revealing their underlying mechanism as a form of contrastive learning. Based on this insight, we propose Neighbor GRPO, a novel alignment algorithm that completely bypasses the need for SDEs. Neighbor GRPO generates a diverse set of candidate trajectories by perturbing the initial noise conditions of the ODE and optimizes the model using a softmax distance-based surrogate leaping policy. We establish a theoretical connection between this distance-based objective and policy gradient optimization, rigorously integrating our approach into the GRPO framework. Our method fully preserves the advantages of deterministic ODE sampling, including efficiency and compatibility with high-order solvers. We further introduce symmetric anchor sampling for computational efficiency and group-wise quasi-norm reweighting to address reward flattening. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Neighbor GRPO significantly outperforms SDE-based counterparts in terms of training cost, convergence speed, and generation quality.

TL;DR: The paper introduces MatPedia, a model that bridges the gap between natural image appearance and physically-based rendering (PBR) material properties to improve material synthesis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of creating photorealistic PBR materials, which is a labor-intensive process requiring specialized expertise. Current methods lack a unified representation that integrates natural image appearance and PBR attributes, limiting their efficiency and scalability.

Method: MatPedia uses a novel joint representation that encodes materials into two correlated latents: one for RGB appearance and another for PBR properties. It formulates these features as a 5-frame sequence and adopts video diffusion models to capture their correlations and leverage RGB generation capabilities.

Result: The model enables multiple tasks like text-to-material generation, image-to-material generation, and intrinsic decomposition within a single framework. Trained on a large-scale dataset (MatHybrid-410K), it achieves high-quality native $1024×1024$ synthesis, outperforming existing methods in quality and diversity.

Conclusion: MatPedia introduces a unified framework for PBR material generation that integrates visual priors from RGB images and achieves superior performance across various material synthesis tasks.

Abstract: Physically-based rendering (PBR) materials are fundamental to photorealistic graphics, yet their creation remains labor-intensive and requires specialized expertise. While generative models have advanced material synthesis, existing methods lack a unified representation bridging natural image appearance and PBR properties, leading to fragmented task-specific pipelines and inability to leverage large-scale RGB image data. We present MatPedia, a foundation model built upon a novel joint RGB-PBR representation that compactly encodes materials into two interdependent latents: one for RGB appearance and one for the four PBR maps encoding complementary physical properties. By formulating them as a 5-frame sequence and employing video diffusion architectures, MatPedia naturally captures their correlations while transferring visual priors from RGB generation models. This joint representation enables a unified framework handling multiple material tasks--text-to-material generation, image-to-material generation, and intrinsic decomposition--within a single architecture. Trained on MatHybrid-410K, a mixed corpus combining PBR datasets with large-scale RGB images, MatPedia achieves native $1024\times1024$ synthesis that substantially surpasses existing approaches in both quality and diversity.

TL;DR: The paper addresses blind single image super-resolution (SISR) by proposing a Dual Branch Degradation Extractor Network capable of addressing unknown degradation types, including blur and noise, and achieves state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current SISR methods struggle with unknown and variable degradation deviations from fixed assumptions, leading to performance drops, necessitating a method capable of handling diverse degradation scenarios.

Method: The authors propose a Dual Branch Degradation Extractor Network that predicts two unsupervised embeddings (blurry and noisy degradation) and adapts an SR network to these embeddings differently. The degradation extractor is also treated as a regularizer to exploit differences between super-resolved and high-resolution images.

Result: Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks show that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance for the blind super-resolution (SR) problem.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively handles blind SR by explicitly addressing blur and noise degradations, demonstrating its robustness and superior performance across diverse conditions.

Abstract: Previous methods have demonstrated remarkable performance in single image super-resolution (SISR) tasks with known and fixed degradation (e.g., bicubic downsampling). However, when the actual degradation deviates from these assumptions, these methods may experience significant declines in performance. In this paper, we propose a Dual Branch Degradation Extractor Network to address the blind SR problem. While some blind SR methods assume noise-free degradation and others do not explicitly consider the presence of noise in the degradation model, our approach predicts two unsupervised degradation embeddings that represent blurry and noisy information. The SR network can then be adapted to blur embedding and noise embedding in distinct ways. Furthermore, we treat the degradation extractor as a regularizer to capitalize on differences between SR and HR images. Extensive experiments on several benchmarks demonstrate our method achieves SOTA performance in the blind SR problem.

Motivation: Current 3D reconstruction systems face challenges such as drift and inefficient, redundant maps, limiting their performance and utility for tasks like novel view synthesis.

Method: The framework builds locally consistent submaps and combines them into a compact global Gaussian map that optimizes scene geometry and camera poses, maintaining cross-view geometric consistency.

Result: SING3R-SLAM achieves state-of-the-art performance in tracking, 3D reconstruction, and novel view rendering, with a 12% improvement in tracking and producing detailed, compact representations.

Conclusion: The proposed SING3R-SLAM framework demonstrates efficiency in 3D mapping, robustness in tracking, and high-quality outputs, making it suitable for real-world applications and multiple downstream tasks.

Abstract: Recent advances in dense 3D reconstruction enable the accurate capture of local geometry; however, integrating them into SLAM is challenging due to drift and redundant point maps, which limit efficiency and downstream tasks, such as novel view synthesis. To address these issues, we propose SING3R-SLAM, a globally consistent and compact Gaussian-based dense RGB SLAM framework. The key idea is to combine locally consistent 3D reconstructions with a unified global Gaussian representation that jointly refines scene geometry and camera poses, enabling efficient and versatile 3D mapping for multiple downstream applications. SING3R-SLAM first builds locally consistent submaps through our lightweight tracking and reconstruction module, and then progressively aligns and fuses them into a global Gaussian map that enforces cross-view geometric consistency. This global map, in turn, provides feedback to correct local drift and enhance the robustness of tracking. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SING3R-SLAM achieves state-of-the-art tracking, 3D reconstruction, and novel view rendering, resulting in over 12% improvement in tracking and producing finer, more detailed geometry, all while maintaining a compact and memory-efficient global representation on real-world datasets.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to address the challenge of generating realistic cooked food images on edge devices, overcoming the limitations of existing resource-intensive or unrealistic generative models.

Method: The authors present a new dataset of cooking progression with annotations, propose a recipe- and state-guided image generator, and introduce a Culinary Image Similarity (CIS) metric to ensure temporal consistency and assess culinary plausibility.

Result: The proposed model demonstrated improved performance, significantly reducing FID scores—by 30% on the new dataset and 60% on public datasets—compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The study provides a novel approach to synthesize realistic food images using an edge-efficient model, a culinary-specific evaluation metric, and a unique dataset, offering a pathway for user-preferred visual output generation.

Abstract: Synthesizing realistic cooked food images from raw inputs on edge devices is a challenging generative task, requiring models to capture complex changes in texture, color and structure during cooking. Existing image-to-image generation methods often produce unrealistic results or are too resource-intensive for edge deployment. We introduce the first oven-based cooking-progression dataset with chef-annotated doneness levels and propose an edge-efficient recipe and cooking state guided generator that synthesizes realistic food images conditioned on raw food image. This formulation enables user-preferred visual targets rather than fixed presets. To ensure temporal consistency and culinary plausibility, we introduce a domain-specific \textit{Culinary Image Similarity (CIS)} metric, which serves both as a training loss and a progress-monitoring signal. Our model outperforms existing baselines with significant reductions in FID scores (30\% improvement on our dataset; 60\% on public datasets)

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of learning 3D scene geometry and semantics in a scalable and precise manner without requiring prohibitively expensive large-scale 3D annotations, which is critical for autonomous driving.

Method: The method, QueryOcc, employs self-supervised 4D query-based learning across space and time, leveraging either pseudo-point clouds from vision models or raw lidar data for supervision. It incorporates a novel contractive scene representation for efficient, long-range reasoning.

Result: QueryOcc outperforms previous camera-based approaches by 26% in semantic RayIoU on the Occ3D-nuScenes benchmark, while maintaining real-time operation at 11.6 FPS.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that direct 4D query supervision significantly strengthens self-supervised 3D semantic learning, making it suitable for applications like autonomous driving.

Abstract: Learning 3D scene geometry and semantics from images is a core challenge in computer vision and a key capability for autonomous driving. Since large-scale 3D annotation is prohibitively expensive, recent work explores self-supervised learning directly from sensor data without manual labels. Existing approaches either rely on 2D rendering consistency, where 3D structure emerges only implicitly, or on discretized voxel grids from accumulated lidar point clouds, limiting spatial precision and scalability. We introduce QueryOcc, a query-based self-supervised framework that learns continuous 3D semantic occupancy directly through independent 4D spatio-temporal queries sampled across adjacent frames. The framework supports supervision from either pseudo-point clouds derived from vision foundation models or raw lidar data. To enable long-range supervision and reasoning under constant memory, we introduce a contractive scene representation that preserves near-field detail while smoothly compressing distant regions. QueryOcc surpasses previous camera-based methods by 26% in semantic RayIoU on the self-supervised Occ3D-nuScenes benchmark while running at 11.6 FPS, demonstrating that direct 4D query supervision enables strong self-supervised occupancy learning. https://research.zenseact.com/publications/queryocc/

TL;DR: This paper introduces SeeCLIP, a Semantic-enhanced CLIP framework, to address Open-Set Domain Generalization by enhancing fine-grained semantic processing and using duplex contrastive learning to manage unknowns effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to handle the realistic situation in Open-Set Domain Generalization where models encounter domain shifts and unexpected object categories while avoiding over-confidence and dealing with challenging unknown classes.

Method: SeeCLIP incorporates a semantic-aware prompt enhancement module for richer semantic alignment, a duplex contrastive learning approach for balancing separability and semantic proximity for unknowns, and a semantic-guided diffusion module to generate pseudo-unknown samples to refine decision boundaries.

Result: SeeCLIP achieves consistent improvements of 3% in accuracy and 5% in the H-score compared to current state-of-the-art methods across five benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: The SeeCLIP framework effectively addresses both structural risk and open-space risk, achieving improved generalization and recognition of novel categories.

Abstract: Open-Set Domain Generalization (OSDG) tackles the realistic scenario where deployed models encounter both domain shifts and novel object categories. Despite impressive progress with vision-language models like CLIP, existing methods still fall into the dilemma between structural risk of known-classes and open-space risk from unknown-classes, and easily suffers from over-confidence, especially when distinguishing ``hard unknowns" that share fine-grained visual similarities with known classes. To this end, we propose a Semantic-enhanced CLIP (SeeCLIP) framework that explicitly addresses this dilemma through fine-grained semantic enhancement. In SeeCLIP, we propose a semantic-aware prompt enhancement module to decompose images into discriminative semantic tokens, enabling nuanced vision-language alignment beyond coarse category labels. To position unknown prompts effectively, we introduce duplex contrastive learning with complementary objectives, that is, repulsion to maintain separability from known classes, and cohesion to preserve semantic proximity. Further, our semantic-guided diffusion module synthesizes pseudo-unknowns by perturbing extracted semantic tokens, generating challenging samples that are visually similar to known classes yet exhibit key local differences. These hard negatives force the model to learn finer decision boundaries. Extensive experiments across five benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements of 3% accuracy and 5% H-score over state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The proposed method significantly boosts rendering quality while simultaneously reducing storage and computational costs, establishing state-of-the-art performance in compact 3DGS.

Abstract: 3DGS employs a large number of Gaussian primitives to fit scenes, resulting in substantial storage and computational overhead. Existing pruning methods rely on manually designed criteria or introduce additional learnable parameters, yielding suboptimal results. To address this, we propose an natural selection inspired pruning framework that models survival pressure as a regularization gradient field applied to opacity, allowing the optimization gradients--driven by the goal of maximizing rendering quality--to autonomously determine which Gaussians to retain or prune. This process is fully learnable and requires no human intervention. We further introduce an opacity decay technique with a finite opacity prior, which accelerates the selection process without compromising pruning effectiveness. Compared to 3DGS, our method achieves over 0.6 dB PSNR gain under 15\% budgets, establishing state-of-the-art performance for compact 3DGS. Project page https://xiaobin2001.github.io/GNS-web.

*Sai Nath Chowdary Medikonduru,Hongpeng Jin,Yanzhao Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The research highlights the development of the Synergistic Diversity framework (SQ metric) to improve plant disease detection using Deep Neural Network Ensembles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenges of accurate plant disease detection using Deep Neural Networks by improving the selection process for ensemble models, inspired by the global economic impact and food insecurity driven by plant diseases.

Method: The authors critically analyzed existing ensemble diversity metrics, identified limitations, introduced the SQ metric for synergistic evaluation of ensemble models, and validated their approach using extensive experiments on a plant leaf image dataset.

Result: The SQ metric was shown to outperform existing methods in ensemble selection, achieving improved accuracy in detecting plant diseases from leaf images.

Conclusion: The research demonstrates that the SQ framework can significantly enhance the accuracy and reliability of image-based plant disease detection, paving the way for better agricultural outcomes.

Abstract: Plant diseases pose a significant threat to global agriculture, causing over $220 billion in annual economic losses and jeopardizing food security. The timely and accurate detection of these diseases from plant leaf images is critical to mitigating their adverse effects. Deep neural network Ensembles (Deep Ensembles) have emerged as a powerful approach to enhancing prediction accuracy by leveraging the strengths of diverse Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). However, selecting high-performing ensemble member models is challenging due to the inherent difficulty in measuring ensemble diversity. In this paper, we introduce the Synergistic Diversity (SQ) framework to enhance plant disease detection accuracy. First, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of the limitations of existing ensemble diversity metrics (denoted as Q metrics), which often fail to identify optimal ensemble teams. Second, we present the SQ metric, a novel measure that captures the synergy between ensemble members and consistently aligns with ensemble accuracy. Third, we validate our SQ approach through extensive experiments on a plant leaf image dataset, which demonstrates that our SQ metric substantially improves ensemble selection and enhances detection accuracy. Our findings pave the way for a more reliable and efficient image-based plant disease detection.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RadioKMoE integrates Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) with Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) for precise radiomap estimation, leveraging physics-based modeling for improved accuracy and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Complex radio propagation behavior and environmental dynamics create challenges for accurate radiomap estimation.

Method: The framework combines KAN for coarse initial radiomap predictions with MoE network for detailed and accurate refinement, leveraging expert networks for diverse radiomap patterns.

Result: Experimental evaluations show improved accuracy and robustness in radiomap estimation across multi- and single-band scenarios.

Conclusion: RadioKMoE enhances radiomap prediction by combining physics-guided modeling with expert-driven refinement, addressing global and local dynamics effectively.

Abstract: Radiomap serves as a vital tool for wireless network management and deployment by providing powerful spatial knowledge of signal propagation and coverage. However, increasingly complex radio propagation behavior and surrounding environments pose strong challenges for radiomap estimation (RME). In this work, we propose a knowledge-guided RME framework that integrates Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) with Mixture-of-Experts (MoE), namely RadioKMoE. Specifically, we design a KAN module to predict an initial coarse coverage map, leveraging KAN's strength in approximating physics models and global radio propagation patterns. The initial coarse map, together with environmental information, drives our MoE network for precise radiomap estimation. Unlike conventional deep learning models, the MoE module comprises expert networks specializing in distinct radiomap patterns to improve local details while preserving global consistency. Experimental results in both multi- and single-band RME demonstrate the enhanced accuracy and robustness of the proposed RadioKMoE in radiomap estimation.

*Jonathan Skaza,Parsa Madinei,Ziqi Wen,Miguel Eckstein*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces DReX, a vision-only model combining attention-based self-supervised and convolutional features to predict image complexity, achieving state-of-the-art results without relying on multimodal approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding human perception of image complexity and improving tasks in computer vision while addressing whether linguistic data is essential for predicting visual complexity.

Method: The proposed DReX model fuses hierarchical features from ResNet-50 and semantic-rich representations from DINOv3 using a learnable attention mechanism to predict image complexity.

Result: DReX achieves superior performance in complexity prediction and robust generalization across datasets and metrics, surpassing multimodal models with significantly fewer parameters.

Conclusion: Visual features alone are sufficient for human-like complexity predictions, and combining self-supervised transformers with supervised CNNs offers synergistic benefits.

Abstract: Visual complexity prediction is a fundamental problem in computer vision with applications in image compression, retrieval, and classification. Understanding what makes humans perceive an image as complex is also a long-standing question in cognitive science. Recent approaches have leveraged multimodal models that combine visual and linguistic representations, but it remains unclear whether language information is necessary for this task. We propose DReX (DINO-ResNet Fusion), a vision-only model that fuses self-supervised and convolutional representations through a learnable attention mechanism to predict image complexity. Our architecture integrates multi-scale hierarchical features from ResNet-50 with semantically rich representations from DINOv3 ViT-S/16, enabling the model to capture both low-level texture patterns and high-level semantic structure. DReX achieves state-of-the-art performance on the IC9600 benchmark (Pearson r = 0.9581), surpassing previous methods--including those trained on multimodal image-text data--while using approximately 21.5x fewer learnable parameters. Furthermore, DReX generalizes robustly across multiple datasets and metrics, achieving superior results on Pearson and Spearman correlation, Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). Ablation and attention analyses confirm that DReX leverages complementary cues from both backbones, with the DINOv3 [CLS] token enhancing sensitivity to visual complexity. Our findings suggest that visual features alone can be sufficient for human-aligned complexity prediction and that, when properly fused, self-supervised transformers and supervised deep convolutional neural networks offer complementary and synergistic benefits for this task.

*Junhong Min,Jimin Kim,Cheol-Hui Min,Minwook Kim,Youngpil Jeon,Minyong Choi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DepthFocus introduces a steerable Vision Transformer for intent-driven control of stereo depth estimation, addressing multi-layered depth complexities in real-world scenes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of traditional depth estimation models that struggle with layered ambiguities created by transmissive materials, and to develop an active perception system mimicking human depth focus behavior.

Method: The paper proposes DepthFocus, a Vision Transformer conditioned on scalar depth preferences to actively focus and estimate depth in complex scenes. It utilizes a new 500k multi-layered synthetic dataset for training.

Result: DepthFocus achieves state-of-the-art performance on traditional benchmarks (e.g., BOOSTER) and excels in intent-aligned estimation on newly proposed multi-depth datasets, showcasing robustness and generalization for real-world see-through scenes.

Conclusion: DepthFocus represents a shift toward active, human-like 3D perception, demonstrating its ability to handle complex, layered depth ambiguities and successfully generalize to novel scenarios.

Abstract: Depth in the real world is rarely singular. Transmissive materials create layered ambiguities that confound conventional perception systems. Existing models remain passive, attempting to estimate static depth maps anchored to the nearest surface, while humans actively shift focus to perceive a desired depth. We introduce DepthFocus, a steerable Vision Transformer that redefines stereo depth estimation as intent-driven control. Conditioned on a scalar depth preference, the model dynamically adapts its computation to focus on the intended depth, enabling selective perception within complex scenes. The training primarily leverages our newly constructed 500k multi-layered synthetic dataset, designed to capture diverse see-through effects. DepthFocus not only achieves state-of-the-art performance on conventional single-depth benchmarks like BOOSTER, a dataset notably rich in transparent and reflective objects, but also quantitatively demonstrates intent-aligned estimation on our newly proposed real and synthetic multi-depth datasets. Moreover, it exhibits strong generalization capabilities on unseen see-through scenes, underscoring its robustness as a significant step toward active and human-like 3D perception.

*Qianyi Shao,Yuanfan Zhang,Renxiang Xiao,Liang Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MVLR, a model designed to restore images degraded by adverse weather conditions, outperforming other models in benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve image restoration performance under diverse and severe weather conditions for autonomous systems.

Method: MVLR uses a lightweight encoder-decoder, Visual-Language Model (VLM) for degradation priors, and Implicit Memory Bank (IMB) for retrieving prototypes. Dynamic cross-attention mechanisms combine these to boost restoration accuracy.

Result: MVLR achieves higher PSNR and SSIM metrics over baselines in benchmarks of severe-weather scenarios.

Conclusion: MVLR strikes a balance between compactness and expressiveness, proving effective for real-time deployment in adverse outdoor conditions.

Abstract: Reliable visual perception under adverse weather conditions, such as rain, haze, snow, or a mixture of them, is desirable yet challenging for autonomous driving and outdoor robots. In this paper, we propose a unified Memory-Enhanced Visual-Language Recovery (MVLR) model that restores images from different degradation levels under various weather conditions. MVLR couples a lightweight encoder-decoder backbone with a Visual-Language Model (VLM) and an Implicit Memory Bank (IMB). The VLM performs chain-of-thought inference to encode weather degradation priors and the IMB stores continuous latent representations of degradation patterns. The VLM-generated priors query the IMB to retrieve fine-grained degradation prototypes. These prototypes are then adaptively fused with multi-scale visual features via dynamic cross-attention mechanisms, enhancing restoration accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency. Extensive experiments on four severe-weather benchmarks show that MVLR surpasses single-branch and Mixture-of-Experts baselines in terms of Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM). These results indicate that MVLR offers a practical balance between model compactness and expressiveness for real-time deployment in diverse outdoor conditions.

*Patrick Amadeus Irawan,Ikhlasul Akmal Hanif,Muhammad Dehan Al Kautsar,Genta Indra Winata,Fajri Koto,Alham Fikri Aji*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper identifies an issue in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) where their performance heavily drops when presented with multiple cultural cues in images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of evaluations testing VLMs' robustness to multiple cultural cues and improve their performance in multicultural contexts.

Method: The authors introduce ConfusedTourist, a tool designed to test VLMs by presenting them with perturbed cultural and geographical inputs, employing experiments with stacked images and image generation techniques.

Result: The study shows that even state-of-the-art VLMs experience significant accuracy drops due to attention shifts when faced with mixed cultural cues.

Conclusion: VLMs need to be developed with better cultural robustness to handle complex multicultural scenarios, as the current state is vulnerable to diverse visual cultural inputs.

Abstract: Although the cultural dimension has been one of the key aspects in evaluating Vision-Language Models (VLMs), their ability to remain stable across diverse cultural inputs remains largely untested, despite being crucial to support diversity and multicultural societies. Existing evaluations often rely on benchmarks featuring only a singular cultural concept per image, overlooking scenarios where multiple, potentially unrelated cultural cues coexist. To address this gap, we introduce ConfusedTourist, a novel cultural adversarial robustness suite designed to assess VLMs' stability against perturbed geographical cues. Our experiments reveal a critical vulnerability, where accuracy drops heavily under simple image-stacking perturbations and even worsens with its image-generation-based variant. Interpretability analyses further show that these failures stem from systematic attention shifts toward distracting cues, diverting the model from its intended focus. These findings highlight a critical challenge: visual cultural concept mixing can substantially impair even state-of-the-art VLMs, underscoring the urgent need for more culturally robust multimodal understanding.

TL;DR: The paper introduces FLUID, a training-free framework for face de-identification in latent space using pretrained diffusion models, providing better identity suppression and attribute preservation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhance face de-identification processes with improved identity suppression while retaining utility and semantic attributes, addressing limitations of existing methods.

Method: The method involves utilizing latent space identity substitution on pretrained diffusion models, with optimization guided by novel reagent losses and implementing linear/geodesic editing techniques.

Result: FLUID demonstrated superior identity suppression and attribute preservation compared to state-of-the-art methods on CelebA-HQ and FFHQ datasets, confirmed by qualitative and quantitative evaluations.

Conclusion: FLUID effectively improves face de-identification by leveraging pre-trained diffusion models, offering enhanced trade-offs between identity suppression and attribute retention.

Abstract: We present FLUID (Face de-identification in the Latent space via Utility-preserving Identity Displacement), a training-free framework that directly substitutes identity in the latent space of pretrained diffusion models. Inspired by substitution mechanisms in chemistry, we reinterpret identity editing as semantic displacement in the latent h-space of a pretrained unconditional diffusion model. Our framework discovers identity-editing directions through optimization guided by novel reagent losses, which supervise for attribute preservation and identity suppression. We further propose both linear and geodesic (tangent-based) editing schemes to effectively navigate the latent manifold. Experimental results on CelebA-HQ and FFHQ demonstrate that FLUID achieves a superior trade-off between identity suppression and attribute preservation, outperforming state-of-the-art de-identification methods in both qualitative and quantitative metrics.

*Lingyan Ruan,Bin Chen,Taehyun Rhee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new method to estimate lens blur from RGB images for better integration of 3D objects into real scenes. It avoids the need for scene depth or camera parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Blending 3D virtual objects into real-life scenes with convincing lens blur is challenging, requiring depth and camera data that is often inaccessible to ordinary users.

Method: The authors propose directly estimating the circle of confusion (CoC) map from RGB images and use a neural reblurring network to render realistic lens blur for 3D object compositing.

Result: The proposed method achieves superior visual fidelity and realistic defocus effects, outperforming existing techniques in evaluations.

Conclusion: This method simplifies the process of achieving realistic 3D object integration in mixed reality, making it more flexible and accessible without camera metadata or depth inputs.

Abstract: Consistent and natural camera lens blur is important for seamlessly blending 3D virtual objects into photographed real-scenes. Since lens blur typically varies with scene depth, the placement of virtual objects and their corresponding blur levels significantly affect the visual fidelity of mixed reality compositions. Existing pipelines often rely on camera parameters (e.g., focal length, focus distance, aperture size) and scene depth to compute the circle of confusion (CoC) for realistic lens blur rendering. However, such information is often unavailable to ordinary users, limiting the accessibility and generalizability of these methods. In this work, we propose a novel compositing approach that directly estimates the CoC map from RGB images, bypassing the need for scene depth or camera metadata. The CoC values for virtual objects are inferred through a linear relationship between its signed CoC map and depth, and realistic lens blur is rendered using a neural reblurring network. Our method provides flexible and practical solution for real-world applications. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves high-fidelity compositing with realistic defocus effects, outperforming state-of-the-art techniques in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations.

Result: The CrossAttention mechanism significantly improves trajectory prediction results compared to traditional feature concatenation, showcasing the dataset's potential for advancing research in sports analytics.

Conclusion: RacketVision is a valuable resource for studying dynamic object tracking and multimodal analysis in sports, with potential to drive innovative research in the field.

Abstract: We introduce RacketVision, a novel dataset and benchmark for advancing computer vision in sports analytics, covering table tennis, tennis, and badminton. The dataset is the first to provide large-scale, fine-grained annotations for racket pose alongside traditional ball positions, enabling research into complex human-object interactions. It is designed to tackle three interconnected tasks: fine-grained ball tracking, articulated racket pose estimation, and predictive ball trajectory forecasting. Our evaluation of established baselines reveals a critical insight for multi-modal fusion: while naively concatenating racket pose features degrades performance, a CrossAttention mechanism is essential to unlock their value, leading to trajectory prediction results that surpass strong unimodal baselines. RacketVision provides a versatile resource and a strong starting point for future research in dynamic object tracking, conditional motion forecasting, and multimodal analysis in sports.

TL;DR: This paper presents RoomPlanner, a fully automatic framework to generate 3D indoor scenes from short text inputs, featuring innovations for spatial optimization and rendering efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to simplify and automate the creation of realistic 3D room layouts, eliminating the need for manual intervention or image guidance and addressing limitations of existing methods.

Method: RoomPlanner uses hierarchical language-driven planners to interpret text prompts into detailed scene descriptions, followed by spatial optimization constraints and innovative rendering strategies (AnyReach Sampling and ITFS).

Result: The framework generates rational, collision-free, and editable 3D room layouts within 30 minutes, outperforming previous methods in rendering speed and visual quality.

Conclusion: RoomPlanner advances 3D scene generation by providing a fast, efficient, and automated solution ideal for creating realistic and editable indoor environments from textual inputs.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose RoomPlanner, the first fully automatic 3D room generation framework for painlessly creating realistic indoor scenes with only short text as input. Without any manual layout design or panoramic image guidance, our framework can generate explicit layout criteria for rational spatial placement. We begin by introducing a hierarchical structure of language-driven agent planners that can automatically parse short and ambiguous prompts into detailed scene descriptions. These descriptions include raw spatial and semantic attributes for each object and the background, which are then used to initialize 3D point clouds. To position objects within bounded environments, we implement two arrangement constraints that iteratively optimize spatial arrangements, ensuring a collision-free and accessible layout solution. In the final rendering stage, we propose a novel AnyReach Sampling strategy for camera trajectory, along with the Interval Timestep Flow Sampling (ITFS) strategy, to efficiently optimize the coarse 3D Gaussian scene representation. These approaches help reduce the total generation time to under 30 minutes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method can produce geometrically rational 3D indoor scenes, surpassing prior approaches in both rendering speed and visual quality while preserving editability. The code will be available soon.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PathAgent uses a chain-of-thought approach to analyze WSIs, integrating visual cues and explicit reasoning to provide interpretable predictions, outperforming traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of explicit reasoning and transparency in computational pipelines for analyzing WSIs, aiming to emulate the logical steps pathologists use.

Method: PathAgent employs a training-free LLM-based framework with three modules: Navigator for locating regions, Perceptor for extracting visual cues, and Executor for forming a chain-of-thought reasoning.

Result: PathAgent demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization across five datasets, surpassing task-specific baselines and showing promise in collaborative evaluations with pathologists.

Conclusion: PathAgent is an effective, transparent, and clinically relevant diagnostic assistant, offering interpretable predictions grounded in explicit reasoning.

Abstract: Analyzing whole-slide images (WSIs) requires an iterative, evidence-driven reasoning process that parallels how pathologists dynamically zoom, refocus, and self-correct while collecting the evidence. However, existing computational pipelines often lack this explicit reasoning trajectory, resulting in inherently opaque and unjustifiable predictions. To bridge this gap, we present PathAgent, a training-free, large language model (LLM)-based agent framework that emulates the reflective, stepwise analytical approach of human experts. PathAgent can autonomously explore WSI, iteratively and precisely locating significant micro-regions using the Navigator module, extracting morphology visual cues using the Perceptor, and integrating these findings into the continuously evolving natural language trajectories in the Executor. The entire sequence of observations and decisions forms an explicit chain-of-thought, yielding fully interpretable predictions. Evaluated across five challenging datasets, PathAgent exhibits strong zero-shot generalization, surpassing task-specific baselines in both open-ended and constrained visual question-answering tasks. Moreover, a collaborative evaluation with human pathologists confirms PathAgent's promise as a transparent and clinically grounded diagnostic assistant.

*Teng Fu,Mengyang Zhao,Ke Niu,Kaixin Peng,Bin Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes OmniPT, a new unified pedestrian tracking framework that integrates tracking and semantic understanding using advanced training on LVLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the performance gap of LVLMs in instance-level tasks and enhance their abilities in semantic-level pedestrian tracking.

Method: The framework utilizes a four-phase training approach (RL-Mid Training-SFT-RL) to adapt and fine-tune LVLMs for pedestrian tracking tasks.

Result: Experimental results on benchmarks show OmniPT outperforms previous methods in tracking tasks.

Conclusion: OmniPT effectively transforms LVLM capabilities to excel in pedestrian tracking and semantic object understanding tasks.

Abstract: LVLMs have been shown to perform excellently in image-level tasks such as VQA and caption. However, in many instance-level tasks, such as visual grounding and object detection, LVLMs still show performance gaps compared to previous expert models. Meanwhile, although pedestrian tracking is a classical task, there have been a number of new topics in combining object tracking and natural language, such as Referring MOT, Cross-view Referring MOT, and Semantic MOT. These tasks emphasize that models should understand the tracked object at an advanced semantic level, which is exactly where LVLMs excel. In this paper, we propose a new unified Pedestrian Tracking framework, namely OmniPT, which can track, track based on reference and generate semantic understanding of tracked objects interactively. We address two issues: how to model the tracking task into a task that foundation models can perform, and how to make the model output formatted answers. To this end, we implement a training phase consisting of RL-Mid Training-SFT-RL. Based on the pre-trained weights of the LVLM, we first perform a simple RL phase to enable the model to output fixed and supervisable bounding box format. Subsequently, we conduct a mid-training phase using a large number of pedestrian-related datasets. Finally, we perform supervised fine-tuning on several pedestrian tracking datasets, and then carry out another RL phase to improve the model's tracking performance and enhance its ability to follow instructions. We conduct experiments on tracking benchmarks and the experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can perform better than the previous methods.

TL;DR: RL-AD-Net is a model-agnostic framework using reinforcement learning (RL) in latent space to refine point cloud completions, outperforming existing methods in consistency and adaptability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing point cloud completion models struggle with local geometric inconsistencies despite creating globally plausible shapes from partial inputs.

Method: RL-AD-Net refines point cloud completions using reinforcement learning in the latent space of a pretrained point autoencoder, along with a PointNN selector for ensuring geometric consistency and robustness.

Result: The model improves completion outputs across both training-style and random cropping settings using ShapeNetCore-2048 dataset, outperforming baseline networks in geometric fidelity consistently.

Conclusion: RL-AD-Net effectively enhances point cloud completions with a lightweight, generalizable, and modular refinement framework, supporting its application to various completion models without retraining.

Abstract: Recent point cloud completion models, including transformer-based, denoising-based, and other state-of-the-art approaches, generate globally plausible shapes from partial inputs but often leave local geometric inconsistencies. We propose RL-AD-Net, a reinforcement learning (RL) refinement framework that operates in the latent space of a pretrained point autoencoder. The autoencoder encodes completions into compact global feature vectors (GFVs), which are selectively adjusted by an RL agent to improve geometric fidelity. To ensure robustness, a lightweight non-parametric PointNN selector evaluates the geometric consistency of both the original completion and the RL-refined output, retaining the better reconstruction. When ground truth is available, both Chamfer Distance and geometric consistency metrics guide refinement. Training is performed separately per category, since the unsupervised and dynamic nature of RL makes convergence across highly diverse categories challenging. Nevertheless, the framework can be extended to multi-category refinement in future work. Experiments on ShapeNetCore-2048 demonstrate that while baseline completion networks perform reasonable under their training-style cropping, they struggle in random cropping scenarios. In contrast, RL-AD-Net consistently delivers improvements across both settings, highlighting the effectiveness of RL-guided ensemble refinement. The approach is lightweight, modular, and model-agnostic, making it applicable to a wide range of completion networks without requiring retraining.

TL;DR: REArtGS++ enhances the reconstruction and joint estimation of articulated objects using advanced geometric constraints and planar Gaussian splatting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current articulated object reconstruction methods struggle with screw joints, multi-part objects, and unseen states. This motivates the need for improved generalizable methods.

Method: REArtGS++ uses decoupled screw motion modeling, part-aware Gaussian optimization, and temporal geometric constraints, including planar Gaussian modeling and consistency enforced by Taylor first-order expansion.

Result: Experiments show REArtGS++ outperforms earlier models in reconstructing part-level surfaces and joint estimation for synthetic and real-world environments.

Conclusion: REArtGS++ introduces innovations that significantly improve the reconstruction and estimation for generalizable articulated objects, advancing state-of-the-art methodology in this domain.

Abstract: Articulated objects are pervasive in daily environments, such as drawers and refrigerators. Towards their part-level surface reconstruction and joint parameter estimation, REArtGS~\cite{wu2025reartgs} introduces a category-agnostic approach using multi-view RGB images at two different states. However, we observe that REArtGS still struggles with screw-joint or multi-part objects and lacks geometric constraints for unseen states. In this paper, we propose REArtGS++, a novel method towards generalizable articulated object reconstruction with temporal geometry constraint and planar Gaussian splatting. We first model a decoupled screw motion for each joint without type prior, and jointly optimize part-aware Gaussians with joint parameters through part motion blending. To introduce time-continuous geometric constraint for articulated modeling, we encourage Gaussians to be planar and propose a temporally consistent regularization between planar normal and depth through Taylor first-order expansion. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world articulated objects demonstrate our superiority in generalizable part-level surface reconstruction and joint parameter estimation, compared to existing approaches.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MRI synthesis from sparse CT scans is challenging. ReBrain combines a diffusion model and retrieval mechanisms for accurate full-volume MRI reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MRI is critical for brain disease diagnosis, but physical or clinical restrictions often prevent its use. Synthesizing MRI from sparse CT scans addresses this limitation.

Method: The proposed framework ReBrain uses a Brownian Bridge Diffusion Model (BBDM) for MRI slice synthesis, retrieval of reference CT slices via a database, and ControlNet integration for structural guidance.

Result: ReBrain achieves state-of-the-art performance in cross-modal MRI reconstruction under sparse CT conditions, as validated on SynthRAD2023 and BraTS datasets.

Conclusion: ReBrain demonstrates strong potential in overcoming challenges of sparse CT-based MRI reconstruction, leveraging diffusion models and retrieval-guided approaches.

Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) plays a crucial role in brain disease diagnosis, but it is not always feasible for certain patients due to physical or clinical constraints. Recent studies attempt to synthesize MRI from Computed Tomography (CT) scans; however, low-dose protocols often result in highly sparse CT volumes with poor through-plane resolution, making accurate reconstruction of the full brain MRI volume particularly challenging. To address this, we propose ReBrain, a retrieval-augmented diffusion framework for brain MRI reconstruction. Given any 3D CT scan with limited slices, we first employ a Brownian Bridge Diffusion Model (BBDM) to synthesize MRI slices along the 2D dimension. Simultaneously, we retrieve structurally and pathologically similar CT slices from a comprehensive prior database via a fine-tuned retrieval model. These retrieved slices are used as references, incorporated through a ControlNet branch to guide the generation of intermediate MRI slices and ensure structural continuity. We further account for rare retrieval failures when the database lacks suitable references and apply spherical linear interpolation to provide supplementary guidance. Extensive experiments on SynthRAD2023 and BraTS demonstrate that ReBrain achieves state-of-the-art performance in cross-modal reconstruction under sparse conditions.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces DiverseVAR, a method to enhance the generative diversity of Visual Autoregressive (VAR) models, addressing the issue of diversity collapse without requiring additional training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VAR models offer improved efficiency and image quality, but suffer from diversity collapse, which limits their output variability. Addressing this limitation can unlock their full potential for high-quality and diverse image synthesis.

Method: DiverseVAR works by manipulating the pivotal component in the feature map: suppressing it in the model input and amplifying it in the output to enhance diversity without additional training.

Result: The approach effectively improves generative diversity in VAR models while maintaining image fidelity and causing negligible performance trade-offs.

Conclusion: DiverseVAR successfully addresses diversity collapse in VAR models, providing a simple and efficient solution for high-diversity and high-fidelity image generation. Code for replication is available online.

Abstract: Visual Autoregressive (VAR) models have recently garnered significant attention for their innovative next-scale prediction paradigm, offering notable advantages in both inference efficiency and image quality compared to traditional multi-step autoregressive (AR) and diffusion models. However, despite their efficiency, VAR models often suffer from the diversity collapse i.e., a reduction in output variability, analogous to that observed in few-step distilled diffusion models. In this paper, we introduce DiverseVAR, a simple yet effective approach that restores the generative diversity of VAR models without requiring any additional training. Our analysis reveals the pivotal component of the feature map as a key factor governing diversity formation at early scales. By suppressing the pivotal component in the model input and amplifying it in the model output, DiverseVAR effectively unlocks the inherent generative potential of VAR models while preserving high-fidelity synthesis. Empirical results demonstrate that our approach substantially enhances generative diversity with only neglectable performance influences. Our code will be publicly released at https://github.com/wangtong627/DiverseVAR.

TL;DR: STAR modeling provides flexible sequence order for image generation without sacrificing sampling performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance image generation methods by incorporating priors like center bias and locality while maintaining flexibility and performance.

Method: STAR leverages traversal orders from spanning trees sampled in patch lattices and breadth-first search to ensure efficient and structured sequence orders.

Result: STAR achieves postfix completion capabilities and retains sampling performance without altering existing AR model architecture.

Conclusion: STAR offers a balanced approach to flexible sequence ordering and sampling efficiency in autoregressive image generation.

Abstract: We present Spanning Tree Autoregressive (STAR) modeling, which can incorporate prior knowledge of images, such as center bias and locality, to maintain sampling performance while also providing sufficiently flexible sequence orders to accommodate image editing at inference. Approaches that expose randomly permuted sequence orders to conventional autoregressive (AR) models in visual generation for bidirectional context either suffer from a decline in performance or compromise the flexibility in sequence order choice at inference. Instead, STAR utilizes traversal orders of uniform spanning trees sampled in a lattice defined by the positions of image patches. Traversal orders are obtained through breadth-first search, allowing us to efficiently construct a spanning tree whose traversal order ensures that the connected partial observation of the image appears as a prefix in the sequence through rejection sampling. Through the tailored yet structured randomized strategy compared to random permutation, STAR preserves the capability of postfix completion while maintaining sampling performance without any significant changes to the model architecture widely adopted in the language AR modeling.

### [121] [SPAGS: Sparse-View Articulated Object Reconstruction from Single State via Planar Gaussian Splatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17092)
*Di Wu,Liu Liu,Xueyu Yuan,Qiaoyu Jun,Wenxiao Chen,Ruilong Yan,Yiming Tang,Liangtu Song*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a framework for reconstructing 3D articulated objects using sparse-view RGB images, overcoming the limitations of existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current reconstruction methods for articulated objects often require expensive, multi-stage inputs, limiting practicality.

Method: The framework employs planar Gaussian Splatting, a Gaussian information field for optimal view selection, and a coarse-to-fine optimization of planar Gaussians with depth regularization and few-shot diffusion. Additionally, part segmentation probability is integrated and refined through back-projections.

Result: The proposed method outperforms existing approaches in achieving high-fidelity part-level surface reconstructions on both synthetic and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: This novel framework enhances the efficiency and accuracy of articulated object reconstruction, while requiring only sparse-view inputs. Codes will be provided publicly for further accessibility.

Abstract: Articulated objects are ubiquitous in daily environments, and their 3D reconstruction holds great significance across various fields. However, existing articulated object reconstruction methods typically require costly inputs such as multi-stage and multi-view observations. To address the limitations, we propose a category-agnostic articulated object reconstruction framework via planar Gaussian Splatting, which only uses sparse-view RGB images from a single state. Specifically, we first introduce a Gaussian information field to perceive the optimal sparse viewpoints from candidate camera poses. Then we compress 3D Gaussians into planar Gaussians to facilitate accurate estimation of normal and depth. The planar Gaussians are optimized in a coarse-to-fine manner through depth smooth regularization and few-shot diffusion. Moreover, we introduce a part segmentation probability for each Gaussian primitive and update them by back-projecting part segmentation masks of renderings. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves higher-fidelity part-level surface reconstruction on both synthetic and real-world data than existing methods. Codes will be made publicly available.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ReCoVAD reduces redundant computations for video anomaly detection by selectively processing video frames leveraging pre-trained models, achieving state-of-the-art performance efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the high computational and latency issues of dense frame-level inference in video anomaly detection while utilizing large pre-trained models for efficient reasoning.

Method: Introduces the ReCoVAD framework inspired by dual pathways in human nervous systems. ReCoVAD features a Reflex pathway for fast frame analysis using lightweight CLIP-based models and a Conscious pathway using vision-language models for refined event descriptions and anomaly scoring.

Result: ReCoVAD demonstrates state-of-the-art, training-free video anomaly detection with reduced computational needs, processing only 28.55% (UCF-Crime dataset) and 16.04% (XD-Violence dataset) of frames required by previous methods.

Conclusion: ReCoVAD proves sparse reasoning with large pre-trained models suffices for effective video anomaly detection, combining high performance with computational efficiency.

Abstract: Video anomaly detection (VAD) plays a vital role in real-world applications such as security surveillance, autonomous driving, and industrial monitoring. Recent advances in large pre-trained models have opened new opportunities for training-free VAD by leveraging rich prior knowledge and general reasoning capabilities. However, existing studies typically rely on dense frame-level inference, incurring high computational costs and latency. This raises a fundamental question: Is dense reasoning truly necessary when using powerful pre-trained models in VAD systems? To answer this, we propose ReCoVAD, a novel framework inspired by the dual reflex and conscious pathways of the human nervous system, enabling selective frame processing to reduce redundant computation. ReCoVAD consists of two core pathways: (i) a Reflex pathway that uses a lightweight CLIP-based module to fuse visual features with prototype prompts and produce decision vectors, which query a dynamic memory of past frames and anomaly scores for fast response; and (ii) a Conscious pathway that employs a medium-scale vision-language model to generate textual event descriptions and refined anomaly scores for novel frames. It continuously updates the memory and prototype prompts, while an integrated large language model periodically reviews accumulated descriptions to identify unseen anomalies, correct errors, and refine prototypes. Extensive experiments show that ReCoVAD achieves state-of-the-art training-free performance while processing only 28.55\% and 16.04\% of the frames used by previous methods on the UCF-Crime and XD-Violence datasets, demonstrating that sparse reasoning is sufficient for effective large-model-based VAD.

### [123] [Bridging Visual Affective Gap: Borrowing Textual Knowledge by Learning from Noisy Image-Text Pairs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17103)
*Daiqing Wu,Dongbao Yang,Yu Zhou,Can Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Partitioned Adaptive Contrastive Learning (PACL) to bridge the "affective gap" and improve visual emotion recognition (VER) by leveraging knowledge from pre-trained textual models along with pre-trained visual models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the limitations in visual emotion recognition caused by the "affective gap"—the lack of direct association between factual-level features in visual information and emotional categories—by utilizing the textual modality's explicit emotional expression and high information density.

Method: The authors propose Partitioned Adaptive Contrastive Learning (PACL), a technique that separates various sample types and applies distinct contrastive learning strategies for each. They dynamically construct positive and negative pairs to better utilize noisy social media data and strengthen connections between images and texts.

Result: Experiments show that PACL effectively bridges the "affective gap," leading to significant performance improvements in emotion-related tasks across multiple pre-trained visual models.

Conclusion: Bridging the "affective gap" by using textual modality knowledge enhances visual emotion recognition performance, demonstrating the viability of PACL for emotion-related tasks involving noisy data.

Abstract: Visual emotion recognition (VER) is a longstanding field that has garnered increasing attention with the advancement of deep neural networks. Although recent studies have achieved notable improvements by leveraging the knowledge embedded within pre-trained visual models, the lack of direct association between factual-level features and emotional categories, called the "affective gap", limits the applicability of pre-training knowledge for VER tasks. On the contrary, the explicit emotional expression and high information density in textual modality eliminate the "affective gap". Therefore, we propose borrowing the knowledge from the pre-trained textual model to enhance the emotional perception of pre-trained visual models. We focus on the factual and emotional connections between images and texts in noisy social media data, and propose Partitioned Adaptive Contrastive Learning (PACL) to leverage these connections. Specifically, we manage to separate different types of samples and devise distinct contrastive learning strategies for each type. By dynamically constructing negative and positive pairs, we fully exploit the potential of noisy samples. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that bridging the "affective gap" significantly improves the performance of various pre-trained visual models in downstream emotion-related tasks. Our code is released on https://github.com/wdqqdw/PACL.

### [124] [ChainV: Atomic Visual Hints Make Multimodal Reasoning Shorter and Better](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17106)
*Yuan Zhang,Ming Lu,Junwen Pan,Tao Huang,Kuan Cheng,Qi She,Shanghang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces ChainV, a model that uses dynamic visual hints to enhance reasoning efficiency and accuracy in multimodal tasks, particularly math-intensive benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Although multimodal reasoning models excel in text and vision integration, they struggle with redundant self-reflection in reasoning chains. Existing methods lack adaptability for dynamic visual inputs which limits reasoning performance enhancement.

Method: ChainV dynamically incorporates visual hints into reasoning by selecting coarsely identified visual patches, refining them with representative atomic hints using attention intensity. It includes a consistency-based evaluation mechanism to ensure reliability, integrating these hints into reasoning with a Bernoulli process.

Result: ChainV achieves a $2.3\%$ improvement in accuracy on the MathVista benchmark, reduces inference latency by $51.4\%$, and shortens output token length by $24.5\%$.

Conclusion: ChainV effectively enhances multimodal reasoning performance by improving accuracy and efficiency through the dynamic integration of visual hints.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal reasoning models have demonstrated impressive capabilities across text and vision. However, even leading models exhibit redundant self-reflection when generating lengthy reasoning chains. While training-free CoT compression methods have emerged in the LLMs domain, they rely on static visual references and thus provide limited gains for multimodal reasoning. Therefore, we propose ChainV, a framework that dynamically integrates visual hints into the reasoning process, thereby making multimodal reasoning shorter and better. Specifically, ChainV first performs a coarse visual patch selection based on the previous reasoning step, then refines it by identifying the most representative atomic visual hint according to the averaged attention intensity. Additionally, ChainV introduces a consistency-based evaluation mechanism to assess the reliability of the chosen hint, guiding the model to adaptively adjust its level of self-reflection. Eventually, the pixel coordinates of the selected visual hint and its reliability are incorporated into thinking with a Bernoulli stochastic process. Experiments indicate that our method significantly improves reasoning accuracy and efficiency, especially on math-intensive benchmarks where visual hints are crucial for multi-step symbolic reasoning. For example, ChainV achieves $2.3\%$ improvement on the MathVista within MIMO-VL-RL, while reducing inference latency by $51.4\%$ and shortening output token length by $24.5\%$.

TL;DR: The paper introduces the PEGS framework for reconstructing large-scale rigid motion by integrating physical priors with event stream enhancement in a 3D Gaussian Splatting pipeline.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reconstructing rigid motion at large spatiotemporal scales is challenging due to issues like modeling limitations, motion blur, and lack of physical consistency.

Method: PEGS uses a triple-level supervision scheme with acceleration constraints, event streams for detailed guidance, and Kalman regularization. It employs simulated annealing for adaptive training and introduces an RGB-Event paired dataset.

Result: The PEGS framework outperforms mainstream dynamic methods in reconstructing motion over extensive spatiotemporal ranges.

Conclusion: By combining physical priors and event-based enhancement, PEGS demonstrates effective motion reconstruction and delivers a new dataset for natural, fast rigid motion scenarios.

Abstract: Reconstruction of rigid motion over large spatiotemporal scales remains a challenging task due to limitations in modeling paradigms, severe motion blur, and insufficient physical consistency. In this work, we propose PEGS, a framework that integrates Physical priors with Event stream enhancement within a 3D Gaussian Splatting pipeline to perform deblurred target-focused modeling and motion recovery. We introduce a cohesive triple-level supervision scheme that enforces physical plausibility via an acceleration constraint, leverages event streams for high-temporal resolution guidance, and employs a Kalman regularizer to fuse multi-source observations. Furthermore, we design a motion-aware simulated annealing strategy that adaptively schedules the training process based on real-time kinematic states. We also contribute the first RGB-Event paired dataset targeting natural, fast rigid motion across diverse scenarios. Experiments show PEGS's superior performance in reconstructing motion over large spatiotemporal scales compared to mainstream dynamic methods.

*SaiKiran Tedla,Joshua E. Little,Hakki Can Karaimer,Michael S. Brown*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study introduces a 2D chromaticity-based mapping method for in-camera colorimetric accuracy under non-Planckian illuminants, using an MLP trained with LED sources, achieving improved performance and compatibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional one-dimensional CCT-based colorimetric mapping struggles with modern lighting technologies like LEDs that deviate from the Planckian locus, leading to inaccuracies.

Method: The paper proposes transitioning to a 2D chromaticity space and employs a lightweight multi-layer perceptron (MLP) trained on LED source data to enhance colorimetric accuracy and mapping capabilities.

Result: The proposed method reduces angular reproduction error by 22% on average in LED-lit conditions, supports effective multi-illuminant scenes, maintains compatibility with traditional lighting, and is viable for real-time use.

Conclusion: Moving from traditional CCT interpolation to a 2D chromaticity approach and utilizing a trained MLP significantly improves colorimetric mapping accuracy, especially under LED lighting, with efficient real-time application possibilities.

Abstract: Traditional in-camera colorimetric mapping relies on correlated color temperature (CCT)-based interpolation between pre-calibrated transforms optimized for Planckian illuminants such as CIE A and D65. However, modern lighting technologies such as LEDs can deviate substantially from the Planckian locus, exposing the limitations of relying on conventional one-dimensional CCT for illumination characterization. This paper demonstrates that transitioning from 1D CCT (on the Planckian locus) to a 2D chromaticity space (off the Planckian locus) improves colorimetric accuracy across various mapping approaches. In addition, we replace conventional CCT interpolation with a lightweight multi-layer perceptron (MLP) that leverages 2D chromaticity features for robust colorimetric mapping under non-Planckian illuminants. A lightbox-based calibration procedure incorporating representative LED sources is used to train our MLP. Validated across diverse LED lighting, our method reduces angular reproduction error by 22% on average in LED-lit scenes, maintains backward compatibility with traditional illuminants, accommodates multi-illuminant scenes, and supports real-time in-camera deployment with negligible additional computational cost.

### [127] [A Multi-Stage Optimization Framework for Deploying Learned Image Compression on FPGAs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17135)
*Jiaxun Fang,Li Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a multi-stage optimization framework to bridge the gap between high-performance deep learning-based image compression (LIC) models and efficient implementation on resource-constrained FPGAs, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-performance LIC models suffer from performance degradation when deployed on resource-constrained FPGAs, motivating the need to optimize these models for efficient hardware-friendly implementations.

Method: The proposed framework includes: (1) Dynamic Range-Aware Quantization (DRAQ) with activation clipping and weight regularization to combat quantization-induced degradation; (2) mixed-precision search to optimize bit-width allocation; and (3) channel pruning techniques to reduce model redundancy in GDN-based layers.

Result: The DRAQ method reduced BD-rate overhead from 30% to 6.3%, and hardware-aware optimizations reduced computational complexity by 20% while maintaining compression performance. The optimized model outperformed existing FPGA-based LIC implementations.

Conclusion: The presented optimization framework successfully enables high-fidelity, efficient hardware-friendly image compression models for resource-constrained FPGA deployment, achieving state-of-the-art efficiency and quality.

Abstract: Deep learning-based image compression (LIC) has achieved state-of-the-art rate-distortion (RD) performance, yet deploying these models on resource-constrained FPGAs remains a major challenge. This work presents a complete, multi-stage optimization framework to bridge the gap between high-performance floating-point models and efficient, hardware-friendly integer-based implementations. First, we address the fundamental problem of quantization-induced performance degradation. We propose a Dynamic Range-Aware Quantization (DRAQ) method that uses statistically-calibrated activation clipping and a novel weight regularization scheme to counteract the effects of extreme data outliers and large dynamic ranges, successfully creating a high-fidelity 8-bit integer model. Second, building on this robust foundation, we introduce two hardware-aware optimization techniques tailored for FPGAs. A progressive mixed-precision search algorithm exploits FPGA flexibility to assign optimal, non-uniform bit-widths to each layer, minimizing complexity while preserving performance. Concurrently, a channel pruning method, adapted to work with the Generalized Divisive Normalization (GDN) layers common in LIC, removes model redundancy by eliminating inactive channels. Our comprehensive experiments show that the foundational DRAQ method reduces the BD-rate overhead of a GDN-based model from $30\%$ to $6.3\%$. The subsequent hardware-aware optimizations further reduce computational complexity by over $20\%$ with negligible impact on RD performance, yielding a final model that is both state-of-the-art in efficiency and superior in quality to existing FPGA-based LIC implementations.

### [128] [One-Step Diffusion Transformer for Controllable Real-World Image Super-Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17138)
*Yushun Fang,Yuxiang Chen,Shibo Yin,Qiang Hu,Jiangchao Yao,Ya Zhang,Xiaoyun Zhang,Yanfeng Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ODTSR, a diffusion transformer, achieves high-quality image super-resolution with controllable fidelity in one step, outperforming current methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of balancing fidelity and controllability in real-world image super-resolution, as existing methods either compromise on fidelity or lose control flexibility.

Method: ODTSR introduces a Noise-hybrid Visual Stream (NVS) design and Fidelity-aware Adversarial Training (FAA) to simultaneously consider fidelity and controllability in one-step inference.

Result: Extensive experiments show ODTSR achieves state-of-the-art performance in real-world image super-resolution (Real-ISR) and enhances controllability for specialized scenarios like scene text image super-resolution (STISR).

Conclusion: ODTSR effectively balances fidelity and controllability in one-step Real-ISR, achieving superior performance and adaptability for complex applications.

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion-based real-world image super-resolution (Real-ISR) have demonstrated remarkable perceptual quality, yet the balance between fidelity and controllability remains a problem: multi-step diffusion-based methods suffer from generative diversity and randomness, resulting in low fidelity, while one-step methods lose control flexibility due to fidelity-specific finetuning. In this paper, we present ODTSR, a one-step diffusion transformer based on Qwen-Image that performs Real-ISR considering fidelity and controllability simultaneously: a newly introduced visual stream receives low-quality images (LQ) with adjustable noise (Control Noise), and the original visual stream receives LQs with consistent noise (Prior Noise), forming the Noise-hybrid Visual Stream (NVS) design. ODTSR further employs Fidelity-aware Adversarial Training (FAA) to enhance controllability and achieve one-step inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ODTSR not only achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on generic Real-ISR, but also enables prompt controllability on challenging scenarios such as real-world scene text image super-resolution (STISR) of Chinese characters without training on specific datasets.

*Yidong Huang,Zun Wang,Han Lin,Dong-Ki Kim,Shayegan Omidshafiei,Jaehong Yoon,Yue Zhang,Mohit Bansal*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SketchVerify, a novel framework to improve video generation by using a training-free, sketch-verification loop that ensures coherent and instruction-consistent object motions prior to generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video generation approaches fail to balance motion fidelity, temporal coherence, and computation efficiency, often struggling with complex motions or requiring computationally expensive iterations.

Method: SketchVerify uses a sampling-verification loop at test time to generate multiple candidate motion plans. It evaluates and ranks these motions using a vision-language verifier for semantic and physical plausibility. Lightweight video sketches enable efficient scoring and avoid repeated heavy video synthesis.

Result: The proposed method significantly outperforms competitive baselines in motion quality, physical realism, and long-term consistency. It achieves this while being computationally efficient.

Conclusion: SketchVerify provides an efficient framework for generating dynamic and instruction-consistent motions, proving its value in video generation by maintaining quality while reducing computational costs.

Abstract: Recent video generation approaches increasingly rely on planning intermediate control signals such as object trajectories to improve temporal coherence and motion fidelity. However, these methods mostly employ single-shot plans that are typically limited to simple motions, or iterative refinement which requires multiple calls to the video generator, incuring high computational cost. To overcome these limitations, we propose SketchVerify, a training-free, sketch-verification-based planning framework that improves motion planning quality with more dynamically coherent trajectories (i.e., physically plausible and instruction-consistent motions) prior to full video generation by introducing a test-time sampling and verification loop. Given a prompt and a reference image, our method predicts multiple candidate motion plans and ranks them using a vision-language verifier that jointly evaluates semantic alignment with the instruction and physical plausibility. To efficiently score candidate motion plans, we render each trajectory as a lightweight video sketch by compositing objects over a static background, which bypasses the need for expensive, repeated diffusion-based synthesis while achieving comparable performance. We iteratively refine the motion plan until a satisfactory one is identified, which is then passed to the trajectory-conditioned generator for final synthesis. Experiments on WorldModelBench and PhyWorldBench demonstrate that our method significantly improves motion quality, physical realism, and long-term consistency compared to competitive baselines while being substantially more efficient. Our ablation study further shows that scaling up the number of trajectory candidates consistently enhances overall performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces CC-DiceCE loss, enhancing small lesion detection while maintaining segmentation performance, and shows it outperforms a similar reference method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing loss functions like Dice underperform in segmenting small lesions, dominating overall outcomes due to their minimal contribution.

Method: Develop CC-DiceCE loss within the CC-Metrics framework; benchmark it against blob loss using nnU-Net for evaluation.

Result: CC-DiceCE improves lesion detection (recall) with little segmentation trade-off but introduces slightly more false positives; it surpasses blob loss in performance.

Conclusion: CC-DiceCE is a promising enhancement for medical image segmentation, especially for small lesion detection, showing broad applicability and reliability.

Abstract: Traditional loss functions in medical image segmentation, such as Dice, often under-segment small lesions because their small relative volume contributes negligibly to the overall loss. To address this, instance-wise loss functions and metrics have been proposed to evaluate segmentation quality on a per-lesion basis. We introduce CC-DiceCE, a loss function based on the CC-Metrics framework, and compare it with the existing blob loss. Both are benchmarked against a DiceCE baseline within the nnU-Net framework, which provides a robust and standardized setup. We find that CC-DiceCE loss increases detection (recall) with minimal to no degradation in segmentation performance, albeit at the cost of slightly more false positives. Furthermore, our multi-dataset study shows that CC-DiceCE generally outperforms blob loss.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address real-time detection challenges in remote sensing images, particularly difficulties arising from small object detection and the need to balance high accuracy with computational efficiency.

Method: The authors propose DMG-YOLO, which includes a Dual-branch Feature Extraction module (combining depthwise separable convolutions and a vision transformer) for local and global feature extraction, a Multi-scale Feature Fusion module with dilated convolutions for enhanced detail preservation, and a Global and Local Aggregate Feature Pyramid Network for improved feature fusion.

Result: The method demonstrates competitive performance on the VisDrone2019 and NWPU VHR-10 datasets, excelling in terms of mAP, model size, and efficiency.

Conclusion: DMG-YOLO offers an effective solution for real-time small object detection in remote sensing images by incorporating advanced lightweight design and feature fusion techniques.

Abstract: Remote sensing imagery is widely used across various fields, yet real-time detection remains challenging due to the prevalence of small objects and the need to balance accuracy with efficiency. To address this, we propose DMG-YOLO, a lightweight real-time detector tailored for small object detection in remote sensing images. Specifically, we design a Dual-branch Feature Extraction (DFE) module in the backbone, which partitions feature maps into two parallel branches: one extracts local features via depthwise separable convolutions, and the other captures global context using a vision transformer with a gating mechanism. Additionally, a Multi-scale Feature Fusion (MFF) module with dilated convolutions enhances multi-scale integration while preserving fine details. In the neck, we introduce the Global and Local Aggregate Feature Pyramid Network (GLAFPN) to further boost small object detection through global-local feature fusion. Extensive experiments on the VisDrone2019 and NWPU VHR-10 datasets show that DMG-YOLO achieves competitive performance in terms of mAP, model size, and other key metrics.

*Liuhan Yin,Runkun Ju,Guodong Guo,Erkang Cheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces DiffRefiner, a two-stage framework that improves trajectory prediction for autonomous driving using a combination of transformer-based proposals and diffusion methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improvements are needed in generative approaches for autonomous vehicle trajectory prediction, as they lack sufficient flexibility and accuracy in denoising human-crafted anchors or noise.

Method: The framework involves two stages: a Proposal Decoder using predefined anchors to predict coarse trajectories, followed by a Diffusion Refiner to refine the predictions iteratively.

Result: DiffRefiner achieves state-of-the-art performance on NAVSIM v2 and Bench2Drive benchmarks with improved accuracy and effectiveness demonstrated via ablation studies.

Conclusion: DiffRefiner enhances generative trajectory prediction by integrating discriminative initial proposals and fine-grained refinements, setting new records in autonomous driving benchmarks.

Abstract: Unlike discriminative approaches in autonomous driving that predict a fixed set of candidate trajectories of the ego vehicle, generative methods, such as diffusion models, learn the underlying distribution of future motion, enabling more flexible trajectory prediction. However, since these methods typically rely on denoising human-crafted trajectory anchors or random noise, there remains significant room for improvement. In this paper, we propose DiffRefiner, a novel two-stage trajectory prediction framework. The first stage uses a transformer-based Proposal Decoder to generate coarse trajectory predictions by regressing from sensor inputs using predefined trajectory anchors. The second stage applies a Diffusion Refiner that iteratively denoises and refines these initial predictions. In this way, we enhance the performance of diffusion-based planning by incorporating a discriminative trajectory proposal module, which provides strong guidance for the generative refinement process. Furthermore, we design a fine-grained denoising decoder to enhance scene compliance, enabling more accurate trajectory prediction through enhanced alignment with the surrounding environment. Experimental results demonstrate that DiffRefiner achieves state-of-the-art performance, attaining 87.4 EPDMS on NAVSIM v2, and 87.1 DS along with 71.4 SR on Bench2Drive, thereby setting new records on both public benchmarks. The effectiveness of each component is validated via ablation studies as well.

### [133] [UI-Styler: Ultrasound Image Style Transfer with Class-Aware Prompts for Cross-Device Diagnosis Using a Frozen Black-Box Inference Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17155)
*Nhat-Tuong Do-Tran,Ngoc-Hoang-Lam Le,Ching-Chun Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses the domain shifts in ultrasound images caused by varied acquisition devices, proposing a novel method (UI-Styler) for class-aware image style transfer to improve downstream inference models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The diversity in ultrasound acquisition devices leads to domain shifts that negatively impact the performance of inference models. Existing solutions lack class-specific semantic alignment, reducing diagnostic accuracy.

Method: The proposed UI-Styler uses a pattern-matching mechanism to transfer texture patterns from target to source images while preserving structural content. It employs a class-aware prompting strategy with pseudo labels to ensure semantic alignment.

Result: UI-Styler achieved superior performance in reducing distribution distances and improving classification and segmentation tasks across ultrasound cross-device scenarios.

Conclusion: UI-Styler is effective in addressing domain shifts in ultrasound imaging and enhancing diagnostic accuracy, outperforming existing unpaired image translation approaches.

Abstract: The appearance of ultrasound images varies across acquisition devices, causing domain shifts that degrade the performance of fixed black-box downstream inference models when reused. To mitigate this issue, it is practical to develop unpaired image translation (UIT) methods that effectively align the statistical distributions between source and target domains, particularly under the constraint of a reused inference-blackbox setting. However, existing UIT approaches often overlook class-specific semantic alignment during domain adaptation, resulting in misaligned content-class mappings that can impair diagnostic accuracy. To address this limitation, we propose UI-Styler, a novel ultrasound-specific, class-aware image style transfer framework. UI-Styler leverages a pattern-matching mechanism to transfer texture patterns embedded in the target images onto source images while preserving the source structural content. In addition, we introduce a class-aware prompting strategy guided by pseudo labels of the target domain, which enforces accurate semantic alignment with diagnostic categories. Extensive experiments on ultrasound cross-device tasks demonstrate that UI-Styler consistently outperforms existing UIT methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance in distribution distance and downstream tasks, such as classification and segmentation.

*Mario Markov,Stefan Maria Ailuro,Luc Van Gool,Konrad Schindler,Danda Pani Paudel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces FireScope-Bench, a large-scale dataset for wildfire risk modeling, and proposes FireScope, a reasoning-enhanced visual language model to predict wildfire risk maps with high accuracy and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the limitations in current wildfire risk modeling methods which struggle with causal reasoning and multimodal understanding, thus hindering reliable generalization and robust predictions.

Method: The authors developed FireScope-Bench, combining Sentinel-2 imagery, climate data, and expert-defined risk rasters across the USA and Europe. They introduced FireScope, which utilizes reinforcement learning and visual supervision to infer risk maps with faithful reasoning traces.

Result: FireScope demonstrated improved performance, achieving significant gains in cross-continental generalization. Expert feedback and automated analysis validated the semantic meaningfulness of its reasoning traces.

Conclusion: The findings establish that reasoning can enhance wildfire risk model predictions in terms of generalization and interpretability. FireScope-Bench is proposed as a valuable resource for advancing spatial modeling in the field.

Abstract: Predicting wildfire risk is a reasoning-intensive spatial problem that requires the integration of visual, climatic, and geographic factors to infer continuous risk maps. Existing methods lack the causal reasoning and multimodal understanding required for reliable generalization. We introduce $\textbf{FireScope-Bench}$, a large-scale dataset and benchmark that couples Sentinel-2 imagery and climate data with expert-defined risk rasters across the USA, and real wildfire events in Europe for cross-continental evaluation. Building on this dataset, we propose $\textbf{FireScope}$, a VLM-based reasoning-to-generation framework that learns from both reinforcement learning and visual supervision to predict risk rasters with complementary reasoning traces. When trained in the USA and tested in Europe, $\textbf{FireScope}$ achieves substantial performance gains, while expert feedback and automated analysis confirm that its reasoning traces are faithful and semantically meaningful. Our findings demonstrate that reasoning can ground raster prediction models, improving both generalization and interpretability. To our knowledge, this is the first framework to (1) demonstrate that language-based reasoning can improve generalization in visual generation, (2) propose a high-resolution wildfire risk model that can be applied across continents, and (3) enable systematic studies of robust cross-continental generalization for multimodal fire risk models. We believe that $\textbf{FireScope-Bench}$ has the potential to serve as a foundation for advancing reasoning-driven, interpretable and generalizable spatial modeling. Data and source code will be made publicly available.

### [135] [Investigating self-supervised representations for audio-visual deepfake detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17181)
*Dragos-Alexandru Boldisor,Stefan Smeu,Dan Oneata,Elisabeta Oneata*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Self-supervised representations are investigated for their efficacy in audio-visual deepfake detection. Their strengths and challenges are highlighted, especially regarding cross-domain generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the underexplored potential of self-supervised representations in detecting audio-visual deepfakes and understanding their patterns and limitations.

Method: Systematic evaluation of self-supervised representations across different modalities (audio, video, multimodal) and domains (e.g., lip movements, generic visual content) in terms of effectiveness, interpretability, and complementarity.

Result: Findings revealed that self-supervised features generally capture meaningful deepfake-relevant information and exhibit complementary capabilities, but fail to generalize reliably across diverse datasets.

Conclusion: While self-supervised representations show promise in understanding and detecting deepfakes, the major challenge lies in achieving robust and reliable generalization across different domains and datasets.

Abstract: Self-supervised representations excel at many vision and speech tasks, but their potential for audio-visual deepfake detection remains underexplored. Unlike prior work that uses these features in isolation or buried within complex architectures, we systematically evaluate them across modalities (audio, video, multimodal) and domains (lip movements, generic visual content). We assess three key dimensions: detection effectiveness, interpretability of encoded information, and cross-modal complementarity. We find that most self-supervised features capture deepfake-relevant information, and that this information is complementary. Moreover, models primarily attend to semantically meaningful regions rather than spurious artifacts. Yet none generalize reliably across datasets. This generalization failure likely stems from dataset characteristics, not from the features themselves latching onto superficial patterns. These results expose both the promise and fundamental challenges of self-supervised representations for deepfake detection: while they learn meaningful patterns, achieving robust cross-domain performance remains elusive.

*Aditya Mishra,Akshay Agarwal,Haroon Lone*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces INTSD, a nighttime traffic sign dataset, and LENS-Net, a model for robust sign recognition in low-light conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recognizing traffic signs at night remains difficult due to visual noise, lack of publication datasets, and limitations of existing methods in leveraging multimodal cues and handling low illumination.

Method: The paper introduces INTSD, a large-scale nighttime traffic sign dataset, and proposes LENS-Net, which combines adaptive image enhancement and cross-modal attention mechanisms for detection and classification.

Result: LENS-Net outperforms state-of-the-art models in nighttime traffic sign recognition, and ablation studies validate its key components.

Conclusion: The paper provides comprehensive benchmarks with the INTSD dataset and demonstrates the success of LENS-Net, offering publicly available resources to advance research in nighttime traffic sign recognition.

Abstract: Traffic signboards are vital for road safety and intelligent transportation systems, enabling navigation and autonomous driving. Yet, recognizing traffic signs at night remains challenging due to visual noise and scarcity of public nighttime datasets. Despite advances in vision architectures, existing methods struggle with robustness under low illumination and fail to leverage complementary mutlimodal cues effectively. To overcome these limitations, firstly, we introduce INTSD, a large-scale dataset comprising street-level night-time images of traffic signboards collected across diverse regions of India. The dataset spans 41 traffic signboard classes captured under varying lighting and weather conditions, providing a comprehensive benchmark for both detection and classification tasks. To benchmark INTSD for night-time sign recognition, we conduct extensive evaluations using state-of-the-art detection and classification models. Secondly, we propose LENS-Net, which integrates an adaptive image enhancement detector for joint illumination correction and sign localization, followed by a structured multimodal CLIP-GCNN classifier that leverages cross-modal attention and graph-based reasoning for robust and semantically consistent recognition. Our method surpasses existing frameworks, with ablation studies confirming the effectiveness of its key components. The dataset and code for LENS-Net is publicly available for research.

*Yipeng Chen,Zhichao Ye,Zhenzhou Fang,Xinyu Chen,Xiaoyu Zhang,Jialing Liu,Nan Wang,Haomin Liu,Guofeng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PostCam is a system for generating novel-view videos by enabling post-capture editing of camera trajectories with high precision and quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video recapture methods have limitations in precision of camera control and fail to preserve fine visual details when manipulating dynamic scenes.

Method: PostCam utilizes a query-shared cross-attention module that integrates 6-DoF camera poses and rendered video frames into a shared feature representation. It also employs a two-stage training strategy for refining camera control and visual fidelity.

Result: PostCam demonstrates over 20% improvement in camera control precision and view consistency and achieves superior video generation quality compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: PostCam significantly enhances video manipulation capabilities in dynamic scenes, offering precise control and improved visual quality.

Abstract: We propose PostCam, a framework for novel-view video generation that enables post-capture editing of camera trajectories in dynamic scenes. We find that existing video recapture methods suffer from suboptimal camera motion injection strategies; such suboptimal designs not only limit camera control precision but also result in generated videos that fail to preserve fine visual details from the source video. To achieve more accurate and flexible motion manipulation, PostCam introduces a query-shared cross-attention module. It integrates two distinct forms of control signals: the 6-DoF camera poses and the 2D rendered video frames. By fusing them into a unified representation within a shared feature space, our model can extract underlying motion cues, which enhances both control precision and generation quality. Furthermore, we adopt a two-stage training strategy: the model first learns coarse camera control from pose inputs, and then incorporates visual information to refine motion accuracy and enhance visual fidelity. Experiments on both real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate that PostCam outperforms state-of-the-art methods by over 20% in camera control precision and view consistency, while achieving the highest video generation quality.

### [138] [Real Noise Decoupling for Hyperspectral Image Denoising](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17196)
*Yingkai Zhang,Tao Zhang,Jing Nie,Ying Fu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a multi-stage noise-decoupling framework for hyperspectral image (HSI) denoising to tackle complex noise and enhance quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods struggle with modeling and addressing the complex noise in real-world HSIs, limiting denoising effectiveness.

Method: The proposed approach decomposes complex noise into explicitly modeled and implicitly modeled components. Explicit noise is addressed using a pre-trained denoising network based on an existing noise model, while implicit noise is tackled using a high-frequency wavelet guided network. A multi-stage learning strategy is used for training and optimization.

Result: Experiments on public and new datasets prove the framework surpasses state-of-the-art methods in handling real-world noise and improving HSI quality.

Conclusion: The framework successfully reduces noise complexity, enhances model learning, and significantly improves hyperspectral image denoising performance.

Abstract: Hyperspectral image (HSI) denoising is a crucial step in enhancing the quality of HSIs. Noise modeling methods can fit noise distributions to generate synthetic HSIs to train denoising networks. However, the noise in captured HSIs is usually complex and difficult to model accurately, which significantly limits the effectiveness of these approaches. In this paper, we propose a multi-stage noise-decoupling framework that decomposes complex noise into explicitly modeled and implicitly modeled components. This decoupling reduces the complexity of noise and enhances the learnability of HSI denoising methods when applied to real paired data. Specifically, for explicitly modeled noise, we utilize an existing noise model to generate paired data for pre-training a denoising network, equipping it with prior knowledge to handle the explicitly modeled noise effectively. For implicitly modeled noise, we introduce a high-frequency wavelet guided network. Leveraging the prior knowledge from the pre-trained module, this network adaptively extracts high-frequency features to target and remove the implicitly modeled noise from real paired HSIs. Furthermore, to effectively eliminate all noise components and mitigate error accumulation across stages, a multi-stage learning strategy, comprising separate pre-training and joint fine-tuning, is employed to optimize the entire framework. Extensive experiments on public and our captured datasets demonstrate that our proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods, effectively handling complex real-world noise and significantly enhancing HSI quality.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces VLA-4D, a vision-language-action model designed for spatiotemporally coherent robotic manipulation by incorporating advanced visual and action representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VLA models face difficulties in achieving spatial precision and temporal coherence in robotic manipulation tasks, which are essential for fine-grained and smooth execution.

Method: The authors propose a 4D-aware framework, integrating 3D positional and 1D temporal data into visual representations through cross-attention and designing spatiotemporal action representations for better planning and prediction.

Result: The model demonstrates superior performance in ensuring spatial smoothness and temporal coherence in robotic manipulation tasks, as validated through experiments on an extended dataset.

Conclusion: VLA-4D enhances robotic manipulation by advancing both visual and action representations, achieving improved spatiotemporal coherence over prior methods.

Abstract: Vision-language-action (VLA) models show potential for general robotic tasks, but remain challenging in spatiotemporally coherent manipulation, which requires fine-grained representations. Typically, existing methods embed 3D positions into visual representations to enhance the spatial precision of actions. However, these methods struggle to achieve temporally coherent control over action execution. In this work, we propose VLA-4D, a general VLA model with 4D awareness for spatiotemporally coherent robotic manipulation. Our model is guided by two key designs: 1) 4D-aware visual representation. We extract visual features, embed 1D time into 3D positions for 4D embeddings, and fuse them into a unified visual representation via a cross-attention mechanism. 2) Spatiotemporal action representation. We extend conventional spatial action representations with temporal information to enable the spatiotemporal planning, and align the multimodal representations into the LLM for spatiotemporal action prediction. Within this unified framework, the designed visual and action representations jointly make robotic manipulation spatially-smooth and temporally-coherent. In addition, we extend the VLA dataset with temporal action annotations for fine-tuning our model. Extensive experiments have been conducted to verify the superiority of our method across different tasks of robotic manipulation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces CA-SAM, a strategy combining the Segment Anything Model (SAM) with a lightweight Alignment Layer to achieve efficient and effective continual learning for medical image segmentation, overcoming catastrophic forgetting across nine datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Heterogeneous privacy policies across medical institutions prevent joint training on pooled datasets, necessitating a continual learning method for segmentation without catastrophic forgetting. SAM is promising but computationally heavy.

Method: The paper proposes the Alignment Layer, a lightweight module for encoder-decoder alignment improving SAM's adaptation to medical images. It integrates the Alignment Layer into CA-SAM, a continual learning framework that adapts layers while leveraging SAM's zero-shot priors.

Result: CA-SAM demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in continual learning scenarios, validated across nine different medical image segmentation datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed CA-SAM method balances efficiency with high performance for medical image segmentation, addressing catastrophic forgetting issues while being computationally feasible.

Abstract: In medical image segmentation, heterogeneous privacy policies across institutions often make joint training on pooled datasets infeasible, motivating continual image segmentation-learning from data streams without catastrophic forgetting. While the Segment Anything Model (SAM) offers strong zero-shot priors and has been widely fine-tuned across downstream tasks, its large parameter count and computational overhead challenge practical deployment. This paper demonstrates that the SAM paradigm is highly promising once its computational efficiency and performance can be balanced. To this end, we introduce the Alignment Layer, a lightweight, plug-and-play module which aligns encoder-decoder feature distributions to efficiently adapt SAM to specific medical images, improving accuracy while reducing computation. Building on SAM and the Alignment Layer, we then propose Continual Alignment for SAM (CA-SAM), a continual learning strategy that automatically adapts the appropriate Alignment Layer to mitigate catastrophic forgetting, while leveraging SAM's zero-shot priors to preserve strong performance on unseen medical datasets. Experimented across nine medical segmentation datasets under continual-learning scenario, CA-SAM achieves state-of-the-art performance.

TL;DR: SPECTRE is a transformer-based foundation model for 3D medical imaging, specifically volumetric CT, utilizing self-supervised and vision-language pretraining strategies to handle CT-specific challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a general-purpose, scalable, and open-source foundation model for 3D volumetric CT imaging, addressing challenges such as token scaling, anisotropy, and noisy data typically faced in this domain.

Method: SPECTRE employs 3D Vision Transformers with a dual-approach of local and global transformers for feature extraction and context modeling. It utilizes self-distillation (DINO-style) and a vision-language alignment (SigLIP) with radiology report data, trained on openly available datasets.

Result: SPECTRE outperforms previous CT foundation models across multiple benchmarks in both zero-shot and fine-tuned tasks, demonstrating its effectiveness and generalizability.

Conclusion: SPECTRE establishes itself as a scalable, open-source, and high-performing transformer-based model for volumetric CT imaging, showcasing that pretraining on public datasets can yield clinically meaningful and generalizable features.

Abstract: We introduce SPECTRE, a fully transformer-based foundation model for volumetric computed tomography (CT). Our Self-Supervised & Cross-Modal Pretraining for CT Representation Extraction (SPECTRE) approach utilizes scalable 3D Vision Transformer architectures and modern self-supervised and vision-language pretraining strategies to learn general-purpose CT representations. Volumetric CT poses unique challenges, such as extreme token scaling, geometric anisotropy, and weak or noisy clinical supervision, that make standard transformer and contrastive learning recipes ineffective out of the box. The framework jointly optimizes a local transformer for high-resolution volumetric feature extraction and a global transformer for whole-scan context modeling, making large-scale 3D attention computationally tractable. Notably, SPECTRE is trained exclusively on openly available CT datasets, demonstrating that high-performing, generalizable representations can be achieved without relying on private data. Pretraining combines DINO-style self-distillation with SigLIP-based vision-language alignment using paired radiology reports, yielding features that are both geometrically consistent and clinically meaningful. Across multiple CT benchmarks, SPECTRE consistently outperforms prior CT foundation models in both zero-shot and fine-tuned settings, establishing SPECTRE as a scalable, open, and fully transformer-based foundation model for 3D medical imaging.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address challenges like extreme non-linear distortion, occlusion, and depth ambiguity in fisheye imagery, especially for BEV semantic segmentation in complex environments.

Method: The framework uses calibrated geometric unprojection, per-pixel depth estimation via Gaussian parameterization, and differentiable splatting in 3D space to create uncertainty-aware BEV semantic maps.

Result: The framework achieves high performance with IoU scores of 87.75% for drivable regions and 57.26% for vehicles, even under severe fisheye distortion and diverse environmental conditions.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively handles fisheye distortion and environmental complexities, advancing BEV semantic segmentation accuracy and robustness.

Abstract: Accurate BEV semantic segmentation from fisheye imagery remains challenging due to extreme non-linear distortion, occlusion, and depth ambiguity inherent to wide-angle projections. We present a distortion-aware BEV segmentation framework that directly processes multi-camera high-resolution fisheye images,utilizing calibrated geometric unprojection and per-pixel depth distribution estimation. Each image pixel is lifted into 3D space via Gaussian parameterization, predicting spatial means and anisotropic covariances to explicitly model geometric uncertainty. The projected 3D Gaussians are fused into a BEV representation via differentiable splatting, producing continuous, uncertainty-aware semantic maps without requiring undistortion or perspective rectification. Extensive experiments demonstrate strong segmentation performance on complex parking and urban driving scenarios, achieving IoU scores of 87.75% for drivable regions and 57.26% for vehicles under severe fisheye distortion and diverse environmental conditions.

*Chaowei Fang,Bolin Fu,De Cheng,Lechao Cheng,Guanbin Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Dual-domain Adaptation Networks for realistic image super-resolution, efficiently adapting pre-trained synthetic models to real-world datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world image super-resolution is critical for applications like surveillance and medical imaging but lacks comprehensive LR-HR datasets, needing efficient model adaptation methods.

Method: The proposed method selectively updates pre-trained model parameters using spatial-domain adaptation and adds a frequency domain adaptation branch to enhance high-frequency details.

Result: The approach outperformed state-of-the-art models in realistic image SR benchmarks such as RealSR, D2CRealSR, and DRealSR.

Conclusion: Dual-domain adaptation effectively transfers synthetic SR models to real-world tasks, improving realism and precision in image super-resolution.

Abstract: Realistic image super-resolution (SR) focuses on transforming real-world low-resolution (LR) images into high-resolution (HR) ones, handling more complex degradation patterns than synthetic SR tasks. This is critical for applications like surveillance, medical imaging, and consumer electronics. However, current methods struggle with limited real-world LR-HR data, impacting the learning of basic image features. Pre-trained SR models from large-scale synthetic datasets offer valuable prior knowledge, which can improve generalization, speed up training, and reduce the need for extensive real-world data in realistic SR tasks. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach, Dual-domain Adaptation Networks, which is able to efficiently adapt pre-trained image SR models from simulated to real-world datasets. To achieve this target, we first set up a spatial-domain adaptation strategy through selectively updating parameters of pre-trained models and employing the low-rank adaptation technique to adjust frozen parameters. Recognizing that image super-resolution involves recovering high-frequency components, we further integrate a frequency domain adaptation branch into the adapted model, which combines the spectral data of the input and the spatial-domain backbone's intermediate features to infer HR frequency maps, enhancing the SR result. Experimental evaluations on public realistic image SR benchmarks, including RealSR, D2CRealSR, and DRealSR, demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method over existing state-of-the-art models.

Motivation: To address the need for transformation-invariant yet efficient neural networks suitable for resource-limited environments, especially for applications like satellite imagery and geometric vision.

Method: The proposed method uses G-CNNs with rotational equivariance (via the C4 cyclic group) combined with structured pruning of network layers, adaptive fine-tuning, and dynamic INT8 quantization.

Result: The proposed method reduces parameters by 29.3% while maintaining consistent performance under geometric transformations and achieving significant accuracy recovery.

Conclusion: This framework offers an efficient solution for deploying transformation-invariant models in practical applications, such as satellite imagery, while ensuring compactness and geometric robustness.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel framework combining group equivariant convolutional neural networks (G-CNNs) with equivariant-aware structured pruning to produce compact, transformation-invariant models for resource-constrained environments. Equivariance to rotations is achieved through the C4 cyclic group via the e2cnn library,enabling consistent performance under geometric transformations while reducing computational overhead.
  Our approach introduces structured pruning that preserves equivariant properties by analyzing e2cnn layer structure and applying neuron-level pruning to fully connected components. To mitigate accuracy degradation, we implement adaptive fine-tuning that automatically triggers when accuracy drop exceeds 2%, using early stopping and learning rate scheduling for efficient recovery. The framework includes dynamic INT8 quantization and a comprehensive pipeline encompassing training, knowledge distillation, structured pruning, fine-tuning, and quantization.
  We evaluate our method on satellite imagery (EuroSAT) and standard benchmarks (CIFAR-10, Rotated MNIST) demonstrating effectiveness across diverse domains. Experimental results show 29.3% parameter reduction with significant accuracy recovery, demonstrating that structured pruning of equivariant networks achieves substantial compression while maintaining geometric robustness. Our pipeline provides a reproducible framework for optimizing equivariant models, bridging the gap between group-theoretic network design and practical deployment constraints, with particular relevance to satellite imagery analysis and geometric vision tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper focuses on blind deconvolution for color images by proposing a novel quaternion fidelity term to capture interdependencies among color channels, which results in significant improvements in image deblurring.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing methods for blind deconvolution of color images, which often ignore relationships between color channels and fail to provide an effective solution for accurate deblurring.

Method: The paper introduces a quaternion fidelity term designed for color image deconvolution. The term utilizes a quaternion convolution kernel comprising four components: one capturing overall blur and three addressing specific interdependencies in the red, green, and blue channels. A normalized quaternion kernel is employed to ensure intensity preservation.

Result: Extensive experiments on real datasets demonstrate that the proposed method significantly improves the deblurring effect and effectively removes artifacts in blurred color images.

Conclusion: The proposed approach showcases itself as a powerful tool for color image deconvolution, overcoming existing limitations and improving the accuracy of color deblurring.

Abstract: In this work, we address the challenging problem of blind deconvolution for color images. Existing methods often convert color images to grayscale or process each color channel separately, which overlooking the relationships between color channels. To handle this issue, we formulate a novel quaternion fidelity term designed specifically for color image blind deconvolution. This fidelity term leverages the properties of quaternion convolution kernel, which consists of four kernels: one that functions similarly to a non-negative convolution kernel to capture the overall blur, and three additional convolution kernels without constraints corresponding to red, green and blue channels respectively model their unknown interdependencies. In order to preserve image intensity, we propose to use the normalized quaternion kernel in the blind deconvolution process. Extensive experiments on real datasets of blurred color images show that the proposed method effectively removes artifacts and significantly improves deblurring effect, demonstrating its potential as a powerful tool for color image deconvolution.

*Jiaye Qian,Ge Zheng,Yuchen Zhu,Sibei Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses hallucination issues in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) by analyzing causal pathways and proposing targeted interventions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Vision-Language Models' susceptibility to hallucination impacts their reliability across tasks.

Method: A causal intervention framework aligning with LVLM transformer architecture is introduced to identify and intervene on hallucination pathways.

Result: Experiments on various benchmarks show reduced hallucinations across different alignment formats.

Conclusion: The proposed framework and intervention methods effectively mitigate hallucinations, enhancing LVLM performance and reliability.

Abstract: Despite their impressive performance across a wide range of tasks, Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) remain prone to hallucination. In this study, we propose a comprehensive intervention framework aligned with the transformer's causal architecture in LVLMs, integrating the effects of different intervention paths on hallucination. We find that hallucinations in LVLMs do not arise from a single causal path, but rather from the interplay among image-to-input-text, image-to-output-text, and text-to-text pathways. For the first time, we also find that LVLMs rely on different pathways depending on the question-answer alignment format. Building on these insights, we propose simple yet effective methods to identify and intervene on critical hallucination heads within each pathway, tailored to discriminative and generative formats. Experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our approach consistently reduces hallucinations across diverse alignment types.

*Bulat Khaertdinov,Mirela Popa,Nava Tintarev*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper explores using relevance feedback mechanisms to improve the performance of vision-language models (VLMs) for visual search without fine-tuning the models themselves.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to enhance visual search capabilities of VLMs with relevance feedback for better performance during inference, rather than relying on scaling or fine-tuning.

Method: Four feedback strategies are introduced: pseudo-relevance feedback (PRF), generative relevance feedback (GRF), an attentive feedback summarizer (AFS) that uses multimodal features, and an explicit feedback simulation using ground-truth captions.

Result: The proposed methods improved retrieval performance by 3-5% in MRR@5 for small VLMs and 1-3% for larger ones. AFS and explicit feedback demonstrated stronger robustness in multi-turn retrieval settings.

Conclusion: Relevance feedback mechanisms effectively enhance VLM-based retrieval performance, paving the way for more interactive and adaptive visual search systems.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) enable intuitive visual search using natural language queries. However, improving their performance often requires fine-tuning and scaling to larger model variants. In this work, we propose a mechanism inspired by traditional text-based search to improve retrieval performance at inference time: relevance feedback. While relevance feedback can serve as an alternative to fine-tuning, its model-agnostic design also enables use with fine-tuned VLMs. Specifically, we introduce and evaluate four feedback strategies for VLM-based retrieval. First, we revise classical pseudo-relevance feedback (PRF), which refines query embeddings based on top-ranked results. To address its limitations, we propose generative relevance feedback (GRF), which uses synthetic captions for query refinement. Furthermore, we introduce an attentive feedback summarizer (AFS), a custom transformer-based model that integrates multimodal fine-grained features from relevant items. Finally, we simulate explicit feedback using ground-truth captions as an upper-bound baseline. Experiments on Flickr30k and COCO with the VLM backbones show that GRF, AFS, and explicit feedback improve retrieval performance by 3-5% in MRR@5 for smaller VLMs, and 1-3% for larger ones, compared to retrieval with no feedback. Moreover, AFS, similarly to explicit feedback, mitigates query drift and is more robust than GRF in iterative, multi-turn retrieval settings. Our findings demonstrate that relevance feedback can consistently enhance retrieval across VLMs and open up opportunities for interactive and adaptive visual search.

Motivation: There is a need for diverse and complex real-world point cloud datasets, especially for edge cases, to improve training of autonomous systems. Current synthetic data generation approaches face limitations in realism and efficiency.

Method: The proposed method uses range image projection and semantic mask conditioning for diffusion-based generation of point clouds. Real-world LiDAR scans are transformed into 2D range view images, enabling semantic editing using convex hull-based masks for geometric consistency.

Conclusion: This method offers a cost-effective and scalable solution for generating diverse point cloud data, enhancing the robustness and generalization of autonomous driving systems.

Abstract: Training autonomous driving and navigation systems requires large and diverse point cloud datasets that capture complex edge case scenarios from various dynamic urban settings. Acquiring such diverse scenarios from real-world point cloud data, especially for critical edge cases, is challenging, which restricts system generalization and robustness. Current methods rely on simulating point cloud data within handcrafted 3D virtual environments, which is time-consuming, computationally expensive, and often fails to fully capture the complexity of real-world scenes. To address some of these issues, this research proposes a novel approach that addresses the problem discussed by editing real-world LiDAR scans using semantic mask-based guidance to generate novel synthetic LiDAR point clouds. We incorporate range image projection and semantic mask conditioning to achieve diffusion-based generation. Point clouds are transformed to 2D range view images, which are used as an intermediate representation to enable semantic editing using convex hull-based semantic masks. These masks guide the generation process by providing information on the dimensions, orientations, and locations of objects in the real environment, ensuring geometric consistency and realism. This approach demonstrates high-quality LiDAR point cloud generation, capable of producing complex edge cases and dynamic scenes, as validated on the KITTI-360 dataset. This offers a cost-effective and scalable solution for generating diverse LiDAR data, a step toward improving the robustness of autonomous driving systems.

*Chuancheng Shi,Shangze Li,Shiming Guo,Simiao Xie,Wenhua Wu,Jingtong Dou,Chao Wu,Canran Xiao,Cong Wang,Zifeng Cheng,Fei Shen,Tat-Seng Chua*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper analyzes cultural biases in multilingual text-to-image (T2I) models and proposes methods to improve cultural consistency in generated images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current T2I models generate outputs that are culturally neutral or biased toward English, failing to preserve cultural nuances across languages.

Method: The authors develop a probing technique to identify culture-sensitive neurons and propose two strategies: inference-time cultural activation and layer-targeted cultural enhancement.

Result: The proposed methods enhance cultural consistency in T2I models while maintaining image fidelity and diversity, as demonstrated on the CultureBench dataset.

Conclusion: Addressing cultural biases in T2I models is feasible by targeting culture-sensitive components, leading to improved alignment of images with multilingual prompts.

Abstract: Multilingual text-to-image (T2I) models have advanced rapidly in terms of visual realism and semantic alignment, and are now widely utilized. Yet outputs vary across cultural contexts: because language carries cultural connotations, images synthesized from multilingual prompts should preserve cross-lingual cultural consistency. We conduct a comprehensive analysis showing that current T2I models often produce culturally neutral or English-biased results under multilingual prompts. Analyses of two representative models indicate that the issue stems not from missing cultural knowledge but from insufficient activation of culture-related representations. We propose a probing method that localizes culture-sensitive signals to a small set of neurons in a few fixed layers. Guided by this finding, we introduce two complementary alignment strategies: (1) inference-time cultural activation that amplifies the identified neurons without backbone fine-tuned; and (2) layer-targeted cultural enhancement that updates only culturally relevant layers. Experiments on our CultureBench demonstrate consistent improvements over strong baselines in cultural consistency while preserving fidelity and diversity.

*David Nordström,Johan Edstedt,Fredrik Kahl,Georg Bökman*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents MuM, an extension of masked autoencoding (MAE) for multi-view 3D scene understanding, surpassing the performance of DINOv3 and CroCo v2 in downstream tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve upon existing self-supervised learning methods by focusing on geometric reasoning and 3D vision, which are less developed compared to semantic understanding.

Method: The proposed method extends masked autoencoding (MAE) to multiple views by masking all views uniformly and leveraging a lightweight decoder with inter-frame attention, offering simplicity and scalability.

Result: MuM outperforms state-of-the-art models such as DINOv3 and CroCo v2 in tasks like feedforward reconstruction, dense image matching, and relative pose estimation.

Conclusion: MuM effectively advances self-supervised learning for 3D vision by demonstrating its scalability and superior performance in various 3D and geometric reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning on images seeks to extract meaningful visual representations from unlabeled data. When scaled to large datasets, this paradigm has achieved state-of-the-art performance and the resulting trained models such as DINOv3 have seen widespread adoption. However, most prior efforts are optimized for semantic understanding rather than geometric reasoning. One important exception is Cross-View Completion, CroCo, which is a form of masked autoencoding (MAE) tailored for 3D understanding. In this work, we continue on the path proposed by CroCo and focus on learning features tailored for 3D vision. In a nutshell, we extend MAE to arbitrarily many views of the same scene. By uniformly masking all views and employing a lightweight decoder with inter-frame attention, our approach is inherently simpler and more scalable than CroCo. We evaluate the resulting model, MuM, extensively on downstream tasks including feedforward reconstruction, dense image matching and relative pose estimation, finding that it outperforms the state-of-the-art visual encoders DINOv3 and CroCo v2.

*Wenrui Zhang,Xinggang Wang,Bin Feng,Wenyu Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MolSight, a learning framework for Optical Chemical Structure Recognition (OCSR), is introduced to enhance stereochemical recognition, achieving state-of-the-art results in its domain.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing OCSR systems struggle to accurately interpret stereochemical information due to subtle visual differences in structures like wedge bonds and spatial arrangements.

Method: MolSight applies a three-stage training paradigm: pre-training on large but noisy datasets, multi-granularity fine-tuning with rich supervisory data, and reinforcement learning with the introduction of a stereochemical dataset.

Result: MolSight delivers state-of-the-art performance in recognizing stereochemical structures, overcoming current limitations through its structured training approach.

Conclusion: The proposed framework, despite its compact size, significantly advances stereochemical recognition and optical chemical structure interpretation using innovative strategies like GRPO and targeted datasets.

Abstract: Optical Chemical Structure Recognition (OCSR) plays a pivotal role in modern chemical informatics, enabling the automated conversion of chemical structure images from scientific literature, patents, and educational materials into machine-readable molecular representations. This capability is essential for large-scale chemical data mining, drug discovery pipelines, and Large Language Model (LLM) applications in related domains. However, existing OCSR systems face significant challenges in accurately recognizing stereochemical information due to the subtle visual cues that distinguish stereoisomers, such as wedge and dash bonds, ring conformations, and spatial arrangements. To address these challenges, we propose MolSight, a comprehensive learning framework for OCSR that employs a three-stage training paradigm. In the first stage, we conduct pre-training on large-scale but noisy datasets to endow the model with fundamental perception capabilities for chemical structure images. In the second stage, we perform multi-granularity fine-tuning using datasets with richer supervisory signals, systematically exploring how auxiliary tasks-specifically chemical bond classification and atom localization-contribute to molecular formula recognition. Finally, we employ reinforcement learning for post-training optimization and introduce a novel stereochemical structure dataset. Remarkably, we find that even with MolSight's relatively compact parameter size, the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm can further enhance the model's performance on stereomolecular. Through extensive experiments across diverse datasets, our results demonstrate that MolSight achieves state-of-the-art performance in (stereo)chemical optical structure recognition.

TL;DR: BiFingerPose is a bimodal finger pose estimation algorithm using capacitive images and fingerprints to improve accuracy significantly over prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhance human-computer interaction by overcoming limitations in finger pose estimation on touchscreen devices.

Method: A bimodal approach combining capacitive images and fingerprint patches to estimate finger pose parameters, including roll angle.

Result: BiFingerPose achieves over 21% improvement in accuracy, 2.5x task efficiency, and 23% better user operation accuracy compared to previous methods.

Conclusion: BiFingerPose demonstrates practical superiority, expands application space for enhanced security and user experience, and code is available for further development.

Abstract: Finger pose offers promising opportunities to expand human computer interaction capability of touchscreen devices. Existing finger pose estimation algorithms that can be implemented in portable devices predominantly rely on capacitive images, which are currently limited to estimating pitch and yaw angles and exhibit reduced accuracy when processing large-angle inputs (especially when it is greater than 45 degrees). In this paper, we propose BiFingerPose, a novel bimodal based finger pose estimation algorithm capable of simultaneously and accurately predicting comprehensive finger pose information. A bimodal input is explored, including a capacitive image and a fingerprint patch obtained from the touchscreen with an under-screen fingerprint sensor. Our approach leads to reliable estimation of roll angle, which is not achievable using only a single modality. In addition, the prediction performance of other pose parameters has also been greatly improved. The evaluation of a 12-person user study on continuous and discrete interaction tasks further validated the advantages of our approach. Specifically, BiFingerPose outperforms previous SOTA methods with over 21% improvement in prediction performance, 2.5 times higher task completion efficiency, and 23% better user operation accuracy, demonstrating its practical superiority. Finally, we delineate the application space of finger pose with respect to enhancing authentication security and improving interactive experiences, and develop corresponding prototypes to showcase the interaction potential. Our code will be available at https://github.com/XiongjunGuan/DualFingerPose.

*Jiajie Guo,Qingpeng Zhu,Jin Zeng,Xiaolong Wu,Changyong He,Weida Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SpatialGeo, a model designed to improve spatial reasoning in multimodal large language models through enhanced spatial-aware embeddings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most multimodal large language models have limited spatial reasoning ability due to their vision encoders focusing on instance-level semantic features, neglecting spatial arrangements in 3D space.

Method: SpatialGeo introduces a hierarchical fusion vision encoder that integrates geometry and semantic features, using a hierarchical adapter to complement the CLIP encoder with geometry features from self-supervised learning. The pretrained LLaVA model is further optimized with random feature dropping to foster better spatial grounding.

Result: SpatialGeo demonstrates improved spatial reasoning, enhancing performance by at least 8.0% on SpatialRGPT-Bench while reducing memory usage by approximately 50% during inference.

Conclusion: SpatialGeo successfully addresses spatial ambiguity in large language models by enhancing spatial-awareness, providing significant performance gains while maintaining efficiency. The model's source code is publicly accessible.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved significant progress in image and language tasks due to the strong reasoning capability of large language models (LLMs). Nevertheless, most MLLMs suffer from limited spatial reasoning ability to interpret and infer spatial arrangements in three-dimensional space. In this work, we propose a novel vision encoder based on hierarchical fusion of geometry and semantics features, generating spatial-aware visual embedding and boosting the spatial grounding capability of MLLMs. Specifically, we first unveil that the spatial ambiguity shortcoming stems from the lossy embedding of the vision encoder utilized in most existing MLLMs (e.g., CLIP), restricted to instance-level semantic features. This motivates us to complement CLIP with the geometry features from vision-only self-supervised learning via a hierarchical adapter, enhancing the spatial awareness in the proposed SpatialGeo. The network is efficiently trained using pretrained LLaVA model and optimized with random feature dropping to avoid trivial solutions relying solely on the CLIP encoder. Experimental results show that SpatialGeo improves the accuracy in spatial reasoning tasks, enhancing state-of-the-art models by at least 8.0% in SpatialRGPT-Bench with approximately 50% less memory cost during inference.

### [154] [Non-Parametric Probabilistic Robustness: A Conservative Metric with Optimized Perturbation Distributions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17380)
*Zheng Wang,Yi Zhang,Siddartha Khastgir,Carsten Maple,Xingyu Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces non-parametric probabilistic robustness (NPPR), an improved metric for evaluating deep learning model vulnerabilities to input perturbations, which avoids predefined perturbation distributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models are vulnerable to small input perturbations that lead to errors, and existing probabilistic robustness formulations assume fixed perturbation distributions, which is impractical.

Method: NPPR abandons predefined perturbation distributions by learning optimized perturbation distributions from data using methods such as Gaussian Mixture Models combined with a Multilayer Perceptron model.

Result: Experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny ImageNet show NPPR delivers more conservative probabilistic robustness estimates, improving realism compared to traditional approaches.

Conclusion: NPPR provides a more practical robustness evaluation under distributional uncertainty, solidifying it as a valuable metric for assessing DL model reliability.

Abstract: Deep learning (DL) models, despite their remarkable success, remain vulnerable to small input perturbations that can cause erroneous outputs, motivating the recent proposal of probabilistic robustness (PR) as a complementary alternative to adversarial robustness (AR). However, existing PR formulations assume a fixed and known perturbation distribution, an unrealistic expectation in practice. To address this limitation, we propose non-parametric probabilistic robustness (NPPR), a more practical PR metric that does not rely on any predefined perturbation distribution. Following the non-parametric paradigm in statistical modeling, NPPR learns an optimized perturbation distribution directly from data, enabling conservative PR evaluation under distributional uncertainty. We further develop an NPPR estimator based on a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) with Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) heads and bicubic up-sampling, covering various input-dependent and input-independent perturbation scenarios. Theoretical analyses establish the relationships among AR, PR, and NPPR. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny ImageNet across ResNet18/50, WideResNet50 and VGG16 validate NPPR as a more practical robustness metric, showing up to 40\% more conservative (lower) PR estimates compared to assuming those common perturbation distributions used in state-of-the-arts.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces NoPe-NeRF++, a technique that enhances Neural Radiance Fields training without prior camera poses, combining local and global optimization for better pose estimation and novel view synthesis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods like NoPe-NeRF struggle in complex scenarios due to reliance on local image relationships for camera pose estimation.

Method: The approach combines explicit feature matching for pose initialization, local joint optimization for training NeRF representation, and global optimization incorporating geometric consistency through bundle adjustment.

Result: NoPe-NeRF++ achieves superior pose estimation accuracy and novel view synthesis quality compared to state-of-the-art methods, validated by extensive evaluations on benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: The paper successfully demonstrates the integration of local and global cues in NeRF training, improving robustness and performance for challenging scenes.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce NoPe-NeRF++, a novel local-to-global optimization algorithm for training Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) without requiring pose priors. Existing methods, particularly NoPe-NeRF, which focus solely on the local relationships within images, often struggle to recover accurate camera poses in complex scenarios. To overcome the challenges, our approach begins with a relative pose initialization with explicit feature matching, followed by a local joint optimization to enhance the pose estimation for training a more robust NeRF representation. This method significantly improves the quality of initial poses. Additionally, we introduce global optimization phase that incorporates geometric consistency constraints through bundle adjustment, which integrates feature trajectories to further refine poses and collectively boost the quality of NeRF. Notably, our method is the first work that seamlessly combines the local and global cues with NeRF, and outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both pose estimation accuracy and novel view synthesis. Extensive evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate our superior performance and robustness, even in challenging scenes, thus validating our design choices.

### [156] [Refracting Reality: Generating Images with Realistic Transparent Objects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17340)
*Yue Yin,Enze Tao,Dylan Campbell*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This work improves generative image models in accurately rendering transparent objects with refraction, using Snell’s Law and image synchronization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generative models struggle with synthesizing transparent objects involving complex optical phenomena like refraction, reflection, and scattering.

Method: The authors propose a method synchronizing image pixels via Snell's Law for refracting surfaces and use a secondary panoramic image for unobserved surfaces, applying warping and merging operations.

Result: The proposed approach generates images of transparent objects that adhere to optical laws more accurately and plausibly.

Conclusion: By incorporating physical laws like Snell’s Law, this method significantly enhances the optical plausibility in generating images of transparent objects, addressing a critical limitation in generative models.

Abstract: Generative image models can produce convincingly real images, with plausible shapes, textures, layouts and lighting. However, one domain in which they perform notably poorly is in the synthesis of transparent objects, which exhibit refraction, reflection, absorption and scattering. Refraction is a particular challenge, because refracted pixel rays often intersect with surfaces observed in other parts of the image, providing a constraint on the color. It is clear from inspection that generative models have not distilled the laws of optics sufficiently well to accurately render refractive objects. In this work, we consider the problem of generating images with accurate refraction, given a text prompt. We synchronize the pixels within the object's boundary with those outside by warping and merging the pixels using Snell's Law of Refraction, at each step of the generation trajectory. For those surfaces that are not directly observed in the image, but are visible via refraction or reflection, we recover their appearance by synchronizing the image with a second generated image -- a panorama centered at the object -- using the same warping and merging procedure. We demonstrate that our approach generates much more optically-plausible images that respect the physical constraints.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel framework for generating painting processes across different media, overcoming limitations in traditional video tutorials and generative models, while achieving consistency and human-aligned artistic workflows.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of interactivity and personalization in existing painting tutorials and to overcome limitations in generative models that struggle with cross-media generalization and structural inconsistencies.

Method: A unified framework is proposed with semantics-driven style control, cross-medium style augmentation, a reverse-painting training strategy, and a large-scale dataset for ensuring cross-media consistency, temporal coherence, and fidelity.

Result: The method achieves strong performance on metrics like LPIPS, DINO, and CLIP, and introduces a Perceptual Distance Profile (PDP) curve that mirrors human creative workflows.

Conclusion: The framework provides a significant advancement in generating realistic and faithful painting processes, enabling cross-media process transfer with human-like artistic progression.

Abstract: Step-by-step painting tutorials are vital for learning artistic techniques, but existing video resources (e.g., YouTube) lack interactivity and personalization. While recent generative models have advanced artistic image synthesis, they struggle to generalize across media and often show temporal or structural inconsistencies, hindering faithful reproduction of human creative workflows. To address this, we propose a unified framework for multi-media painting process generation with a semantics-driven style control mechanism that embeds multiple media into a diffusion models conditional space and uses cross-medium style augmentation. This enables consistent texture evolution and process transfer across styles. A reverse-painting training strategy further ensures smooth, human-aligned generation. We also build a large-scale dataset of real painting processes and evaluate cross-media consistency, temporal coherence, and final-image fidelity, achieving strong results on LPIPS, DINO, and CLIP metrics. Finally, our Perceptual Distance Profile (PDP) curve quantitatively models the creative sequence, i.e., composition, color blocking, and detail refinement, mirroring human artistic progression.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reducing reliance on large, manually labeled datasets for skeleton-based action recognition, as their collection is expensive and time-intensive.

Method: The paper uses graph convolutional networks (GCNs) with a novel acquisition function combining representativity, diversity, and uncertainty. It further employs an invertible GCN to map data into latent spaces for improved data distribution capture.

Result: Experiments on two skeleton-based datasets show high effectiveness and competitive performance compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The label-efficient GCN approach significantly reduces labeling effort while maintaining strong recognition performance, proving its practical value for skeleton-based action tasks.

Abstract: Skeleton-based action recognition is a hotspot in image processing. A key challenge of this task lies in its dependence on large, manually labeled datasets whose acquisition is costly and time-consuming. This paper devises a novel, label-efficient method for skeleton-based action recognition using graph convolutional networks (GCNs). The contribution of the proposed method resides in learning a novel acquisition function -- scoring the most informative subsets for labeling -- as the optimum of an objective function mixing data representativity, diversity and uncertainty. We also extend this approach by learning the most informative subsets using an invertible GCN which allows mapping data from ambient to latent spaces where the inherent distribution of the data is more easily captured. Extensive experiments, conducted on two challenging skeleton-based recognition datasets, show the effectiveness and the outperformance of our label-frugal GCNs against the related work.

*Xiangteng He,Shunsuke Sakai,Kun Yuan,Nicolas Padoy,Tatsuhito Hasegawa,Leonid Sigal*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DSeq-JEPA improves visual representation learning by introducing sequential prediction of discriminative regions, outperforming existing methods across multiple visual tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address limitations in I-JEPA, which lacks selective and sequential prediction, by simulating human-like visual attention for better visual understanding.

Method: DSeq-JEPA integrates JEPA-style latent prediction with GPT-style sequential reasoning. It first uses saliency maps to identify primary discriminative regions, followed by a progressive curriculum-like prediction of subsequent regions.

Result: Extensive experiments show DSeq-JEPA achieves better performance in tasks like image classification, fine-grained categorization, detection, segmentation, and reasoning, outperforming I-JEPA variants.

Conclusion: The proposed DSeq-JEPA provides a human-inspired approach to visual representation learning, achieving more discriminative and generalizable features.

Abstract: Image-based Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture (I-JEPA) learns visual representations by predicting latent embeddings of masked regions from visible context. However, it treats all regions uniformly and independently, lacking an explicit notion of where or in what order predictions should be made. Inspired by human visual perception, which deploys attention selectively and sequentially from the most informative to secondary regions, we propose DSeq-JEPA, a Discriminative Sequential Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture that bridges predictive and autoregressive self-supervised learning, integrating JEPA-style latent prediction with GPT-style sequential reasoning. Specifically, DSeq-JEPA (i) first identifies primary discriminative regions based on a transformer-derived saliency map, emphasizing the distribution of visual importance, and then (ii) predicts subsequent regions in this discriminative order, progressively forming a curriculum-like semantic progression from primary to secondary cues -- a form of GPT-style pre-training. Extensive experiments across diverse tasks, including image classification (ImageNet), fine-grained visual categorization (iNaturalist21, CUB-200-2011, Stanford-Cars), detection and segmentation (MS-COCO, ADE20K), and low-level reasoning tasks (Clevr/Count, Clevr/Dist), demonstrate that DSeq-JEPA consistently focuses on more discriminative and generalizable representations than I-JEPA variants.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Unified Attention-Mamba (UAM) backbone for cell-level radiomics analysis to improve cancer diagnosis, achieving state-of-the-art performance in classification and segmentation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing radiomics studies focus on slide-level or patch-level tumor classification, leaving cell-level radiomics analysis underexplored. Furthermore, there is no specialized backbone architecture for handling radiomics data effectively.

Method: The authors design the Unified Attention-Mamba (UAM) backbone, which flexibly integrates attention and Mamba modules in a unified architecture. This backbone eliminates manual ratio tuning and enhances encoding capability. It is further developed into a multimodal framework for cell classification and tumor segmentation.

Result: UAM achieved state-of-the-art performance, improving cell classification accuracy from 74% to 78% (n=349,882 cells) and tumor segmentation precision from 75% to 80% (n=406 patches) on public benchmarks.

Conclusion: The UAM backbone demonstrates its effectiveness and extensibility as a multimodal foundation in radiomics-driven cancer diagnosis, enhancing both diagnostic accuracy and AI interpretability.

Abstract: Cell-level radiomics features provide fine-grained insights into tumor phenotypes and have the potential to significantly enhance diagnostic accuracy on hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) images. By capturing micro-level morphological and intensity patterns, these features support more precise tumor identification and improve AI interpretability by highlighting diagnostically relevant cells for pathologist review. However, most existing studies focus on slide-level or patch-level tumor classification, leaving cell-level radiomics analysis largely unexplored. Moreover, there is currently no dedicated backbone specifically designed for radiomics data. Inspired by the recent success of the Mamba architecture in vision and language domains, we introduce a Unified Attention-Mamba (UAM) backbone for cell-level classification using radiomics features. Unlike previous hybrid approaches that integrate Attention and Mamba modules in fixed proportions, our unified design flexibly combines their capabilities within a single cohesive architecture, eliminating the need for manual ratio tuning and improving encode capability. We develop two UAM variants to comprehensively evaluate the benefits of this unified structure. Building on this backbone, we further propose a multimodal UAM framework that jointly performs cell-level classification and image segmentation. Experimental results demonstrate that UAM achieves state-of-the-art performance across both tasks on public benchmarks, surpassing leading image-based foundation models. It improves cell classification accuracy from 74% to 78% ($n$=349,882 cells), and tumor segmentation precision from 75% to 80% ($n$=406 patches). These findings highlight the effectiveness and promise of UAM as a unified and extensible multimodal foundation for radiomics-driven cancer diagnosis.

*Seamie Hayes,Reenu Mohandas,Tim Brophy,Alexandre Boulch,Ganesh Sistu,Ciaran Eising*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SuperQuadricOcc, a method for semantic occupancy estimation using superquadrics to achieve reduced memory, faster inference, and improved performance compared to Gaussian-based approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations of Gaussian-based semantic occupancy estimation methods, which require high memory and are unsuitable for real-time inference, by leveraging superquadrics for more efficient scene representation.

Method: SuperQuadricOcc incorporates superquadrics into occupancy estimation through a multi-layer icosphere-tessellated Gaussian approximation, enabling Gaussian rasterization for effective model supervision during training.

Result: On the Occ3D dataset, the method achieves a 75% reduction in memory usage, 124% faster inference, and a 5.9% improvement in mIoU compared to Gaussian-based methods, while removing the need for temporal labels.

Conclusion: SuperQuadricOcc demonstrates competitive performance while enabling real-time inference with reduced primitives and lower memory requirements, marking a significant advancement in semantic occupancy estimation for automated driving.

Abstract: Semantic occupancy estimation enables comprehensive scene understanding for automated driving, providing dense spatial and semantic information essential for perception and planning. While Gaussian representations have been widely adopted in self-supervised occupancy estimation, the deployment of a large number of Gaussian primitives drastically increases memory requirements and is not suitable for real-time inference. In contrast, superquadrics permit reduced primitive count and lower memory requirements due to their diverse shape set. However, implementation into a self-supervised occupancy model is nontrivial due to the absence of a superquadric rasterizer to enable model supervision. Our proposed method, SuperQuadricOcc, employs a superquadric-based scene representation. By leveraging a multi-layer icosphere-tessellated Gaussian approximation of superquadrics, we enable Gaussian rasterization for supervision during training. On the Occ3D dataset, SuperQuadricOcc achieves a 75\% reduction in memory footprint, 124\% faster inference, and a 5.9\% improvement in mIoU compared to previous Gaussian-based methods, without the use of temporal labels. To our knowledge, this is the first occupancy model to enable real-time inference while maintaining competitive performance. The use of superquadrics reduces the number of primitives required for scene modeling by 84\% relative to Gaussian-based approaches. Finally, evaluation against prior methods is facilitated by our fast superquadric voxelization module. The code will be released as open source.

*Linxiang Su,András Balogh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CLIP models, while strong in zero-shot image-text matching, are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. This paper introduces a method called ATAC, which enhances robustness effectively through test-time embedding adjustments with minimal computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limited robustness of CLIP models against adversarial image perturbations, as existing adversarial fine-tuning is costly and current test-time defenses show limited effectiveness.

Method: The proposed ATAC strategy operates in the embedding space of CLIP, leveraging augmentation-induced latent drift vectors to infer semantic recovery directions and correct embeddings based on angular consistency.

Result: ATAC consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods by approximately 50% in robustness across benchmarks and requires minimal computational resources. It also displays robustness in extreme and adaptive attack scenarios.

Conclusion: ATAC demonstrates an efficient, highly robust test-time adversarial defense strategy, establishing a novel paradigm for defending CLIP in its embedding space.

Abstract: Despite its remarkable success in zero-shot image-text matching, CLIP remains highly vulnerable to adversarial perturbations on images. As adversarial fine-tuning is prohibitively costly, recent works explore various test-time defense strategies; however, these approaches still exhibit limited robustness. In this work, we revisit this problem and propose a simple yet effective strategy: Augmentation-based Test-time Adversarial Correction (ATAC). Our method operates directly in the embedding space of CLIP, calculating augmentation-induced drift vectors to infer a semantic recovery direction and correcting the embedding based on the angular consistency of these latent drifts. Across a wide range of benchmarks, ATAC consistently achieves remarkably high robustness, surpassing that of previous state-of-the-art methods by nearly 50\% on average, all while requiring minimal computational overhead. Furthermore, ATAC retains state-of-the-art robustness in unconventional and extreme settings and even achieves nontrivial robustness against adaptive attacks. Our results demonstrate that ATAC is an efficient method in a novel paradigm for test-time adversarial defenses in the embedding space of CLIP.

Method: The method extends sparse voxel rasterization by integrating SDFs with two key contributions: geometric initialization using a visual geometry model and a spatial smoothness loss to ensure coherent relationships among voxels.

Result: Experiments demonstrate strong reconstruction accuracy with fast convergence across various benchmarks.

Conclusion: SVRecon offers a novel approach to high-fidelity surface reconstruction, combining accuracy and computational efficiency. The code will be publicly shared for wider use.

Abstract: We extend the recently proposed sparse voxel rasterization paradigm to the task of high-fidelity surface reconstruction by integrating Signed Distance Function (SDF), named SVRecon. Unlike 3D Gaussians, sparse voxels are spatially disentangled from their neighbors and have sharp boundaries, which makes them prone to local minima during optimization. Although SDF values provide a naturally smooth and continuous geometric field, preserving this smoothness across independently parameterized sparse voxels is nontrivial. To address this challenge, we promote coherent and smooth voxel-wise structure through (1) robust geometric initialization using a visual geometry model and (2) a spatial smoothness loss that enforces coherent relationships across parent-child and sibling voxel groups. Extensive experiments across various benchmarks show that our method achieves strong reconstruction accuracy while having consistently speedy convergence. The code will be made public.

Conclusion: The study helps tackle equity issues in AI, emphasizing diversity and ethics, and paves the way for inclusive and reliable face verification systems.

Abstract: Face verification is a significant component of identity authentication in various applications including online banking and secure access to personal devices. The majority of the existing face image datasets often suffer from notable biases related to race, gender, and other demographic characteristics, limiting the effectiveness and fairness of face verification systems. In response to these challenges, we propose a comprehensive methodology that integrates advanced generative models to create varied and diverse high-quality synthetic face images. This methodology emphasizes the representation of a diverse range of facial traits, ensuring adherence to characteristics permissible in identity card photographs. Furthermore, we introduce the Diverse and Inclusive Faces for Verification (DIF-V) dataset, comprising 27,780 images of 926 unique identities, designed as a benchmark for future research in face verification. Our analysis reveals that existing verification models exhibit biases toward certain genders and races, and notably, applying identity style modifications negatively impacts model performance. By tackling the inherent inequities in existing datasets, this work not only enriches the discussion on diversity and ethics in artificial intelligence but also lays the foundation for developing more inclusive and reliable face verification technologies

*Sukwon Yun,Heming Yao,Burkhard Hoeckendorf,David Richmond,Aviv Regev,Russell Littman*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces MoE-ViT, a Sparse Mixture-of-Experts-based architecture to optimize Vision Transformers for multi-channel imaging, focusing on computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Vision Transformers struggle with computational inefficiency in modeling cross-channel attention for multi-channel data like cell painting and satellite images.

Method: The paper proposes MoE-ViT, which treats each image channel as an expert and uses a lightweight router to selectively include the most relevant channels per patch, reducing the computational load.

Result: MoE-ViT significantly enhances efficiency without performance degradation, validated on JUMP-CP and So2Sat datasets.

Conclusion: MoE-ViT effectively addresses the efficiency challenge for multi-channel imaging, making it a promising backbone for such applications.

Abstract: Vision Transformers ($\text{ViTs}$) have become the backbone of vision foundation models, yet their optimization for multi-channel domains - such as cell painting or satellite imagery - remains underexplored. A key challenge in these domains is capturing interactions between channels, as each channel carries different information. While existing works have shown efficacy by treating each channel independently during tokenization, this approach naturally introduces a major computational bottleneck in the attention block - channel-wise comparisons leads to a quadratic growth in attention, resulting in excessive $\text{FLOPs}$ and high training cost. In this work, we shift focus from efficacy to the overlooked efficiency challenge in cross-channel attention and ask: "Is it necessary to model all channel interactions?". Inspired by the philosophy of Sparse Mixture-of-Experts ($\text{MoE}$), we propose MoE-ViT, a Mixture-of-Experts architecture for multi-channel images in $\text{ViTs}$, which treats each channel as an expert and employs a lightweight router to select only the most relevant experts per patch for attention. Proof-of-concept experiments on real-world datasets - JUMP-CP and So2Sat - demonstrate that $\text{MoE-ViT}$ achieves substantial efficiency gains without sacrificing, and in some cases enhancing, performance, making it a practical and attractive backbone for multi-channel imaging.

*Runxun Zhang,Yizhou Liu,Li Dongrui,Bo XU,Jingwei Wei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MorphSeek introduces a fine-grained policy optimization approach for deformable image registration, achieving improved accuracy and efficiency in high-dimensional medical imaging tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deformable image registration is crucial but challenging due to high-dimensional deformation spaces and insufficient voxel-level supervision.

Method: MorphSeek utilizes a spatially continuous optimization in latent feature space, combining unsupervised warm-up and weakly supervised fine-tuning with Group Relative Policy Optimization.

Result: MorphSeek achieved consistent Dice score improvements over baselines across three 3D registration datasets while enhancing label efficiency and maintaining low computational costs.

Conclusion: The framework offers an efficient and scalable solution for visual alignment in complex high-dimensional medical image analysis tasks.

Abstract: Deformable image registration (DIR) remains a fundamental yet challenging problem in medical image analysis, largely due to the prohibitively high-dimensional deformation space of dense displacement fields and the scarcity of voxel-level supervision. Existing reinforcement learning frameworks often project this space into coarse, low-dimensional representations, limiting their ability to capture spatially variant deformations. We propose MorphSeek, a fine-grained representation-level policy optimization paradigm that reformulates DIR as a spatially continuous optimization process in the latent feature space. MorphSeek introduces a stochastic Gaussian policy head atop the encoder to model a distribution over latent features, facilitating efficient exploration and coarse-to-fine refinement. The framework integrates unsupervised warm-up with weakly supervised fine-tuning through Group Relative Policy Optimization, where multi-trajectory sampling stabilizes training and improves label efficiency. Across three 3D registration benchmarks (OASIS brain MRI, LiTS liver CT, and Abdomen MR-CT), MorphSeek achieves consistent Dice improvements over competitive baselines while maintaining high label efficiency with minimal parameter cost and low step-level latency overhead. Beyond optimizer specifics, MorphSeek advances a representation-level policy learning paradigm that achieves spatially coherent and data-efficient deformation optimization, offering a principled, backbone-agnostic, and optimizer-agnostic solution for scalable visual alignment in high-dimensional settings.

### [167] [MCMoE: Completing Missing Modalities with Mixture of Experts for Incomplete Multimodal Action Quality Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17397)
*Huangbiao Xu,Huanqi Wu,Xiao Ke,Junyi Wu,Rui Xu,Jinglin Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a Missing Completion Framework with Mixture of Experts (MCMoE) to effectively address missing modality issues in multimodal action quality assessment (AQA), achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal AQA aims to utilize complementary contextual cues for fine-grained action evaluation. However, existing models fail or degrade significantly when some modalities are missing during inference, creating a need for a robust system that handles incomplete modalities without performance loss.

Method: The authors propose MCMoE, which integrates unimodal and joint representation learning in a single training stage. Key innovations include an adaptive gated modality generator to reconstruct missing modalities and modality experts that refine and dynamically mix unimodal knowledge for robust cross-modal representations.

Result: The proposed MCMoE achieves state-of-the-art performance on three public AQA benchmarks for complete and incomplete multimodal scenarios, demonstrating its ability to handle missing modalities effectively.

Conclusion: The MCMoE framework provides a robust solution to incomplete modalities in multimodal AQA, offering improved generalization by reconstructing and refining missing inputs while leveraging unimodal and cross-modal knowledge.

Abstract: Multimodal Action Quality Assessment (AQA) has recently emerged as a promising paradigm. By leveraging complementary information across shared contextual cues, it enhances the discriminative evaluation of subtle intra-class variations in highly similar action sequences. However, partial modalities are frequently unavailable at the inference stage in reality. The absence of any modality often renders existing multimodal models inoperable. Furthermore, it triggers catastrophic performance degradation due to interruptions in cross-modal interactions. To address this issue, we propose a novel Missing Completion Framework with Mixture of Experts (MCMoE) that unifies unimodal and joint representation learning in single-stage training. Specifically, we propose an adaptive gated modality generator that dynamically fuses available information to reconstruct missing modalities. We then design modality experts to learn unimodal knowledge and dynamically mix the knowledge of all experts to extract cross-modal joint representations. With a mixture of experts, missing modalities are further refined and complemented. Finally, in the training phase, we mine the complete multimodal features and unimodal expert knowledge to guide modality generation and generation-based joint representation extraction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our MCMoE achieves state-of-the-art results in both complete and incomplete multimodal learning on three public AQA benchmarks.

### [168] [Preventing Shortcut Learning in Medical Image Analysis through Intermediate Layer Knowledge Distillation from Specialist Teachers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17421)
*Christopher Boland,Sotirios Tsaftaris,Sonia Dahdouh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Deep learning models often learn shortcuts from irrelevant features, which can reduce their robustness, particularly in medical imaging. This paper proposes a knowledge distillation framework using a fine-tuned teacher network to reduce shortcut learning in student networks, demonstrating significant improvements across datasets and architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models often rely on shortcuts from spurious correlations in training data, particularly in high-stakes fields like medical imaging. This leads to reduced usage of meaningful features, risking patient harm and poor robustness in predictions.

Method: The authors propose a knowledge distillation framework where a teacher network, fine-tuned on task-relevant data, guides a student network trained on biased data. It leverages intermediate network layers to counteract shortcuts and uses multiple datasets and architectures to validate the approach.

Result: The proposed framework outperforms traditional bias-mitigation techniques in experiments with CheXpert, ISIC 2017, and SimBA datasets. It achieves results comparable to bias-free training even on out-of-distribution test data.

Conclusion: The knowledge distillation approach effectively mitigates shortcut learning in medical imaging, making it practical for real-world scenarios with limited bias annotations. It improves model robustness while maintaining performance on biased and out-of-distribution data.

Abstract: Deep learning models are prone to learning shortcut solutions to problems using spuriously correlated yet irrelevant features of their training data. In high-risk applications such as medical image analysis, this phenomenon may prevent models from using clinically meaningful features when making predictions, potentially leading to poor robustness and harm to patients. We demonstrate that different types of shortcuts (those that are diffuse and spread throughout the image, as well as those that are localized to specific areas) manifest distinctly across network layers and can, therefore, be more effectively targeted through mitigation strategies that target the intermediate layers. We propose a novel knowledge distillation framework that leverages a teacher network fine-tuned on a small subset of task-relevant data to mitigate shortcut learning in a student network trained on a large dataset corrupted with a bias feature. Through extensive experiments on CheXpert, ISIC 2017, and SimBA datasets using various architectures (ResNet-18, AlexNet, DenseNet-121, and 3D CNNs), we demonstrate consistent improvements over traditional Empirical Risk Minimization, augmentation-based bias-mitigation, and group-based bias-mitigation approaches. In many cases, we achieve comparable performance with a baseline model trained on bias-free data, even on out-of-distribution test data. Our results demonstrate the practical applicability of our approach to real-world medical imaging scenarios where bias annotations are limited and shortcut features are difficult to identify a priori.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces RS-FMD, a database of over 150 remote sensing foundation models (RSFMs), and REMSA, an LLM-based agent for selecting RSFMs from natural language queries, effectively simplifying model selection for remote sensing tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to simplify the challenging and complex process of selecting appropriate RSFMs, which is made difficult by heterogeneous documentation, diverse formats, and different deployment constraints.

Method: The authors developed the RS-FMD database, which comprises over 150 RSFMs across multiple data modalities, and introduced REMSA, an LLM-based agent that interprets user requirements, handles missing constraints, ranks models using in-context learning, and justifies its selections.

Result: The proposed REMSA agent outperformed baseline models like naive agents, dense retrieval, and RAG-based LLMs across a benchmark of 75 expert-verified RS query scenarios with 900 configurations.

Conclusion: The work enhances the accessibility and effectiveness of RSFM selection, providing a structured, transparent approach through the RS-FMD database and REMSA agent, while ensuring public and secure data usage.

Abstract: Foundation Models (FMs) are increasingly used in remote sensing (RS) for tasks such as environmental monitoring, disaster assessment, and land-use mapping. These models include unimodal vision encoders trained on a single data modality and multimodal architectures trained on combinations of SAR, multispectral, hyperspectral, and image-text data. They support diverse RS tasks including semantic segmentation, image classification, change detection, and visual question answering. However, selecting an appropriate remote sensing foundation model (RSFM) remains difficult due to scattered documentation, heterogeneous formats, and varied deployment constraints. We introduce the RSFM Database (RS-FMD), a structured resource covering over 150 RSFMs spanning multiple data modalities, resolutions, and learning paradigms. Built on RS-FMD, we present REMSA, the first LLM-based agent for automated RSFM selection from natural language queries. REMSA interprets user requirements, resolves missing constraints, ranks candidate models using in-context learning, and provides transparent justifications. We also propose a benchmark of 75 expert-verified RS query scenarios, producing 900 configurations under an expert-centered evaluation protocol. REMSA outperforms several baselines, including naive agents, dense retrieval, and unstructured RAG-based LLMs. It operates entirely on publicly available metadata and does not access private or sensitive data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhancing adversarial robustness of vision-language models deployed in safety-critical applications.

Method: MMT-ARD uses a dual-teacher knowledge fusion approach, adaptive weight allocation based on teacher confidence, and sigmoid-based weighting to balance multi-modal knowledge transfer.

Result: MMT-ARD improves robust accuracy (+4.32%) and zero-shot accuracy (+3.5%) on a ViT-B-32 model, also increasing training efficiency by 2.3x.

Conclusion: The framework effectively and efficiently enhances adversarial robustness in multimodal models, providing scalability and improved performance in adversarial settings.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are increasingly deployed in safety-critical applications, making their adversarial robustness a crucial concern. While adversarial knowledge distillation has shown promise in transferring robustness from teacher to student models, traditional single-teacher approaches suffer from limited knowledge diversity, slow convergence, and difficulty in balancing robustness and accuracy. To address these challenges, we propose MMT-ARD: a Multimodal Multi-Teacher Adversarial Robust Distillation framework. Our key innovation is a dual-teacher knowledge fusion architecture that collaboratively optimizes clean feature preservation and robust feature enhancement. To better handle challenging adversarial examples, we introduce a dynamic weight allocation strategy based on teacher confidence, enabling adaptive focus on harder samples. Moreover, to mitigate bias among teachers, we design an adaptive sigmoid-based weighting function that balances the strength of knowledge transfer across modalities. Extensive experiments on ImageNet and zero-shot benchmarks demonstrate that MMT-ARD improves robust accuracy by +4.32% and zero-shot accuracy by +3.5% on the ViT-B-32 model, while achieving a 2.3x increase in training efficiency over traditional single-teacher methods. These results highlight the effectiveness and scalability of MMT-ARD in enhancing the adversarial robustness of multimodal large models.

Motivation: To address the challenge in digital content creation of decomposing flat images into editable, ordered layers, mimicking an artist’s compositional process.

Method: The authors propose Illustrator's Depth and train a neural network on layered vector graphic datasets to infer layer indices for pixels directly from raster inputs.

Result: The method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in image vectorization and enables applications such as text-to-vector graphics generation, 3D relief generation from 2D images, and depth-aware editing.

Conclusion: Reframing depth as a creative abstraction, rather than a physical quantity, provides a new foundation for editable image decomposition and expands applications in digital content creation.

Abstract: We introduce Illustrator's Depth, a novel definition of depth that addresses a key challenge in digital content creation: decomposing flat images into editable, ordered layers. Inspired by an artist's compositional process, illustrator's depth infers a layer index to each pixel, forming an interpretable image decomposition through a discrete, globally consistent ordering of elements optimized for editability. We also propose and train a neural network using a curated dataset of layered vector graphics to predict layering directly from raster inputs. Our layer index inference unlocks a range of powerful downstream applications. In particular, it significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines for image vectorization while also enabling high-fidelity text-to-vector-graphics generation, automatic 3D relief generation from 2D images, and intuitive depth-aware editing. By reframing depth from a physical quantity to a creative abstraction, illustrator's depth prediction offers a new foundation for editable image decomposition.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitation of semantic segmentation networks, which fail to generalize across different lidar sensors without intervention, especially under domain shifts.

Method: The study explores unsupervised image-to-lidar knowledge distillation and identifies optimal configurations like using robust VFM features, a pretrained backbone architecture, and an MLP head.

Result: The proposed pipeline demonstrates superior adaptation performance across four challenging benchmark settings, achieving state-of-the-art results.

Conclusion: The study confirms the effectiveness of a universal pretrained backbone with a frozen structure and a trainable MLP head for cross-domain generalization in lidar point cloud segmentation. The pipeline emphasizes efficiency and robustness. Code will be openly shared.

Abstract: Semantic segmentation networks trained under full supervision for one type of lidar fail to generalize to unseen lidars without intervention. To reduce the performance gap under domain shifts, a recent trend is to leverage vision foundation models (VFMs) providing robust features across domains. In this work, we conduct an exhaustive study to identify recipes for exploiting VFMs in unsupervised domain adaptation for semantic segmentation of lidar point clouds. Building upon unsupervised image-to-lidar knowledge distillation, our study reveals that: (1) the architecture of the lidar backbone is key to maximize the generalization performance on a target domain; (2) it is possible to pretrain a single backbone once and for all, and use it to address many domain shifts; (3) best results are obtained by keeping the pretrained backbone frozen and training an MLP head for semantic segmentation. The resulting pipeline achieves state-of-the-art results in four widely-recognized and challenging settings. The code will be available at: https://github.com/valeoai/muddos.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in accurately estimating traveled distances using GPR images, especially in adverse weather and environments, by improving odometry methods with advancements in neural networks.

Method: The proposed custom neural network extracts and analyzes multi-scale similarity and difference features of consecutive GPR B-scan images to estimate Euclidean distances.

Conclusion: The proposed neural network effectively improves precision in GPR-based robot/vehicle localization, making it a promising solution for challenging environments.

Abstract: When performing robot/vehicle localization using ground penetrating radar (GPR) to handle adverse weather and environmental conditions, existing techniques often struggle to accurately estimate distances when processing B-scan images with minor distinctions. This study introduces a new neural network-based odometry method that leverages the similarity and difference features of GPR B-scan images for precise estimation of the Euclidean distances traveled between the B-scan images. The new custom neural network extracts multi-scale features from B-scan images taken at consecutive moments and then determines the Euclidean distance traveled by analyzing the similarities and differences between these features. To evaluate our method, an ablation study and comparison experiments have been conducted using the publicly available CMU-GPR dataset. The experimental results show that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art counterparts in all tests. Specifically, our method achieves a root mean square error (RMSE), and achieves an overall weighted RMSE of 0.449 m across all data sets, which is a 10.2\% reduction in RMSE when compared to the best state-of-the-art method.

TL;DR: The paper introduces CWMDT, a framework enabling counterfactual reasoning in video-based world models using structured representations and large language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to answer counterfactual queries in world models is increasing, especially for analyzing physical AI behavior under varying conditions. Current models struggle with modifying specific scene properties in predictions.

Method: CWMDT builds digital twins of scenes as structured text representations and utilizes large language models for reasoning. It then conditions video diffusion models to generate counterfactual visual predictions.

Result: CWMDT achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark tests, showcasing its effectiveness in counterfactual reasoning via structured representations.

Conclusion: Digital twin representations combined with reasoning and video generation techniques can significantly enhance counterfactual reasoning in video-based world models.

Abstract: World models learn to predict the temporal evolution of visual observations given a control signal, potentially enabling agents to reason about environments through forward simulation. Because of the focus on forward simulation, current world models generate predictions based on factual observations. For many emerging applications, such as comprehensive evaluations of physical AI behavior under varying conditions, the ability of world models to answer counterfactual queries, such as "what would happen if this object was removed?", is of increasing importance. We formalize counterfactual world models that additionally take interventions as explicit inputs, predicting temporal sequences under hypothetical modifications to observed scene properties. Traditional world models operate directly on entangled pixel-space representations where object properties and relationships cannot be selectively modified. This modeling choice prevents targeted interventions on specific scene properties. We introduce CWMDT, a framework to overcome those limitations, turning standard video diffusion models into effective counterfactual world models. First, CWMDT constructs digital twins of observed scenes to explicitly encode objects and their relationships, represented as structured text. Second, CWMDT applies large language models to reason over these representations and predict how a counterfactual intervention propagates through time to alter the observed scene. Third, CWMDT conditions a video diffusion model with the modified representation to generate counterfactual visual sequences. Evaluations on two benchmarks show that the CWMDT approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, suggesting that alternative representations of videos, such as the digital twins considered here, offer powerful control signals for video forward simulation-based world models.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Radar2Shape, a machine learning model that reconstructs 3D objects from radar signals even when data is incomplete or limited. It demonstrates robustness across simulated and real-world conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurately reconstructing 3D objects from radar signals is a challenge due to signal complexity and limited viewing angles, which are critical for aerospace and commercial uses.

Method: Radar2Shape employs a denoising diffusion model through a two-stage approach: first it builds a latent space with shape features, then performs frequency-based conditioned diffusion.

Result: Radar2Shape effectively reconstructs arbitrary 3D objects from partial radar signals, showing generalization across simulated and real-world data. Two benchmark datasets are released for further study.

Conclusion: Radar2Shape demonstrates that its novel approach solves key issues in 3D reconstruction from radar signals, paving the way for advancements in radar-based modeling systems.

Abstract: Determining the shape of 3D objects from high-frequency radar signals is analytically complex but critical for commercial and aerospace applications. Previous deep learning methods have been applied to radar modeling; however, they often fail to represent arbitrary shapes or have difficulty with real-world radar signals which are collected over limited viewing angles. Existing methods in optical 3D reconstruction can generate arbitrary shapes from limited camera views, but struggle when they naively treat the radar signal as a camera view. In this work, we present Radar2Shape, a denoising diffusion model that handles a partially observable radar signal for 3D reconstruction by correlating its frequencies with multiresolution shape features. Our method consists of a two-stage approach: first, Radar2Shape learns a regularized latent space with hierarchical resolutions of shape features, and second, it diffuses into this latent space by conditioning on the frequencies of the radar signal in an analogous coarse-to-fine manner. We demonstrate that Radar2Shape can successfully reconstruct arbitrary 3D shapes even from partially-observed radar signals, and we show robust generalization to two different simulation methods and real-world data. Additionally, we release two synthetic benchmark datasets to encourage future research in the high-frequency radar domain so that models like Radar2Shape can safely be adapted into real-world radar systems.

TL;DR: This paper develops a deep learning method to estimate "spine age" using MRI data and evaluates its clinical utility by exploring the association between spine age gap and degenerative conditions and lifestyle factors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of identifying and assessing healthy spine aging and associated degenerative conditions using MRI images thereby promoting better spine health management.

Method: Deep learning algorithms trained on over 18,000 MRI series. Data filtering via UMAP and HDBSCAN clustering methods to select subjects with age-related spine degeneration. Ablation studies were performed to refine the model and assess different factors (data size, loss, spine regions).

Result: The model successfully predicts spine age and identifies a useful biomarker called Spine Age Gap (SAG). SAG correlates with spine conditions like disc bulges, stenosis, and fractures, and lifestyle factors like smoking or physical labor.

Conclusion: The proposed method provides an effective way to estimate spine age and offers clinical relevance by correlating SAG with degenerative conditions and lifestyle factors, making it a promising tool for spine health assessment.

Abstract: The human spine is a complex structure composed of 33 vertebrae. It holds the body and is important for leading a healthy life. The spine is vulnerable to age-related degenerations that can be identified through magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In this paper we propose a novel computer-vison-based deep learning method to estimate spine age using images from over 18,000 MRI series. Data are restricted to subjects with only age-related spine degeneration. Eligibility criteria are created by identifying common age-based clusters of degenerative spine conditions using uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) and hierarchical density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (HDBSCAN). Model selection is determined using a detailed ablation study on data size, loss, and the effect of different spine regions. We evaluate the clinical utility of our model by calculating the difference between actual spine age and model-predicted age, the spine age gap (SAG), and examining the association between these differences and spine degenerative conditions and lifestyle factors. We find that SAG is associated with conditions including disc bulges, disc osteophytes, spinal stenosis, and fractures, as well as lifestyle factors like smoking and physically demanding work, and thus may be a useful biomarker for measuring overall spine health.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores how downsizing multimodal models impacts their visual and reasoning abilities, proposing an Extract+Think approach for improved efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for smaller, more efficient multimodal models to tackle practical demands while maintaining robust capabilities.

Method: A systematic analysis of how reducing large language model (LLM) capacity affects multimodal capabilities, along with the introduction of visual extraction tuning to improve perceptual capabilities.

Result: Findings reveal that LLM downscaling disproportionately hurts visual capabilities, more than reasoning skills. The performance drop in visual perception matches or exceeds reasoning losses. Visual extraction tuning effectively mitigates this issue.

Conclusion: The Extract+Think approach enhances efficiency and performance, offering a refined solution for multimodal intelligence in compact models.

Abstract: Scaling up multimodal models has enabled remarkable advances in visual understanding and reasoning, but practical demands call for smaller, efficient systems. In this work, we conduct a principled analysis of downscaling intelligence in multimodal models, examining how reduced large language model (LLM) capacity affects multimodal capabilities. Our initial findings reveal an interesting trend: LLM downscaling disproportionately affects visual capabilities, rather than abilities inherited from the LLM. We then examine whether this drop mainly reflects the expected decline in visual reasoning or a more fundamental loss of perceptual abilities. Isolating the effect of LLM downscaling on perception, we find performance still drops sharply, often matching or exceeding the impact on reasoning. To address this bottleneck, we introduce visual extraction tuning, which explicitly trains the model to extract instruction-relevant visual details consistently across tasks.

*Yolo Yunlong Tang,Daiki Shimada,Hang Hua,Chao Huang,Jing Bi,Rogerio Feris,Chenliang Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Video-R4, a model for text-rich video reasoning that utilizes iterative visual rumination, such as frame selection and zooming, to improve multimodal understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video QA models often fail due to single-pass perception, leading to missed fine-grained details in transient textual cues.

Method: The authors develop Video-R4, a video reasoning language model that uses iterative processes like frame selection, zooming, and pixel re-encoding. They also create two datasets and use a multi-stage rumination learning framework with supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and GRPO-based reinforcement learning.

Result: Video-R4 achieves state-of-the-art performance on M4-ViteVQA and demonstrates generalizability to multiple domains, such as document QA and generic video QA.

Conclusion: Iterative rumination is shown to be an effective paradigm for pixel-grounded multimodal reasoning, enabling significant advancements in video question answering.

Abstract: Understanding text-rich videos requires reading small, transient textual cues that often demand repeated inspection. Yet most video QA models rely on single-pass perception over fixed frames, leading to hallucinations and failures on fine-grained evidence. Inspired by how humans pause, zoom, and re-read critical regions, we introduce Video-R4 (Reinforcing Text-Rich Video Reasoning with Visual Rumination), a video reasoning LMM that performs visual rumination: iteratively selecting frames, zooming into informative regions, re-encoding retrieved pixels, and updating its reasoning state. We construct two datasets with executable rumination trajectories: Video-R4-CoT-17k for supervised practice and Video-R4-RL-30k for reinforcement learning. We propose a multi-stage rumination learning framework that progressively finetunes a 7B LMM to learn atomic and mixing visual operations via SFT and GRPO-based RL. Video-R4-7B achieves state-of-the-art results on M4-ViteVQA and further generalizes to multi-page document QA, slides QA, and generic video QA, demonstrating that iterative rumination is an effective paradigm for pixel-grounded multimodal reasoning.

### [179] [EvDiff: High Quality Video with an Event Camera](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17492)
*Weilun Li,Lei Sun,Ruixi Gao,Qi Jiang,Yuqin Ma,Kaiwei Wang,Ming-Hsuan Yang,Luc Van Gool,Danda Pani Paudel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EvDiff leverages event cameras' sparse event streams and uses an advanced diffusion model for reconstructing high-quality videos, improving over prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The aim is to address the inherent challenges in reconstructing intensity images from event camera data, which is sparse and lacks absolute brightness. Traditional methods struggle with quality and scalability.

Method: EvDiff, an event-based diffusion model, uses single forward diffusion steps coupled with a temporally consistent encoder (EvEncoder). It employs a new training framework leveraging large-scale image datasets, bypassing the need for paired event-image datasets.

Result: EvDiff demonstrates better results in both fidelity and realism, surpassing previous methods in various pixel-level and perceptual metrics.

Conclusion: EvDiff utilizes event data to generate high-quality videos, offering a scalable, efficient, and effective alternative for addressing intensity image reconstruction challenges.

Abstract: As neuromorphic sensors, event cameras asynchronously record changes in brightness as streams of sparse events with the advantages of high temporal resolution and high dynamic range. Reconstructing intensity images from events is a highly ill-posed task due to the inherent ambiguity of absolute brightness. Early methods generally follow an end-to-end regression paradigm, directly mapping events to intensity frames in a deterministic manner. While effective to some extent, these approaches often yield perceptually inferior results and struggle to scale up in model capacity and training data. In this work, we propose EvDiff, an event-based diffusion model that follows a surrogate training framework to produce high-quality videos. To reduce the heavy computational cost of high-frame-rate video generation, we design an event-based diffusion model that performs only a single forward diffusion step, equipped with a temporally consistent EvEncoder. Furthermore, our novel Surrogate Training Framework eliminates the dependence on paired event-image datasets, allowing the model to leverage large-scale image datasets for higher capacity. The proposed EvDiff is capable of generating high-quality colorful videos solely from monochromatic event streams. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our method strikes a sweet spot between fidelity and realism, outperforming existing approaches on both pixel-level and perceptual metrics.

*Weiwei Cai,Shuangkang Fang,Weicai Ye,Xin Dong,Yunhan Yang,Xuanyang Zhang,Wei Cheng,Yanpei Cao,Gang Yu,Tao Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel native 3D editing framework that addresses speed and quality issues in instruction-guided 3D editing by directly manipulating 3D representations in a single feed-forward pass and introducing a large multi-modal dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing instruction-guided 3D editing approaches are either too slow or suffer from inconsistent geometry and poor visual quality, necessitating a better framework for 3D content creation.

Method: The proposed framework employs a direct 3D editing approach using a feed-forward pass and introduces a large-scale multi-modal dataset, exploring two conditioning strategies: cross-attention and 3D token concatenation.

Result: The 3D token concatenation approach showed higher parameter efficiency and superior performance. The proposed method outperformed existing 2D-lifting methods in quality, 3D consistency, and fidelity to instructions.

Conclusion: This work introduces a parameter-efficient and effective framework for instruction-guided 3D editing, backed by a meticulously created dataset, addressing previous limitations and setting new quality benchmarks.

Abstract: Instruction-guided 3D editing is a rapidly emerging field with the potential to broaden access to 3D content creation. However, existing methods face critical limitations: optimization-based approaches are prohibitively slow, while feed-forward approaches relying on multi-view 2D editing often suffer from inconsistent geometry and degraded visual quality. To address these issues, we propose a novel native 3D editing framework that directly manipulates 3D representations in a single, efficient feed-forward pass. Specifically, we create a large-scale, multi-modal dataset for instruction-guided 3D editing, covering diverse addition, deletion, and modification tasks. This dataset is meticulously curated to ensure that edited objects faithfully adhere to the instructional changes while preserving the consistency of unedited regions with the source object. Building upon this dataset, we explore two distinct conditioning strategies for our model: a conventional cross-attention mechanism and a novel 3D token concatenation approach. Our results demonstrate that token concatenation is more parameter-efficient and achieves superior performance. Extensive evaluations show that our method outperforms existing 2D-lifting approaches, setting a new benchmark in generation quality, 3D consistency, and instruction fidelity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Mixture-of-Experts systems struggle with load imbalance among experts, affecting training efficiency and compromising model performance and accuracy.

Method: The authors propose MicroEP, a fine-grained token scheduling strategy for optimal load balancing, and MicroMoE, an efficient distributed MoE training system leveraging MicroEP.

Result: MicroMoE enhances training throughput by up to 47.6% and achieves consistent optimal load balance among GPUs.

Conclusion: MicroEP and MicroMoE offer a significant advancement in addressing load balancing challenges in MoE systems, optimizing both efficiency and performance.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has emerged as a promising approach to scale up deep learning models due to its significant reduction in computational resources. However, the dynamic nature of MoE leads to load imbalance among experts, severely impacting training efficiency. While previous research has attempted to address the load balancing challenge, existing solutions either compromise model accuracy or introduce additional system overhead. As a result, they fail to achieve fine-grained load balancing, which is crucial to optimizing training efficiency.
  We propose MicroEP, a novel parallelization strategy to achieve fine-grained load balancing in MoE systems. MicroEP is capable of achieving optimal load balancing in every micro-batch through efficient token scheduling across GPUs. Furthermore, we propose MicroMoE, an efficient distributed MoE training system with MicroEP's load balancing capabilities. Our experimental results demonstrate that MicroMoE improves the end-to-end training throughput by up to 47.6% compared with the state-of-the-art system, and almost consistently achieves optimal load balance among GPUs.

*Gabriel Job Antunes Grabher,Fumio Machida,Thomas Ropars*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper explores optimizing performance anomaly detection in cloud services to balance latency and resource consumption, highlighting the trade-offs between precision, recall, and inspection frequency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for effective identification and management of performance anomalies in cloud services to maintain desired performance objectives while balancing the associated resource costs.

Method: The authors employ Stochastic Reward Nets to model and analyze the relationship between the characteristics of an anomaly detector (precision, recall, inspection frequency) and their effects on system latency and resource use.

Result: The study reveals that high precision alone is sufficient for cost-performance balance when the detector runs frequently; however, recall is more crucial when detection runs occur less often.

Conclusion: Optimization of anomaly detection in cloud services depends on the inspection frequency. The findings provide insights into designing and setting parameters for performance anomaly detectors to achieve a better performance-to-cost trade-off.

Abstract: Detecting and resolving performance anomalies in Cloud services is crucial for maintaining desired performance objectives. Scaling actions triggered by an anomaly detector help achieve target latency at the cost of extra resource consumption. However, performance anomaly detectors make mistakes. This paper studies which characteristics of performance anomaly detection are important to optimize the trade-off between performance and cost. Using Stochastic Reward Nets, we model a Cloud service monitored by a performance anomaly detector. Using our model, we study the impact of detector characteristics, namely precision, recall and inspection frequency, on the average latency and resource consumption of the monitored service. Our results show that achieving a high precision and a high recall is not always necessary. If detection can be run frequently, a high precision is enough to obtain a good performance-to-cost trade-off, but if the detector is run infrequently, recall becomes the most important.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PepBridge is a novel computational framework for designing protein surfaces and structures that complement target receptors, employing advanced diffusion models and ensuring chemical feasibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for improved methods in computational protein design to create diverse and realistic protein structures that precisely complement target receptors.

Method: PepBridge uses a multi-step process involving denoising diffusion bridge models, multi-model diffusion predictions, and Shape-Frame Matching Networks to integrate receptor surface geometry with protein design.

Result: Extensive tests show PepBridge's efficacy in creating proteins that are structurally viable, demonstrating enhanced surface complementarity and conformational stability.

Conclusion: PepBridge represents a significant advancement in top-down protein design by enabling the joint design of protein surfaces and structures tailored to receptor properties.

Abstract: Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) are governed by surface complementarity and hydrophobic interactions at protein interfaces. However, designing diverse and physically realistic protein structure and surfaces that precisely complement target receptors remains a significant challenge in computational protein design. In this work, we introduce PepBridge, a novel framework for the joint design of protein surface and structure that seamlessly integrates receptor surface geometry and biochemical properties. Starting with a receptor surface represented as a 3D point cloud, PepBridge generates complete protein structures through a multi-step process. First, it employs denoising diffusion bridge models (DDBMs) to map receptor surfaces to ligand surfaces. Next, a multi-model diffusion model predicts the corresponding structure, while Shape-Frame Matching Networks ensure alignment between surface geometry and backbone architecture. This integrated approach facilitates surface complementarity, conformational stability, and chemical feasibility. Extensive validation across diverse protein design scenarios demonstrates PepBridge's efficacy in generating structurally viable proteins, representing a significant advancement in the joint design of top-down protein structure.

*Yuqi Li,Kuiye Ding,Chuanguang Yang,Hao Wang,Haoxuan Wang,Huiran Duan,Junming Liu,Yingli Tian*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DDTime introduces an innovative dataset distillation framework for time-series forecasting that significantly enhances accuracy with minimal computational overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current time-series forecasting models demand extensive datasets and computational power. Dataset distillation offers efficiency but struggles with temporal bias and insufficient sample diversity in time-series.

Method: The framework, DDTime, employs temporal statistics and frequency-domain alignment for bias mitigation, alongside inter-sample regularization for enhanced diversity in synthetic trajectories.

Result: DDTime demonstrates around 30% relative accuracy improvement over existing methods with only 2.49% computational overhead across diverse benchmarks.

Conclusion: DDTime proves effective and efficient, addressing challenges in time-series dataset distillation and pushing the boundaries of forecasting performance.

Abstract: Time-series forecasting is fundamental across many domains, yet training accurate models often requires large-scale datasets and substantial computational resources. Dataset distillation offers a promising alternative by synthesizing compact datasets that preserve the learning behavior of full data. However, extending dataset distillation to time-series forecasting is non-trivial due to two fundamental challenges: 1.temporal bias from strong autocorrelation, which leads to distorted value-term alignment between teacher and student models; and 2.insufficient diversity among synthetic samples, arising from the absence of explicit categorical priors to regularize trajectory variety.
  In this work, we propose DDTime, a lightweight and plug-in distillation framework built upon first-order condensation decomposition. To tackle Challenge 1, it revisits value-term alignment through temporal statistics and introduces a frequency-domain alignment mechanism to mitigate autocorrelation-induced bias, ensuring spectral consistency and temporal fidelity. To address Challenge 2, we further design an inter-sample regularization inspired by the information bottleneck principle, which enhances diversity and maximizes information density across synthetic trajectories. The combined objective is theoretically compatible with a wide range of condensation paradigms and supports stable first-order optimization. Extensive experiments on 20 benchmark datasets and diverse forecasting architectures demonstrate that DDTime consistently outperforms existing distillation methods, achieving about 30% relative accuracy gains while introducing about 2.49% computational overhead. All code and distilled datasets will be released.

### [186] [When Structure Doesn't Help: LLMs Do Not Read Text-Attributed Graphs as Effectively as We Expected](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16767)
*Haotian Xu,Yuning You,Tengfei Ma*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper examines how encoding graph structure impacts Large Language Models (LLMs) when dealing with text-attributed graphs, finding that explicit structural priors may not always enhance performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the necessity and impact of explicit graph structural encoding for effective graph reasoning using Large Language Models (LLMs).

Method: Conducted systematic experiments comparing the performance of LLMs on text-attributed graphs with and without explicit graph structure encoding strategies.

Result: LLMs perform strongly using only textual descriptions for nodes, while structural encoding strategies often provide minimal or even negative effects.

Conclusion: Explicit graph structures are often unnecessary for LLM-based graph reasoning, suggesting a paradigm shift towards semantics-driven approaches in graph learning.

Abstract: Graphs provide a unified representation of semantic content and relational structure, making them a natural fit for domains such as molecular modeling, citation networks, and social graphs. Meanwhile, large language models (LLMs) have excelled at understanding natural language and integrating cross-modal signals, sparking interest in their potential for graph reasoning. Recent work has explored this by either designing template-based graph templates or using graph neural networks (GNNs) to encode structural information. In this study, we investigate how different strategies for encoding graph structure affect LLM performance on text-attributed graphs. Surprisingly, our systematic experiments reveal that: (i) LLMs leveraging only node textual descriptions already achieve strong performance across tasks; and (ii) most structural encoding strategies offer marginal or even negative gains. We show that explicit structural priors are often unnecessary and, in some cases, counterproductive when powerful language models are involved. This represents a significant departure from traditional graph learning paradigms and highlights the need to rethink how structure should be represented and utilized in the LLM era. Our study is to systematically challenge the foundational assumption that structure is inherently beneficial for LLM-based graph reasoning, opening the door to new, semantics-driven approaches for graph learning.

TL;DR: This paper introduces GCL-OT, a graph contrastive learning framework leveraging optimal transport to address challenges in aligning structure and text on text-attributed graphs with varying heterophily types.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for structure-text contrastive learning suffer from limitations when dealing with heterophilic graphs. There's a need for a more flexible approach that can handle mixed, noisy, and missing semantic correlations in structure-text alignment.

Method: The proposed method, GCL-OT, integrates tailored mechanisms for handling multi-granular heterophily in text-attributed graphs using optimal transport. It includes RealSoftMax-based similarity estimation for partial heterophily, prompt-based filtering for complete heterophily, and OT-guided soft supervision to enhance latent homophily.

Result: Theoretical analysis demonstrates improved mutual information bounds and Bayes error. Experimental results on nine benchmarks validate GCL-OT's superiority over existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of effectiveness and robustness.

Conclusion: GCL-OT provides a novel, flexible, and robust solution for aligning structure and text in text-attributed graphs with varying heterophily types, outperforming current methods.

Abstract: Recently, structure-text contrastive learning has shown promising performance on text-attributed graphs by leveraging the complementary strengths of graph neural networks and language models. However, existing methods typically rely on homophily assumptions in similarity estimation and hard optimization objectives, which limit their applicability to heterophilic graphs. Although existing methods can mitigate heterophily through structural adjustments or neighbor aggregation, they usually treat textual embeddings as static targets, leading to suboptimal alignment. In this work, we identify the multi-granular heterophily in text-attributed graphs, including complete heterophily, partial heterophily, and latent homophily, which makes structure-text alignment particularly challenging due to mixed, noisy, and missing semantic correlations. To achieve flexible and bidirectional alignment, we propose GCL-OT, a novel graph contrastive learning framework with optimal transport, equipped with tailored mechanisms for each type of heterophily. Specifically, for partial heterophily, we design a RealSoftMax-based similarity estimator to emphasize key neighbor-word interactions while easing background noise. For complete heterophily, we introduce a prompt-based filter that adaptively excludes irrelevant noise during optimal transport alignment. Furthermore, we incorporate OT-guided soft supervision to uncover potential neighbors with similar semantics, enhancing the learning of latent homophily. Theoretical analysis shows that GCL-OT can improve the mutual information bound and Bayes error guarantees. Extensive experiments on nine benchmarks show that GCL-OT consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, verifying its effectiveness and robustness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the theoretical gradient descent dynamics for DEQs, an unexplored area despite their practical success.

Method: The authors examine linear and single-index models rigorously and prove conservation laws, conditions for well-conditioned gradient flows, and convergence with proper initialization and step size.

Result: Demonstrates conservation laws and linear convergence of gradient descent in DEQ models; validates findings through experiments.

Conclusion: The paper advances the theoretical understanding of DEQs gradient descent and demonstrates practical experimental alignment with the results.

Abstract: Deep equilibrium models (DEQs) have recently emerged as a powerful paradigm for training infinitely deep weight-tied neural networks that achieve state of the art performance across many modern machine learning tasks. Despite their practical success, theoretically understanding the gradient descent dynamics for training DEQs remains an area of active research. In this work, we rigorously study the gradient descent dynamics for DEQs in the simple setting of linear models and single-index models, filling several gaps in the literature. We prove a conservation law for linear DEQs which implies that the parameters remain trapped on spheres during training and use this property to show that gradient flow remains well-conditioned for all time. We then prove linear convergence of gradient descent to a global minimizer for linear DEQs and deep equilibrium single-index models under appropriate initialization and with a sufficiently small step size. Finally, we validate our theoretical findings through experiments.

*Yaoxin Yang,Peng Ye,Xudong Tan,Chongjun Tu,Maosen Zhao,Jia Hao,Tao Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces FlashCache, a novel KV Cache compression framework tailored for multimodal large language models (MLLMs), achieving faster inference and reduced memory usage while preserving task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The high inference overhead in multimodal large language models due to increased KV Cache memory consumption from visual inputs demands more efficient compression methods that maintain critical information.

Method: The authors propose FlashCache, leveraging frequency-domain analysis to identify and retain Outlier KVs, which are crucial for inference, through an Outlier KV Recognition Module and a Dynamic Budget Allocation Module that adaptively determines cache size per layer.

Result: FlashCache achieves up to 1.69x faster decoding and reduces KV Cache memory usage by 80% without compromising performance on various benchmarks.

Conclusion: FlashCache effectively addresses multimodal KV Cache inefficiencies, offering a practical solution for enhancing MLLM inference speed and scalability.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models suffer from substantial inference overhead since multimodal KV Cache grows proportionally with the visual input length. Existing multimodal KV Cache compression methods mostly rely on attention score to reduce cache size, which makes them are incompatible with established efficient attention kernels (e.g., FlashAttention) and ignores the contribution of value vectors to the attention output. In this work, we revisit multimodal KV Cache compression from the perspective of the KV matrices' distribution. First, we observe that frequency-domain energy of multimodal KV matrices is predominantly concentrated in low-frequency and extract this principal energy via a low-pass filter. Further, we find that removing KV pairs that deviate substantially from this principal energy leads to a pronounced performance drop, which we define as Outlier KVs. Considering Outlier KVs are more likely to encode features critical for inference, we propose FlashCache, a frequency-domain-guided, Outlier-KV-aware KV Cache compression framework. First, we introduce an Outlier KV Recognition Module that models the principal component of multimodal KV matrices in the frequency domain and preferentially retains KV pairs that significantly deviate from it. Furthermore, Dynamic Budget Allocation Module is designed to adaptively determine the per-layer KV Cache size to retain more Outlier KVs. Experiments on multiple MLLMs and benchmarks demonstrate that FlashCache outperforms state-of-the-art multimoal KV compression methods, achieving up to 1.69 times faster decoding with 80% lower KV memory usage while maintaining task performance.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a principled and interpretable MIL framework based on Vector Symbolic Architectures (VSAs), offering state-of-the-art results while adhering to strict MIL constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most deep learning-based Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) methods violate the fundamental iff constraint, leading to inflated metrics and poor generalization. This work seeks to address this issue by creating a framework that adheres strictly to the MIL problem formulation.

Method: The proposed framework represents instances and concepts as nearly orthogonal high-dimensional vectors using Vector Symbolic Architectures (VSAs) and enforces logical constraints with algebraic operations. It includes a learned encoder for transforming raw data into VSA vectors and a VSA-driven MaxNetwork classifier for inference.

Result: The method achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard MIL benchmarks and medical imaging datasets while strictly upholding the MIL iff constraint.

Conclusion: This work provides an effective, interpretable, and principled alternative to current MIL approaches, addressing their shortcomings by encoding MIL assumptions directly into the model's structure.

Abstract: Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) tasks impose a strict logical constraint: a bag is labeled positive if and only if at least one instance within it is positive. While this iff constraint aligns with many real-world applications, recent work has shown that most deep learning-based MIL approaches violate it, leading to inflated performance metrics and poor generalization. We propose a novel MIL framework based on Vector Symbolic Architectures (VSAs), which provide a differentiable mechanism for performing symbolic operations in high-dimensional space. Our method encodes the MIL assumption directly into the model's structure by representing instances and concepts as nearly orthogonal high-dimensional vectors and using algebraic operations to enforce the iff constraint during classification. To bridge the gap between raw data and VSA representations, we design a learned encoder that transforms input instances into VSA-compatible vectors while preserving key distributional properties. Our approach, which includes a VSA-driven MaxNetwork classifier, achieves state-of-the-art results for a valid MIL model on standard MIL benchmarks and medical imaging datasets, outperforming existing methods while maintaining strict adherence to the MIL formulation. This work offers a principled, interpretable, and effective alternative to existing MIL approaches that rely on learned heuristics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The work seeks to address the inefficiency and redundancy in data science caused by difficulties in identifying dataset versions, leading to duplicated efforts and transformations.

Method: SAVeD uses a modified SimCLR pipeline with random transformations to create augmented dataset views, embedding these views with a custom transformer encoder. It contrasts latent space representations to optimize semantic similarity and detect dataset versions.

Result: The model achieved high validation accuracy and separation on five canonical datasets, outperforming untrained baselines and prior state-of-the-art methods like Starmie.

Conclusion: SAVeD effectively distinguishes semantically altered dataset versions while surpassing existing benchmarks and reinforcing its practicality for dataset versioning tasks.

Abstract: Our work introduces SAVeD (Semantically Aware Version Detection), a contrastive learning-based framework for identifying versions of structured datasets without relying on metadata, labels, or integration-based assumptions. SAVeD addresses a common challenge in data science of repeated labor due to a difficulty of similar work or transformations on datasets. SAVeD employs a modified SimCLR pipeline, generating augmented table views through random transformations (e.g., row deletion, encoding perturbations). These views are embedded via a custom transformer encoder and contrasted in latent space to optimize semantic similarity. Our model learns to minimize distances between augmented views of the same dataset and maximize those between unrelated tables. We evaluate performance using validation accuracy and separation, defined respectively as the proportion of correctly classified version/non-version pairs on a hold-out set, and the difference between average similarities of versioned and non-versioned tables (defined by a benchmark, and not provided to the model). Our experiments span five canonical datasets from the Semantic Versioning in Databases Benchmark, and demonstrate substantial gains post-training. SAVeD achieves significantly higher accuracy on completely unseen tables in, and a significant boost in separation scores, confirming its capability to distinguish semantically altered versions. Compared to untrained baselines and prior state-of-the-art dataset-discovery methods like Starmie, our custom encoder achieves competitive or superior results.

Motivation: The study addresses the challenges of statistical heterogeneity and privacy concerns in decentralized model training within IoT networks.

Method: The researchers analyze FL algorithms on the CICIoT2023 dataset to classify large-scale IoT attacks under various statistical data distributions.

Result: The paper brings insights into the performance of FL algorithms when dealing with statistical heterogeneity in IoT attack detection.

Conclusion: The study helps bridge the research gap related to FL for detecting IoT attacks and provides a comparative analysis to guide future research in the domain.

Abstract: In the context of the growing proliferation of user devices and the concurrent surge in data volumes, the complexities arising from the substantial increase in data have posed formidable challenges to conventional machine learning model training. Particularly, this is evident within resource-constrained and security-sensitive environments such as those encountered in networks associated with the Internet of Things (IoT). Federated Learning has emerged as a promising remedy to these challenges by decentralizing model training to edge devices or parties, effectively addressing privacy concerns and resource limitations. Nevertheless, the presence of statistical heterogeneity in non-Independently and Identically Distributed (non-IID) data across different parties poses a significant hurdle to the effectiveness of FL. Many FL approaches have been proposed to enhance learning effectiveness under statistical heterogeneity. However, prior studies have uncovered a gap in the existing research landscape, particularly in the absence of a comprehensive comparison between federated methods addressing statistical heterogeneity in detecting IoT attacks.

### [193] [Monte Carlo Expected Threat (MOCET) Scoring](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16823)
*Joseph Kim,Saahith Potluri*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces MOCET, a scalable and interpretable metric to evaluate real-world risks associated with AI Safety Level (ASL-3+) threats.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to improve AI safety evaluation metrics, particularly for assessing risks posed by ASL-3+ models, which can empower non-state actors in biosecurity contexts.

Method: The authors propose a novel metric, MOCET, designed to quantify real-world risks in an interpretable, scalable, and open-ended manner to address gaps in existing AI safety metrics.

Result: MOCET provides a tool for contextualizing real-world risks and aligns with the rapid advancements in large language models (LLMs). It complements existing evaluation frameworks like LAB-Bench, BioLP-bench, and WMDP.

Conclusion: The development of MOCET offers a step forward in assessing AI safety risks and guides stakeholders in implementing effective safeguards.

Abstract: Evaluating and measuring AI Safety Level (ASL) threats are crucial for guiding stakeholders to implement safeguards that keep risks within acceptable limits. ASL-3+ models present a unique risk in their ability to uplift novice non-state actors, especially in the realm of biosecurity. Existing evaluation metrics, such as LAB-Bench, BioLP-bench, and WMDP, can reliably assess model uplift and domain knowledge. However, metrics that better contextualize "real-world risks" are needed to inform the safety case for LLMs, along with scalable, open-ended metrics to keep pace with their rapid advancements. To address both gaps, we introduce MOCET, an interpretable and doubly-scalable metric (automatable and open-ended) that can quantify real-world risks.

### [194] [Self-Supervised Learning by Curvature Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17426)
*Benyamin Ghojogh,M. Hadi Sepanj,Paul Fieguth*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces CurvSSL, a novel self-supervised learning framework utilizing curvature-based regularization to enhance representation by explicitly shaping local data geometry.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current non-contrastive self-supervised learning methods focus on global statistics but overlook the local geometry of data manifolds, motivating the need to improve manifold representation.

Method: The authors propose CurvSSL and its RKHS extension, using curvature-derived regularization alongside Barlow Twins-style redundancy-reduction loss to address local geometry via discrete curvature scores.

Result: The method shows competitive or improved linear evaluation performance compared to Barlow Twins and VICReg on MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets.

Conclusion: Explicitly considering local manifold geometry through curvature is a valuable addition to statistical regularizers for self-supervised learning methods.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has recently advanced through non-contrastive methods that couple an invariance term with variance, covariance, or redundancy-reduction penalties. While such objectives shape first- and second-order statistics of the representation, they largely ignore the local geometry of the underlying data manifold. In this paper, we introduce CurvSSL, a curvature-regularized self-supervised learning framework, and its RKHS extension, kernel CurvSSL. Our approach retains a standard two-view encoder-projector architecture with a Barlow Twins-style redundancy-reduction loss on projected features, but augments it with a curvature-based regularizer. Each embedding is treated as a vertex whose $k$ nearest neighbors define a discrete curvature score via cosine interactions on the unit hypersphere; in the kernel variant, curvature is computed from a normalized local Gram matrix in an RKHS. These scores are aligned and decorrelated across augmentations by a Barlow-style loss on a curvature-derived matrix, encouraging both view invariance and consistency of local manifold bending. Experiments on MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets with a ResNet-18 backbone show that curvature-regularized SSL yields competitive or improved linear evaluation performance compared to Barlow Twins and VICReg. Our results indicate that explicitly shaping local geometry is a simple and effective complement to purely statistical SSL regularizers.

*Yihang Fu,Lifang He,Qingyu Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ManifoldFormer introduces a geometric deep learning framework for EEG data, addressing limitations of treating neural signals as generic time series by incorporating the intrinsic geometric structure of neural dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the mismatch between neural geometry and model assumptions in existing EEG foundation models, improving representation quality and cross-subject generalization.

Method: The model uses a Riemannian VAE for manifold embedding, a geometric Transformer with geodesic-aware attention, and a dynamics predictor with neural ODEs to ensure manifold-constrained evolution.

Result: ManifoldFormer achieves improved performance, with a 4.6-4.8% accuracy increase and a 6.2-10.2% rise in Cohen's Kappa across four datasets, while maintaining robust cross-subject generalization.

Conclusion: The study highlights the importance of incorporating geometric structure into EEG models, demonstrating that such constraints enhance performance and reveal meaningful neural patterns aligned with neurophysiology.

Abstract: Existing EEG foundation models mainly treat neural signals as generic time series in Euclidean space, ignoring the intrinsic geometric structure of neural dynamics that constrains brain activity to low-dimensional manifolds. This fundamental mismatch between model assumptions and neural geometry limits representation quality and cross-subject generalization. ManifoldFormer addresses this limitation through a novel geometric deep learning framework that explicitly learns neural manifold representations. The architecture integrates three key innovations: a Riemannian VAE for manifold embedding that preserves geometric structure, a geometric Transformer with geodesic-aware attention mechanisms operating directly on neural manifolds, and a dynamics predictor leveraging neural ODEs for manifold-constrained temporal evolution. Extensive evaluation across four public datasets demonstrates substantial improvements over state-of-the-art methods, with 4.6-4.8% higher accuracy and 6.2-10.2% higher Cohen's Kappa, while maintaining robust cross-subject generalization. The geometric approach reveals meaningful neural patterns consistent with neurophysiological principles, establishing geometric constraints as essential for effective EEG foundation models.

*Falk Dippela,Yinan Yu,Annika Rosengren,Martin Lindgren,Christina E. Lundberg,Erik Aerts,Martin Adiels,Helen Sjöland*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper evaluates the performance and efficiency of six sequence models from three architecture classes (Transformers, Transformers++, Mambas) on clinical prediction tasks using electronic health records (EHRs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To empirically analyze and improve model performance and efficiency for clinical prediction tasks using EHRs, with a focus on systematic evaluation of design choices in the medical domain.

Method: The study evaluates six sequence models’ performances on three prediction tasks (clinical instability and mortality) within a large Swedish heart failure cohort, with ablation studies analyzing EHR input sequences, architectural configurations, and temporal data preprocessing.

Result: Llama achieves the best performance (predictive discrimination and calibration), followed by Mambas. Both architectures require less training data compared to other large Transformers while achieving high efficiency and superior results.

Conclusion: The paper highlights Llama and Mamba as leading architectures for EHR-based clinical prediction tasks and provides benchmarks and systematic guidelines to guide future EHR model development.

Abstract: Transformers have defined the state-of-the-art for clinical prediction tasks involving electronic health records (EHRs). The recently introduced Mamba architecture outperformed an advanced Transformer (Transformer++) based on Llama in handling long context lengths, while using fewer model parameters. Despite the impressive performance of these architectures, a systematic approach to empirically analyze model performance and efficiency under various settings is not well established in the medical domain. The performances of six sequence models were investigated across three architecture classes (Transformers, Transformers++, Mambas) in a large Swedish heart failure (HF) cohort (N = 42820), providing a clinically relevant case study. Patient data included diagnoses, vital signs, laboratories, medications and procedures extracted from in-hospital EHRs. The models were evaluated on three one-year prediction tasks: clinical instability (a readmission phenotype) after initial HF hospitalization, mortality after initial HF hospitalization and mortality after latest hospitalization. Ablations account for modifications of the EHR-based input patient sequence, architectural model configurations, and temporal preprocessing techniques for data collection. Llama achieves the highest predictive discrimination, best calibration, and showed robustness across all tasks, followed by Mambas. Both architectures demonstrate efficient representation learning, with tiny configurations surpassing other large-scaled Transformers. At equal model size, Llama and Mambas achieve superior performance using 25% less training data. This paper presents a first ablation study with systematic design choices for input tokenization, model configuration and temporal data preprocessing. Future model development in clinical prediction tasks using EHRs could build upon this study's recommendation as a starting point.

### [197] [Provably Minimum-Length Conformal Prediction Sets for Ordinal Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16845)
*Zijian Zhang,Xinyu Chen,Yuanjie Shi,Liyuan Lillian Ma,Zifan Xu,Yan Yan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents a model-agnostic ordinal conformal prediction method with optimal prediction intervals and improved uncertainty quantification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reliable uncertainty quantification is crucial for high-stakes applications like medical diagnosis, but existing ordinal CP methods have limitations such as reliance on heuristic algorithms or restrictive model assumptions.

Method: The authors introduce a sliding-window algorithm to tackle the minimum-length covering problem at the instance level, ensuring local optimality and improving predictive efficiency.

Result: Experiments on four benchmark datasets showed a 15% average decrease in prediction set size over baselines, demonstrating improved efficiency and maintained coverage.

Conclusion: The proposed ordinal-CP method offers a practical, efficient, distribution-free solution for ordinal classification tasks, addressing coverage-efficiency trade-offs.

Abstract: Ordinal classification has been widely applied in many high-stakes applications, e.g., medical imaging and diagnosis, where reliable uncertainty quantification (UQ) is essential for decision making. Conformal prediction (CP) is a general UQ framework that provides statistically valid guarantees, which is especially useful in practice. However, prior ordinal CP methods mainly focus on heuristic algorithms or restrictively require the underlying model to predict a unimodal distribution over ordinal labels. Consequently, they provide limited insight into coverage-efficiency trade-offs, or a model-agnostic and distribution-free nature favored by CP methods. To this end, we fill this gap by propose an ordinal-CP method that is model-agnostic and provides instance-level optimal prediction intervals. Specifically, we formulate conformal ordinal classification as a minimum-length covering problem at the instance level. To solve this problem, we develop a sliding-window algorithm that is optimal on each calibration data, with only a linear time complexity in K, the number of label candidates. The local optimality per instance further also improves predictive efficiency in expectation. Moreover, we propose a length-regularized variant that shrinks prediction set size while preserving coverage. Experiments on four benchmark datasets from diverse domains are conducted to demonstrate the significantly improved predictive efficiency of the proposed methods over baselines (by 15% decrease on average over four datasets).

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This study used Passive Acoustic Monitoring (PAM) combined with machine learning to classify European lobsters (Homarus gammarus) by age and sex, achieving high accuracy using bioacoustic data and AI models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop non-invasive methods for monitoring important aquatic species like lobsters, facilitating better conservation, fisheries management, and aquaculture practices.

Method: Bioacoustic emissions (buzzing/carapace vibrations) of lobsters were analyzed using hydrophone data. Deep Learning (1D-CNN, 1D-DCNN) and Machine Learning models (SVM, k-NN, Naive Bayes, Random Forest, XGBoost, MLP) were applied with Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) as input features.

Result: Models achieved over 97% accuracy for age classification and over 93% accuracy for sex classification, except for Naive Bayes in some cases.

Conclusion: This research shows the high potential of ML/DL models for non-invasive monitoring and classification of lobsters, supporting their conservation and management through acoustic data analysis.

Abstract: Monitoring aquatic species, especially elusive ones like lobsters, presents challenges. This study focuses on Homarus gammarus (European lobster), a key species for fisheries and aquaculture, and leverages non-invasive Passive Acoustic Monitoring (PAM). Understanding lobster habitats, welfare, reproduction, sex, and age is crucial for management and conservation. While bioacoustic emissions have classified various aquatic species using Artificial Intelligence (AI) models, this research specifically uses H. gammarus bioacoustics (buzzing/carapace vibrations) to classify lobsters by age (juvenile/adult) and sex (male/female).
  The dataset was collected at Johnshaven, Scotland, using hydrophones in concrete tanks. We explored the efficacy of Deep Learning (DL) models (1D-CNN, 1D-DCNN) and six Machine Learning (ML) models (SVM, k-NN, Naive Bayes, Random Forest, XGBoost, MLP). Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) were used as features.
  For age classification (adult vs. juvenile), most models achieved over 97% accuracy (Naive Bayes: 91.31%). For sex classification, all models except Naive Bayes surpassed 93.23%. These strong results demonstrate the potential of supervised ML and DL to extract age- and sex-related features from lobster sounds. This research offers a promising non-invasive PAM approach for lobster conservation, detection, and management in aquaculture and fisheries, enabling real-world edge computing applications for underwater species.

### [199] [Better audio representations are more brain-like: linking model-brain alignment with performance in downstream auditory tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16849)
*Leonardo Pepino,Pablo Riera,Juan Kamienkowski,Luciana Ferrer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study examined how well the internal representations of various audio models align with human brain activity, finding that self-supervised models with strong task performance better predict brain signals and show emergent brain-like representations during pretraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to determine whether improving task performance in artificial neural networks also aligns their internal representations more closely with real brain signals, especially in the context of auditory processing.

Method: The authors evaluated 36 audio models using voxel-wise regression, component-wise regression, and representation similarity analysis (RSA) to compare models' representations with brain activity from two fMRI datasets. They also analyzed the models' performance in auditory tasks from the HEAREval benchmark and studied representational evolution during pretraining of EnCodecMAE.

Result: Self-supervised audio models were found to better predict human auditory cortex activity than older, more specialized models. Strong correlations (r>0.7) were observed between model task performance and alignment with brain representations. During EnCodecMAE pretraining, similarity to brain representations emerged early and progressively increased, without explicit optimization for this.

Conclusion: Improving task performance in self-supervised audio models leads to better alignment with human brain activity. Further, brain-like representations can emerge naturally during training as the models optimize for reconstructing audio data rather than being explicitly trained to mirror brain signals.

Abstract: Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are increasingly powerful models of brain computation, yet it remains unclear whether improving their task performance also makes their internal representations more similar to brain signals. To address this question in the auditory domain, we quantified the alignment between the internal representations of 36 different audio models and brain activity from two independent fMRI datasets. Using voxel-wise and component-wise regression, and representation similarity analysis (RSA), we found that recent self-supervised audio models with strong performance in diverse downstream tasks are better predictors of auditory cortex activity than older and more specialized models. To assess the quality of the audio representations, we evaluated these models in 6 auditory tasks from the HEAREval benchmark, spanning music, speech, and environmental sounds. This revealed strong positive Pearson correlations ($r>0.7$) between a model's overall task performance and its alignment with brain representations. Finally, we analyzed the evolution of the similarity between audio and brain representations during the pretraining of EnCodecMAE. We discovered that brain similarity increases progressively and emerges early during pretraining, despite the model not being explicitly optimized for this objective. This suggests that brain-like representations can be an emergent byproduct of learning to reconstruct missing information from naturalistic audio data.

*Katia Pires Nascimento do Sacramento,Elliot Q. C. Garcia,Nicéias Silva Vilela,Vinicius P. Sacramento,Tiago A. E. Ferreira*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This study demonstrates the efficiency of Deep Neural Networks (DNN) in distinguishing Parkinson's disease (PD) patients from healthy individuals using vocal biomarkers, achieving high accuracy results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to leverage non-invasive, low-cost vocal biomarkers for the early detection of Parkinson’s disease, addressing the need for accessible diagnostic methods in clinical contexts.

Method: Two publicly available voice datasets were analyzed using Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) extracted from voice samples. Various classification strategies with DNN and traditional ML methods were compared using extensive random validation and non-parametric statistical tests.

Result: DNN models achieved superior average accuracies of 98.65% and 92.11% on two datasets, outperforming conventional ML models and achieving competitive results with existing studies.

Conclusion: This study confirms that DNNs are highly efficient, reliable, and promising tools for the early detection of Parkinson’s disease through voice-based biomarkers.

Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that, in addition to directly impairing functional mobility, is frequently associated with vocal impairments such as hypophonia and dysarthria, which typically manifest in the early stages. The use of vocal biomarkers to support the early diagnosis of PD presents a non-invasive, low-cost, and accessible alternative in clinical settings. Thus, the objective of this cross-sectional study was to consistently evaluate the effectiveness of a Deep Neural Network (DNN) in distinguishing individuals with Parkinson's disease from healthy controls, in comparison with traditional Machine Learning (ML) methods, using vocal biomarkers. Two publicly available voice datasets were used. Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) were extracted from the samples, and model robustness was assessed using a validation strategy with 1000 independent random executions. Performance was evaluated using classification statistics. Since normality assumptions were not satisfied, non-parametric tests (Kruskal-Wallis and Bonferroni post-hoc tests) were applied to verify whether the tested classification models were similar or different in the classification of PD. With an average accuracy of $98.65\%$ and $92.11\%$ on the Italian Voice dataset and Parkinson's Telemonitoring dataset, respectively, the DNN demonstrated superior performance and efficiency compared to traditional ML models, while also achieving competitive results when benchmarked against relevant studies. Overall, this study confirms the efficiency of DNNs and emphasizes their potential to provide greater accuracy and reliability for the early detection of neurodegenerative diseases using voice-based biomarkers.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new framework called Topologic Attention Networks to improve long-range dependency modeling in graphs with better scalability and computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Graph Neural Networks face limitations in capturing long-range dependencies due to reliance on local message passing or heavy computation methods like self-attention.

Method: The authors develop a probabilistic mechanism called topologic attention, enabling information flow through both direct and indirect graph connections without explicit pairwise interactions.

Result: The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance across all baseline models and improves unified reasoning over local and global relationships in graph data.

Conclusion: Topologic Attention Networks are effective for handling long-range dependencies in graphs, scalable, computationally efficient, and publicly available for further exploration.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks rely on local message passing, which limits their ability to model long-range dependencies in graphs. Existing approaches extend this range through continuous-time dynamics or dense self-attention, but both suffer from high computational cost and limited scalability. We propose Topologic Attention Networks, a new framework that applies topologic attention, a probabilistic mechanism that learns how information should flow through both direct and indirect connections in a graph. Unlike conventional attention that depends on explicit pairwise interactions, topologic attention emerges from the learned information propagation of the graph, enabling unified reasoning over local and global relationships. This method achieves provides state-of-the-art performance across all measured baseline models. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/Marshall-Rosenhoover/Topologic-Attention-Networks.

### [202] [PersonalizedRouter: Personalized LLM Routing via Graph-based User Preference Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16883)
*Zhongjie Dai,Tao Feng,Jiaxuan You*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces PersonalizedRouter, a framework for personalized selection of large language models (LLMs) based on user preferences and interaction data, which achieves significantly better performance than existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM selection is challenging since users have diverse preferences regarding performance, cost, and response style. Existing methods do not effectively address these individual user preferences.

Method: PersonalizedRouter uses a graph-based approach, representing user profiles, queries, and LLMs as a heterogeneous graph, and leverages interaction data to model relationships and perform personalized LLM selection. It also introduces two evaluation strategies and a new benchmark.

Result: PersonalizedRouter outperforms other methods with a performance improvement of up to 59.69% in a benchmark of 1,000 simulated users and 10 LLMs. It also exhibits strong generalization to new users and LLMs.

Conclusion: PersonalizedRouter provides a highly effective framework for tailoring LLM selection to user-specific needs and preferences, showing significant performance improvements over existing approaches while maintaining efficiency.

Abstract: The growing number of Large Language Models (LLMs) with diverse capabilities and response styles provides users with a wider range of choices, which presents challenges in selecting appropriate LLMs, as user preferences vary in terms of performance, cost, and response style. Current LLM selection methods typically optimize for a single fixed objective, such as performance, cost, or a trade-off between them, and fail to learn individual user preferences from interaction data. To address these limitations, we propose PersonalizedRouter, a graph-based framework that models diverse user profiles and performs personalized LLM selection by leveraging interaction data that includes task context, queries, candidate LLMs, and user decisions. To capture contextual information between user queries and optimal LLMs, PersonalizedRouter converts the interaction data into a heterogeneous graph, where the relationships between different types of nodes are represented by edges. To evaluate adaptability across users, we design two strategies: the multi-cost-efficiency simulation strategy and the LLM-as-a-Judge strategy. In addition, we construct PersonaRoute-Bench, a large-scale benchmark with 1,000 simulated users and 10 LLMs. Experimental results show that PersonalizedRouter significantly outperforms existing LLM selection methods and surpasses the strongest methods by a large margin of 15.38% and 9.83% under two simulation strategies. On the PersonaRoute-Bench with 1,000 users, it further surpasses the best methods by 16.19% and 59.69% while maintaining higher efficiency. Moreover, PersonalizedRouter demonstrates strong few-shot generalization, achieving 64.81% and 85.80% of the fully trained model's performance when adapting to new users and new LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Detecting rising advertising talents early is essential to leverage their potential effectively, and using social data combined with advanced modeling can improve prediction accuracy.

Method: The research combined Twitter and TV data, experimented with traditional time-series models, neural networks, and ensemble learning methods to predict time-dependent social data changes.

Result: Ensemble methods showed better regression metrics performance, while neural networks excelled in precision and recall for forecasting talent breakout by the defined concept.

Conclusion: Neural networks have better capabilities in identifying talent breakout compared to traditional and ensemble approaches, showcasing the importance of precision and recall in forecasting emerging talents.

Abstract: Early detection of rising talents is of paramount importance in the field of advertising. In this paper, we define a concept of talent breakout and propose a method to detect Japanese talents before their rise to stardom. The main focus of the study is to determine the effectiveness of combining Twitter and TV data on predicting time-dependent changes in social data. Although traditional time-series models are known to be robust in many applications, the success of neural network models in various fields (e.g.\ Natural Language Processing, Computer Vision, Reinforcement Learning) continues to spark an interest in the time-series community to apply new techniques in practice. Therefore, in order to find the best modeling approach, we have experimented with traditional, neural network and ensemble learning methods. We observe that ensemble learning methods outperform traditional and neural network models based on standard regression metrics. However, by utilizing the concept of talent breakout, we are able to assess the true forecasting ability of the models, where neural networks outperform traditional and ensemble learning methods in terms of precision and recall.

*Trieu Nguyen,Hao-Wei Pang,Shasha Feng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces PepEVOLVE, a position-aware framework for optimizing macrocyclic peptides dynamically and efficiently, outperforming previous methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current peptide optimization methods are slow and inefficient due to the vast combinatorial space and reliance on predefined edit positions, limiting dynamic optimization.

Method: PepEVOLVE introduces dynamic editing capabilities through augmented pretraining, a multi-armed bandit router for site selection, and a novel optimization algorithm to improve peptide properties.

Result: PepEVOLVE consistently outperformed prior methods (like PepINVENT), achieving higher scores and better candidates on a benchmark task while converging faster.

Conclusion: PepEVOLVE provides an effective, reproducible approach for optimizing peptides without requiring predefined edit sites, enhancing exploration and optimization across multiple objectives.

Abstract: Macrocyclic peptides are an emerging modality that combines biologics-like affinity with small-molecule-like developability, but their vast combinatorial space and multi-parameter objectives make lead optimization slow and challenging. Prior generative approaches such as PepINVENT require chemists to pre-specify mutable positions for optimization, choices that are not always known a priori, and rely on static pretraining and optimization algorithms that limit the model's ability to generalize and effectively optimize peptide sequences. We introduce PepEVOLVE, a position-aware, dynamic framework that learns both where to edit and how to dynamically optimize peptides for multi-objective improvement. PepEVOLVE (i) augments pretraining with dynamic masking and CHUCKLES shifting to improve generalization, (ii) uses a context-free multi-armed bandit router that discovers high-reward residues, and (iii) couples a novel evolving optimization algorithm with group-relative advantage to stabilize reinforcement updates. During in silico evaluations, the router policy reliably learns and concentrates probability on chemically meaningful sites that influence the peptide's properties. On a therapeutically motivated Rev-binding macrocycle benchmark, PepEVOLVE outperformed PepINVENT by reaching higher mean scores (approximately 0.8 vs. 0.6), achieving best candidates with a score of 0.95 (vs. 0.87), and converging in fewer steps under the task of optimizing permeability and lipophilicity with structural constraints. Overall, PepEVOLVE offers a practical, reproducible path to peptide lead optimization when optimal edit sites are unknown, enabling more efficient exploration and improving design quality across multiple objectives.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces CroTad, a threshold-free framework utilizing contrastive and reinforcement learning for real-time sub-trajectory anomaly detection, addressing challenges like noisiness and irregular sampling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve anomaly detection in modern ITS by addressing limitations like sub-trajectory analysis underutilization, dependency on thresholds, and issues with noisy, irregular sampling of trajectory data.

Method: CroTad employs contrastive learning to identify diverse normal travel patterns and reinforcement learning for real-time, threshold-free anomaly scoring at sub-trajectory and point levels.

Result: Experimental validation on two real-world datasets shows CroTad's effectiveness and adaptability in detecting trajectory anomalies.

Conclusion: CroTad resolves key challenges in trajectory anomaly detection by offering a robust, real-time solution adaptable to real-world noisy data scenarios.

Abstract: Detecting trajectory anomalies is a vital task in modern Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), enabling the identification of unsafe, inefficient, or irregular travel behaviours. While deep learning has emerged as the dominant approach, several key challenges remain unresolved. First, sub-trajectory anomaly detection, capable of pinpointing the precise segments where anomalies occur, remains underexplored compared to whole-trajectory analysis. Second, many existing methods depend on carefully tuned thresholds, limiting their adaptability in real-world applications. Moreover, the irregular sampling of trajectory data and the presence of noise in training sets further degrade model performance, making it difficult to learn reliable representations of normal routes. To address these challenges, we propose a contrastive reinforcement learning framework for online trajectory anomaly detection, CroTad. Our method is threshold-free and robust to noisy, irregularly sampled data. By incorporating contrastive learning, CroTad learns to extract diverse normal travel patterns for different itineraries and effectively distinguish anomalous behaviours at both sub-trajectory and point levels. The detection module leverages deep reinforcement learning to perform online, real-time anomaly scoring, enabling timely and fine-grained identification of abnormal segments. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our framework across various evaluation scenarios.

*Angelina Yan,Matt L. Sampson,Peter Melchior*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a pipeline for effective arrhythmia classification in wearable ECGs across varying sampling frequencies, achieving high classification performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Wearable ECGs are limited by the intermittent nature of clinical devices and reduced sampling frequencies due to battery constraints, impacting morphology analysis.

Method: The authors use latent ODE modeling to generate feature vectors from single-channel signals at various sampling frequencies, classified using gradient boosted trees.

Result: Minimal performance degradation is observed across frequencies with macro-averaged AUC-ROC values up to 0.984, demonstrating robustness.

Conclusion: The approach mitigates trade-offs between signal fidelity and battery life, enabling smaller wearables and facilitating long-term cardiac health monitoring.

Abstract: 12-lead ECGs with high sampling frequency are the clinical gold standard for arrhythmia detection, but their short-term, spot-check nature often misses intermittent events. Wearable ECGs enable long-term monitoring but suffer from irregular, lower sampling frequencies due to battery constraints, making morphology analysis challenging. We present an end-to-end classification pipeline to address these issues. We train a latent ODE to model continuous ECG waveforms and create robust feature vectors from high-frequency single-channel signals. We construct three latent vectors per waveform via downsampling the initial 360 Hz ECG to 90 Hz and 45 Hz. We then use a gradient boosted tree to classify these vectors and test robustness across frequencies. Performance shows minimal degradation, with macro-averaged AUC-ROC values of 0.984, 0.978, and 0.976 at 360 Hz, 90 Hz, and 45 Hz, respectively, suggesting a way to sidestep the trade-off between signal fidelity and battery life. This enables smaller wearables, promoting long-term monitoring of cardiac health.

### [208] [ToC: Tree-of-Claims Search with Multi-Agent Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16972)
*Shuyang Yu,Jianan Liang,Hui Hu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Tree of Claims (ToC), a framework for optimizing patent claims that combines Large Language Models with Monte Carlo Tree Search to improve claim novelty, scope retention, and semantic coherence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Optimizing patent claims is complex due to the need for a balance between novelty and legal scope, while manual drafting is inconsistent and LLMs lack structured reasoning for effective claim refinement.

Method: The method incorporates Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with a multi-agent system, including an LLM-based EditorAgent for proposing edits and an ExaminerAgent simulating patent examiner analyses, guided by a multi-objective reward function.

Result: ToC delivers an 8% average improvement in composite scores (and up to 9% in some cases) compared to standard LLMs based on experiments with 1145 claims. Ablation studies validate its performance.

Conclusion: ToC provides a transparent and interpretable framework that effectively combines LLM reasoning and MCTS for optimizing patent claims, surpassing traditional methods in quality and coherence.

Abstract: Optimizing patent claims is a critical yet challenging task, demanding careful balance between maximizing novelty and preserving legal scope. Manual claim drafting is labor-intensive, costly, and inherently inconsistent, while conventional Large Language Models (LLMs) often lack the structured, iterative reasoning essential for precise claim refinement. To address these challenges, we introduce Tree of Claims (ToC), an innovative framework that redefines claim editing as a guided search problem. ToC synergistically integrates Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with a collaborative multi-agent system, comprising an LLM-based EditorAgent that proposes contextually grounded edits, and an ExaminerAgent that mimics patent examiner critiques through structured, chain-of-thought analyses of novelty and prior art disclosure. Driven by a carefully designed multi-objective reward function, ToC jointly optimizes novelty, scope retention, and semantic coherence. Experimental evaluation on a benchmark of 1145 claims demonstrates that ToC significantly outperforms standard LLMs in zero-shot and few-shot scenarios, achieving an average composite score improvement of 8\%, and up to 9\% in certain cases. Extensive experiments, including detailed ablation studies, validate ToC's efficacy in generating superior, legally robust claim revisions. Overall, ToC establishes a transparent, controllable, and interpretable methodology that effectively bridges advanced LLM reasoning capabilities with strategic MCTS planning for structured patent claim optimization.The source code is available at https://github.com/ysy2003/ToC.

### [209] [FIRM: Federated In-client Regularized Multi-objective Alignment for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16992)
*Fatemeh,Nourzad,Amirhossein Roknilamouki,Eylem Ekici,Jia,Liu,Ness B. Shroff*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces FIRM, a new federated learning algorithm for aligning large language models with human values by reducing client disagreement and enhancing communication efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Balancing multiple human values in large language models is computationally costly and raises privacy concerns, with current Federated Multi-Objective Optimization methods being communication-heavy and not scalable.

Method: FIRM involves locally solving a regularized multi-objective optimization problem on client devices, avoiding the need to transmit large multi-gradients by only sending adjusted parameters.

Result: The proposed method converges to Pareto-stationary points, ensures finite-time convergence, smoothes training dynamics, reduces client disagreement drift, and strengthens trade-offs based on objective preferences.

Conclusion: FIRM offers an efficient and scalable solution to federated multi-objective alignment, addressing both communication and computational challenges while providing new adaptability in objective trade-offs.

Abstract: Aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human values often involves balancing multiple, conflicting objectives such as helpfulness and harmlessness. Training these models is computationally intensive, and centralizing the process raises significant data privacy concerns. Federated Learning (FL) offers a compelling alternative, but existing Federated Multi-Objective Optimization (FMOO) methods face severe communication bottlenecks as their reliance on transmitting multiple gradients to a server is unscalable for large models. We introduce FIRM (Federated In-client Regularized Multi-objective alignment), a novel algorithm that achieves both client disagreement drift mitigation and communication efficiency. In FIRM, each client locally solves a regularized multi-objective optimization problem. By directly mitigating client disagreement drift through in-client regularization, our method eliminates the need for the multi-gradient transmissions common in prior works. Consequently, clients need only to transmit a single set of adapted parameters, maintaining high communication efficiency. We prove that our algorithm converges to Pareto-stationary points and, to our knowledge, provide the first finite-time convergence guarantees for this federated multi-objective alignment setting. Empirically, we show that FIRM leads to smoother training dynamics, reduced client disagreement drift, and improved reward trade-offs compared to baselines. We further propose a method to incorporate a preference over the objectives and report empirical Pareto plots, demonstrating that FIRM can smoothly adapt trade-offs between objectives in response to specified preferences.

### [210] [Mask the Redundancy: Evolving Masking Representation Learning for Multivariate Time-Series Clustering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17008)
*Zexi Tan,Xiaopeng Luo,Yunlin Liu,Yiqun Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel method, EMTC, to improve Multivariate Time-Series clustering by addressing redundancy in temporal data and enhancing discriminative timestamp representation through adaptive masking and multi-view learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MTS clustering performance is hindered by the substantial redundancy found in temporal data, which reduces attention to discriminative timestamps. Existing masking strategies fail to dynamically adapt to clustering-critical timestamps in representation learning.

Method: The proposed EMTC method uses two key modules: (1) Importance-aware Variate-wise Masking (IVM) to adaptively highlight discriminative timestamps, and (2) Multi-Endogenous Views (MEV) for reconstruction and contrastive learning to optimize representation and clustering collaboratively.

Result: EMTC demonstrated significant performance improvements over eight state-of-the-art methods on 15 benchmarks, achieving an average performance boost of 4.85% compared to the strongest baselines.

Conclusion: EMTC effectively addresses the challenges of redundancy and static masking in MTS data clustering, providing adaptive and generalizable representation learning that enhances clustering performance significantly.

Abstract: Multivariate Time-Series (MTS) clustering discovers intrinsic grouping patterns of temporal data samples. Although time-series provide rich discriminative information, they also contain substantial redundancy, such as steady-state machine operation records and zero-output periods of solar power generation. Such redundancy diminishes the attention given to discriminative timestamps in representation learning, thus leading to performance bottlenecks in MTS clustering. Masking has been widely adopted to enhance the MTS representation, where temporal reconstruction tasks are designed to capture critical information from MTS. However, most existing masking strategies appear to be standalone preprocessing steps, isolated from the learning process, which hinders dynamic adaptation to the importance of clustering-critical timestamps. Accordingly, this paper proposes the Evolving-masked MTS Clustering (EMTC) method, with its model architecture composed of Importance-aware Variate-wise Masking (IVM) and Multi-Endogenous Views (MEV) representation learning modules. IVM adaptively guides the model in learning more discriminative representations for clustering, while the MEV-based reconstruction and contrastive learning pathways enhance the generalization. That is, the MEV reconstruction facilitates multi-perspective complementary to prevent the masking from premature convergence, and the clustering-guided contrastive learning facilitates the joint optimization of representation and clustering. Extensive experiments on 15 real benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of EMTC in comparison with eight SOTA methods, where the EMTC achieves an average improvement of 4.85% over the strongest baselines.

### [211] [Energy Scaling Laws for Diffusion Models: Quantifying Compute and Carbon Emissions in Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17031)
*Aniketh Iyengar,Jiaqi Han,Boris Ruf,Vincent Grari,Marcin Detyniecki,Stefano Ermon*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to predict GPU energy consumption for diffusion models using an adaptation of Kaplan scaling laws, validated through experiments on different models and GPUs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the rising energy demands and environmental concerns of diffusion models in image generation and to provide a principled approach for predicting energy consumption across various configurations.

Method: The authors adapted Kaplan scaling laws to predict energy consumption by focusing on computational complexity (FLOPs) and decomposing inference into key operations, emphasizing the dominant role of denoising.

Result: Their energy scaling model achieved high accuracy (R-squared > 0.9) within individual GPU architectures and demonstrated strong cross-architecture generalization, validating its reliability.

Conclusion: The study provides a robust framework for energy prediction of diffusion models, enabling better resource planning and sustainable AI deployment.

Abstract: The rapidly growing computational demands of diffusion models for image generation have raised significant concerns about energy consumption and environmental impact. While existing approaches to energy optimization focus on architectural improvements or hardware acceleration, there is a lack of principled methods to predict energy consumption across different model configurations and hardware setups. We propose an adaptation of Kaplan scaling laws to predict GPU energy consumption for diffusion models based on computational complexity (FLOPs). Our approach decomposes diffusion model inference into text encoding, iterative denoising, and decoding components, with the hypothesis that denoising operations dominate energy consumption due to their repeated execution across multiple inference steps. We conduct comprehensive experiments across four state-of-the-art diffusion models (Stable Diffusion 2, Stable Diffusion 3.5, Flux, and Qwen) on three GPU architectures (NVIDIA A100, A4000, A6000), spanning various inference configurations including resolution (256x256 to 1024x1024), precision (fp16/fp32), step counts (10-50), and classifier-free guidance settings. Our energy scaling law achieves high predictive accuracy within individual architectures (R-squared > 0.9) and exhibits strong cross-architecture generalization, maintaining high rank correlations across models and enabling reliable energy estimation for unseen model-hardware combinations. These results validate the compute-bound nature of diffusion inference and provide a foundation for sustainable AI deployment planning and carbon footprint estimation.

### [212] [Step-E: A Differentiable Data Cleaning Framework for Robust Learning with Noisy Labels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17040)
*Wenzhang Du*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Step-E, an integrated framework that improves deep model performance on noisy datasets by prioritizing clean and consistent examples during training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training data in the wild often include noisy labels and outliers, which hinder the performance of deep neural networks. Existing methods focus on data cleaning as a separate preprocessing step, lacking integration with downstream model feedback and adaptation to unknown noise patterns.

Method: Step-E integrates sample selection with model training by ranking samples based on loss per epoch, excluding high-loss examples after a warm-up phase, and focusing learning on consistent examples. This forms an online curriculum that progressively ignores persistent outliers.

Result: Step-E significantly improved test accuracies on noisy datasets like CIFAR-100N (from 43.3% to 50.4%) and CIFAR-10N (from 83.9% to 85.3%), outperforming baseline methods and approaching clean-label oracle performance, with minimal computational overhead.

Conclusion: By integrating sample selection and model learning, Step-E effectively handles noisy labels and outliers, offering a robust framework for training deep neural networks on imperfect real-world datasets.

Abstract: Training data collected in the wild often contain noisy labels and outliers that substantially degrade the performance and reliability of deep neural networks. While data cleaning is commonly applied as a separate preprocessing stage, such two-stage pipelines neither fully exploit feedback from the downstream model nor adapt to unknown noise patterns. We propose Step-E, a simple framework that integrates sample selection and model learning into a single optimization process. At each epoch, Step-E ranks samples by loss and gradually increases the fraction of high-loss examples that are excluded from gradient updates after a brief warm-up stage, yielding an online curriculum that focuses on easy and consistent examples and eventually ignores persistent outliers. On CIFAR-100N, Step-E improves the test accuracy of a ResNet-18 model from 43.3% (+/- 0.7%) to 50.4% (+/- 0.9%), clearly outperforming loss truncation, self-paced learning, and one-shot filtering while approaching the clean-label oracle at 60.5% (+/- 0.2%). On CIFAR-10N (aggre), Step-E also improves over the noisy baseline (85.3% vs. 83.9%) and nearly matches the clean-label oracle (85.9%), with only moderate training-time overhead.

### [213] [Hash Collisions in Molecular Fingerprints: Effects on Property Prediction and Bayesian Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17078)
*Walter Virany,Austin Tripp*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores the accuracy differences between exact and compressed molecular fingerprints in predictive models, showing minor accuracy improvements for exact fingerprints but no significant optimization benefits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the potential accuracy limitations caused by hash collisions in molecular fingerprinting, which can lead to biased molecular similarity calculations.

Method: The study compares exact fingerprints with compressed ones in molecular property prediction and Bayesian optimization tasks, using Gaussian process models and benchmarks from the DOCKSTRING dataset.

Result: Exact fingerprints demonstrated small and consistent improvements in predictive accuracy across five molecular property prediction benchmarks.

Conclusion: While exact fingerprints enhance predictive accuracy slightly, they offer no major advantages in Bayesian optimization performance.

Abstract: Molecular fingerprinting methods use hash functions to create fixed-length vector representations of molecules. However, hash collisions cause distinct substructures to be represented with the same feature, leading to overestimates in molecular similarity calculations. We investigate whether using exact fingerprints improves accuracy compared to standard compressed fingerprints in molecular property prediction and Bayesian optimization where the underlying predictive model is a Gaussian process. We find that using exact fingerprints yields a small yet consistent improvement in predictive accuracy on five molecular property prediction benchmarks from the DOCKSTRING dataset. However, these gains did not translate to significant improvements in Bayesian optimization performance.

### [214] [Why Do Language Model Agents Whistleblow?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17085)
*Kushal Agrawal,Frank Xiao,Guido Bergman,Asa Cooper Stickland*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Analyzes LLM behavior in whistleblowing scenarios, exploring tendencies and triggers for disclosing misconduct.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and evaluate how LLMs act in tool-using and whistleblowing scenarios, especially when they contradict user instructions or interests.

Method: Developed a realistic evaluation suite of staged misconduct scenarios. Analyzed behavior across models with varying prompts, task complexities, and tool availability.

Result: Discovered factors influencing whistleblowing rates: model family variation, task complexity reduction, moral system prompts increasing whistleblowing, and detailed workflows reducing whistleblowing.

Conclusion: LLM tendencies to whistleblow vary based on task complexity, design prompts, models, and workflow structures. Further exploration required for aligning tool-using agents effectively.

Abstract: The deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) as tool-using agents causes their alignment training to manifest in new ways. Recent work finds that language models can use tools in ways that contradict the interests or explicit instructions of the user. We study LLM whistleblowing: a subset of this behavior where models disclose suspected misconduct to parties beyond the dialog boundary (e.g., regulatory agencies) without user instruction or knowledge. We introduce an evaluation suite of diverse and realistic staged misconduct scenarios to assess agents for this behavior. Across models and settings, we find that: (1) the frequency of whistleblowing varies widely across model families, (2) increasing the complexity of the task the agent is instructed to complete lowers whistleblowing tendencies, (3) nudging the agent in the system prompt to act morally substantially raises whistleblowing rates, and (4) giving the model more obvious avenues for non-whistleblowing behavior, by providing more tools and a detailed workflow to follow, decreases whistleblowing rates. Additionally, we verify the robustness of our dataset by testing for model evaluation awareness, and find that both black-box methods and probes on model activations show lower evaluation awareness in our settings than in comparable previous work.

### [215] [Geometric-Disentangelment Unlearning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17100)
*Duo Zhou,Yuji Zhang,Tianxin Wei,Ruizhong Qiu,Ke Yang,Xiao Lin,Cheng Qian,Jingrui He,Hanghang Tong,Heng Ji,Huan Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework called Geometric-disentanglement Unlearning (GU) to address the challenge of effective forgetting while preserving model performance on retained data in machine unlearning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Machine unlearning is necessary for privacy and reliable models but comes with a tradeoff: forgetting certain data often damages performance on retained data. There is a lack of theoretical grounding to minimize this tradeoff.

Method: The authors conducted a first-order analysis of how training updates impact retained data. They identified the retain-invariant condition by ensuring forgetting updates are orthogonal to retain-gradient subspaces. They proposed GU which separates a forget update into tangential and normal components, focusing on only the normal component for training.

Result: GU improves forgetting performance while preserving retained knowledge compared to existing methods. Experiments showed consistent enhancements across TOFU, MUSE, and WMDP benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed GU method provides a theoretically grounded, efficient, and compatible approach to improve gradient-based machine unlearning processes and addresses the tradeoff between forgetting and retaining model performance.

Abstract: Machine unlearning, the removal of a training subset's influence from a deployed model, is critical for privacy preservation and model reliability, yet gradient ascent on forget samples often harms retained knowledge. Existing approaches face a persistent tradeoff between effective forgetting and preservation on the retain set. While previous methods provide useful heuristics, they often lack a formal analysis on how exactly forgetting updates harm retained knowledge, and whether the side effects can be removed with theoretical guarantees. To explore a theoretically sound and simple solution, we start from the first principle on how performance on the retain set is actually affected: a first-order analysis of the local change of the retain loss under small parameter updates during model training. We start from a crisp equivalence: the retain loss is unchanged to first order iff the update direction is orthogonal to the subspace spanned by retain gradients ("retain-invariant"). This identifies the entangled component as the tangential part of forget update within the retain-gradient subspace, and characterizes disentanglement as orthogonality. Guided by this, we propose the Geometric-disentanglement Unlearning (GU) that decomposes any candidate forget gradient update into tangential and normal components to retain space and executes only the normal component. Under a standard trust-region budget, the projected direction aligned with the raw forget gradient is optimal among all first-order retain-invariant moves, and we also derive the optimal projected direction for joint forget-retain updating objectives. Our method is plug-and-play and can be attached to existing gradient-based unlearning procedures to mitigate side effects. GU achieves consistent improvement on various methods across three benchmarks TOFU, MUSE, and WMDP.

TL;DR: This paper presents a new 42-year pan-Arctic land surface temperature (LST) dataset downscaled from coarse satellite data to 1 km resolution using deep learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations of coarse spatial resolution in satellite LST data for analyzing fine-scale Arctic climate processes.

Method: The method involves a super-resolution algorithm based on a deep anisotropic diffusion model, trained on MODIS LST data and refined using land cover, elevation, and vegetation data.

Result: A pan-Arctic LST dataset spanning four decades with twice-daily, 1 km resolution observations was developed, enabling improved climate research.

Conclusion: This dataset enhances climate modeling, supports pre-MODIS-era monitoring, and provides a foundation for future satellite missions.

Abstract: Land surface temperature (LST) is an essential climate variable (ECV) crucial for understanding land-atmosphere energy exchange and monitoring climate change, especially in the rapidly warming Arctic. Long-term satellite-based LST records, such as those derived from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR), are essential for detecting climate trends. However, the coarse spatial resolution of AVHRR's global area coverage (GAC) data limit their utility for analyzing fine-scale permafrost dynamics and other surface processes in the Arctic. This paper presents a new 42 years pan-Arctic LST dataset, downscaled from AVHRR GAC to 1 km with a super-resolution algorithm based on a deep anisotropic diffusion model. The model is trained on MODIS LST data, using coarsened inputs and native-resolution outputs, guided by high-resolution land cover, digital elevation, and vegetation height maps. The resulting dataset provides twice-daily, 1 km LST observations for the entire pan-Arctic region over four decades. This enhanced dataset enables improved modelling of permafrost, reconstruction of near-surface air temperature, and assessment of surface mass balance of the Greenland Ice Sheet. Additionally, it supports climate monitoring efforts in the pre-MODIS era and offers a framework adaptable to future satellite missions for thermal infrared observation and climate data record continuity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the challenges of noise and acquisition difficulty in sEMG measurements, and provide wearable alternatives using IMU for prosthetics and rehabilitation biofeedback.

Method: Simultaneous sEMG and IMU data were collected, and a Sliding-Window-Wave-Net model using dilated causal convolutions was trained to map IMU data to normalized sEMG signals.

Result: The model successfully predicted the timing and shape of muscle activations but underestimated peak amplitudes, still showcasing high temporal fidelity.

Conclusion: This method demonstrates feasibility for applications in muscle intent detection, particularly in prosthetics and rehabilitation biofeedback systems.

Abstract: Surface Electromyography (sEMG) provides vital insights into muscle function, but it can be noisy and challenging to acquire. Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) provide a robust and wearable alternative to motion capture systems. This paper investigates the synthesis of normalized sEMG signals from 6-axis IMU data using a deep learning approach. We collected simultaneous sEMG and IMU data sampled at 1~KHz for various arm movements. A Sliding-Window-Wave-Net model, based on dilated causal convolutions, was trained to map the IMU data to the sEMG signal. The results show that the model successfully predicts the timing and general shape of muscle activations. Although peak amplitudes were often underestimated, the high temporal fidelity demonstrates the feasibility of using this method for muscle intent detection in applications such as prosthetics and rehabilitation biofeedback.

Result: DelTriC demonstrates superior performance compared to traditional clustering algorithms in various scenarios and significantly enhances outlier detection.

Conclusion: DelTriC offers an innovative and robust approach to clustering, excelling in scalability, accuracy, and anomaly detection.

Abstract: The paper introduces DelTriC (Delaunay Triangulation Clustering), a clustering algorithm which integrates PCA/UMAP-based projection, Delaunay triangulation, and a novel back-projection mechanism to form clusters in the original high-dimensional space. DelTriC decouples neighborhood construction from decision-making by first triangulating in a low-dimensional proxy to index local adjacency, and then back-projecting to the original space to perform robust edge pruning, merging, and anomaly detection. DelTriC can outperform traditional methods such as k-means, DBSCAN, and HDBSCAN in many scenarios; it is both scalable and accurate, and it also significantly improves outlier detection.

TL;DR: This paper introduces TS-DFM, a framework for predicting transition states (TSs) in chemical reactions using a novel network structure operating in molecular geometry space.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate understanding of transition states in reaction mechanisms is limited by complex experimental and computational methods. This necessitates a computational tool to efficiently predict TSs.

Method: TS-DFM operates in molecular distance geometry space and employs a network, TSDVNet, to learn velocity fields for TS geometry prediction. It also accelerates convergence in CI-NEB optimization and identifies alternative reaction paths.

Result: TS-DFM outperforms React-OT by 30% in structural accuracy on Transition1X dataset, detects lower-energy TSs, and generalizes well to unseen molecules and reaction types as proven on RGD1 dataset.

Conclusion: TS-DFM presents an accurate, efficient, and generalizable solution to predict TSs, offering a significant advancement in reaction mechanism exploration.

Abstract: Transition states (TSs) are crucial for understanding reaction mechanisms, yet their exploration is limited by the complexity of experimental and computational approaches. Here we propose TS-DFM, a flow matching framework that predicts TSs from reactants and products. By operating in molecular distance geometry space, TS-DFM explicitly captures the dynamic changes of interatomic distances in chemical reactions. A network structure named TSDVNet is designed to learn the velocity field for generating TS geometries accurately. On the benchmark dataset Transition1X, TS-DFM outperforms the previous state-of-the-art method React-OT by 30\% in structural accuracy. These predicted TSs provide high-quality initial structures, accelerating the convergence of CI-NEB optimization. Additionally, TS-DFM can identify alternative reaction paths. In our experiments, even a more favorable TS with lower energy barrier is discovered. Further tests on RGD1 dataset confirm its strong generalization ability on unseen molecules and reaction types, highlighting its potential for facilitating reaction exploration.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sampling 3D molecular structures and their conformations is critical for understanding molecular properties and designing drugs. Current methods generate limited conformational information, hindering assessments of molecular characteristics.

Method: FlexiFlow introduces a novel architecture that builds on flow-matching models, ensuring equivariance and permutation invariance, while enabling sampling of molecules along with diverse conformations.

Result: FlexiFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance on molecular generation tasks using QM9 and GEOM Drugs datasets. It excels in generating valid and novel molecules with conformational diversity efficiently compared to physics-based methods.

Conclusion: FlexiFlow effectively generates molecular conformational ensembles. It bridges gaps in current 3D molecular generation methods by improving coverage and inference efficiency, and adapts successfully to protein-conditioned ligand generation tasks.

Abstract: Sampling useful three-dimensional molecular structures along with their most favorable conformations is a key challenge in drug discovery. Current state-of-the-art 3D de-novo design flow matching or diffusion-based models are limited to generating a single conformation. However, the conformational landscape of a molecule determines its observable properties and how tightly it is able to bind to a given protein target. By generating a representative set of low-energy conformers, we can more directly assess these properties and potentially improve the ability to generate molecules with desired thermodynamic observables. Towards this aim, we propose FlexiFlow, a novel architecture that extends flow-matching models, allowing for the joint sampling of molecules along with multiple conformations while preserving both equivariance and permutation invariance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on the QM9 and GEOM Drugs datasets, achieving state-of-the-art results in molecular generation tasks. Our results show that FlexiFlow can generate valid, unstrained, unique, and novel molecules with high fidelity to the training data distribution, while also capturing the conformational diversity of molecules. Moreover, we show that our model can generate conformational ensembles that provide similar coverage to state-of-the-art physics-based methods at a fraction of the inference time. Finally, FlexiFlow can be successfully transferred to the protein-conditioned ligand generation task, even when the dataset contains only static pockets without accompanying conformations.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores projection methods to effectively handle nonlinear constraints in neural PDE solvers and demonstrates their improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural PDE solvers often violate governing equation constraints, particularly complex nonlinear ones, which limits their accuracy in scientific simulations.

Method: Two training-free, post hoc projection methods are evaluated: nonlinear optimization-based projection and local linearization-based projection using Jacobian and vector operations.

Result: Both proposed projections reduce constraint violations significantly and improve accuracy compared to physics-informed baselines.

Conclusion: These post hoc projection methods enhance the reliability of neural PDE solvers for complex scenarios with nonlinear constraints.

Abstract: Neural PDE solvers used for scientific simulation often violate governing equation constraints. While linear constraints can be projected cheaply, many constraints are nonlinear, complicating projection onto the feasible set. Dynamical PDEs are especially difficult because constraints induce long-range dependencies in time. In this work, we evaluate two training-free, post hoc projections of approximate solutions: a nonlinear optimization-based projection, and a local linearization-based projection using Jacobian-vector and vector-Jacobian products. We analyze constraints across representative PDEs and find that both projections substantially reduce violations and improve accuracy over physics-informed baselines.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Premium car manufacturers face complexities in demand forecasting due to high product variety, sparse data at variant levels, and dynamic market conditions.

Method: The methodology involves LightGBM ensembles with pooled training sets, quantile regression, and mixed-integer linear programming for hierarchical demand forecast reconciliation.

Result: Results show spatiotemporal dependencies and rounding bias impact forecast accuracy. Integer forecasts are critical for operational needs, with online behavioral data enhancing accuracy at detailed levels.

Conclusion: The approach using LightGBM ensembles and reconciliation improves forecasting across hierarchical levels and demonstrates the influence of various short-term and medium-term factors on demand.

Abstract: Premium automotive manufacturers face increasingly complex forecasting challenges due to high product variety, sparse variant-level data, and volatile market dynamics. This study addresses monthly automobile demand forecasting across a multi-product, multi-market, and multi-level hierarchy using data from a German premium manufacturer. The methodology combines point and probabilistic forecasts across strategic and operational planning levels, leveraging ensembles of LightGBM models with pooled training sets, quantile regression, and a mixed-integer linear programming reconciliation approach. Results highlight that spatiotemporal dependencies, as well as rounding bias, significantly affect forecast accuracy, underscoring the importance of integer forecasts for operational feasibility. Shapley analysis shows that short-term demand is reactive, shaped by life cycle maturity, autoregressive momentum, and operational signals, whereas medium-term demand reflects anticipatory drivers such as online engagement, planning targets, and competitive indicators, with online behavioral data considerably improving accuracy at disaggregated levels.

Abstract: Ultrafast electron beam X-ray computed tomography produces noisy data due to short measurement times, causing reconstruction artifacts and limiting overall image quality. To counteract these issues, two self-supervised deep learning methods for denoising of raw detector data were investigated and compared against a non-learning based denoising method. We found that the application of the deep-learning-based methods was able to enhance signal-to-noise ratios in the detector data and also led to consistent improvements of the reconstructed images, outperforming the non-learning based method.

*Yassir Bendou,Omar Ezzahir,Eduardo Fernandes Montesuma,Gabriel Mahuas,Victoria Shevchenko,Mike Gartrell*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces Repulsive Bayesian Prompt Learning (ReBaPL), a method enhancing Bayesian prompt learning through efficient exploration using SGHMC and integrating representation-space repulsion for improved robustness and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prompt tuning in large-scale foundation models often faces challenges like overfitting and limited generalization. This study aims to address such limitations by refining Bayesian prompt learning for robustness and adaptability.

Method: The paper proposes the ReBaPL framework, which integrates a cyclical step-size schedule with the stochastic gradient Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (SGHMC) algorithm for efficient exploration of the posterior landscape and introduces a repulsive force in representation space to promote diversity.

Result: ReBaPL achieves superior performance and generalization in Bayesian prompt learning, outperforming state-of-the-art methods across multiple benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed ReBaPL method enhances flexibility and robustness in Bayesian prompt learning, representing a modular, plug-and-play Bayesian extension applicable to existing maximum likelihood-based prompt learning techniques.

Abstract: Prompt learning has emerged as an effective technique for fine-tuning large-scale foundation models for downstream tasks. However, conventional prompt tuning methods are prone to overfitting and can struggle with out-of-distribution generalization. To address these limitations, Bayesian prompt learning has been proposed, which frames prompt optimization as a Bayesian inference problem to enhance robustness. This paper introduces Repulsive Bayesian Prompt Learning (ReBaPL), a novel method for Bayesian prompt learning, designed to efficiently explore the complex and often multimodal posterior landscape of prompts. Our method integrates a cyclical step-size schedule with a stochastic gradient Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (SGHMC) algorithm, enabling alternating phases of exploration to discover new modes, and exploitation to refine existing modes. Furthermore, we introduce a repulsive force derived from a potential function over probability metrics (including Maximum Mean Discrepancy and Wasserstein distance) computed on the distributions of representations produced by different prompts. This representation-space repulsion diversifies exploration and prevents premature collapse to a single mode. Our approach allows for a more comprehensive characterization of the prompt posterior distribution, leading to improved generalization. In contrast to prior Bayesian prompt learning methods, our method provides a modular plug-and-play Bayesian extension of any existing prompt learning method based on maximum likelihood estimation. We demonstrate the efficacy of ReBaPL on several benchmark datasets, showing superior performance over state-of-the-art methods for prompt learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL) has potential to better capture temporal structure and improve continual learning but lacks strong theoretical foundations.

Method: The paper develops Feudal Q-learning and uses stochastic approximation and ODE methods to analyze its convergence and stability, presenting theoretical guarantees.

Result: The convergence and stability of Feudal Q-learning are proven and interpreted as an equilibrium of a game. Experimental results support the theoretical findings.

Conclusion: Feudal Q-learning provides theoretical insights and practical validation, offering a strong foundation for HRL and associating it with game-theoretic concepts.

Abstract: Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning promises, among other benefits, to efficiently capture and utilize the temporal structure of a decision-making problem and to enhance continual learning capabilities, but theoretical guarantees lag behind practice. In this paper, we propose a Feudal Q-learning scheme and investigate under which conditions its coupled updates converge and are stable. By leveraging the theory of Stochastic Approximation and the ODE method, we present a theorem stating the convergence and stability properties of Feudal Q-learning. This provides a principled convergence and stability analysis tailored to Feudal RL. Moreover, we show that the updates converge to a point that can be interpreted as an equilibrium of a suitably defined game, opening the door to game-theoretic approaches to Hierarchical RL. Lastly, experiments based on the Feudal Q-learning algorithm support the outcomes anticipated by theory.

### [226] [R2PS: Worst-Case Robust Real-Time Pursuit Strategies under Partial Observability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17367)
*Runyu Lu,Ruochuan Shi,Yuanheng Zhu,Dongbin Zhao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents a novel approach to develop real-time robust pursuit strategies in graph-based Pursuit-Evasion Games (PEGs) under partial observability, achieved through dynamic programming and graph-based reinforcement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for Pursuit-Evasion Games lack real-time applicability and robustness when pursuers have imperfect information and evaders can predict actions in partially observable settings.

Method: The paper integrates dynamic programming for Markov PEGs, a belief preservation mechanism, and adapts the EPG framework through cross-graph reinforcement learning.

Result: The proposed method enables robust zero-shot generalization to unseen graph structures and outperforms existing RL-based methods trained directly on test graphs.

Conclusion: The approach successfully addresses real-time strategy generation under partial observability, enhancing performance in dynamic and unpredictable environments.

Abstract: Computing worst-case robust strategies in pursuit-evasion games (PEGs) is time-consuming, especially when real-world factors like partial observability are considered. While important for general security purposes, real-time applicable pursuit strategies for graph-based PEGs are currently missing when the pursuers only have imperfect information about the evader's position. Although state-of-the-art reinforcement learning (RL) methods like Equilibrium Policy Generalization (EPG) and Grasper provide guidelines for learning graph neural network (GNN) policies robust to different game dynamics, they are restricted to the scenario of perfect information and do not take into account the possible case where the evader can predict the pursuers' actions. This paper introduces the first approach to worst-case robust real-time pursuit strategies (R2PS) under partial observability. We first prove that a traditional dynamic programming (DP) algorithm for solving Markov PEGs maintains optimality under the asynchronous moves by the evader. Then, we propose a belief preservation mechanism about the evader's possible positions, extending the DP pursuit strategies to a partially observable setting. Finally, we embed the belief preservation into the state-of-the-art EPG framework to finish our R2PS learning scheme, which leads to a real-time pursuer policy through cross-graph reinforcement learning against the asynchronous-move DP evasion strategies. After reinforcement learning, our policy achieves robust zero-shot generalization to unseen real-world graph structures and consistently outperforms the policy directly trained on the test graphs by the existing game RL approach.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how optimization dynamics in stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and its variants lead to generalization in deep learning. The paper also seeks to clarify the relationship between flat minima, data structure, and optimization methods.

Method: Introduces a linear stability framework, with a coherence measure, to analyze the behavior of stochastic gradient descent (SGD), random perturbations, and SAM, primarily in two-layer ReLU networks.

Result: The study identifies a coherence measure which quantifies gradient curvature alignment across data and explains why certain minima are favored and stable during training.

Conclusion: The findings connect data structure, optimization dynamics, and generalization, improving the understanding of why SGD and its variants prefer flat minima in deep learning.

Abstract: Understanding the dynamics of optimization in deep learning is increasingly important as models scale. While stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and its variants reliably find solutions that generalize well, the mechanisms driving this generalization remain unclear. Notably, these algorithms often prefer flatter or simpler minima, particularly in overparameterized settings. Prior work has linked flatness to generalization, and methods like Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) explicitly encourage flatness, but a unified theory connecting data structure, optimization dynamics, and the nature of learned solutions is still lacking. In this work, we develop a linear stability framework that analyzes the behavior of SGD, random perturbations, and SAM, particularly in two layer ReLU networks. Central to our analysis is a coherence measure that quantifies how gradient curvature aligns across data points, revealing why certain minima are stable and favored during training.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a framework to enhance coreset selection for deep learning, improving performance and efficiency by addressing limitations of existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for efficient coreset selection has become critical as deep learning models scale and computational demands increase.

Method: The authors introduce a novel framework that utilizes posterior sampling to robustly select coresets and employs a smoothed loss function to enhance stability and generalization.

Result: Experiments show that the proposed method achieves faster training and better generalization across various datasets when compared to state-of-the-art techniques.

Conclusion: Addressing challenges in gradient-based approaches, the proposed method improves coreset representativeness and computational efficiency, making it a valuable advancement for deep learning workflows.

Abstract: As deep learning models continue to scale, the growing computational demands have amplified the need for effective coreset selection techniques. Coreset selection aims to accelerate training by identifying small, representative subsets of data that approximate the performance of the full dataset. Among various approaches, gradient based methods stand out due to their strong theoretical underpinnings and practical benefits, particularly under limited data budgets. However, these methods face challenges such as naive stochastic gradient descent (SGD) acting as a surprisingly strong baseline and the breakdown of representativeness due to loss curvature mismatches over time.
  In this work, we propose a novel framework that addresses these limitations. First, we establish a connection between posterior sampling and loss landscapes, enabling robust coreset selection even in high data corruption scenarios. Second, we introduce a smoothed loss function based on posterior sampling onto the model weights, enhancing stability and generalization while maintaining computational efficiency. We also present a novel convergence analysis for our sampling-based coreset selection method. Finally, through extensive experiments, we demonstrate how our approach achieves faster training and enhanced generalization across diverse datasets than the current state of the art.

TL;DR: The paper introduces DS-Span, a single-phase discriminative subgraph mining framework overcoming inefficiencies in traditional multi-phase mining methods by unifying processes and optimizing subgraph generation and selection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve graph representation learning by addressing inefficiencies and coupling issues in existing subgraph mining methods like high computational costs and redundant processes.

Method: Proposed DS-Span, a unified framework integrating pattern growth, pruning, and supervision-driven scoring into a single traversal. It uses a coverage-capped eligibility mechanism and information-gain-guided selection to balance representation and redundancy.

Result: DS-Span produces compact yet discriminative subgraph features effectively, achieving comparable or improved classification accuracy and significantly reducing runtime in benchmark experiments.

Conclusion: Unified, single-phase discriminative subgraph mining like DS-Span can enhance scalability, efficiency, and interpretability in graph representation learning.

Abstract: Graph representation learning seeks to transform complex, high-dimensional graph structures into compact vector spaces that preserve both topology and semantics. Among the various strategies, subgraph-based methods provide an interpretable bridge between symbolic pattern discovery and continuous embedding learning. Yet, existing frequent or discriminative subgraph mining approaches often suffer from redundant multi-phase pipelines, high computational cost, and weak coupling between mined structures and their discriminative relevance. We propose DS-Span, a single-phase discriminative subgraph mining framework that unifies pattern growth, pruning, and supervision-driven scoring within one traversal of the search space. DS-Span introduces a coverage-capped eligibility mechanism that dynamically limits exploration once a graph is sufficiently represented, and an information-gain-guided selection that promotes subgraphs with strong class-separating ability while minimizing redundancy. The resulting subgraph set serves as an efficient, interpretable basis for downstream graph embedding and classification. Extensive experiments across benchmarks demonstrate that DS-Span generates more compact and discriminative subgraph features than prior multi-stage methods, achieving higher or comparable accuracy with significantly reduced runtime. These results highlight the potential of unified, single-phase discriminative mining as a foundation for scalable and interpretable graph representation learning.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a transformer-based framework, MAPT, for solving the Multi-Vehicle Dynamic Pickup and Delivery Problem with Stochastic Requests (MVDPDPSR) more efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome computational and efficiency bottlenecks in solving large-scale dynamic vehicle routing problems, especially when existing methods are unable to model joint actions effectively and struggle with capturing complex inter-entity relationships.

Method: The proposed Multi-Agent Pointer Transformer (MAPT) integrates a Transformer Encoder for entity representation, a Transformer Decoder combined with a Pointer Network for generating action sequences, and a Relation-Aware Attention module. It utilizes informative priors for guided decision-making.

Result: MAPT demonstrates superior performance on 8 datasets and offers significant computational speed advantages over traditional operations research methods.

Conclusion: MAPT is an effective and efficient solution for dynamic and large-scale vehicle routing problems, addressing the challenges faced by existing methods.

Abstract: This paper addresses the cooperative Multi-Vehicle Dynamic Pickup and Delivery Problem with Stochastic Requests (MVDPDPSR) and proposes an end-to-end centralized decision-making framework based on sequence-to-sequence, named Multi-Agent Pointer Transformer (MAPT). MVDPDPSR is an extension of the vehicle routing problem and a spatio-temporal system optimization problem, widely applied in scenarios such as on-demand delivery. Classical operations research methods face bottlenecks in computational complexity and time efficiency when handling large-scale dynamic problems. Although existing reinforcement learning methods have achieved some progress, they still encounter several challenges: 1) Independent decoding across multiple vehicles fails to model joint action distributions; 2) The feature extraction network struggles to capture inter-entity relationships; 3) The joint action space is exponentially large. To address these issues, we designed the MAPT framework, which employs a Transformer Encoder to extract entity representations, combines a Transformer Decoder with a Pointer Network to generate joint action sequences in an AutoRegressive manner, and introduces a Relation-Aware Attention module to capture inter-entity relationships. Additionally, we guide the model's decision-making using informative priors to facilitate effective exploration. Experiments on 8 datasets demonstrate that MAPT significantly outperforms existing baseline methods in terms of performance and exhibits substantial computational time advantages compared to classical operations research methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The new method InTAct addresses representation drift in continual learning under domain shifts by preserving activation ranges of shared layers, improving stability and plasticity without storing past data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To solve the problem of representation drift in continual learning, where shared features evolve and cause forgetting, especially under domain shifts.

Method: InTAct identifies and preserves characteristic activation ranges for previously learned tasks, constraining updates to stabilize neurons' functional roles while allowing adaptability without freezing parameters or storing past data.

Result: InTAct demonstrated significant improvement, boosting Average Accuracy by up to 8 percentage points over state-of-the-art baselines in domain-incremental benchmarks like DomainNet and ImageNet-R.

Conclusion: InTAct provides a robust and architecture-agnostic solution to representation drift, enhancing performance and achieving a balance between stability and adaptability in continual learning frameworks.

Abstract: Continual learning aims to enable neural networks to acquire new knowledge without forgetting previously learned information. While recent prompt-based methods perform strongly in class-incremental settings, they remain vulnerable under domain shifts, where the input distribution changes but the label space remains fixed. This exposes a persistent problem known as representation drift. Shared representations evolve in ways that overwrite previously useful features and cause forgetting even when prompts isolate task-specific parameters. To address this issue, we introduce InTAct, a method that preserves functional behavior in shared layers without freezing parameters or storing past data. InTAct captures the characteristic activation ranges associated with previously learned tasks and constrains updates to ensure the network remains consistent within these regions, while still allowing for flexible adaptation elsewhere. In doing so, InTAct stabilizes the functional role of important neurons rather than directly restricting parameter values. The approach is architecture-agnostic and integrates seamlessly into existing prompt-based continual learning frameworks. By regulating representation changes where past knowledge is encoded, InTAct achieves a principled balance between stability and plasticity. Across diverse domain-incremental benchmarks, including DomainNet and ImageNet-R, InTAct consistently reduces representation drift and improves performance, increasing Average Accuracy by up to 8 percentage points over state-of-the-art baselines.

TL;DR: This paper introduces MS-DGFormer, a transformer-based framework for analyzing minimally prepared raw mass spectral data, aimed at revolutionizing real-time pathogen detection in environmental settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the inefficiency of traditional MALDI-MS systems, which require labor-intensive sample preparation and multi-shot spectral averaging, limiting their utility in real-time environmental monitoring.

Method: The authors utilize a transformer-based architecture with a novel dictionary encoder leveraging SVD-derived denoised spectral information.

Result: MS-DGFormer demonstrates robust performance in single-shot pathogen identification from noisy aerosol spectra, facilitating autonomous real-time analysis.

Conclusion: The approach enables portable MALDI-MS platforms, significantly advancing environmental pathogen detection and response capabilities.

Abstract: Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization Mass Spectrometry (MALDI-MS) is a cornerstone in biomolecular analysis, offering precise identification of pathogens through unique mass spectral signatures. Yet, its reliance on labor-intensive sample preparation and multi-shot spectral averaging restricts its use to laboratory settings, rendering it impractical for real-time environmental monitoring. These limitations are especially pronounced in emerging aerosol MALDI-MS systems, where autonomous sampling generates noisy spectra for unknown aerosol analytes, requiring single-shot detection for effective analysis. Addressing these challenges, we propose the Mass Spectral Dictionary-Guided Transformer (MS-DGFormer): a data-driven framework that redefines spectral analysis by directly processing raw, minimally prepared mass spectral data. MS-DGFormer leverages a transformer architecture, designed to capture the long-range dependencies inherent in these time-series spectra. To enhance feature extraction, we introduce a novel dictionary encoder that integrates denoised spectral information derived from Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), enabling the model to discern critical biomolecular patterns from single-shot spectra with robust performance. This innovation provides a system to achieve superior pathogen identification from aerosol samples, facilitating autonomous, real-time analysis in field conditions. By eliminating the need for extensive preprocessing, our method unlocks the potential for portable, deployable MALDI-MS platforms, revolutionizing environmental pathogen detection and rapid response to biological threats.

Conclusion: The framework successfully enhances AI agents' personalization capabilities, enabling consistent persona-aligned behaviors and leveraging collective knowledge.

Abstract: We propose a novel framework for persona-based language model system, motivated by the need for personalized AI agents that adapt to individual user preferences. In our approach, the agent embodies the user's "persona" (e.g. user profile or taste) and is powered by a large language model (LLM). To enable the agent to leverage rich contextual information, we introduce a Knowledge-Graph-enhanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Graph RAG) mechanism that constructs an LLM-derived graph index of relevant documents and summarizes communities of related information. Our framework generates personalized prompts by combining: (1) a summary of the user's historical behaviors and preferences extracted from the knowledge graph, and (2) relevant global interaction patterns identified through graph-based community detection. This dynamic prompt engineering approach allows the agent to maintain consistent persona-aligned behaviors while benefiting from collective knowledge. On the LaMP benchmark, our method improves news categorization F1 by 11.1%, movie tagging F1 by 56.1%, and reduces product rating MAE by 10.4% over prior methods.

*Vinay Kanakeri,Shivam Bajaj,Ashwin Verma,Vijay Gupta,Aritra Mitra*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a clustering and learning framework for reinforcement learning in Linear Quadratic Regulator setting, to improve sample efficiency by utilizing data from similar processes, while avoiding biases from dissimilar processes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reinforcement learning is data-intensive, and utilizing data from similar processes could improve its sample efficiency. However, identifying similar processes remains challenging due to unknown models.

Method: The study proposes an algorithm combining sequential elimination and zeroth-order policy optimization for simultaneous clustering and learning. The algorithm clusters processes based on dynamic and task similarities for personalized policy learning.

Result: The algorithm guarantees high-probability correct clustering under suitable cluster separation conditions. Sub-optimality gaps in learned policies decrease with cluster size, without bias from dissimilar processes.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates clustering can enable personalized policy learning in data-driven control, enhancing statistical gains from collaboration without bias from dissimilar data. The method is efficient with minimal communication overhead.

Abstract: It is known that reinforcement learning (RL) is data-hungry. To improve sample-efficiency of RL, it has been proposed that the learning algorithm utilize data from 'approximately similar' processes. However, since the process models are unknown, identifying which other processes are similar poses a challenge. In this work, we study this problem in the context of the benchmark Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) setting. Specifically, we consider a setting with multiple agents, each corresponding to a copy of a linear process to be controlled. The agents' local processes can be partitioned into clusters based on similarities in dynamics and tasks. Combining ideas from sequential elimination and zeroth-order policy optimization, we propose a new algorithm that performs simultaneous clustering and learning to output a personalized policy (controller) for each cluster. Under a suitable notion of cluster separation that captures differences in closed-loop performance across systems, we prove that our approach guarantees correct clustering with high probability. Furthermore, we show that the sub-optimality gap of the policy learned for each cluster scales inversely with the size of the cluster, with no additional bias, unlike in prior works on collaborative learning-based control. Our work is the first to reveal how clustering can be used in data-driven control to learn personalized policies that enjoy statistical gains from collaboration but do not suffer sub-optimality due to inclusion of data from dissimilar processes. From a distributed implementation perspective, our method is attractive as it incurs only a mild logarithmic communication overhead.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the dynamics of volume-price distributions can reveal the underlying patterns in financial markets, critical for better forecasting and volatility analysis.

Method: The authors fitted volume-price data to statistical models (Gamma, Inverse Gamma, Weibull, and Log-Normal) and analyzed the time series for detrended parameters using adaptive binning and higher-order Kramers-Moyal coefficients.

Result: The study found distinct patterns in the dynamics of the shape ($φ$) and scale ($θ$) parameters, such as predominance of diffusion or jump-diffusion behavior across models, with implications for volatility analysis driven by rare discontinuities.

Conclusion: The stochastic evolution of volume-price distributions exhibits a variety of dynamics. Rare discontinuities significantly impact volatility, with varying behaviors for different statistical models.

Abstract: We present a data-driven framework to model the stochastic evolution of volume-price distribution from the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) equities. The empirical distributions are sampled every 10 minutes over 976 trading days, and fitted to different models, namely Gamma, Inverse Gamma, Weibull, and Log-Normal distributions. Each of these models is parameterized by a shape parameter, $φ$, and a scale parameter, $θ$, which are detrended from their daily average behavior. The time series of the detrended parameters is analyzed using adaptive binning and regression-based extraction of the Kramers-Moyal (KM) coefficients, up to their sixth order, enabling to classification of its intrinsic dynamics. We show that (i) $φ$ is well described as a pure diffusion with a linear mean regression for the Gamma, Inverse Gamma, and Weibull models, while $θ$ shows dominant jump-diffusion dynamics, with an elevated fourth- and sixth-order moment contributions; (ii) the log-normal model shows however the opposite: $θ$ is predominantly diffusive, with $φ$ showing weak jump signatures; (iii) global moment inversion yields jump rates and amplitudes that account for a large share of total variance for $θ$, confirming that rare discontinuities dominate volatility.

Motivation: To better understand the internal dynamics of reservoir computing networks and the minimal computational components necessary for different tasks.

Method: Analyzed how factors like neuron count, nonlinearity, activation functions, connectivity, and input matrix design affect reservoir computer performance, focusing on simplifying tasks.

Result: Discovered that the readout layer can sometimes handle most computation, with the reservoir offering nonlinearity and memory, and that overlooked factors like input matrix structure can impact system performance.

Conclusion: Reservoir computing tasks can often be simplified, with minimal but crucial design parameters having significant influence over system capabilities.

Abstract: Reservoir computers, based on large recurrent neural networks with fixed random connections, are known to perform a wide range of information processing tasks. However, the nature of data transformations within the reservoir, the interplay of input matrix, reservoir, and readout layer, as well as the effect of varying design parameters remain poorly understood. In this study, we shift the focus from performance maximization to systematic simplification, aiming to identify the minimal computational ingredients required for different model tasks. We examine how many neurons, how much nonlinearity, and which connective structure is necessary and sufficient to perform certain tasks, considering also neurons with non-sigmoidal activation functions and networks with non-random connectivity. Surprisingly, we find non-trivial cases where the readout layer performs the bulk of the computation, with the reservoir merely providing weak nonlinearity and memory. Furthermore, design aspects often considered secondary, such as the structure of the input matrix, the steepness of activation functions, or the precise input/output timing, emerge as critical determinants of system performance in certain tasks.

Method: The researchers used empirical analysis with SmartWatts and Running Average Power Limit (RAPL) to study bundler workload and energy consumption correlations.

Result: They determined the active power consumption overhead added by the bundler to Ethereum access services.

Conclusion: The findings provide insights into the power consumption efficiency and operational overhead of Ethereum's bundler services.

Abstract: Ethereum is currently the main blockchain ecosystem providing decentralised trust guarantees for applications ranging from finance to e-government. A common criticism of blockchain networks has been their energy consumption and operational costs. The switch from Proof-of-Work (PoW) protocol to Proof-of-Stake (PoS) protocol has significantly reduced this issue, though concerns remain, especially with network expansions via additional layers. The ERC-4337 standard is a recent proposal that facilitates end-user access to Ethereum-backed applications. It introduces a middleware called a bundler, operated as a third-party service, where part of its operational cost is represented by its power consumption. While bundlers have served over 500 million requests in the past two years, fewer than 15 official bundler providers exist, compared to over 100 regular Ethereum access providers. In this paper, we provide a first look at the active power consumption overhead that a bundler would add to an Ethereum access service. Using SmartWatts, a monitoring system leveraging Running Average Power Limit (RAPL) hardware interfaces, we empirically determine correlations between the bundler workload and its active power consumption.

*Disha Kamale,Xi Yu,Cristian-Ioan Vasile*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper addresses task planning with temporal logic in large robot environments by introducing a preference-aware A*-based framework with an efficient heuristic for scalability and near-optimal solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to solve the challenge of planning temporal logic tasks in large-scale robot environments, specifically when full task compliance is not possible, using user preferences to guide task relaxation.

Method: The method employs an automata-based representation for temporal logic goals and user preferences, integrated into an A*-based planning framework with a novel, efficient heuristic to improve scalability and performance.

Result: The approach demonstrates scalability, faster runtime, and memory efficiency compared to uninformed search algorithms, with empirical evidence showing near-optimal task satisfaction and suboptimality bounds.

Conclusion: The framework provides a practical solution for planning complex tasks in large robotic environments, balancing computational efficiency with task compliance and user preferences.

Abstract: In this work, we consider the problem of planning for temporal logic tasks in large robot environments. When full task compliance is unattainable, we aim to achieve the best possible task satisfaction by integrating user preferences for relaxation into the planning process. Utilizing the automata-based representations for temporal logic goals and user preferences, we propose an A*-based planning framework. This approach effectively tackles large-scale problems while generating near-optimal high-level trajectories. To facilitate this, we propose a simple, efficient heuristic that allows for planning over large robot environments in a fraction of time and search memory as compared to uninformed search algorithms. We present extensive case studies to demonstrate the scalability, runtime analysis as well as empirical bounds on the suboptimality of the proposed heuristic.

### [241] [Single-Pixel Tactile Skin via Compressive Sampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16898)
*Ariel Slepyan,Laura Xing,Rudy Zhang,Nitish Thakor*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper presents a new tactile sensing skin design (Single-Pixel Tactile Skin) that simplifies wiring and enhances data efficiency using hardware-level compressive sampling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the challenges in developing large-area and high-speed electronic skins, mainly due to wiring complexity and data bottlenecks in robotics and human-machine interfaces.

Method: The authors propose a tactile sensing system where each sensor dynamically contributes weighted analog signals to a global output, performing distributed compressed sensing and drastically reducing wiring and measurement requirements.

Result: The system achieved high-speed object classification at 3500 FPS and was able to resolve fast phenomena like an 8 ms projectile impact into 23 frames, showcasing high performance.

Conclusion: This method provides a scalable and effective pathway for integrating tactile intelligence into robotics, with features like adaptive reconstruction that enhance responsiveness and data efficiency.

Abstract: Development of large-area, high-speed electronic skins is a grand challenge for robotics, prosthetics, and human-machine interfaces, but is fundamentally limited by wiring complexity and data bottlenecks. Here, we introduce Single-Pixel Tactile Skin (SPTS), a paradigm that uses compressive sampling to reconstruct rich tactile information from an entire sensor array via a single output channel. This is achieved through a direct circuit-level implementation where each sensing element, equipped with a miniature microcontroller, contributes a dynamically weighted analog signal to a global sum, performing distributed compressed sensing in hardware. Our flexible, daisy-chainable design simplifies wiring to a few input lines and one output, and significantly reduces measurement requirements compared to raster scanning methods. We demonstrate the system's performance by achieving object classification at an effective 3500 FPS and by capturing transient dynamics, resolving an 8 ms projectile impact into 23 frames. A key feature is the support for adaptive reconstruction, where sensing fidelity scales with measurement time. This allows for rapid contact localization using as little as 7% of total data, followed by progressive refinement to a high-fidelity image - a capability critical for responsive robotic systems. This work offers an efficient pathway towards large-scale tactile intelligence for robotics and human-machine interfaces.

*Yendo Hu,Yiliang Wu,Weican Chen*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel hybrid algorithm to improve UAV obstacle avoidance by combining enhanced APF and MRF IAPF methods to optimize path planning and reduce collision risks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional APF methods lead to inefficient flight paths, abrupt heading changes, and high risks of collisions in multi-UAV scenarios during obstacle avoidance.

Method: The study introduces a hybrid algorithm combining MRF IAPF forces (obstacle repulsion, inter-UAV interaction, and target attraction) with improved single UAV path optimization mechanisms (collision risk assessments and auxiliary sub-goal strategies).

Result: Simulation results show that the new algorithm optimizes path length, stabilizes UAV heading, avoids obstacles effectively, and restores formation in static environments with unknown obstacles.

Conclusion: The proposed algorithm significantly enhances UAV path planning and obstacle avoidance, proving its effectiveness for multi-UAV operations in static environments.

Abstract: In multi UAV scenarios,the traditional Artificial Potential Field (APF) method often leads to redundant flight paths and frequent abrupt heading changes due to unreasonable obstacle avoidance path planning,and is highly prone to inter UAV collisions during the obstacle avoidance process.To address these issues,this study proposes a novel hybrid algorithm that combines the improved Multi-Robot Formation Obstacle Avoidance (MRF IAPF) algorithm with an enhanced APF optimized for single UAV path planning.Its core ideas are as follows:first,integrating three types of interaction forces from MRF IAPF obstacle repulsion force,inter UAV interaction force,and target attraction force;second,incorporating a refined single UAV path optimization mechanism,including collision risk assessment and an auxiliary sub goal strategy.When a UAV faces a high collision threat,temporary waypoints are generated to guide obstacle avoidance,ensuring eventual precise arrival at the actual target.Simulation results demonstrate that compared with traditional APF based formation algorithms,the proposed algorithm achieves significant improvements in path length optimization and heading stability,can effectively avoid obstacles and quickly restore the formation configuration,thus verifying its applicability and effectiveness in static environments with unknown obstacles.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces MobileOcc, a dataset for semantic occupancy perception tailored for mobile robots in crowded environments, with annotation methods and benchmark tasks for evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of research focused on dense semantic occupancy perception for mobile robots in pedestrian-rich environments compared to autonomous driving.

Method: A novel annotation pipeline combining static object occupancy annotations and a mesh optimization framework utilizing both 2D images and LiDAR data to model human occupancy.

Result: MobileOcc benchmarks two tasks: occupancy and pedestrian velocity prediction, and evaluates its performance across datasets, showing robust and reproducible results.

Conclusion: MobileOcc sets a foundation for advancing dense semantic occupancy for mobile robots by providing reliable benchmarks and a novel annotation framework.

Abstract: Dense 3D semantic occupancy perception is critical for mobile robots operating in pedestrian-rich environments, yet it remains underexplored compared to its application in autonomous driving. To address this gap, we present MobileOcc, a semantic occupancy dataset for mobile robots operating in crowded human environments. Our dataset is built using an annotation pipeline that incorporates static object occupancy annotations and a novel mesh optimization framework explicitly designed for human occupancy modeling. It reconstructs deformable human geometry from 2D images and subsequently refines and optimizes it using associated LiDAR point data. Using MobileOcc, we establish benchmarks for two tasks, i) Occupancy prediction and ii) Pedestrian velocity prediction, using different methods including monocular, stereo, and panoptic occupancy, with metrics and baseline implementations for reproducible comparison. Beyond occupancy prediction, we further assess our annotation method on 3D human pose estimation datasets. Results demonstrate that our method exhibits robust performance across different datasets.

*Sicheng Xie,Lingchen Meng,Zhiying Du,Shuyuan Tu,Haidong Cao,Jiaqi Leng,Zuxuan Wu,Yu-Gang Jiang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper proposes a method, CalibAll, for accurate, training-free camera extrinsic estimation using a single mark on the robot, which is robust and effective across diverse setups.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Camera extrinsics enhance imitation learning in robotics, but they are often unavailable or hard to estimate due to challenges like local minima and poor generalization.

Method: CalibAll uses a single mark on the robot's end-effector and employs vision foundation models for mark localization. It further refines coarse camera extrinsic estimation using point tracking, 3D trajectories, and a rendering-based optimization process.

Result: Experimental results showed CalibAll surpasses state-of-the-art methods in robustness and accuracy, while producing additional useful annotations such as depth maps and masks.

Conclusion: CalibAll provides an effective, stable, and simple solution for camera extrinsic estimation, making it valuable for diverse robotic platforms and supporting downstream tasks.

Abstract: Imitation learning has achieved remarkable success in a variety of robotic tasks by learning a mapping function from camera-space observations to robot-space actions. Recent work indicates that the use of robot-to-camera transformation information ({\ie}, camera extrinsics) benefits the learning process and produces better results. However, camera extrinsics are oftentimes unavailable and estimation methods usually suffer from local minima and poor generalizations. In this paper, we present CalibAll, a simple yet effective method that \textbf{requires only a single mark} and performs training-free, stable, and accurate camera extrinsic estimation across diverse robots and datasets through a coarse-to-fine calibration pipeline. In particular, we annotate a single mark on an end-effector (EEF), and leverage the correspondence ability emerged from vision foundation models (VFM) to automatically localize the corresponding mark across robots in diverse datasets. Using this mark, together with point tracking and the 3D EEF trajectory, we obtain a coarse camera extrinsic via temporal Perspective-n-Point (PnP). This estimate is further refined through a rendering-based optimization that aligns rendered and ground-true masks, yielding accurate and stable camera extrinsic. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, showing strong robustness and general effectiveness across three robot platforms. It also produces useful auxiliary annotations such as depth maps, link-wise masks, and end-effector 2D trajectories, which can further support downstream tasks.

*Yiwen Ying,Hanjing Ye,Senzi Luo,Luyao Liu,Yu Zhan,Li He,Hong Zhang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper presents a novel method for obstacle avoidance in dynamic environments using multi-frame predictions for proactive robot navigation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of static assumptions in model-based methods and single-frame adaptability in learning-based methods for real-time navigation in dynamic environments.

Method: The paper introduces a framework that integrates multi-frame constraints and a future prediction module to enable proactive navigation by predicting the paths of moving obstacles.

Result: The proposed method improves navigation robustness and efficiency, as demonstrated in both simulations and real-world experiments.

Conclusion: Incorporating multi-frame observations and predictive planning enhances robot navigation in unknown, highly dynamic scenarios.

Abstract: Obstacle avoidance in complex and dynamic environments is a critical challenge for real-time robot navigation. Model-based and learning-based methods often fail in highly dynamic scenarios because traditional methods assume a static environment and cannot adapt to real-time changes, while learning-based methods rely on single-frame observations for motion constraint estimation, limiting their adaptability. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes a novel framework that leverages multi-frame point constraints, including current and future frames predicted by a dedicated module, to enable proactive end-to-end navigation. By incorporating a prediction module that forecasts the future path of moving obstacles based on multi-frame observations, our method allows the robot to proactively anticipate and avoid potential dangers. This proactive planning capability significantly enhances navigation robustness and efficiency in unknown dynamic environments. Simulations and real-world experiments validate the effectiveness of our approach.

### [246] [H-GAR: A Hierarchical Interaction Framework via Goal-Driven Observation-Action Refinement for Robotic Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17079)
*Yijie Zhu,Rui Shao,Ziyang Liu,Jie He,Jizhihui Liu,Jiuru Wang,Zitong Yu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces H-GAR, a hierarchical framework that integrates goal-driven observation and action refinement for robotic manipulation, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing goal-agnostic and monolithic approaches in robotic manipulation that result in semantically misaligned predictions and incoherent behaviors.

Method: H-GAR employs a hierarchical framework consisting of a Goal-Conditioned Observation Synthesizer (GOS) to synthesize intermediate observations and an Interaction-Aware Action Refiner (IAAR) to refine actions. These modules leverage goal observations and a Historical Action Memory Bank for better decision-making.

Result: H-GAR improves manipulation accuracy and demonstrates superior performance in both simulation and real-world robotic tasks compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: H-GAR's goal-grounded and interaction-based design advances robotic manipulation, enabling coherent and effective decision-making through explicit observation-action interaction.

Abstract: Unified video and action prediction models hold great potential for robotic manipulation, as future observations offer contextual cues for planning, while actions reveal how interactions shape the environment. However, most existing approaches treat observation and action generation in a monolithic and goal-agnostic manner, often leading to semantically misaligned predictions and incoherent behaviors. To this end, we propose H-GAR, a Hierarchical interaction framework via Goal-driven observation-Action Refinement.To anchor prediction to the task objective, H-GAR first produces a goal observation and a coarse action sketch that outline a high-level route toward the goal. To enable explicit interaction between observation and action under the guidance of the goal observation for more coherent decision-making, we devise two synergistic modules. (1) Goal-Conditioned Observation Synthesizer (GOS) synthesizes intermediate observations based on the coarse-grained actions and the predicted goal observation. (2) Interaction-Aware Action Refiner (IAAR) refines coarse actions into fine-grained, goal-consistent actions by leveraging feedback from the intermediate observations and a Historical Action Memory Bank that encodes prior actions to ensure temporal consistency. By integrating goal grounding with explicit action-observation interaction in a coarse-to-fine manner, H-GAR enables more accurate manipulation. Extensive experiments on both simulation and real-world robotic manipulation tasks demonstrate that H-GAR achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Progress-Think enables agents to navigate more accurately by predicting progress via visual observations, utilizing a novel three-stage training framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the long-horizon coherence of Vision-Language Navigation systems, addressing limitations in action prediction and numeric progress methods.

Method: Introduced a three-stage framework involving Self-Aligned Progress Pretraining, Progress-Guided Policy Pretraining, and Progress-Policy Co-Finetuning to inject progress prediction into navigation policies.

Result: State-of-the-art success and efficiency in Vision-Language Navigation tasks, validated on R2R-CE and RxR-CE benchmarks.

Conclusion: Semantic progress reasoning enhances navigation consistency and performance, marking a step forward in Vision-Language Navigation systems.

Abstract: Vision-Language Navigation requires agents to act coherently over long horizons by understanding not only local visual context but also how far they have advanced within a multi-step instruction. However, recent Vision-Language-Action models focus on direct action prediction and earlier progress methods predict numeric achievements; both overlook the monotonic co-progression property of the observation and instruction sequences. Building on this insight, Progress-Think introduces semantic progress reasoning, predicting instruction-style progress from visual observations to enable more accurate navigation. To achieve this without expensive annotations, we propose a three-stage framework. In the initial stage, Self-Aligned Progress Pretraining bootstraps a reasoning module via a novel differentiable alignment between visual history and instruction prefixes. Then, Progress-Guided Policy Pretraining injects learned progress states into the navigation context, guiding the policy toward consistent actions. Finally, Progress-Policy Co-Finetuning jointly optimizes both modules with tailored progress-aware reinforcement objectives. Experiments on R2R-CE and RxR-CE show state-of-the-art success and efficiency, demonstrating that semantic progress yields a more consistent representation of navigation advancement.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Currently, reflections of active markers in the environment are seen as a challenge in localization. This research aims to exploit these reflections to achieve precise localization for heterogeneous micro-aerial or marine robotic swarms, especially in unknown or challenging environments.

Method: The proposed system inherently uses reflections for robot localization without relying on prior knowledge of robot dimensions, specific marker setups, or surface characteristics, ensuring adaptability under uncertain dynamic conditions such as water surfaces.

Result: Experiments validated the system’s effectiveness, surpassing state-of-the-art techniques in accuracy and achieving operational ranges beyond 30 meters in both indoor and outdoor environments.

Conclusion: The reflection-based localization approach proved feasible and effective, offering enhanced adaptability and accuracy for cooperative robotic operations under diverse environmental conditions.

Abstract: Reflections of active markers in the environment are a common source of ambiguity in onboard visual relative localization. This work presents a novel approach for onboard relative localization in multi-robot teams that exploits these typically unwanted reflections of active markers in the environment. It operates without prior knowledge of robot size or predefined marker configurations and remains independent of surface properties, an essential feature for heterogeneous micro-aerial swarms cooperating in unknown environments. It explicitly accounts for uncertainties caused by non-flat surfaces, with a particular focus on dynamic water surfaces, which are especially relevant for marine deployments. We validated the approach in both indoor and outdoor experiments, demonstrating that the proposed reflection-based localization system operates reliably without prior knowledge of team member size and achieves greater effective range (above 30 m) and accuracy than state-of-the-art methods. The video and source code of this work will be made publicly available after publication.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Black-box optimization is widely used for complex robot design problems but suffers from low sampling efficiency. This paper aims to address this inefficiency.

Method: The authors propose a hybrid approach, combining LLMs with black-box optimization. LLMs perform parallel sampling, informed by problem settings and feedback, alongside black-box methods.

Result: The proposed method enhances the efficiency of design solution exploration. The authors provide a demonstration and analysis of its characteristics and limitations.

Conclusion: Using LLMs in conjunction with black-box optimization improves efficiency in robot design, though considerations of its strengths and gaps are discussed.

Abstract: Various methods for robot design optimization have been developed so far. These methods are diverse, ranging from numerical optimization to black-box optimization. While numerical optimization is fast, it is not suitable for cases involving complex structures or discrete values, leading to frequent use of black-box optimization instead. However, black-box optimization suffers from low sampling efficiency and takes considerable sampling iterations to obtain good solutions. In this study, we propose a method to enhance the efficiency of robot body design based on black-box optimization by utilizing large language models (LLMs). In parallel with the sampling process based on black-box optimization, sampling is performed using LLMs, which are provided with problem settings and extensive feedback. We demonstrate that this method enables more efficient exploration of design solutions and discuss its characteristics and limitations.

Conclusion: The proposed TP-MDDN framework and AWMSystem improve the handling of long-horizon, multi-need navigation tasks, showcasing better adaptability and performance compared to state-of-the-art models.

Abstract: In daily life, people often move through spaces to find objects that meet their needs, posing a key challenge in embodied AI. Traditional Demand-Driven Navigation (DDN) handles one need at a time but does not reflect the complexity of real-world tasks involving multiple needs and personal choices. To bridge this gap, we introduce Task-Preferenced Multi-Demand-Driven Navigation (TP-MDDN), a new benchmark for long-horizon navigation involving multiple sub-demands with explicit task preferences. To solve TP-MDDN, we propose AWMSystem, an autonomous decision-making system composed of three key modules: BreakLLM (instruction decomposition), LocateLLM (goal selection), and StatusMLLM (task monitoring). For spatial memory, we design MASMap, which combines 3D point cloud accumulation with 2D semantic mapping for accurate and efficient environmental understanding. Our Dual-Tempo action generation framework integrates zero-shot planning with policy-based fine control, and is further supported by an Adaptive Error Corrector that handles failure cases in real time. Experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both perception accuracy and navigation robustness.

TL;DR: The paper presents a simulator for designing and controlling soft robotic nets for capturing space debris, emphasizing a compliant net design and effective control strategy for high-performance results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of autonomously removing space debris, by introducing improved mechanical modeling and control strategies for soft robotic nets.

Method: The authors developed a simulator using MuJoCo physics engine to model net dynamics, self-contact, debris interaction, orbital mechanics, and a controller for satellite thrusters, testing different compliance levels and control approaches.

Result: The study reveals that more compliant nets, combined with a sliding mode controller, achieve 100% successful debris captures, higher contact efficiency, and an enhanced effective area.

Conclusion: Soft, compliant nets with advanced control strategies are effective for autonomous space debris capture, demonstrating significant potential for real-world applications.

Abstract: In this work, we propose a simulator, based on the open-source physics engine MuJoCo, for the design and control of soft robotic nets for the autonomous removal of space debris. The proposed simulator includes net dynamics, contact between the net and the debris, self-contact of the net, orbital mechanics, and a controller that can actuate thrusters on the four satellites at the corners of the net. It showcases the case of capturing Envisat, a large ESA satellite that remains in orbit as space debris following the end of its mission. This work investigates different mechanical models, which can be used to simulate the net dynamics, simulating various degrees of compliance, and different control strategies to achieve the capture of the debris, depending on the relative position of the net and the target. Unlike previous works on this topic, we do not assume that the net has been previously ballistically thrown toward the target, and we start from a relatively static configuration. The results show that a more compliant net achieves higher performance when attempting the capture of Envisat. Moreover, when paired with a sliding mode controller, soft nets are able to achieve successful capture in 100% of the tested cases, whilst also showcasing a higher effective area at contact and a higher number of contact points between net and Envisat.

*Julien Merand,Boris Meden,Mathieu Grossard*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces a machine learning-based method using a Conditional Variational Auto-Encoder (CVAE) to efficiently estimate joint configurations of a multifingered gripper from point cloud data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing inverse kinematics (IK) techniques have limitations in handling certain challenges such as decision-making for intermediate joint positions or solving complex kinematical scenarios, making grasp planning less effective.

Method: The authors employ a Conditional Variational Auto-Encoder (CVAE) which processes point cloud data to reconstruct joint configurations of the gripper, bypassing traditional IK limitations.

Result: The proposed approach is validated on the MultiDex grasping dataset with the Allegro Hand, operating efficiently within 0.05 milliseconds and matching state-of-the-art accuracy.

Conclusion: The method demonstrates a successful application of machine learning for accurate and fast joint configuration estimation, contributing to advancements in AI-driven grasp planning techniques.

Abstract: This paper presents an efficient approach for determining the joint configuration of a multifingered gripper solely from the point cloud data of its poly-articulated chain, as generated by visual sensors, simulations or even generative neural networks. Well-known inverse kinematics (IK) techniques can provide mathematically exact solutions (when they exist) for joint configuration determination based solely on the fingertip pose, but often require post-hoc decision-making by considering the positions of all intermediate phalanges in the gripper's fingers, or rely on algorithms to numerically approximate solutions for more complex kinematics. In contrast, our method leverages machine learning to implicitly overcome these challenges. This is achieved through a Conditional Variational Auto-Encoder (CVAE), which takes point cloud data of key structural elements as input and reconstructs the corresponding joint configurations. We validate our approach on the MultiDex grasping dataset using the Allegro Hand, operating within 0.05 milliseconds and achieving accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art methods. This highlights the effectiveness of our pipeline for joint configuration estimation within the broader context of AI-driven techniques for grasp planning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enable autonomous robots with a single monocular camera to effectively explore unknown environments without relying on dense range sensors—a task largely unsolved in mobile robotics.

Method: The method involves improving mapping by handling sparse depth, free-space gaps, and uncertainty using oversampling and tracking obstacles, and enhanced planning through rapid replanning and perception-aware controls.

Result: The proposed method successfully achieves 3D exploration in real-world indoor and outdoor environments, including unstructured outdoor settings, using sparse monocular SLAM data.

Conclusion: This work demonstrates that frontier-based exploration with sparse monocular depth data is viable and effective, marking a first in achieving real-world 3D monocular exploration in unstructured environments.

Abstract: Autonomous exploration of unknown environments is a key capability for mobile robots, but it is largely unsolved for robots equipped with only a single monocular camera and no dense range sensors. In this paper, we present a novel approach to monocular vision-based exploration that can safely cover large-scale unstructured indoor and outdoor 3D environments by explicitly accounting for the properties of a sparse monocular SLAM frontend in both mapping and planning. The mapping module solves the problems of sparse depth data, free-space gaps, and large depth uncertainty by oversampling free space in texture-sparse areas and keeping track of obstacle position uncertainty. The planning module handles the added free-space uncertainty through rapid replanning and perception-aware heading control. We further show that frontier-based exploration is possible with sparse monocular depth data when parallax requirements and the possibility of textureless surfaces are taken into account. We evaluate our approach extensively in diverse real-world and simulated environments, including ablation studies. To the best of the authors' knowledge, the proposed method is the first to achieve 3D monocular exploration in real-world unstructured outdoor environments. We open-source our implementation to support future research.

Abstract: We present FORWARD, a high-resolution multimodal dataset of a cut-to-length forwarder operating in rough terrain on two harvest sites in the middle part of Sweden. The forwarder is a large Komatsu model equipped with a variety of sensors, including RTK-GNSS, 360-camera, operator vibration sensors, internal CAN-bus signal recording, and multiple IMUs. The data includes event time logs recorded in 5 Hz with e.g., driving speed, fuel consumption, vehicle position with centimeter accuracy, and crane use while the vehicle operates in forest areas laser-scanned with very high-resolution, $\sim$1500 points per square meter. Production log files (StanForD standard) with time-stamped machine events, extensive video material, and terrain data in various formats are included as well. About 18 hours of regular wood extraction work during three days is annotated from 360-video material into individual work elements and included in the dataset. We also include scenario specifications of conducted experiments on forest roads and in terrain. Scenarios include repeatedly driving the same routes with and without steel tracks, different load weight, and different target driving speeds. The dataset is intended for developing models and algorithms for trafficability, perception, and autonomous control of forest machines using artificial intelligence, simulation, and experiments on physical testbeds. In part, we focus on forwarders traversing terrain, avoiding obstacles, and loading or unloading logs, with consideration for efficiency, fuel consumption, safety, and environmental impact. Other benefits of the open dataset include the ability to explore auto-generation and calibration of forestry machine simulators and automation scenario descriptions using the data recorded in the field.

*Chiori Hori,Yoshiki Masuyama,Siddarth Jain,Radu Corcodel,Devesh Jha,Diego Romeres,Jonathan Le Roux*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces a long-context Q-former and text-conditioning approach for enhancing human-robot dialogue in collaborative tasks with improved video-based action planning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve human-robot collaboration by enhancing robots' ability to understand human actions and interactions in long-horizon tasks.

Method: The paper proposes a long-context Q-former for processing entire videos and a text-conditioning approach to refine the generation of instructions via LLM integration.

Result: Experiments using the YouCook2 dataset show improved accuracy in confirmation generation and action planning with the proposed approaches.

Conclusion: Incorporating long-context dependencies and text-conditioning improves robot action planning and confirmation generation in collaborative tasks involving multimodal scene understanding.

Abstract: Human-robot collaboration towards a shared goal requires robots to understand human action and interaction with the surrounding environment. This paper focuses on human-robot interaction (HRI) based on human-robot dialogue that relies on the robot action confirmation and action step generation using multimodal scene understanding. The state-of-the-art approach uses multimodal transformers to generate robot action steps aligned with robot action confirmation from a single clip showing a task composed of multiple micro steps. Although actions towards a long-horizon task depend on each other throughout an entire video, the current approaches mainly focus on clip-level processing and do not leverage long-context information. This paper proposes a long-context Q-former incorporating left and right context dependency in full videos. Furthermore, this paper proposes a text-conditioning approach to feed text embeddings directly into the LLM decoder to mitigate the high abstraction of the information in text by Q-former. Experiments with the YouCook2 corpus show that the accuracy of confirmation generation is a major factor in the performance of action planning. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the long-context Q-former improves the confirmation and action planning by integrating VideoLLaMA3.

TL;DR: The paper introduces METIS, a vision-language-action model for dexterous robot manipulation that uses large-scale human and robotic data to improve task success rates and adaptability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current limitations in building generalist robots for dexterous manipulation stem from the scarcity of large-scale, action-annotated data and the challenges in bridging the gap between human and robot capabilities.

Method: The proposed method, METIS, uses the newly constructed EgoAtlas – a large, unified dataset of human and robot data – with a motion-aware dynamic representation to pretrain a vision-language-action model for reasoning and action in manipulation tasks.

Result: METIS achieves the highest average success rate across six real-world dexterous manipulation tasks while demonstrating strong generalization and robustness to unfamiliar scenarios.

Conclusion: METIS signifies a promising advancement toward generalist robotic systems capable of versatile and dexterous manipulation by leveraging humanlike datasets and integrated model design.

Abstract: Building a generalist robot that can perceive, reason, and act across diverse tasks remains an open challenge, especially for dexterous manipulation. A major bottleneck lies in the scarcity of large-scale, action-annotated data for dexterous skills, as teleoperation is difficult and costly. Human data, with its vast scale and diverse manipulation behaviors, provides rich priors for learning robotic actions. While prior works have explored leveraging human demonstrations, they are often constrained by limited scenarios and a large visual gap between human and robots. To eliminate these limitations, we propose METIS, a vision-language-action (VLA) model for dexterous manipulation pretrained on multi-source egocentric datasets. We first construct EgoAtlas, which integrates large-scale human and robotic data from multiple sources, all unified under a consistent action space. We further extract motion-aware dynamics, a compact and discretized motion representation, which provides efficient and expressive supervision for VLA training. Built upon them, METIS integrates reasoning and acting into a unified framework, enabling effective deployment to downstream dexterous manipulation tasks. Our method demonstrates exceptional dexterous manipulation capabilities, achieving highest average success rate in six real-world tasks. Experimental results also highlight the superior generalization and robustness to out-of-distribution scenarios. These findings emphasize METIS as a promising step toward a generalist model for dexterous manipulation.

TL;DR: The paper introduces AMS, a unified framework for humanoid robots capable of both agile motion and extreme balance in a single policy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between agile dynamic skills and stability-critical behaviors in humanoid robots for human-centered tasks.

Method: The method involves leveraging human motion capture data for agility and synthetic balance motions for stability, combining them with hybrid reward schemes and adaptive learning strategies.

Result: AMS demonstrates a single policy executing both dynamic motions like dancing/running and extreme balance motions in simulations and on a Unitree G1 humanoid.

Conclusion: AMS showcases a versatile robotic control approach that successfully integrates agility and stability for advanced humanoid applications.

Abstract: Humanoid robots are envisioned to perform a wide range of tasks in human-centered environments, requiring controllers that combine agility with robust balance. Recent advances in locomotion and whole-body tracking have enabled impressive progress in either agile dynamic skills or stability-critical behaviors, but existing methods remain specialized, focusing on one capability while compromising the other. In this work, we introduce AMS (Agility Meets Stability), the first framework that unifies both dynamic motion tracking and extreme balance maintenance in a single policy. Our key insight is to leverage heterogeneous data sources: human motion capture datasets that provide rich, agile behaviors, and physically constrained synthetic balance motions that capture stability configurations. To reconcile the divergent optimization goals of agility and stability, we design a hybrid reward scheme that applies general tracking objectives across all data while injecting balance-specific priors only into synthetic motions. Further, an adaptive learning strategy with performance-driven sampling and motion-specific reward shaping enables efficient training across diverse motion distributions. We validate AMS extensively in simulation and on a real Unitree G1 humanoid. Experiments demonstrate that a single policy can execute agile skills such as dancing and running, while also performing zero-shot extreme balance motions like Ip Man's Squat, highlighting AMS as a versatile control paradigm for future humanoid applications.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve multi-objective robotic decision-making that avoids worst-case scenarios and enhances performance in high-dimensional environments.

Method: A novel simulation pipeline was developed integrating vector cost bimatrix games, XAI for decision-making data analysis, and SEMBAS for parameter sensitivity exploration.

Result: The vector cost approach outperforms scalarization methods, showcasing its utility in competitive motion planning.

Conclusion: The proposed framework provides an interpretable, generalizable advantage for robotic behavioral planning with improved multi-objective decision-making.

Abstract: The vector cost bimatrix game is a method for multi-objective decision making that enables autonomous robotic systems to optimize for multiple goals at once while avoiding worst-case scenarios in neglected objectives. We expand this approach to arbitrary numbers of objectives and compare its performance to scalar weighted sum methods during competitive motion planning. Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) software is used to aid in the analysis of high dimensional decision-making data. State-space Exploration of Multidimensional Boundaries using Adherence Strategies (SEMBAS) is applied to explore performance modes in the parameter space as a sensitivity study for the baseline and proposed frameworks. While some works have explored aspects of game theoretic planning and intelligent systems validation separately, we combine each of these into a novel and comprehensive simulation pipeline. This integration demonstrates a dramatic improvement of the vector cost method over scalarization and offers an interpretable and generalizable framework for robotic behavioral planning.

TL;DR: The paper introduces IndustryNav, a benchmark for assessing spatial reasoning in dynamic, industrial environments with VLLMs, addressing limitations in existing benchmarks that focus on static, household settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of dynamic, real-world evaluation settings for Visual Large Language Models in spatial reasoning and navigation.

Method: IndustryNav uses 12 Unity-created warehouse scenarios with dynamic elements, employing PointGoal navigation and introducing novel safety metrics (collision rate, warning rate).

Result: Results reveal consistent advantages for closed-source models, but all evaluated Visual Large Language Models struggle with robust planning, collision avoidance, and exploration.

Conclusion: Future research should shift focus towards tasks requiring dynamic and safe navigation in complex, real-world environments.

Abstract: While Visual Large Language Models (VLLMs) show great promise as embodied agents, they continue to face substantial challenges in spatial reasoning. Existing embodied benchmarks largely focus on passive, static household environments and evaluate only isolated capabilities, failing to capture holistic performance in dynamic, real-world complexity. To fill this gap, we present IndustryNav, the first dynamic industrial navigation benchmark for active spatial reasoning. IndustryNav leverages 12 manually created, high-fidelity Unity warehouse scenarios featuring dynamic objects and human movement. Our evaluation employs a PointGoal navigation pipeline that effectively combines egocentric vision with global odometry to assess holistic local-global planning. Crucially, we introduce the "collision rate" and "warning rate" metrics to measure safety-oriented behaviors and distance estimation. A comprehensive study of nine state-of-the-art VLLMs (including models such as GPT-5-mini, Claude-4.5, and Gemini-2.5) reveals that closed-source models maintain a consistent advantage; however, all agents exhibit notable deficiencies in robust path planning, collision avoidance and active exploration. This highlights a critical need for embodied research to move beyond passive perception and toward tasks that demand stable planning, active exploration, and safe behavior in dynamic, real-world environment.

Motivation: To overcome challenges in learning robust bipedal walking in hybrid dynamics and diverse terrains.

Method: The authors used a gait generator network learned from human motion and paired it with a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) controller for torque control.

Result: Policies trained on flat terrain showed generalizability to steeper slopes and rough surfaces, demonstrating adaptability.

Conclusion: Combining spectral motion priors with Deep Reinforcement Learning is a practical way to achieve natural and robust bipedal locomotion efficiently.

Abstract: Learning human-like, robust bipedal walking remains difficult due to hybrid dynamics and terrain variability. We propose a lightweight framework that combines a gait generator network learned from human motion with Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) controller for torque control. Despite being trained only on flat or mildly sloped ground, the learned policies generalize to steeper ramps and rough surfaces. Results suggest that pairing spectral motion priors with Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) offers a practical path toward natural and robust bipedal locomotion with modest training cost.

TL;DR: This paper presents a continuous pursuit motion control system for brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) using EEG signals, grounded in a brain-inspired Bayesian inference framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for intuitive, real-time motion control in BCIs, which is essential for wheelchair users to navigate complex environments comfortably and interact socially.

Method: Developed a Bayesian inference framework that decodes acceleration-based motor representation dynamics, utilizing Automatic Relevance Determination for feature selection and continual online learning.

Result: Achieved a 72% reduction in normalized mean squared error compared to alternative methods in a transfer learning setting, validating the proposed approach. Empirical support for embodied cognition theory was also demonstrated.

Conclusion: This method advances BCI control by aligning EEG decoding with biological motion principles, offering stable and intuitive control for assistive devices.

Abstract: Non-invasive electroencephalography (EEG)-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) offer an intuitive means for individuals with severe motor impairments to independently operate assistive robotic wheelchairs and navigate built environments. Despite considerable progress in BCI research, most current motion control systems are limited to discrete commands, rather than supporting continuous pursuit, where users can freely adjust speed and direction in real time. Such natural mobility control is, however, essential for wheelchair users to navigate complex public spaces, such as transit stations, airports, hospitals, and indoor corridors, to interact socially with the dynamic populations with agility, and to move flexibly and comfortably as autonomous driving is refined to allow movement at will. In this study, we address the gap of continuous pursuit motion control in BCIs by proposing and validating a brain-inspired Bayesian inference framework, where embodied dynamics in acceleration-based motor representations are decoded. This approach contrasts with conventional kinematics-level decoding and deep learning-based methods. Using a public dataset with sixteen hours of EEG from four subjects performing motor imagery-based target-following, we demonstrate that our method, utilizing Automatic Relevance Determination for feature selection and continual online learning, reduces the normalized mean squared error between predicted and true velocities by 72% compared to autoregressive and EEGNet-based methods in a session-accumulative transfer learning setting. Theoretically, these findings empirically support embodied cognition theory and reveal the brain's intrinsic motor control dynamics in an embodied and predictive nature. Practically, grounding EEG decoding in the same dynamical principles that govern biological motion offers a promising path toward more stable and intuitive BCI control.

TL;DR: The paper introduces SPEAR-1: a robotic foundation model that overcomes the limitations of vision-language models for robotic control by enhancing them with grounded 3D perception and a novel training strategy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robotic foundation models struggle with generalization due to reliance on 2D vision-language models that lack essential 3D spatial reasoning. Acquiring large-scale robotic datasets directly is costly.

Method: The authors enrich non-robotic image datasets with 3D annotations and upgrade pretrained vision-language models to have 3D understanding capabilities. They then train a robotic model, SPEAR-1, on data from 24 Open X-Embodiment datasets.

Result: SPEAR-1 demonstrates advanced performance in embodied control, matches or exceeds state-of-the-art models using significantly fewer robot demonstrations, and showcases enhanced capabilities by leveraging 3D annotations.

Conclusion: Integrating 3D spatial reasoning into robotic foundation models through improved training strategies significantly enhances their reliability and generalization in robotic tasks with fewer resources.

Abstract: Robotic Foundation Models (RFMs) hold great promise as generalist, end-to-end systems for robot control. Yet their ability to generalize across new environments, tasks, and embodiments remains limited. We argue that a major bottleneck lies in their foundations: most RFMs are built by fine-tuning internet-pretrained Vision-Language Models (VLMs). However, these VLMs are trained on 2D image-language tasks and lack the 3D spatial reasoning inherently required for embodied control in the 3D world. Bridging this gap directly with large-scale robotic data is costly and difficult to scale. Instead, we propose to enrich easy-to-collect non-robotic image data with 3D annotations and enhance a pretrained VLM with 3D understanding capabilities. Following this strategy, we train SPEAR-VLM, a 3D-aware VLM that infers object coordinates in 3D space from a single 2D image. Building on SPEAR-VLM, we introduce our main contribution, $~\textbf{SPEAR-1}$: a robotic foundation model that integrates grounded 3D perception with language-instructed embodied control. Trained on $\sim$45M frames from 24 Open X-Embodiment datasets, SPEAR-1 outperforms or matches state-of-the-art models such as $π_0$-FAST and $π_{0.5}$, while it uses 20$\times$ fewer robot demonstrations. This carefully-engineered training strategy unlocks new VLM capabilities and as a consequence boosts the reliability of embodied control beyond what is achievable with only robotic data. We make our model weights and 3D-annotated datasets publicly available.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new generative framework called MDG for modeling multi-agent behavior in autonomous driving and traffic simulations. MDG improves efficiency and versatility over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for multi-agent behavior modeling face limitations in efficiency, sequential processes, and task-specific constraints. These barriers prevent a unified solution for diverse applications in autonomous driving and traffic simulations.

Method: The proposed method, MDG, uses Masked Denoising Generation to reconstruct multi-agent spatiotemporal behavior by independent noise application and localized denoising. It ensures efficient trajectory generation and unifies open-loop prediction, closed-loop simulation, and motion planning in one model.

Result: MDG demonstrated competitive performance on benchmarks like Waymo Sim Agents and nuPlan Planning when trained on real-world driving datasets. It allows efficient, consistent, and controllable multi-agent trajectory generation.

Conclusion: MDG represents a promising, versatile, and simple framework that generalizes well across multiple contexts of multi-agent behavior modeling, avoiding the iterative and task-specific limitations of previous approaches.

Abstract: Modeling realistic and interactive multi-agent behavior is critical to autonomous driving and traffic simulation. However, existing diffusion and autoregressive approaches are limited by iterative sampling, sequential decoding, or task-specific designs, which hinder efficiency and reuse. We propose Masked Denoising Generation (MDG), a unified generative framework that reformulates multi-agent behavior modeling as the reconstruction of independently noised spatiotemporal tensors. Instead of relying on diffusion time steps or discrete tokenization, MDG applies continuous, per-agent and per-timestep noise masks that enable localized denoising and controllable trajectory generation in a single or few forward passes. This mask-driven formulation generalizes across open-loop prediction, closed-loop simulation, motion planning, and conditional generation within one model. Trained on large-scale real-world driving datasets, MDG achieves competitive closed-loop performance on the Waymo Sim Agents and nuPlan Planning benchmarks, while providing efficient, consistent, and controllable open-loop multi-agent trajectory generation. These results position MDG as a simple yet versatile paradigm for multi-agent behavior modeling.

Conclusion: HALO is effective for autonomous aerial mapping and exploration, completing missions efficiently in large-scale environments, with promising simulation and real-world results for areas up to 78,000 sq. m. and elevations at 40 m.

Abstract: We demonstrate real-time high-altitude aerial metric-semantic mapping and exploration using a monocular camera paired with a global positioning system (GPS) and an inertial measurement unit (IMU). Our system, named HALO, addresses two key challenges: (i) real-time dense 3D reconstruction using vision at large distances, and (ii) mapping and exploration of large-scale outdoor environments with accurate scene geometry and semantics. We demonstrate that HALO can plan informative paths that exploit this information to complete missions with multiple tasks specified in natural language. In simulation-based evaluation across large-scale environments of size up to 78,000 sq. m., HALO consistently completes tasks with less exploration time and achieves up to 68% higher competitive ratio in terms of the distance traveled compared to the state-of-the-art semantic exploration baseline. We use real-world experiments on a custom quadrotor platform to demonstrate that (i) all modules can run onboard the robot, and that (ii) in diverse environments HALO can support effective autonomous execution of missions covering up to 24,600 sq. m. area at an altitude of 40 m.

TL;DR: This study evaluates the adherence to PRISMA 2020 guidelines using a copyright-aware benchmark of systematic reviews and tests ten large language models (LLMs) with structured checklists and manuscript-only inputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the difficulty of evaluating adherence to PRISMA 2020 guidelines in peer-review processes due to the lack of shareable benchmarks.

Method: The study developed a copyright-conscious benchmark of 108 systematic reviews and tested ten LLMs using five different input formats, analyzing their sensitivity and specificity across a development and validation cohort.

Result: Results showed that structured PRISMA 2020 checklists improved accuracy significantly (78.7-79.7%) compared to manuscript-only input (45.21%). Among models, accuracy ranged between 70.6-82.8%. A specific model, Qwen3-Max, achieved high sensitivity (95.1%) but lower specificity (49.3%) in the full dataset evaluation.

Conclusion: Using structured checklists significantly improves LLM-based PRISMA guideline evaluations, but human expert verification is still necessary before applying these results to editorial decisions.

Abstract: Evaluating adherence to PRISMA 2020 guideline remains a burden in the peer review process. To address the lack of shareable benchmarks, we constructed a copyright-aware benchmark of 108 Creative Commons-licensed systematic reviews and evaluated ten large language models (LLMs) across five input formats. In a development cohort, supplying structured PRISMA 2020 checklists (Markdown, JSON, XML, or plain text) yielded 78.7-79.7% accuracy versus 45.21% for manuscript-only input (p less than 0.0001), with no differences between structured formats (p>0.9). Across models, accuracy ranged from 70.6-82.8% with distinct sensitivity-specificity trade-offs, replicated in an independent validation cohort. We then selected Qwen3-Max (a high-sensitivity open-weight model) and extended evaluation to the full dataset (n=120), achieving 95.1% sensitivity and 49.3% specificity. Structured checklist provision substantially improves LLM-based PRISMA assessment, though human expert verification remains essential before editorial decisions.

### [269] [Multi-Agent Code Verification with Compound Vulnerability Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16708)
*Shreshth Rajan*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper presents CodeX-Verify, a multi-agent bug detection system that performs better than single agents and existing tools in finding vulnerabilities, demonstrating faster and accurate detection methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the high prevalence of bugs in code generated by large language models (LLMs) and the inefficiency of existing bug detection tools, which leave vulnerabilities unaddressed or create false positives.

Method: The authors developed CodeX-Verify, a multi-agent system where specialized agents detect different types of bugs, combining their detection patterns mathematically to increase accuracy and efficacy.

Result: CodeX-Verify detected 76.1% of bugs, surpassing current methods while running faster and without test execution. Accuracy improves by 39.7pp when using multi-agent combinations, showing better results with specific configurations.

Conclusion: Using multiple specialized agents to detect software vulnerabilities enhances detection accuracy, making CodeX-Verify an efficient solution for real-time production use and outperforming current tools.

Abstract: LLMs generate buggy code: 29.6% of SWE-bench "solved" patches fail, 62% of BaxBench solutions have vulnerabilities, and existing tools only catch 65% of bugs with 35% false positives. We built CodeX-Verify, a multi-agent system that uses four specialized agents to detect different types of bugs. We prove mathematically that combining agents with different detection patterns finds more bugs than any single agent when the agents look for different problems, confirmed by measuring agent correlation of p = 0.05--0.25. We also show that multiple vulnerabilities in the same code create exponentially more risk than previously thought--SQL injection plus exposed credentials creates 15x more danger (risk 300 vs. 20) than traditional models predict. Testing on 99 code samples with verified labels shows our system catches 76.1% of bugs, matching the best existing method while running faster and without test execution. We tested 15 different agent combinations and found that using multiple agents improves accuracy by 39.7 percentage points (from 32.8% to 72.4%) compared to single agents, with gains of +14.9pp, +13.5pp, and +11.2pp for agents 2, 3, and 4. The best two-agent combination reaches 79.3% accuracy. Testing on 300 real patches from Claude Sonnet 4.5 runs in under 200ms per sample, making this practical for production use.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper examines test overfitting issues in automated program repair, especially under the influence of repository-level SWE-bench tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the extent to which test overfitting remains a critical challenge in modern automated program repair techniques, particularly with large language model advancements.

Method: Experimental analysis of automated program repairs using SWE-bench tasks to evaluate susceptibility to test overfitting.

Result: Test overfitting remains an issue, despite improvements in methodologies within the domain of program repair.

Conclusion: The study highlights a persistent challenge of test overfitting in automated program repair and prompts thorough analysis even with newer technologies like large language models.

Abstract: Automated program repair has been shown to be susceptible to generating repaired code that passes on seen tests but fails on a hold-out set of hidden tests. This problem, dubbed test overfitting, has been identified and studied before the rise of large language models. We experimentally study how much test overfitting is still a problem today, using repository-level SWE-bench tasks.

### [272] [ReVul-CoT: Towards Effective Software Vulnerability Assessment with Retrieval-Augmented Generation and Chain-of-Thought Prompting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17027)
*Zhijie Chen,Xiang Chen,Ziming Li,Jiacheng Xue,Chaoyang Gao*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper introduces ReVul-CoT, a framework enhancing Software Vulnerability Assessment by integrating dynamic retrieval and reasoning methods using Large Language Models. It achieves 16.50%-42.26% performance improvement over baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most Large Language Models used for vulnerability assessment lack domain-specific knowledge and rely on shallow pattern matching, hindering effective evaluation of complex code semantics and security implications.

Method: The proposed framework, ReVul-CoT, combines Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting. It utilizes a local knowledge base from trusted sources for retrieval, paired with step-by-step reasoning for analyzing vulnerability exploitability and impact.

Result: ReVul-CoT outperforms existing SVA baselines significantly, achieving up to 42.26% improvement in MCC and enhancing Accuracy, F1-score, and MCC by 10.43%, 15.86%, and 16.50%, respectively.

Conclusion: Integrating dynamic context retrieval with CoT reasoning substantially improves LLM-based vulnerability assessment, opening avenues for sophisticated SVA strategies in future research.

Abstract: Context: Software Vulnerability Assessment (SVA) plays a vital role in evaluating and ranking vulnerabilities in software systems to ensure their security and reliability. Objective: Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently shown remarkable potential in SVA, they still face two major limitations. First, most LLMs are trained on general-purpose corpora and thus lack domain-specific knowledge essential for effective SVA. Second, they tend to rely on shallow pattern matching instead of deep contextual reasoning, making it challenging to fully comprehend complex code semantics and their security implications. Method: To alleviate these limitations, we propose a novel framework ReVul-CoT that integrates Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with Chain-of-Thought (COT) prompting. In ReVul-CoT, the RAG module dynamically retrieves contextually relevant information from a constructed local knowledge base that consolidates vulnerability data from authoritative sources (such as NVD and CWE), along with corresponding code snippets and descriptive information. Building on DeepSeek-V3.1, CoT prompting guides the LLM to perform step-by-step reasoning over exploitability, impact scope, and related factors Results: We evaluate ReVul-CoT on a dataset of 12,070 vulnerabilities. Experimental results show that ReVul-CoT outperforms state-of-the-art SVA baselines by 16.50%-42.26% in terms of MCC, and outperforms the best baseline by 10.43%, 15.86%, and 16.50% in Accuracy, F1-score, and MCC, respectively. Our ablation studies further validate the contributions of considering dynamic retrieval, knowledge integration, and CoT-based reasoning. Conclusion: Our results demonstrate that combining RAG with CoT prompting significantly enhances LLM-based SVA and points out promising directions for future research.

*Horia Cristescu,Charles Park,Trong Canh Nguyen,Sergiu Talmacel,Alexandru-Gabriel Ilie,Stefan Adam*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces UI-CUBE, a benchmark focusing on evaluating Computer Use Agent (CUA) capabilities in enterprise workflows, highlighting the performance gap between simple and complex tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of benchmarks assessing CUAs' operational reliability and enterprise-readiness instead of just functional correctness.

Method: The authors designed UI-CUBE, a benchmark with 226 tasks categorized as simple UI tasks and complex workflows, employing systematic interface variations, multi-resolution testing, and automated task validation.

Result: Evaluation of five state-of-the-art models revealed significant performance gaps, with CUAs achieving 67-85% on simple tasks but only 9-19% on complex workflows, indicating architectural limitations.

Conclusion: Current CUAs are unable to function reliably in complex workflows, and UI-CUBE serves as a diagnostic tool for addressing these architectural challenges for enterprise deployment readiness.

Abstract: While current Computer Use Agent (CUA) benchmarks measure task completion effectively, they provide limited assessment of enterprise deployment readiness, emphasizing functional correctness over the operational reliability required for production systems. We present UI-CUBE (UiPath Computer Use BEnchmark), a systematic benchmark comprising 226 tasks across two difficulty tiers designed to expose fundamental architectural limitations in current CUAs. Our evaluation covers simple UI interactions (136 tasks) and complex workflows including copy-paste tasks (50 tasks) and enterprise application scenarios (40 tasks), with systematic interface variation coverage, multi-resolution testing and automated validation of task success through the application state. Evaluation of five state-of-the-art models reveals a sharp capability cliff rather than gradual performance degradation. Simple UI interactions achieve 67-85% success rates (compared to 97.9% human performance), but complex workflows drop precipitously to 9-19%. Human evaluators with no prior application experience achieve only 61.2% on complex tasks despite near-perfect performance on simple tasks, establishing realistic performance ceilings. This discontinuous performance pattern -- where agents achieve 68-87% of human performance on simple tasks but only 15-32% on complex workflows -- indicates fundamental architectural limitations in memory management, hierarchical planning, and state coordination rather than incremental capability gaps addressable through better training or prompting. UI-CUBE functions as an enterprise-readiness diagnostic, revealing that while current CUAs can manipulate individual interface elements, they cannot yet function as reliable workflow automation tools. These findings provide architectural insights essential for developing production-ready CUAs capable of managing complex, multi-step enterprise processes.

*Jinfeng Wen,Yuehan Sun*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: SlsReuse, an LLM-powered framework, addresses challenges in serverless computing by facilitating function reuse through semantic-enhanced representations, improving developer experience.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenges faced by developers, especially novices, in creating serverless functions from scratch due to platform-specific complexities, proposing function reuse as a solution.

Method: The study introduces SlsReuse, which constructs a reusable function repository. It uses LLMs like ChatGPT-4 to learn semantic-enhanced representations and combines intent-aware discovery with multi-level pruning for function recommendation.

Result: SlsReuse outperforms existing methods with a Recall@10 of 91.20%, surpassing the baseline by 24.53 percentage points on a curated dataset.

Conclusion: SlsReuse demonstrates the effectiveness of leveraging LLMs for serverless function reuse, paving the way for improved developer productivity in cloud computing.

Abstract: Serverless computing has rapidly emerged as a popular cloud computing paradigm. It enables developers to implement function-level tasks, i.e., serverless functions, without managing infrastructure. While reducing operational overhead, it poses challenges, especially for novice developers. Developing functions from scratch requires adapting to heterogeneous, platform-specific programming styles, making the process time-consuming and error-prone. Function reuse offers a promising solution to address these challenges. However, research on serverless computing lacks a dedicated approach for function recommendation. Existing techniques from traditional contexts remain insufficient due to the semantic gap between task descriptions and heterogeneous function implementations. Advances in large language models (LLMs), pre-trained on large-scale corpora, create opportunities to bridge this gap by aligning developer requirements with function semantics.
  This paper presents SlsReuse, the first LLM-powered framework for serverless function reuse. Specifically, SlsReuse first constructs a reusable function repository serving as a foundational knowledge base. Then, it learns unified semantic-enhanced representations of heterogeneous functions through effective prompt engineering with few-shot prompting, capturing implicit code intent, target platforms, programming languages, and cloud services. Finally, given a natural language task query, SlsReuse performs intent-aware discovery combined with a multi-level pruning strategy and similarity matching. We evaluate SlsReuse on a curated dataset of 110 task queries. Built on ChatGPT-4o, one of the most representative LLMs, SlsReuse achieves Recall@10 of 91.20%, exceeding the state-of-the-art baseline by 24.53 percentage points.

*Sebastian Böhm,Florian Sattler,Norbert Siegmund,Sven Apel*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: ConfFLARE is a tool designed to reduce the cost of performance profiling in configurable software systems by identifying relevant configurations for targeted testing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Performance profiling in software systems is cost-intensive, especially when dealing with multiple configurations. Existing methods like configuration sampling may miss regressions.

Method: ConfFLARE identifies data-flow interactions with performance-relevant code and extracts involved software features to estimate configurations affected by performance changes.

Result: In studies on synthetic and real-world systems, ConfFLARE reduced the number of configurations tested by 79% and 70% respectively, while accurately detecting regressions and identifying features.

Conclusion: ConfFLARE effectively minimizes performance testing overhead without compromising the quality of regression detection, enhancing efficiency in software maintenance.

Abstract: Performance is a volatile property of a software system and frequent performance profiling is required to keep the knowledge about a software system's performance behavior up to date. Repeating all performance measurements after every revision is a cost-intensive task, especially in the presence of configurability, where one has to measure multiple configurations to obtain a comprehensive picture. Configuration sampling is a common approach to control the measurement cost. However, it cannot guarantee completeness and might miss performance regressions, especially if they only affect few configurations. As an alternative to solve the cost reduction problem, we present ConfFLARE: ConfFLARE estimates whether a change potentially impacts performance by identifying data-flow interactions with performance-relevant code and extracts which software features participate in such interactions. Based on these features, we can select a subset of relevant configurations to focus performance profiling efforts on. In a study conducted on both, synthetic and real-world software systems, ConfFLARE correctly detects performance regressions in almost all cases and identifies relevant features in all but two cases, reducing the number of configurations to be tested on average by $79\%$ for synthetic and by $70\%$ for real-world regression scenarios saving hours of performance testing time.

*Timmie M. R. Lagermann,Kristina Sophia Carter,Su Mei Gwen Ho,Luís Cruz,Kerstin Eder,Maja H. Kirkeby*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper measures energy consumption across four web UI automation testing frameworks and identifies significant variation depending on the frameworks and actions performed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To guide energy-aware test design by examining variations in energy consumption for different UI actions across various automation testing frameworks.

Method: Researchers utilized a controlled setup with external power metering to measure energy consumption during repeated performance of various UI actions using four testing frameworks. Each action was conducted 35 times.

Result: Energy consumption varied significantly across frameworks. Puppeteer was most energy-efficient for specific actions, Selenium excelled for others, while Nightwatch was generally least efficient. Energy costs for the same action differed by up to six times between frameworks.

Conclusion: Making developers aware of energy consumption metrics for testing frameworks can lead to more energy-conscious choices and optimize testing strategies.

Abstract: We examine per action energy consumption across four web user interface (UI) automation testing frameworks to determine whether consistent tendencies can guide energy-aware test design. Using a controlled client-server setup with external power metering, we repeat each UI action (refresh, click variants, checkbox, drag&drop, input-text, scroll) 35 times. Across each of the actions, energy costs vary by both framework and action. Puppeteer is the most efficient for left-click, right-click, double-click, checkbox, and input-text; Selenium is the most efficient for refresh and scroll; Nightwatch is generally the least energy efficient. The energy cost of performing the same action varied by up to a factor of six depending on the framework. This indicates that providing transparency of energy consumption for UI automation testing frameworks allows developers to make informed, energy-aware decisions when testing a specific UI action.

*Haoxin Tu,Huan Zhao,Yahui Song,Mehtab Zafar,Ruijie Meng,Abhik Roychoudhury*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper introduces AutoRocq, a large language model agent for automated program verification, leveraging iterative refinement loops with the Rocq theorem prover.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With the rise of AI-generated code through Large Language Models (LLMs) and AI applications like AlphaProof in mathematical reasoning, there's a growing opportunity to apply these methods for structured program verification. This would address the challenge of reasoning about the increasingly large volumes of AI-generated code.

Method: The paper proposes AutoRocq, an LLM agent that conducts program verification by iteratively improving proofs through communication with the Rocq theorem prover. This involves a proof agent-autonomous collaboration where feedback and additional contexts refine the proof tree structure.

Result: Experimental evaluations on SV-COMP benchmarks and Linux kernel modules demonstrate promising results, achieving effective automated program verification.

Conclusion: AutoRocq represents a step toward trusted automatic programming, integrating AI-driven code generation with verification to fulfill a generate and validate loop, promoting reliable automated programming systems.

Abstract: Automatically generated code is gaining traction recently, owing to the prevalence of Large Language Models (LLMs). Further, the AlphaProof initiative has demonstrated the possibility of using AI for general mathematical reasoning. Reasoning about computer programs (software) can be accomplished via general mathematical reasoning; however, it tends to be more structured and richer in contexts. This forms an attractive proposition, since then AI agents can be used to reason about voluminous code that gets generated by AI.
  In this work, we present a first LLM agent, AutoRocq, for conducting program verification. Unlike past works, which rely on extensive training of LLMs on proof examples, our agent learns on-the-fly and improves the proof via an iterative refinement loop. The iterative improvement of the proof is achieved by the proof agent communicating with the Rocq (formerly Coq) theorem prover to get additional context and feedback. The final result of the iteration is a proof derivation checked by the Rocq theorem prover. In this way, our proof construction involves autonomous collaboration between the proof agent and the theorem prover. This autonomy facilitates the search for proofs and decision-making in deciding on the structure of the proof tree.
  Experimental evaluation on SV-COMP benchmarks and on Linux kernel modules shows promising efficacy in achieving automated program verification. As automation in code generation becomes more widespread, we posit that our proof agent can be potentially integrated with AI coding agents to achieve a generate and validate loop, thus moving closer to the vision of trusted automatic programming.

TL;DR: This study explores the impact of Self-Admitted Technical Debt (SATD) in Scientific Software (SSW) by analyzing 27 repositories and fine-tuning transformer-based models to identify SATD efficiently. It finds far higher levels of SATD and Scientific Debt in SSW than general-purpose software, highlighting the risks to scientific quality and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the need to understand the relationship between SATD and scientific software, given its significant impact on the reproducibility and reliability of scientific research.

Method: The study analyzed SATD across 27 scientific and general-purpose software repositories and fine-tuned 10 transformer-based models with sizes from 100M to 7B parameters on a large labeled dataset of code comments.

Result: The study found that SSW contains 9.25x more Scientific Debt and 4.93x more SATD than general-purpose software. Additionally, their best transformer-based model outperformed prior methods for SATD identification.

Conclusion: The research highlights that SATD in SSW poses significant risks to software quality and scientific validity. Adopting advanced debt management strategies can enhance the integrity of scientific discoveries.

Abstract: Developers often leave behind clues in their code, admitting where it falls short, known as Self-Admitted Technical Debt (SATD). In the world of Scientific Software (SSW), where innovation moves fast and collaboration is key, such debt is not just common but deeply impactful. As research relies on accurate and reproducible results, accumulating SATD can threaten the very foundations of scientific discovery. Yet, despite its significance, the relationship between SATD and SSW remains largely unexplored, leaving a crucial gap in understanding how to manage SATD in this critical domain. This study explores SATD in SSW repositories, comparing SATD in scientific versus general-purpose open-source software and evaluating transformer-based models for SATD identification. We analyzed SATD in 27 scientific and general-purpose repositories across multiple domains and languages. We fine-tuned and compared 10 transformer-based models (100M-7B parameters) on 67,066 labeled code comments. SSW contains 9.25x more Scientific Debt and 4.93x more SATD than general-purpose software due to complex computations, domain constraints, and evolving research needs. Furthermore, our best model outperforms existing ones. This study uncovers how SATD in SSW differs from general software, revealing its impact on quality and scientific validity. By recognizing these challenges, developers and researchers can adopt smarter strategies to manage debt and safeguard the integrity of scientific discovery.

TL;DR: The paper introduces CREST, a retrieval system using specialized models for different fault criteria in TRs, boosting accuracy, interpretability, and retrieval performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to overcome challenges in managing the complexity and volume of Trouble Reports (TRs) data, critical for maintaining software reliability and service quality.

Method: The paper proposes CREST – a criterion-specific retrieval system using an ensemble of specialized TR models to train on specific TR criteria and aggregate outputs for improved interpretability and effectiveness.

Result: Criterion-specific models within CREST outperform single-model approaches across key retrieval metrics, demonstrating the significance of diverse TR criteria.

Conclusion: CREST enhances fault resolution and software maintenance processes through effective and interpretable TR retrieval, emphasizing the critical role of targeted criteria.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of the telecommunication industry necessitates efficient troubleshooting processes to maintain network reliability, software maintainability, and service quality. Trouble Reports (TRs), which document issues in Ericsson's production system, play a critical role in facilitating the timely resolution of software faults. However, the complexity and volume of TR data, along with the presence of diverse criteria that reflect different aspects of each fault, present challenges for retrieval systems. Building on prior work at Ericsson, which utilized a two-stage workflow, comprising Initial Retrieval (IR) and Re-Ranking (RR) stages, this study investigates different TR observation criteria and their impact on the performance of retrieval models. We propose \textbf{CREST} (\textbf{C}riteria-specific \textbf{R}etrieval via \textbf{E}nsemble of \textbf{S}pecialized \textbf{T}R models), a criterion-driven retrieval approach that leverages specialized models for different TR fields to improve both effectiveness and interpretability, thereby enabling quicker fault resolution and supporting software maintenance. CREST utilizes specialized models trained on specific TR criteria and aggregates their outputs to capture diverse and complementary signals. This approach leads to enhanced retrieval accuracy, better calibration of predicted scores, and improved interpretability by providing relevance scores for each criterion, helping users understand why specific TRs were retrieved. Using a subset of Ericsson's internal TRs, this research demonstrates that criterion-specific models significantly outperform a single model approach across key evaluation metrics. This highlights the importance of all targeted criteria used in this study for optimizing the performance of retrieval systems.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces BITS for GAPS, a framework that combines hierarchical Gaussian processes with entropy-based sampling for hybrid physical systems modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of modeling hybrid physical systems where part of the dynamics are known and residuals are latent.

Method: The method utilizes a Gaussian process with hierarchical priors for latent function modeling and entropy-based acquisition functions for efficient data sampling.

Result: Numerical results show improved sampling efficiency, faster surrogate convergence, and enhanced predictive accuracy in non-ideal regimes.

Conclusion: BITS for GAPS serves as an efficient, interpretable, and uncertainty-aware tool for enhancing hybrid modeling of complex systems.

Abstract: We introduce the Bayesian Information-Theoretic Sampling for hierarchical GAussian Process Surrogates (BITS for GAPS) framework to emulate latent components in hybrid physical systems. BITS for GAPS supports serial hybrid modeling, where known physics governs part of the system and residual dynamics are represented as a latent function inferred from data. A Gaussian process prior is placed over the latent function, with hierarchical priors on its hyperparameters to encode physically meaningful structure in the predictive posterior.
  To guide data acquisition, we derive entropy-based acquisition functions that quantify expected information gain from candidate input locations, identifying samples most informative for training the surrogate. Specifically, we obtain a closed-form expression for the differential entropy of the predictive posterior and establish a tractable lower bound for efficient evaluation. These derivations approximate the predictive posterior as a finite, uniformly weighted mixture of Gaussian processes.
  We demonstrate the framework's utility by modeling activity coefficients in vapor-liquid equilibrium systems, embedding the surrogate into extended Raoult's law for distillation design. Numerical results show that entropy-guided sampling improves sample efficiency by targeting regions of high uncertainty and potential information gain. This accelerates surrogate convergence, enhances predictive accuracy in non-ideal regimes, and preserves physical consistency. Overall, BITS for GAPS provides an efficient, interpretable, and uncertainty-aware framework for hybrid modeling of complex physical systems.

TL;DR: The paper examines English-language vaccine discourse on social media from 2013-2022, focusing on sentiment shifts before and after the COVID-19 pandemic.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how public perceptions and discourse around vaccines evolve over time, particularly during significant health crises like the COVID-19 pandemic, using insights from social cognition and social psychology.

Method: They curated and analyzed a dataset of 18.7 million vaccine-related posts from X (formerly Twitter) spanning 2013-2022, using social psychological theories like the stereotype content model and emotion analysis for sentiment evaluation.

Result: Sentiment and discourse shifted during the pandemic, with decreases in negative emotions, increases in trust and surprise-related emotions, and changes in the use of warmth-focused and competence-focused language. Negative language rose again towards the pandemic's end.

Conclusion: The study highlights how vaccine-related sentiments and narratives on social media dynamically change, providing insights into public trust, warmth, and skepticism over time during health crises.

Abstract: In this work, we study English-language vaccine discourse in social media posts, specifically posts on X (formerly Twitter), in seven years before the COVID-19 outbreak (2013 to 2019) and three years after the outbreak was first reported (2020 to 2022). Drawing on theories from social cognition and the stereotype content model in Social Psychology, we analyze how English speakers talk about vaccines on social media to understand the evolving narrative around vaccines in social media posts. To do that, we first introduce a novel dataset comprising 18.7 million curated posts on vaccine discourse from 2013 to 2022. This extensive collection-filtered down from an initial 129 million posts through rigorous preprocessing-captures both pre-COVID and COVID-19 periods, offering valuable insights into the evolution of English-speaking X users' perceptions related to vaccines. Our analysis shows that the COVID-19 pandemic led to complex shifts in X users' sentiment and discourse around vaccines. We observe that negative emotion word usage decreased during the pandemic, with notable rises in usage of surprise, and trust related emotion words. Furthermore, vaccine-related language tended to use more warmth-focused words associated with trustworthiness, along with positive, competence-focused words during the early days of the pandemic, with a marked rise in negative word usage towards the end of the pandemic, possibly reflecting a growing vaccine hesitancy and skepticism.

*Arnau Mir,Alejandro Mus,Juan Vicente Riera*

Main category: cs.LO

TL;DR: The paper introduces efficient algorithms to compute the position function and its inverse for discrete fuzzy numbers, reducing computational cost for algebraic operations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to improve computational efficiency in handling discrete fuzzy numbers used to represent linguistic information in fuzzy systems.

Method: Algorithms are developed to exploit the combinatorial structure of total orders for accurate computation of the position function and its inverse within discrete fuzzy numbers.

Result: The approach demonstrates complexity of $\mathcal{O}(n^2 m \log n)$, ensuring efficient implementation of operations like aggregation and implication with scalability.

Conclusion: This formulation enhances computational efficiency, enabling broader utilization of discrete fuzzy numbers in fuzzy system operations.

Abstract: Discrete fuzzy numbers, and in particular those defined over a finite chain $L_n = \{0, \ldots, n\}$, have been effectively employed to represent linguistic information within the framework of fuzzy systems. Research on total (admissible) orderings of such types of fuzzy subsets, and specifically those belonging to the set $\mathcal{D}_1^{L_n\rightarrow Y_m}$ consisting of discrete fuzzy numbers $A$ whose support is a closed subinterval of the finite chain $L_n = \{0, 1, \ldots, n\}$ and whose membership values $A(x)$, for $x \in L_n$, belong to the set $Y_m = \{ 0 = y_1 < y_2 < \cdots < y_{m-1} < y_m = 1 \}$, has facilitated the development of new methods for constructing logical connectives, based on a bijective function, called $\textit{pos function}$, that determines the position of each $A \in \mathcal{D}_1^{L_n\rightarrow Y_m}$. For this reason, in this work we revisit the problem by introducing algorithms that exploit the combinatorial structure of total (admissible) orders to compute the $\textit{pos}$ function and its inverse with exactness. The proposed approach achieves a complexity of $\mathcal{O}(n^{2} m \log n)$, which is quadratic in the size of the underlying chain ($n$) and linear in the number of membership levels ($m$). The key point is that the dominant factor is $m$, ensuring scalability with respect to the granularity of membership values. The results demonstrate that this formulation substantially reduces computational cost and enables the efficient implementation of algebraic operations -- such as aggregation and implication -- on the set of discrete fuzzy numbers.

### [283] [Fast Decoding for Non-Adaptive Learning of Erdős--Rényi Random Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17240)
*Hoang Ta,Jonathan Scarlett*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: This paper studies learning graphs via queries on node subsets and proposes a more efficient method to learn Erdős--Rényi (ER) graphs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the inefficiency in learning unknown graphs with a focus on Erdős--Rényi graphs, particularly overcoming the trade-off of prior methods that require either too many tests or high decoding time.

Method: The study extends the binary splitting approach to ER graph learning to design a testing-decoding scheme that achieves efficient test and decoding time.

Result: The method achieves vanishing error probability using O(\bar{k} log n) tests, with a decoding time of O(\bar{k}^{1+δ} log n) for any fixed δ > 0.

Conclusion: The proposed method improves decoding time while keeping testing cost order-optimal, advancing efficient graph learning algorithms.

Abstract: We study the problem of learning an unknown graph via group queries on node subsets, where each query reports whether at least one edge is present among the queried nodes. In general, learning arbitrary graphs with \(n\) nodes and \(k\) edges is hard in the non-adaptive setting, requiring \(Ω\big(\min\{k^2\log n,\,n^2\}\big)\) tests even when a small error probability is allowed. We focus on learning Erdős--Rényi (ER) graphs \(G\sim\ER(n,q)\) in the non-adaptive setting, where the expected number of edges is \(\bar{k}=q\binom{n}{2}\), and we aim to design an efficient testing--decoding scheme achieving asymptotically vanishing error probability. Prior work (Li--Fresacher--Scarlett, NeurIPS 2019) presents a testing--decoding scheme that attains an order-optimal number of tests \(O(\bar{k}\log n)\) but incurs \(Ω(n^2)\) decoding time, whereas their proposed sublinear-time algorithm incurs an extra \((\log \bar{k})(\log n)\) factor in the number of tests. We extend the binary splitting approach, recently developed for non-adaptive group testing, to the ER graph learning setting, and prove that the edge set can be recovered with high probability using \(O(\bar{k}\log n)\) tests while attaining decoding time \(O(\bar{k}^{1+δ}\log n)\) for any fixed \(δ>0\).

*Thorsten Buss,Henry Day-Hall,Frank Gaede,Gregor Kasieczka,Katja Krüger,Anatolii Korol,Thomas Madlener,Peter McKeown*

Main category: hep-ex

TL;DR: The study evaluates the use of generative models for highly granular calorimeter simulations in realistic applications, comparing grid-based and point cloud approaches using the DDML library.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Collider experiments require efficient and accurate surrogate simulators for granular calorimeter showers due to their crucial role in particle physics analysis.

Method: The study develops DDML, a library integrating generative calorimeter surrogates with DD4hep detectors. It benchmarks grid-based and point-cloud generative models with performance evaluations based on electromagnetic shower simulations and post-reconstruction tasks.

Result: Point-cloud generative models show a better balance between speed and accuracy than grid-based models for highly granular calorimeter simulations.

Conclusion: Point-cloud methods can be more efficient for realistic calorimeter simulation tasks, pointing to their potential advantages for future applications in collider experiments.

Abstract: The physics programs of current and future collider experiments necessitate the development of surrogate simulators for calorimeter showers. While much progress has been made in the development of generative models for this task, they have typically been evaluated in simplified scenarios and for single particles. This is particularly true for the challenging task of highly granular calorimeter simulation. For the first time, this work studies the use of highly granular generative calorimeter surrogates in a realistic simulation application. We introduce DDML, a generic library which enables the combination of generative calorimeter surrogates with realistic detectors implemented using the DD4hep toolkit. We compare two different generative models - one operating on a regular grid representation, and the other using a less common point cloud approach. In order to disentangle methodological details from model performance, we provide comparisons to idealized simulators which directly sample representations of different resolutions from the full simulation ground-truth. We then systematically evaluate model performance on post-reconstruction benchmarks for electromagnetic shower simulation. Beginning with a typical single particle study, we introduce a first multi-particle benchmark based on di-photon separations, before studying a first full-physics benchmark based on hadronic decays of the tau lepton. Our results indicate that models operating on a point cloud can achieve a favorable balance between speed and accuracy for highly granular calorimeter simulation compared to those which operate on a regular grid representation.

### [285] [RASTP: Representation-Aware Semantic Token Pruning for Generative Recommendation with Semantic Identifiers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16943)
*Tianyu Zhan,Kairui Fu,Zheqi Lv,Shengyu Zhang*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: This paper introduces RASTP, a method to prune less informative tokens in generative recommendation systems to improve efficiency and maintain effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the computational complexity and memory issues caused by increasing input sequence lengths in recommendation systems that use semantic identifiers (SIDs).

Method: The proposed RASTP method dynamically evaluates and prunes the importance of semantic tokens using a combination of semantic saliency (via representation magnitude) and attention centrality (via cumulative attention weights).

Result: RASTP significantly reduces training time by 26.7% on three real-world Amazon datasets, while maintaining or slightly improving recommendation performance.

Conclusion: By pruning less informative semantic tokens, RASTP offers a more efficient approach to training generative recommendation systems without sacrificing accuracy.

Abstract: Generative recommendation systems typically leverage Semantic Identifiers (SIDs), which represent each item as a sequence of tokens that encode semantic information. However, representing item ID with multiple SIDs significantly increases input sequence length, which is a major determinant of computational complexity and memory consumption. While existing efforts primarily focus on optimizing attention computation and KV cache, we propose RASTP (Representation-Aware Semantic Token Pruning), which directly prunes less informative tokens in the input sequence. Specifically, RASTP evaluates token importance by combining semantic saliency, measured via representation magnitude, and attention centrality, derived from cumulative attention weights. Since RASTP dynamically prunes low-information or irrelevant semantic tokens, experiments on three real-world Amazon datasets show that RASTP reduces training time by 26.7\%, while maintaining or slightly improving recommendation performance. The code has been open-sourced at https://github.com/Yuzt-zju/RASTP.

### [286] [CLLMRec: LLM-powered Cognitive-Aware Concept Recommendation via Semantic Alignment and Prerequisite Knowledge Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17041)
*Xiangrui Xiong,Yichuan Lu,Zifei Pan,Chang Sun*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: CLLMRec leverages Large Language Models to enhance personalized concept recommendations for MOOCs, overcoming the limitations of traditional methods reliant on structured knowledge graphs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in personalized concept recommendation in MOOCs due to the scarcity of high-quality structured knowledge graphs.

Method: CLLMRec uses Large Language Models with Semantic Alignment and Prerequisite Knowledge Distillation, integrating textual descriptions and prerequisite relationships.

Result: Extensive experiments show CLLMRec significantly outperforms baseline methods on multiple evaluation metrics in MOOC datasets.

Conclusion: CLLMRec proves effective in cognitive-aware personalized concept recommendations without relying on explicit structural priors.

Abstract: The growth of Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) presents significant challenges for personalized learning, where concept recommendation is crucial. Existing approaches typically rely on heterogeneous information networks or knowledge graphs to capture conceptual relationships, combined with knowledge tracing models to assess learners' cognitive states. However, these methods face significant limitations due to their dependence on high-quality structured knowledge graphs, which are often scarce in real-world educational scenarios. To address this fundamental challenge, this paper proposes CLLMRec, a novel framework that leverages Large Language Models through two synergistic technical pillars: Semantic Alignment and Prerequisite Knowledge Distillation. The Semantic Alignment component constructs a unified representation space by encoding unstructured textual descriptions of learners and concepts. The Prerequisite Knowledge Distillation paradigm employs a teacher-student architecture, where a large teacher LLM (implemented as the Prior Knowledge Aware Component) extracts conceptual prerequisite relationships from its internalized world knowledge and distills them into soft labels to train an efficient student ranker. Building upon these foundations, our framework incorporates a fine-ranking mechanism that explicitly models learners' real-time cognitive states through deep knowledge tracing, ensuring recommendations are both structurally sound and cognitively appropriate. Extensive experiments on two real-world MOOC datasets demonstrate that CLLMRec significantly outperforms existing baseline methods across multiple evaluation metrics, validating its effectiveness in generating truly cognitive-aware and personalized concept recommendations without relying on explicit structural priors.

### [287] [A Patient-Centric Blockchain Framework for Secure Electronic Health Record Management: Decoupling Data Storage from Access Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17464)
*Tanzim Hossain Romel,Kawshik Kumar Paul,Tanberul Islam Ruhan,Maisha Rahman Mim,Abu Sayed Md. Latiful Hoque*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper proposes a blockchain-based architecture to securely share patient-centered electronic health records (EHRs), offering privacy, security, and auditability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of secure, efficient, and patient-controlled sharing of EHRs while ensuring compliance with security, privacy, and regulatory requirements.

Method: A patient-centric blockchain architecture is introduced, separating EHR storage from authorization/audit. It uses encrypted FHIR off-chain resources, public blockchain for permissions, cryptographic key wrapping for encoding, and a Solidity reference implementation on Ethereum.

Result: The method achieves permission grants with costs averaging 78,000 gas on Layer 1 (L1), with end-to-end latencies for EHR access (1 MB) ranging from 0.7 to 1.4 seconds. Layer-2 reduces gas usage 10–13 times. Practical considerations like metadata privacy and regulatory compliance are addressed.

Conclusion: The proposed system restores patient control over EHRs while maintaining the required security and privacy properties, offering a practical and scalable approach for sensitive clinical data sharing.

Abstract: We present a patient-centric architecture for electronic health record (EHR) sharing that separates content storage from authorization and audit. Encrypted FHIR resources are stored off-chain; a public blockchain records only cryptographic commitments and patient-signed, time-bounded permissions using EIP-712. Keys are distributed via public-key wrapping, enabling storage providers to remain honest-but-curious without risking confidentiality. We formalize security goals (confidentiality, integrity, cryptographically attributable authorization, and auditability of authorization events) and provide a Solidity reference implementation deployed as single-patient contracts. On-chain costs for permission grants average 78,000 gas (L1), and end-to-end access latency for 1 MB records is 0.7--1.4s (mean values for S3 and IPFS respectively), dominated by storage retrieval. Layer-2 deployment reduces gas usage by 10--13x, though data availability charges dominate actual costs. We discuss metadata privacy, key registry requirements, and regulatory considerations (HIPAA/GDPR), demonstrating a practical route to restoring patient control while preserving security properties required for sensitive clinical data.

*Yige Li,Zhe Li,Wei Zhao,Nay Myat Min,Hanxun Huang,Xingjun Ma,Jun Sun*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper presents AutoBackdoor, an automated framework for backdoor injection in large language models (LLMs), achieving high attack success rates and exposing vulnerabilities of existing defenses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations in current backdoor attack methods, such as rigidity and labor-intensiveness, and to develop scalable frameworks for evaluating modern defense robustness against evolving AI threats.

Method: AutoBackdoor uses an autonomous agent-driven pipeline to automate trigger generation, poisoned data construction, and model fine-tuning, employing a language model agent for scalable and context-aware attacks.

Result: AutoBackdoor achieves over 90% attack success across varied realistic threat scenarios, demonstrating the ineffectiveness of current defense mechanisms in mitigating agent-driven backdoor attacks.

Conclusion: The findings highlight significant vulnerabilities in existing defenses and emphasize the necessity for adaptive and rigorous evaluation frameworks against backdoor threats in LLMs.

Abstract: Backdoor attacks pose a serious threat to the secure deployment of large language models (LLMs), enabling adversaries to implant hidden behaviors triggered by specific inputs. However, existing methods often rely on manually crafted triggers and static data pipelines, which are rigid, labor-intensive, and inadequate for systematically evaluating modern defense robustness. As AI agents become increasingly capable, there is a growing need for more rigorous, diverse, and scalable \textit{red-teaming frameworks} that can realistically simulate backdoor threats and assess model resilience under adversarial conditions. In this work, we introduce \textsc{AutoBackdoor}, a general framework for automating backdoor injection, encompassing trigger generation, poisoned data construction, and model fine-tuning via an autonomous agent-driven pipeline. Unlike prior approaches, AutoBackdoor uses a powerful language model agent to generate semantically coherent, context-aware trigger phrases, enabling scalable poisoning across arbitrary topics with minimal human effort. We evaluate AutoBackdoor under three realistic threat scenarios, including \textit{Bias Recommendation}, \textit{Hallucination Injection}, and \textit{Peer Review Manipulation}, to simulate a broad range of attacks. Experiments on both open-source and commercial models, including LLaMA-3, Mistral, Qwen, and GPT-4o, demonstrate that our method achieves over 90\% attack success with only a small number of poisoned samples. More importantly, we find that existing defenses often fail to mitigate these attacks, underscoring the need for more rigorous and adaptive evaluation techniques against agent-driven threats as explored in this work. All code, datasets, and experimental configurations will be merged into our primary repository at https://github.com/bboylyg/BackdoorLLM.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: Passwords are critical for security but often vulnerable due to weak choices by users. SODA ADVANCE is introduced to enhance password evaluation, integrating social media and testing Large Language Models (LLMs) for password generation and assessment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inadequacy of traditional password evaluation methods and mitigate security risks from weak passwords.

Method: SODA ADVANCE integrates a unique module using public data sources like social media for evaluating password strength and leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to assess and generate personalized passwords based on user profiles.

Result: SODA ADVANCE and LLMs successfully generated strong, personalized passwords and effectively evaluated password strength, especially with the inclusion of user-specific data.

Conclusion: Emerging tools like LLMs and SODA ADVANCE improve password security by enhancing strength evaluation and personalized password generation, highlighting their potential in cybersecurity solutions.

Abstract: Although passwords remain the primary defense against unauthorized access, users often tend to use passwords that are easy to remember. This behavior significantly increases security risks, also due to the fact that traditional password strength evaluation methods are often inadequate. In this discussion paper, we present SODA ADVANCE, a data reconstruction tool also designed to enhance evaluation processes related to the password strength. In particular, SODA ADVANCE integrates a specialized module aimed at evaluating password strength by leveraging publicly available data from multiple sources, including social media platforms. Moreover, we investigate the capabilities and risks associated with emerging Large Language Models (LLMs) in evaluating and generating passwords, respectively. Experimental assessments conducted with 100 real users demonstrate that LLMs can generate strong and personalized passwords possibly defined according to user profiles. Additionally, LLMs were shown to be effective in evaluating passwords, especially when they can take into account user profile data.

*Mona Khalil,Alberto Blanco-Justicia,Najeeb Jebreel,Josep Domingo-Ferrer*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper investigates the root causes of membership inference vulnerabilities in ML models, especially the vulnerability of outlier samples, and proposes defensive strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Membership inference attacks pose privacy risks to individuals and are often linked to model overfitting. Existing defenses like differential privacy incur high accuracy losses.

Method: The paper empirically analyzes the characteristics of training data samples vulnerable to membership inference attacks in non-overfitted models, identifying outliers as key sources of vulnerability.

Result: The study identifies that outlier samples within classes—such as noisy or hard-to-classify data—are particularly vulnerable to membership inference attacks.

Conclusion: Targeted defenses can be implemented to protect vulnerable samples, thus improving the privacy-preserving capabilities of machine learning models.

Abstract: Membership inference attacks (MIAs) against machine learning (ML) models aim to determine whether a given data point was part of the model training data. These attacks may pose significant privacy risks to individuals whose sensitive data were used for training, which motivates the use of defenses such as differential privacy, often at the cost of high accuracy losses. MIAs exploit the differences in the behavior of a model when making predictions on samples it has seen during training (members) versus those it has not seen (non-members). Several studies have pointed out that model overfitting is the major factor contributing to these differences in behavior and, consequently, to the success of MIAs. However, the literature also shows that even non-overfitted ML models can leak information about a small subset of their training data. In this paper, we investigate the root causes of membership inference vulnerabilities beyond traditional overfitting concerns and suggest targeted defenses. We empirically analyze the characteristics of the training data samples vulnerable to MIAs in models that are not overfitted (and hence able to generalize). Our findings reveal that these samples are often outliers within their classes (e.g., noisy or hard to classify). We then propose potential defensive strategies to protect these vulnerable samples and enhance the privacy-preserving capabilities of ML models.

*Georgios Anyfantis,Pere Barlet-Ros*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: AutoGraphAD is a novel unsupervised anomaly detection method for NIDS using heterogeneous graphs, achieving faster training and inference with comparable or better results than previous approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address limitations in existing NIDS, such as the need for costly labelled datasets and the outdated or mislabelled public datasets.

Method: The approach utilizes a Heterogeneous Variational Graph Autoencoder to analyze graphs of network activity. It is trained using unsupervised and contrastive learning, combining several losses into an anomaly score for detection.

Result: AutoGraphAD outperforms previous unsupervised methods like Anomal-E in speed (faster training and inference) and achieves comparable or better detection results.

Conclusion: AutoGraphAD provides a more efficient and effective solution for anomaly detection in NIDS without requiring labelled training data, making it suitable for practical deployment.

Abstract: Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) are essential tools for detecting network attacks and intrusions. While extensive research has explored the use of supervised Machine Learning for attack detection and characterisation, these methods require accurately labelled datasets, which are very costly to obtain. Moreover, existing public datasets have limited and/or outdated attacks, and many of them suffer from mislabelled data. To reduce the reliance on labelled data, we propose AutoGraphAD, a novel unsupervised anomaly detection approach based on a Heterogeneous Variational Graph Autoencoder. AutoGraphAD operates on heterogeneous graphs, made from connection and IP nodes that capture network activity within a time window. The model is trained using unsupervised and contrastive learning, without relying on any labelled data. The reconstruction, structural loss, and KL divergence are then weighted and combined in an anomaly score that is then used for anomaly detection. Overall, AutoGraphAD yields the same, and in some cases better, results than previous unsupervised approaches, such as Anomal-E, but without requiring costly downstream anomaly detectors. As a result, AutoGraphAD achieves around 1.18 orders of magnitude faster training and 1.03 orders of magnitude faster inference, which represents a significant advantage for operational deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to redefine augmented reality (AR) by overcoming the limitations of conventional AR engines and paving the way for high-fidelity, immersive experiences.

Method: GAR utilizes a unified generative backbone for video generation by jointly encoding environmental sensing, virtual content, and interaction signals as conditioning inputs.

Result: The paper formalizes the computational framework of GAR, surveys the advancements enabling real-time generative augmentation, and highlights potential applications.

Conclusion: GAR is proposed as a transformative AR paradigm, offering enhanced realism and interaction, while raising new research opportunities and ethical considerations.

Abstract: This paper introduces Generative Augmented Reality (GAR) as a next-generation paradigm that reframes augmentation as a process of world re-synthesis rather than world composition by a conventional AR engine. GAR replaces the conventional AR engine's multi-stage modules with a unified generative backbone, where environmental sensing, virtual content, and interaction signals are jointly encoded as conditioning inputs for continuous video generation. We formalize the computational correspondence between AR and GAR, survey the technical foundations that make real-time generative augmentation feasible, and outline prospective applications that leverage its unified inference model. We envision GAR as a future AR paradigm that delivers high-fidelity experiences in terms of realism, interactivity, and immersion, while eliciting new research challenges on technologies, content ecosystems, and the ethical and societal implications.

Motivation: AI applications in design face challenges in aligning computational rigour with the subjective nature of graphic design, leading to exploration of co-creative workflows.

Method: A systematic review of 872 papers using the PRISMA methodology, narrowing down to 71 publications describing 68 systems. Introduced the GRAPHIC framework to identify key collaboration areas.

Result: The analysis uncovered three essential dimensions for systems: (1) Collaborative Panorama, (2) Processes and Modalities, and (3) Graphic Design Principles. Gaps include initiative balance, explainable models, and promoting transformational creativity.

Conclusion: The research identifies gaps in AI-graphic design collaboration and provides a framework for fostering more effective and creativity-driven systems.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been increasingly applied to creative domains, leading to the development of systems that collaborate with humans in design processes. In Graphic Design, integrating computational systems into co-creative workflows presents specific challenges, as it requires balancing scientific rigour with the subjective and visual nature of design practice. Following the PRISMA methodology, we identified 872 articles, resulting in a final corpus of 71 publications describing 68 unique systems. Based on this review, we introduce GRAPHIC (Guidelines for Reviewing Algorithmic Practices in Human-centred Design and Interaction for Creativity), a framework for analysing AI-based systems applied to Graphic Design. Its goal is to understand how current systems support human-AI collaboration in the Graphic Design discipline. The framework comprises main dimensions, which our analysis revealed to be essential across diverse system types: (1) Collaborative Panorama, (2) Processes and Modalities, and (3) Graphic Design Principles. Its application revealed research gaps, including the need to balance initiative and control between agents, improve communication through explainable interaction models, and promote systems that support transformational creativity grounded in core design principles.

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: The paper examines the use, attitudes, and trust surrounding Generative AI (GenAI) in sociological research, based on a survey of 433 authors, finding skepticism, limited use cases, and environmental and social concerns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to explore how GenAI is being used in sociological research amidst growing attention and skepticism, investigating scholars' usage patterns, motivations, and attitudes.

Method: A survey was conducted targeting 433 authors of recently published articles in sociology journals, focusing on their GenAI usage, reasoning, and perspectives.

Result: Approximately one-third of scholars reported weekly GenAI use, mainly for writing. Concerns about social/environmental issues are high, trust in outputs is low, and opinions about its impact on sociology are divided.

Conclusion: Sociologists are cautious in their use of GenAI, expressing significant concerns about its impact and utility, despite some optimism for its improvement in the future.

Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) has garnered considerable attention for its potential utility in research and scholarship, even among those who typically do not rely on computational tools. Early commentators, however, have also articulated concerns about how GenAI usage comes with enormous environmental costs, serious social risks, and a tendency to produce low-quality content. In the midst of both excitement and skepticism, it is crucial to take stock of how GenAI is actually being used. Our study focuses on sociological research as our site, and here we present findings from a survey of 433 authors of articles published in 50 sociology journals in the last five years. The survey provides an overview of the state of the discipline with regard to the use of GenAI by providing answers to fundamental questions: how (much) do scholars use the technology for their research; what are their reasons for using it; and how concerned, trustful, and optimistic are they about the technology? Of the approximately one third ofrespondents who self-report using GenAI at least weekly, the primary uses are for writing assistance and comparatively less so in planning, data collection, or data analysis. In both use and attitudes, there are surprisingly few differences between self-identified computational and non-computational researchers. Generally, respondents are very concerned about the social and environmental consequences of GenAI. Trust in GenAI outputs is low, regardless of expertise or frequency of use. While optimism that GenAI will improve is high, scholars are divided on whether GenAI will have a positive impact on the field.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AI Scientists overlook critical aspects of scientific collaboration and infrastructure, limiting their ability to genuinely emulate real-world research ecosystems and interact with the human scientific community.

Method: The authors developed OmniScientist, integrating mechanisms like structured knowledge systems, collaborative research protocols, and an open evaluation platform to simulate and support human-like scientific workflows.

Result: OmniScientist automates key scientific tasks, enables seamless multi-agent and human collaboration, and provides a scalable platform for enhancing and evolving innovation within a simulated scientific ecosystem.

Conclusion: By explicitly modeling collaborative and human research mechanisms, OmniScientist demonstrates the potential to bridge AI and human scientific efforts, fostering scalable, collaborative, and sustainable scientific advancements.

Abstract: With the rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs), AI agents have demonstrated increasing proficiency in scientific tasks, ranging from hypothesis generation and experimental design to manuscript writing. Such agent systems are commonly referred to as "AI Scientists." However, existing AI Scientists predominantly formulate scientific discovery as a standalone search or optimization problem, overlooking the fact that scientific research is inherently a social and collaborative endeavor. Real-world science relies on a complex scientific infrastructure composed of collaborative mechanisms, contribution attribution, peer review, and structured scientific knowledge networks. Due to the lack of modeling for these critical dimensions, current systems struggle to establish a genuine research ecosystem or interact deeply with the human scientific community. To bridge this gap, we introduce OmniScientist, a framework that explicitly encodes the underlying mechanisms of human research into the AI scientific workflow. OmniScientist not only achieves end-to-end automation across data foundation, literature review, research ideation, experiment automation, scientific writing, and peer review, but also provides comprehensive infrastructural support by simulating the human scientific system, comprising: (1) a structured knowledge system built upon citation networks and conceptual correlations; (2) a collaborative research protocol (OSP), which enables seamless multi-agent collaboration and human researcher participation; and (3) an open evaluation platform (ScienceArena) based on blind pairwise user voting and Elo rankings. This infrastructure empowers agents to not only comprehend and leverage human knowledge systems but also to collaborate and co-evolve, fostering a sustainable and scalable innovation ecosystem.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the governance challenge of ensuring LLMs align with diverse cultural values amid global high-stakes applications.

Method: Introduces four methodologies: Ethical Dilemma Corpus for stability, Diversity-Enhanced Framework for cultural fidelity, First-Token Probability Alignment for distribution accuracy, and MARK for interpretability.

Result: Analysis uncovers fundamental instability in value systems, under-representation of youth, varying alignment qualities, and regional modeling differences. Mistral-series surpass LLaMA3 models in cross-cultural alignment, and Full-Parameter Fine-Tuning outperforms Reinforcement Learning for cultural variation.

Conclusion: Neither China-origin nor Western-origin LLMs achieve robust cross-cultural generalization, signaling the need for improved governance strategies and methodologies in AI alignment.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly influence high-stakes decision-making across global contexts, ensuring their alignment with diverse cultural values has become a critical governance challenge. This study presents a Multi-Layered Auditing Platform for Responsible AI that systematically evaluates cross-cultural value alignment in China-origin and Western-origin LLMs through four integrated methodologies: Ethical Dilemma Corpus for assessing temporal stability, Diversity-Enhanced Framework (DEF) for quantifying cultural fidelity, First-Token Probability Alignment for distributional accuracy, and Multi-stAge Reasoning frameworK (MARK) for interpretable decision-making. Our comparative analysis of 20+ leading models, such as Qwen, GPT-4o, Claude, LLaMA, and DeepSeek, reveals universal challenges-fundamental instability in value systems, systematic under-representation of younger demographics, and non-linear relationships between model scale and alignment quality-alongside divergent regional development trajectories. While China-origin models increasingly emphasize multilingual data integration for context-specific optimization, Western models demonstrate greater architectural experimentation but persistent U.S.-centric biases. Neither paradigm achieves robust cross-cultural generalization. We establish that Mistral-series architectures significantly outperform LLaMA3-series in cross-cultural alignment, and that Full-Parameter Fine-Tuning on diverse datasets surpasses Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback in preserving cultural variation...

TL;DR: This paper explores the uneven governance of AI through the lens of International Political Economy (IPE), arguing for bottom-up approaches that involve AI workers in fostering ethical and responsible AI development.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the challenges of ensuring responsible and ethical AI development, highlighting the uneven application of governance efforts at international and national levels.

Method: It proposes leveraging AI workers as agents of change through Participatory Design (PD) methods, emphasizing their role in fostering Algorithmic Collective Action (ACA) for better AI governance.

Result: The paper suggests that engaging AI workers can lead to more responsible and just AI development processes, addressing ethical and geopolitical concerns.

Conclusion: Governance alone is insufficient; incorporating bottom-up interventions through AI worker engagement could drive ethical and robust AI development.

Abstract: According to the theory of International Political Economy (IPE), states are often incentivized to rely on rather than constrain powerful corporations. For this reason, IPE provides a useful lens to explain why efforts to govern Artificial Intelligence (AI) at the international and national levels have thus far been developed, applied, and enforced unevenly. Building on recent work that explores how AI companies engage in geopolitics, this position paper argues that some AI workers can be considered actors of geopolitics. It makes the timely case that governance alone cannot ensure responsible, ethical, or robust AI development and use, and greater attention should be paid to bottom-up interventions at the site of AI development. AI workers themselves should be situated as individual agents of change, especially when considering their potential to foster Algorithmic Collective Action (ACA). Drawing on methods of Participatory Design (PD), this paper proposes engaging AI workers as sources of knowledge, relative power, and intentionality to encourage more responsible and just AI development and create the conditions that can facilitate ACA.

### [298] [On the Predictive Skill of Artificial Intelligence-based Weather Models for Extreme Events using Uncertainty Quantification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17176)
*Rodrigo Almeida,Noelia Otero,Miguel-Ángel Fernández-Torres,Jackie Ma*

Main category: physics.ao-ph

TL;DR: This paper evaluates the limitations of AI-based weather models in predicting extreme events and explores ensemble methods using input perturbations to improve probabilistic forecasting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the challenge of accurately predicting extreme weather events using deterministic AI-based weather models, which currently struggle with representing uncertainty and capturing extremes.

Method: Three perturbation strategies - Gaussian noise, Hemispheric Centered Bred Vectors, and Huge Ensembles - are applied to generate 50-member ensembles for evaluating forecasting skill during two major weather events.

Result: Flow-dependent perturbations produce the highest probabilistic skill and realistic ensemble spread, improving the representation of temperature extremes more effectively than precipitation.

Conclusion: Input perturbations can enhance deterministic models toward probabilistic forecasting, offering a promising method to integrate ensemble strategies with uncertainty modeling for AI-driven early warning systems.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of extreme weather events remains a major challenge for artificial intelligence based weather prediction systems. While deterministic models such as FuXi, GraphCast, and SFNO have achieved competitive forecast skill relative to numerical weather prediction, their ability to represent uncertainty and capture extremes is still limited. This study investigates how state of the art deterministic artificial intelligence based models respond to initial-condition perturbations and evaluates the resulting ensembles in forecasting extremes. Using three perturbation strategies (Gaussian noise, Hemispheric Centered Bred Vectors, and Huge Ensembles), we generate 50 member ensembles for two major events in August 2022: the Pakistan floods and the China heatwave. Ensemble skill is assessed against ERA5 and compared with IFS ENS and the probabilistic AIFSENS model using deterministic and probabilistic metrics. Results show that flow dependent perturbations produce the most realistic ensemble spread and highest probabilistic skill, narrowing but not closing the performance gap with numerical weather prediction ensembles. Across variables, artificial intelligence based weather models capture temperature extremes more effectively than precipitation. These findings demonstrate that input perturbations can extend deterministic models toward probabilistic forecasting, paving the way for approaches that combine flow dependent perturbations with generative or latent-space uncertainty modeling for reliable artificial intelligence-driven early warning systems.

### [299] [Dissecting Quantum Reinforcement Learning: A Systematic Evaluation of Key Components](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17112)
*Javier Lazaro,Juan-Ignacio Vazquez,Pablo Garcia-Bringas*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper investigates Parameterised Quantum Circuit (PQC)-based Quantum Reinforcement Learning (QRL), evaluating key components such as data embedding strategies, ansatz design, and post-processing methods in a unified framework to address challenges like barren plateaus and training instability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of the paper is to explore the potential of PQC-based QRL, addressing practical challenges like training instability and barren plateaus, and to analyze the contributions and interplay of individual components in QRL architectures for a deeper understanding.

Method: The methodology involves systematic experimental evaluations focusing on data embedding strategies (e.g., Data Reuploading), ansatz design (entanglement), and post-processing approaches (Output Reuse) within a unified PPO-CartPole framework, enabling controlled comparisons of hybrid and classical approaches.

Result: The study finds that the Output Reuse (OR) technique shows distinct behavior in hybrid pipelines, Data Reuploading (DR) enhances trainability and stability, and excessive entanglement negatively impacts optimization.

Conclusion: The paper offers a reproducible framework and reveals insights into PQC-based QRL by showing the role and impact of individual pipeline components, providing a pathway for systematic benchmarking and further advancements in the field.

Abstract: Parameterised quantum circuit (PQC) based Quantum Reinforcement Learning (QRL) has emerged as a promising paradigm at the intersection of quantum computing and reinforcement learning (RL). By design, PQCs create hybrid quantum-classical models, but their practical applicability remains uncertain due to training instabilities, barren plateaus (BPs), and the difficulty of isolating the contribution of individual pipeline components. In this work, we dissect PQC based QRL architectures through a systematic experimental evaluation of three aspects recurrently identified as critical: (i) data embedding strategies, with Data Reuploading (DR) as an advanced approach; (ii) ansatz design, particularly the role of entanglement; and (iii) post-processing blocks after quantum measurement, with a focus on the underexplored Output Reuse (OR) technique. Using a unified PPO-CartPole framework, we perform controlled comparisons between hybrid and classical agents under identical conditions. Our results show that OR, though purely classical, exhibits distinct behaviour in hybrid pipelines, that DR improves trainability and stability, and that stronger entanglement can degrade optimisation, offsetting classical gains. Together, these findings provide controlled empirical evidence of the interplay between quantum and classical contributions, and establish a reproducible framework for systematic benchmarking and component-wise analysis in QRL.

### [300] [Intrinsic preservation of plasticity in continual quantum learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17228)
*Yu-Qin Chen,Shi-Xin Zhang*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper presents that quantum learning models can alleviate the limitations of loss of plasticity found in classical deep learning, thereby enabling continual learning in adaptive artificial intelligence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the fundamental issue of loss of plasticity in deep learning, preventing networks from learning new data efficiently in dynamic, real-world environments.

Method: The authors utilized quantum neural networks and analyzed their learning abilities over diverse tasks and data modalities, including supervised and reinforcement learning. They identified the physical constraints of quantum systems as a source of superior performance in retaining learning capability.

Result: Quantum neural networks demonstrated sustained learning capabilities and avoided performance degradation, which was an issue for classical models due to unbounded weight growth causing rugged or saturated optimization landscapes.

Conclusion: Quantum learning models offer a novel advantage in continual learning due to their intrinsic physical constraints, which mitigate the performance issues found in classical deep learning. This highlights quantum computing's potential in building lifelong learners.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence in dynamic, real-world environments requires the capacity for continual learning. However, standard deep learning suffers from a fundamental issue: loss of plasticity, in which networks gradually lose their ability to learn from new data. Here we show that quantum learning models naturally overcome this limitation, preserving plasticity over long timescales. We demonstrate this advantage systematically across a broad spectrum of tasks from multiple learning paradigms, including supervised learning and reinforcement learning, and diverse data modalities, from classical high-dimensional images to quantum-native datasets. Although classical models exhibit performance degradation correlated with unbounded weight and gradient growth, quantum neural networks maintain consistent learning capabilities regardless of the data or task. We identify the origin of the advantage as the intrinsic physical constraints of quantum models. Unlike classical networks where unbounded weight growth leads to landscape ruggedness or saturation, the unitary constraints confine the optimization to a compact manifold. Our results suggest that the utility of quantum computing in machine learning extends beyond potential speedups, offering a robust pathway for building adaptive artificial intelligence and lifelong learners.

### [301] [Quantum Masked Autoencoders for Vision Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17372)
*Emma Andrews,Prabhat Mishra*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper introduces Quantum Masked Autoencoders (QMAEs) to learn missing features in quantum states, demonstrating improved performance over existing quantum autoencoders.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing quantum autoencoders do not address masked data, despite their benefits in quantum feature learning. This paper aims to leverage the advantages of quantum computing for masked data with the novel QMAE design.

Method: The proposed QMAE architecture involves learning masked features from input data within quantum states, and reconstructing masked input images with enhanced visual fidelity.

Result: Experimental results show QMAEs outperform state-of-the-art quantum autoencoders by 12.86% in classification accuracy on masked MNIST image datasets.

Conclusion: QMAEs offer an effective approach for masked data learning in quantum settings, showcasing improved visual reconstruction and accuracy in experimental evaluations.

Abstract: Classical autoencoders are widely used to learn features of input data. To improve the feature learning, classical masked autoencoders extend classical autoencoders to learn the features of the original input sample in the presence of masked-out data. While quantum autoencoders exist, there is no design and implementation of quantum masked autoencoders that can leverage the benefits of quantum computing and quantum autoencoders. In this paper, we propose quantum masked autoencoders (QMAEs) that can effectively learn missing features of a data sample within quantum states instead of classical embeddings. We showcase that our QMAE architecture can learn the masked features of an image and can reconstruct the masked input image with improved visual fidelity in MNIST images. Experimental evaluation highlights that QMAE can significantly outperform (12.86% on average) in classification accuracy compared to state-of-the-art quantum autoencoders in the presence of masks.

### [302] [Is Phase Really Needed for Weakly-Supervised Dereverberation ?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17346)
*Marius Rodrigues,Louis Bahrman,Roland Badeau,Gaël Richard*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper investigates the role of the reverberant phase in speech dereverberation and concludes that it carries limited useful information, leading to improved model performance by excluding it.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To analyze how reverberant (wet) phase impacts the effectiveness of speech dereverberation under unsupervised or weakly supervised settings.

Method: Using Statistical Wave Field Theory, the perturbations of the reverberant phase are studied and models are trained under a weak supervision framework by excluding the phase from the loss function.

Result: The reverberant (wet) phase introduces noise, especially at higher frequencies, and excluding it from training improves dereverberation performance.

Conclusion: The reverberant phase is of limited importance in weakly supervised speech dereverberation models, and excluding it enhances overall performance.

Abstract: In unsupervised or weakly-supervised approaches for speech dereverberation, the target clean (dry) signals are considered to be unknown during training. In that context, evaluating to what extent information can be retrieved from the sole knowledge of reverberant (wet) speech becomes critical. This work investigates the role of the reverberant (wet) phase in the time-frequency domain. Based on Statistical Wave Field Theory, we show that late reverberation perturbs phase components with white, uniformly distributed noise, except at low frequencies. Consequently, the wet phase carries limited useful information and is not essential for weakly supervised dereverberation. To validate this finding, we train dereverberation models under a recent weak supervision framework and demonstrate that performance can be significantly improved by excluding the reverberant phase from the loss function.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address concerns about copyright infringement and reliance on large datasets for generative AI music models, the researchers aim to create an innovative framework that mitigates risks while maintaining quality and accessibility.

Method: They introduce MusicAIR, a multimodal AI framework powered by an algorithm-driven symbolic music core that automatically generates musical features from lyrics and supports text-to-music and image-to-music generation. A web tool, GenAIM, showcases its application.

Result: MusicAIR's generated scores showed high adherence to music theory standards, achieving an average key confidence of 85%, surpassing human composers' performance and demonstrating the system's capability to produce diverse, human-like compositions.

Conclusion: MusicAIR and GenAIM exemplify a reliable assistant for music composition and education. Their approach underscores innovation in AI-generated music and makes music creation accessible to more users.

Abstract: Recent advances in generative AI have made music generation a prominent research focus. However, many neural-based models rely on large datasets, raising concerns about copyright infringement and high-performance costs. In contrast, we propose MusicAIR, an innovative multimodal AI music generation framework powered by a novel algorithm-driven symbolic music core, effectively mitigating copyright infringement risks. The music core algorithms connect critical lyrical and rhythmic information to automatically derive musical features, creating a complete, coherent melodic score solely from the lyrics. The MusicAIR framework facilitates music generation from lyrics, text, and images. The generated score adheres to established principles of music theory, lyrical structure, and rhythmic conventions. We developed Generate AI Music (GenAIM), a web tool using MusicAIR for lyric-to-song, text-to-music, and image-to-music generation. In our experiments, we evaluated AI-generated music scores produced by the system using both standard music metrics and innovative analysis that compares these compositions with original works. The system achieves an average key confidence of 85%, outperforming human composers at 79%, and aligns closely with established music theory standards, demonstrating its ability to generate diverse, human-like compositions. As a co-pilot tool, GenAIM can serve as a reliable music composition assistant and a possible educational composition tutor while simultaneously lowering the entry barrier for all aspiring musicians, which is innovative and significantly contributes to AI for music generation.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: DeMT processes speaker styles for effective music playback across different devices using a unique approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods fail to address diverse playback device properties, limiting music adaptation for various devices.

Method: DeMT uses a vision-language model for extracting speaker embeddings and applies a hybrid transformer for music playback adaptation.

Result: DeMT achieves effective speaker-style transfer and robust few-shot adaptation for unseen devices.

Conclusion: DeMT supports applications like device-style augmentation and playback quality enhancement for varied speaker setups.

Abstract: Device-guided music transfer adapts playback across unseen devices for users who lack them. Existing methods mainly focus on modifying the timbre, rhythm, harmony, or instrumentation to mimic genres or artists, overlooking the diverse hardware properties of the playback device (i.e., speaker). Therefore, we propose DeMT, which processes a speaker's frequency response curve as a line graph using a vision-language model to extract device embeddings. These embeddings then condition a hybrid transformer via feature-wise linear modulation. Fine-tuned on a self-collected dataset, DeMT enables effective speaker-style transfer and robust few-shot adaptation for unseen devices, supporting applications like device-style augmentation and quality enhancement.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: This paper proposes a transformer-based multimodal system for detecting phoneme mispronunciations in Quranic Arabic, using acoustic and textual data integrations to enhance precision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate pronunciation detection in Arabic, especially for Quranic recitations where subtleties matter, remains a challenging aspect requiring advanced multimodal systems.

Method: The researchers use a fusion of UniSpeech acoustic embeddings and BERT-based textual embeddings (from Whisper transcriptions), along with various fusion strategies (early, intermediate, late) evaluated on Arabic phoneme datasets.

Result: The paper reports strong performance of the UniSpeech-BERT multimodal framework, highlighting higher accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics in phoneme-level mispronunciation detection.

Conclusion: Fusion-based transformer architectures can benefit educational applications, particularly for speaker-independent pronunciation training in Quranic recitation and language learning.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal deep learning have greatly enhanced the capability of systems for speech analysis and pronunciation assessment. Accurate pronunciation detection remains a key challenge in Arabic, particularly in the context of Quranic recitation, where subtle phonetic differences can alter meaning. Addressing this challenge, the present study proposes a transformer-based multimodal framework for Arabic phoneme mispronunciation detection that combines acoustic and textual representations to achieve higher precision and robustness. The framework integrates UniSpeech-derived acoustic embeddings with BERT-based textual embeddings extracted from Whisper transcriptions, creating a unified representation that captures both phonetic detail and linguistic context. To determine the most effective integration strategy, early, intermediate, and late fusion methods were implemented and evaluated on two datasets containing 29 Arabic phonemes, including eight hafiz sounds, articulated by 11 native speakers. Additional speech samples collected from publicly available YouTube recordings were incorporated to enhance data diversity and generalization. Model performance was assessed using standard evaluation metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, allowing a detailed comparison of the fusion strategies. Experimental findings show that the UniSpeech-BERT multimodal configuration provides strong results and that fusion-based transformer architectures are effective for phoneme-level mispronunciation detection. The study contributes to the development of intelligent, speaker-independent, and multimodal Computer-Aided Language Learning (CALL) systems, offering a practical step toward technology-supported Quranic pronunciation training and broader speech-based educational applications.

We present an end-to-end pipeline combining automated data cleaning with LLM-driven SQL query generation, deployed on a production system managing 240,000 employee records over six months.
  The system operates in two integrated stages: a multi-stage cleaning pipeline that performs translation normalization, spelling correction, and entity deduplication during periodic synchronization from Microsoft SQL Server to PostgreSQL; and a retrieval-augmented generation framework powered by GPT-4o that translates natural-language questions in Turkish, Russian, and English into validated SQL queries. The query engine employs LangChain orchestration, FAISS vector similarity search, and few-shot learning with 500+ validated examples.
  Our evaluation demonstrates 92.5% query validity, 95.1% schema compliance, and 90.7\% semantic accuracy on 2,847 production queries.

Main category: physics.geo-ph

TL;DR: The paper introduces Diffusion-Inversion-Net (DIN), a novel framework utilizing DDPM for probabilistic inverse modeling in groundwater systems, bypassing traditional iterative simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of traditional multi-stage inversion methods by providing a unified, flexible, and probabilistic approach for inversely modeling groundwater flow and solute transport.

Method: DIN employs a Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) as a prior learner, integrating observational data through conditional mechanisms and applying stochastic sampling to generate posterior parameter fields efficiently.

Result: Experiments show DIN effectively estimates hydraulic-conductivity fields, produces constraint-satisfying realizations, and provides robust uncertainty quantification across various scenarios.

Conclusion: DIN demonstrates strong generalization and offers a reliable, powerful alternative to traditional inversion frameworks for groundwater modeling.

Abstract: We propose the Diffusion-Inversion-Net (DIN) framework for inverse modeling of groundwater flow and solute transport processes. DIN utilizes an offline-trained Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) as a powerful prior leaner, which flexibly incorporates sparse, multi-source observational data, including hydraulic head, solute concentration, and hard conductivity data, through conditional injection mechanisms. These conditioning inputs subsequently guide the generative inversion process during sampling. Bypassing iterative forward simulations, DIN leverages stochastic sampling and probabilistic modeling mechanisms to directly generate ensembles of posterior parameter fields by repeatedly executing the reverse denoising process. Two representative posterior scenarios, Gaussian and non-Gaussian, are investigated. The results demonstrate that DIN can produce multiple constraint-satisfying realizations under identical observational conditions, accurately estimate hydraulic-conductivity fields, and achieve reliable uncertainty quantification. The framework exhibits strong generalization capability across diverse data distributions, offering a robust and unified alternative to conventional multi-stage inversion methodologies.

Motivation: To improve GPU performance for AI inference systems, surpassing the limitations of manual kernel development and traditional model compilers.

Method: Developing a logical framework that utilizes multi-agent systems to optimize PyTorch kernels through exploit-heavy strategies combined with error-fixing agents.

Result: The methods achieve a 2.88x speedup on H100 GPUs when tested on the KernelBench benchmark suite.

Conclusion: Multi-agent systems can effectively tune GPU hardware for AI inference tasks, with specific strategies yielding significant performance improvements.

Abstract: Maximizing performance on available GPU hardware is an ongoing challenge for modern AI inference systems.

Our evaluation shows that exploit-heavy strategies perform best when paired with error-fixing agents, and that performance correlates with the granularity of optimization steps. The best implementation achieves an average 2.88x speedup on an H100 GPU across diverse tasks in KernelBench, a benchmark suite covering a range of machine learning architectures in PyTorch.

TL;DR: Multi-robot systems tackle efficiency challenges in industries like farming. This paper introduces the SABA algorithm for scheduling while addressing payload and battery constraints, outperforming six algorithms in tests.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-robot systems are pivotal for overcoming efficiency and cost issues in labor-intensive industries like smart farming, focusing on optimizing robot fleets under energy and payload constraints.

Method: The paper proposes the Segment Anchoring-Based Balancing Algorithm (SABA), combining sequential anchoring for route reconstruction due to energy constraints and proportional splitting-based rebalancing for fine-tuning schedules.

Result: Extensive experiments show SABA surpasses six state-of-the-art algorithms in solution quality and diversity for multi-robot task allocation under challenging energy constraints.

Conclusion: SABA provides a novel method for handling complex scheduling disruptions in multi-robot systems, offering significant advancements in real-world applications under energy limitations.

Abstract: Multi-robot systems have emerged as a key technology for addressing the efficiency and cost challenges in labor-intensive industries. In the representative scenario of smart farming, planning efficient harvesting schedules for a fleet of electric robots presents a highly challenging frontier problem. The complexity arises not only from the need to find Pareto-optimal solutions for the conflicting objectives of makespan and transportation cost, but also from the necessity to simultaneously manage payload constraints and finite battery capacity. When robot loads are dynamically updated during planned multi-trip operations, a mandatory recharge triggered by energy constraints introduces an unscheduled load reset. This interaction creates a complex cascading effect that disrupts the entire schedule and renders traditional optimization methods ineffective. To address this challenge, this paper proposes the segment anchoring-based balancing algorithm (SABA). The core of SABA lies in the organic combination of two synergistic mechanisms: the sequential anchoring and balancing mechanism, which leverages charging decisions as `anchors' to systematically reconstruct disrupted routes, while the proportional splitting-based rebalancing mechanism is responsible for the fine-grained balancing and tuning of the final solutions' makespans. Extensive comparative experiments, conducted on a real-world case study and a suite of benchmark instances, demonstrate that SABA comprehensively outperforms 6 state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of both solution convergence and diversity. This research provides a novel theoretical perspective and an effective solution for the multi-robot task allocation problem under energy constraints.

*Wei-Cheng Tseng,Xuanru Zhou,Mingyue Huo,Yiwen Shao,Hao Zhang,Dong Yu*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: Audio-language pretraining has potential for generalized audio understanding but trails behind vision-language models like CLIP.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome challenges in adopting audio-language models for general-purpose audio understanding, including limited datasets and insufficient evaluations.

Method: The study introduces the CaptionStew dataset and evaluates audio representation learning through contrasting objectives like contrastive learning and captioning for various audio tasks.

Result: Audio-language pretraining demonstrates competitive, transferable representations. Scalability analysis shows contrastive learning excels with smaller datasets, while captioning performs better for tasks involving language understanding.

Conclusion: Audio-language pretraining is a viable path for universal audio representations. The release of resources aims to accelerate research progress in this domain.

Abstract: Audio-language pretraining holds promise for general-purpose audio understanding, yet remains underexplored compared to its vision counterpart. While vision-language models like CLIP serve as widely adopted foundations, existing audio-language models primarily excel at retrieval tasks with limited adoption as general-purpose encoders. We identify three key barriers: limited large-scale audio-text corpora, insufficient caption diversity, and lack of systematic exploration and evaluation. To this end, we introduce CaptionStew, a 10.7M caption dataset aggregating diverse open-source audio-text corpora across multiple domains and captioning styles. Using this resource, we conduct the first comprehensive evaluation comparing contrastive and captioning objectives for audio representation learning across speech, music, and environmental sound tasks. Our results demonstrate that audio-language pretraining yields competitive, transferable representations. Through systematic data-scaling experiments, we reveal complementary objective strengths: contrastive learning achieves superior data efficiency at smaller scales, while captioning demonstrates better scalability on language-involved audio understanding tasks. We also find that common supervised initialization practices provide diminishing returns at scale, challenging current approaches. These findings establish audio-language pretraining as a viable pathway toward general-purpose audio representations, guiding future research. To accelerate progress, we release data preparation recipes, training protocols, and pretrained models, paving the way toward universal audio understanding.

*Liuyuan Jiang,Quan Xiao,Lisha Chen,Tianyi Chen*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: The paper develops novel penalty reformulation techniques for bilevel optimization (BLO), introducing improved algorithms with better iteration complexity and convergence properties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in existing penalty-based BLO methods, such as high inner-loop complexity, small step sizes, and suboptimal iteration complexity.

Method: Introduces a novel penalty reformulation that decouples variables in BLO problems with coupled constraints and designs two algorithms: ALT-PBGD with larger step size capability and PBGD-Free (a single-loop method). Proposes a new curvature condition for relaxed upper-level requirements.

Result: Demonstrates reduced iteration complexity and improved convergence for BLO optimization. The efficacy is validated in tasks such as hyperparameter optimization and language model fine-tuning.

Conclusion: The proposed methods provide more efficient BLO algorithms with better computational scalability and convergence, enhancing their applicability across various machine learning tasks.

Abstract: Penalty-based methods have become popular for solving bilevel optimization (BLO) problems, thanks to their effective first-order nature. However, they often require inner-loop iterations to solve the lower-level (LL) problem and small outer-loop step sizes to handle the increased smoothness induced by large penalty terms, leading to suboptimal complexity. This work considers the general BLO problems with coupled constraints (CCs) and leverages a novel penalty reformulation that decouples the upper- and lower-level variables. This yields an improved analysis of the smoothness constant, enabling larger step sizes and reduced iteration complexity for Penalty-Based Gradient Descent algorithms in ALTernating fashion (ALT-PBGD). Building on the insight of reduced smoothness, we propose PBGD-Free, a novel fully single-loop algorithm that avoids inner loops for the uncoupled constraint BLO. For BLO with CCs, PBGD-Free employs an efficient inner-loop with substantially reduced iteration complexity. Furthermore, we propose a novel curvature condition describing the "flatness" of the upper-level objective with respect to the LL variable. This condition relaxes the traditional upper-level Lipschitz requirement, enables smaller penalty constant choices, and results in a negligible penalty gradient term during upper-level variable updates. We provide rigorous convergence analysis and validate the method's efficacy through hyperparameter optimization for support vector machines and fine-tuning of large language models.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: This paper presents a generative framework for recovering location labels from sparse CSI measurements without relying on explicit labeling, leveraging embeddings and a diffusion-based generative decoder.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most ML-based methods in wireless systems require large labeled datasets with precise location information, which are expensive and challenging to acquire.

Method: The paper designs a hybrid recurrent-convolutional encoder, dual-scale feature extraction, and places learnable radio maps in the latent space. It uses a diffusion-based generative decoder to reconstruct full CSI from sparse data.

Result: The proposed model improves localization accuracy by over 30% and achieves a 20% capacity gain in NLOS scenarios compared to Kalman filter-based methods.

Conclusion: This approach enables efficient and accurate location label recovery using sparse CSI data, enhancing localization accuracy and performance in challenging wireless environments.

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) has greatly advanced data-driven channel modeling and resource optimization in wireless communication systems. However, most existing ML-based methods rely on large, accurately labeled datasets with location information, which are often difficult and costly to obtain. This paper proposes a generative framework to recover location labels directly from sequences of sparse channel state information (CSI) measurements, without explicit location labels for radio map construction. Instead of directly storing raw CSI, we learn a compact low-dimensional radio map embedding and leverage a generative model to reconstruct the high-dimensional CSI. Specifically, to address the uncertainty of sparse CSI, a dual-scale feature extraction scheme is designed to enhance feature representation by jointly exploiting correlations from angular space and across neighboring samples. We develop a hybrid recurrent-convolutional encoder to learn mobility patterns, which combines a truncation strategy and multi-scale convolutions in the recurrent neural network (RNN) to ensure feature robustness against short-term fluctuations. Unlike conventional Gaussian priors in latent space, we embed a learnable radio map to capture the location information by encoding high-level positional features from CSI measurements. Finally, a diffusion-based generative decoder reconstructs the full CSI with high fidelity by conditioning on the positional features in the radio map. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed model can improve localization accuracy by over 30% and achieve a 20% capacity gain in non-line-of-sight (NLOS) scenarios compared with model-based Kalman filter approaches.

Main category: physics.med-ph

TL;DR: This study evaluates the link between specific MRI descriptors in breast cancer and pCR after neoadjuvant chemotherapy, discovering certain features improve predictive accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to determine if pretreatment MRI features combined with clinical and biological variables can improve models for predicting pathological complete response (pCR) in breast cancer, thereby optimizing personalized treatment strategies.

Method: The study performed a retrospective analysis of pretreatment MRI features using BI-RADS and T2-weighted images, employing logistic regression and random forest classifiers to predict pCR outcomes in 129 breast cancer patients treated with NAC.

Result: Key clinical predictors (e.g., BC subtype and Ki67 levels) and MRI features (e.g., unifocality and non-spiculated margins) were linked to pCR. Including MRI in predictive models improved sensitivity, specificity, and precision compared to clinicobiological factors alone.

Conclusion: Non-spiculated margins and unifocality on pretreatment MRI are independently associated with pCR. Incorporating MRI features into machine learning models enhances the prediction of NAC responses, suggesting a multimodal approach could improve treatment planning.

Abstract: Objectives: To evaluate the association between pretreatment MRI descriptors and breast cancer (BC) pathological complete response (pCR) to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). Materials \& Methods: Patients with BC treated by NAC with a breast MRI between 2016 and 2020 were included in this retrospective observational single-center study. MR studies were described using the standardized BI-RADS and breast edema score on T2-weighted MRI. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to assess variables association with pCR according to residual cancer burden. Random forest classifiers were trained to predict pCR on a random split including 70% of the database and were validated on the remaining cases. Results: Among 129 BC, 59 (46%) achieved pCR after NAC (luminal (n=7/37, 19%), triple negative (TN) (n=30/55, 55%), HER2+ (n=22/37, 59%). Clinical and biological items associated with pCR were BC subtype (p<0.001), T stage 0/I/II (p=0.008), higher Ki67 (p=0.005) and higher tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes levels (p=0.016). Univariate analysis showed that the following MRI features, oval or round shape (p=0.047), unifocality (p=0.026), non-spiculated margins (p=0.018), no associated non-mass enhancement (NME) (p = 0.024) and a lower MRI size (p = 0.031) were significantly associated with pCR. Unifocality and non-spiculated margins remained independently associated with pCR at multivariable analysis. Adding significant MRI features to clinicobiological variables in random forest classifiers significantly increased sensitivity (0.67 versus 0.62), specificity (0.69 versus 0.67) and precision (0.71 versus 0.67) for pCR prediction. Conclusion: Non-spiculated margins and unifocality are independently associated with pCR and can increase models performance to predict BC response to NAC. Clinical Relevance Statement: A multimodal approach integrating pretreatment MRI features with clinicobiological predictors, including TILs, could be employed to develop machine learning models for identifying patients at risk of non-response. This may enable consideration of alternative therapeutic strategies to optimize treatment outcomes

*Prabhat K. Mishra,Mateus V. Gasparino,Girish Chowdhary*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: This paper discusses Deep Model Predictive Control (Deep MPC), where MPC is combined with deep learning to address model uncertainties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enhance the capability of model predictive control by integrating deep learning to handle model uncertainties while ensuring constraints are managed.

Method: The method involves combining a neural network to learn system uncertainties and an MPC controller to handle operational constraints safely during dynamic learning transients.

Result: Numerical experiments on four-wheeled skid-steer dynamics demonstrate that incorrect distribution of control authority can result in poor performance.

Conclusion: The study emphasizes the importance of carefully distributing control authority between neural network and MPC to ensure optimal performance and safe operations.

Abstract: Deep Model Predictive Control (Deep MPC) is an evolving field that integrates model predictive control and deep learning. This manuscript is focused on a particular approach, which employs deep neural network in the loop with MPC. This class of approaches distributes control authority between a neural network and an MPC controller, in such a way that the neural network learns the model uncertainties while the MPC handles constraints. The approach is appealing because training data collected while the system is in operation can be used to fine-tune the neural network, and MPC prevents unsafe behavior during those learning transients. This manuscript explains implementation challenges of Deep MPC, algorithmic way to distribute control authority and argues that a poor choice in distributing control authority may lead to poor performance. A reason of poor performance is explained through a numerical experiment on a four-wheeled skid-steer dynamics.

*Seth Siriya,Jingge Zhu,Dragan Nešić,Ye Pu*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: The paper addresses adaptive control for nonlinear stochastic systems with uncertainty, proposing a strategy with stability bounds and demonstrating high probability stability under specific conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to handle adaptive control challenges for nonlinear stochastic systems with uncertainties efficiently and ensure stability.

Method: A certainty equivalence learning-based adaptive control strategy is proposed, supported by deriving stability bounds.

Result: Under certain conditions, the method achieves stability bounds with probabilities, and if global stability conditions are met, it ensures high probability stability guarantees.

Conclusion: The strategy is effective in stabilizing nonlinear stochastic systems with uncertainties within informative regions and globally under specific assumptions.

Abstract: We consider the adaptive control problem for discrete-time, nonlinear stochastic systems with linearly parameterised uncertainty. Assuming access to a parameterised family of controllers that can stabilise the system in a bounded set within an informative region of the state space when the parameter is well-chosen, we propose a certainty equivalence learning-based adaptive control strategy, and subsequently derive stability bounds on the closed-loop system that hold for some probabilities. We then show that if the entire state space is informative, and the family of controllers is globally stabilising with appropriately chosen parameters, high probability stability guarantees can be derived.

Abstract: We introduce fermionic neural network field theories via Grassmann-valued neural networks. Free theories are obtained by a generalization of the Central Limit Theorem to Grassmann variables. This enables the realization of the free Dirac spinor at infinite width and a four fermion interaction at finite width. Yukawa couplings are introduced by breaking the statistical independence of the output weights for the fermionic and bosonic fields. A large class of interacting supersymmetric quantum mechanics and field theory models are introduced by super-affine transformations on the input that realize a superspace formalism.

Abstract: Chest radiography remains one of the most widely used imaging modalities for thoracic diagnosis, yet increasing imaging volumes and radiologist workload continue to challenge timely interpretation. In this work, we investigate the use of MedImageInsight, a medical imaging foundational model, for automated binary classification of chest X-rays into Normal and Abnormal categories. Two approaches were evaluated: (1) fine-tuning MedImageInsight for end-to-end classification, and (2) employing the model as a feature extractor for a transfer learning pipeline using traditional machine learning classifiers. Experiments were conducted using a combination of the ChestX-ray14 dataset and real-world clinical data sourced from partner hospitals. The fine-tuned classifier achieved the highest performance, with an ROC-AUC of 0.888 and superior calibration compared to the transfer learning models, demonstrating performance comparable to established architectures such as CheXNet. These results highlight the effectiveness of foundational medical imaging models in reducing task-specific training requirements while maintaining diagnostic reliability. The system is designed for integration into web-based and hospital PACS workflows to support triage and reduce radiologist burden. Future work will extend the model to multi-label pathology classification to provide preliminary diagnostic interpretation in clinical environments.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The OmniLens++ framework offers a robust solution for blind lens aberration correction by addressing data scalability and integrating prior guidance on optical degradation. It enhances the capability of lens library pre-training pipelines using novel methodologies like Latent PSF Representation and VQVAE.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The work aims to overcome limitations in data scalability and lack of prior-guided optical degradation metrics in current deep-learning-based lens aberration correction pipelines.

Method: The study improves data scalability by increasing degradation diversity, quantifying spatial-variation patterns, and uniformly sampling training data. It introduces a Latent PSF Representation (LPR) leveraging VQVAE for optical degradation modeling with prior constraints.

Result: The proposed OmniLens++ achieves state-of-the-art generalization in blind aberration correction using real-world and synthetic data. It also demonstrates the scalability of its accompanying AODLibpro and the efficacy of LPR in handling large-scale lens libraries.

Conclusion: OmniLens++ successfully resolves key challenges in blind lens aberration correction, setting a new benchmark for performance and scalability. The framework and datasets are set to be publicly shared to foster further research.

Abstract: Emerging deep-learning-based lens library pre-training (LensLib-PT) pipeline offers a new avenue for blind lens aberration correction by training a universal neural network, demonstrating strong capability in handling diverse unknown optical degradations. This work proposes the OmniLens++ framework, which resolves two challenges that hinder the generalization ability of existing pipelines: the difficulty of scaling data and the absence of prior guidance characterizing optical degradation. To improve data scalability, we expand the design specifications to increase the degradation diversity of the lens source, and we sample a more uniform distribution by quantifying the spatial-variation patterns and severity of optical degradation. In terms of model design, to leverage the Point Spread Functions (PSFs), which intuitively describe optical degradation, as guidance in a blind paradigm, we propose the Latent PSF Representation (LPR). The VQVAE framework is introduced to learn latent features of LensLib's PSFs, which is assisted by modeling the optical degradation process to constrain the learning of degradation priors. Experiments on diverse aberrations of real-world lenses and synthetic LensLib show that OmniLens++ exhibits state-of-the-art generalization capacity in blind aberration correction. Beyond performance, the AODLibpro is verified as a scalable foundation for more effective training across diverse aberrations, and LPR can further tap the potential of large-scale LensLib.

TL;DR: The paper introduces VeilGen, a generative model, and DeVeiler, a restoration network, to address veiling glare and optical aberration issues in compact optical systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issue of veiling glare, compounded by optical aberrations, that degrades imaging performance in compact optical systems.

Method: Develop VeilGen using unsupervised learning and Stable Diffusion-based priors to simulate veiling glare, and DeVeiler as a restoration network trained with reversibility constraints, leveraging latent maps for guided restoration.

Result: Experimental results show improvements in restoration quality and physical fidelity compared to existing methods when tackling the compound degradation.

Conclusion: VeilGen synthesizes realistic veiling glare while its latent maps effectively guide the restoration process, showcasing practical potential in enhancing compact optical systems.

Abstract: Beyond the commonly recognized optical aberrations, the imaging performance of compact optical systems-including single-lens and metalens designs-is often further degraded by veiling glare caused by stray-light scattering from non-ideal optical surfaces and coatings, particularly in complex real-world environments. This compound degradation undermines traditional lens aberration correction yet remains underexplored. A major challenge is that conventional scattering models (e.g., for dehazing) fail to fit veiling glare due to its spatial-varying and depth-independent nature. Consequently, paired high-quality data are difficult to prepare via simulation, hindering application of data-driven veiling glare removal models. To this end, we propose VeilGen, a generative model that learns to simulate veiling glare by estimating its underlying optical transmission and glare maps in an unsupervised manner from target images, regularized by Stable Diffusion (SD)-based priors. VeilGen enables paired dataset generation with realistic compound degradation of optical aberrations and veiling glare, while also providing the estimated latent optical transmission and glare maps to guide the veiling glare removal process. We further introduce DeVeiler, a restoration network trained with a reversibility constraint, which utilizes the predicted latent maps to guide an inverse process of the learned scattering model. Extensive experiments on challenging compact optical systems demonstrate that our approach delivers superior restoration quality and physical fidelity compared with existing methods. These suggest that VeilGen reliably synthesizes realistic veiling glare, and its learned latent maps effectively guide the restoration process in DeVeiler. All code and datasets will be publicly released at https://github.com/XiaolongQian/DeVeiler.

*Andy Wu,Sanjiva K. Lele*

Main category: physics.flu-dyn

TL;DR: The paper identifies the problem of neural networks failing in practical LES applications despite promising initial evaluations and proposes combining training data augmentation and reducing input complexity for improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the significant gap between a priori and a posteriori performance of neural network subgrid stress models in LES.

Method: Training neural networks with augmented datasets using two filters and simplifying the input by eliminating higher-order terms.

Result: Neural networks trained with augmented data perform consistently well in various LES codes, reducing the performance disparity between a priori and a posteriori evaluations.

Conclusion: Combining training data augmentation and reduced input complexity offers a solution for reliable neural network-based subgrid modeling in LES.

Abstract: Neural network subgrid stress models often have a priori performance that is far better than the a posteriori performance, leading to neural network models that look very promising a priori completely failing in a posteriori Large Eddy Simulations (LES). This performance gap can be decreased by combining two different methods, training data augmentation and reducing input complexity to the neural network. Augmenting the training data with two different filters before training the neural networks has no performance degradation a priori as compared to a neural network trained with one filter. A posteriori, neural networks trained with two different filters are far more robust across two different LES codes with different numerical schemes. In addition, by ablating away the higher order terms input into the neural network, the a priori versus a posteriori performance changes become less apparent. When combined, neural networks that use both training data augmentation and a less complex set of inputs have a posteriori performance far more reflective of their a priori evaluation.
