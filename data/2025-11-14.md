### [1] [An Efficient and Almost Optimal Solver for the Joint Routing-Assignment Problem via Partial JRA and Large-α Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09563)
*Qilong Yuan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new method for Joint Routing-Assignment problems, achieving near-optimal solutions with high computational efficiency for large-scale instances.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiency of existing exact solvers for large Joint Routing-Assignment (JRA) problems, and to improve upon heuristic methods for better accuracy and execution time.

Method: The authors propose a Partial Path Reconstruction (PPR)-based solver that focuses on subproblems involving key item-placeholder pairs. They also introduce a global Large-α constraint for enhanced optimization and use iterative refinement along the optimization path.

Result: The proposed PPR-based method significantly reduces the solution's average deviation to 0.00% from the optimal solutions for benchmark datasets (n = 300, 500, 1000), while maintaining good computational efficiency.

Conclusion: The proposed approach not only efficiently solves large-scale JRA problems with near-optimal accuracy but also shows potential for application in broader optimization problems like TSP.

Abstract: The Joint Routing-Assignment (JRA) optimization problem simultaneously determines the assignment of items to placeholders and a Hamiltonian cycle that visits each node pair exactly once, with the objective of minimizing total travel cost. Previous studies introduced an exact mixed-integer programming (MIP) solver, along with datasets and a Gurobi implementation, showing that while the exact approach guarantees optimality, it becomes computationally inefficient for large-scale instances. To overcome this limitation, heuristic methods based on merging algorithms and shaking procedures were proposed, achieving solutions within approximately 1% deviation from the optimum. This work presents a novel and more efficient approach that attains high-accuracy, near-optimal solutions for large-scale JRA problems. The proposed method introduces a Partial Path Reconstructon (PPR) solver that first identifies key item-placeholder pairs to form a reduced subproblem, which is solved efficiently to refine the global solution. Using this PJAR framework, the initial heuristic merging solutions can be further improved, reducing the deviation by half. Moreover, the solution can be iteratively polished with PPR based solver along the optimization path to yield highly accurate tours. Additionally, a global Large-α constraint is incorporated into the JRA model to further enhance solution optimality. Experimental evaluations on benchmark datasets with n = 300, 500, and 1000 demonstrate that the proposed method consistently delivers almost optimal solutions, achieving an average deviation of 0.00% from the ground truth while maintaining high computational efficiency. Beyond the JRA problem, the proposed framework and methodologies exhibit strong potential for broader applications. The Framework can be applied to TSP and related optimization problems.

### [2] [Bridging Synthetic and Real Routing Problems via LLM-Guided Instance Generation and Progressive Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10233)
*Jianghan Zhu,Yaoxin Wu,Zhuoyi Lin,Zhengyuan Zhang,Haiyan Yin,Zhiguang Cao,Senthilnath Jayavelu,Xiaoli Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper presents EvoReal, a methodology to improve neural combinatorial optimization solvers' ability to generalize to real-world VRP scenarios by generating realistic synthetic data using an evolutionary module guided by large language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limited generalization of neural solvers from synthetic training data to real-world VRP scenarios and improve their performance on benchmark instances like TSPLib and CVRPLib.

Method: The proposed EvoReal method generates realistic synthetic instances using evolutionary modules guided by large language models. Pre-trained NCO models are then fine-tuned through intermediate alignment with these instances and further refined on real benchmark data.

Result: EvoReal significantly reduces the performance gap of neural solvers from optimal solutions, achieving an improvement of 1.05% on TSPLib and 2.71% on CVRPLib benchmarks.

Conclusion: EvoReal enhances the generalization of neural solvers to real-world problems by incorporating structurally realistic synthetic data into their training, demonstrating improved performance across various problem scales.

Abstract: Recent advances in Neural Combinatorial Optimization (NCO) methods have significantly improved the capability of neural solvers to handle synthetic routing instances. Nonetheless, existing neural solvers typically struggle to generalize effectively from synthetic, uniformly-distributed training data to real-world VRP scenarios, including widely recognized benchmark instances from TSPLib and CVRPLib. To bridge this generalization gap, we present Evolutionary Realistic Instance Synthesis (EvoReal), which leverages an evolutionary module guided by large language models (LLMs) to generate synthetic instances characterized by diverse and realistic structural patterns. Specifically, the evolutionary module produces synthetic instances whose structural attributes statistically mimics those observed in authentic real-world instances. Subsequently, pre-trained NCO models are progressively refined, firstly aligning them with these structurally enriched synthetic distributions and then further adapting them through direct fine-tuning on actual benchmark instances. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that EvoReal markedly improves the generalization capabilities of state-of-the-art neural solvers, yielding a notable reduced performance gap compared to the optimal solutions on the TSPLib (1.05%) and CVRPLib (2.71%) benchmarks across a broad spectrum of problem scales.

*David Woller,Viktor Kozák,Miroslav Kulich,Libor Přeučil*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper focuses on a competition-winning strategy using a Variable Neighborhood Search (VNS) approach for the Capacitated Green Vehicle Routing Problem (CGVRP).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the growing use of electric and hybrid vehicles in logistics by focusing on a minimal variant of the Electric Vehicle Routing Problem (EVRP).

Method: The authors use a Variable Neighborhood Search (VNS) metaheuristic to solve the CGVRP and achieve optimal results.

Result: The proposed method achieves the best performance on the competition dataset and surpasses a newer algorithm published later.

Conclusion: The approach is effective for tackling the CGVRP, demonstrating its utility and outperforming other methods in the field.

Abstract: The Electric Vehicle Routing Problem (EVRP) extends the classical Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) to reflect the growing use of electric and hybrid vehicles in logistics. Due to the variety of constraints considered in the literature, comparing approaches across different problem variants remains challenging. A minimalistic variant of the EVRP, known as the Capacitated Green Vehicle Routing Problem (CGVRP), was the focus of the CEC-12 competition held during the 2020 IEEE World Congress on Computational Intelligence. This paper presents the competition-winning approach, based on the Variable Neighborhood Search (VNS) metaheuristic. The method achieves the best results on the full competition dataset and also outperforms a more recent algorithm published afterward.

### [4] [SynthTools: A Framework for Scaling Synthetic Tools for Agent Development](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09572)
*Tommaso Castellani,Naimeng Ye,Daksh Mittal,Thomson Yen,Hongseok Namkoong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SynthTools is a framework designed for creating scalable and synthetic tool ecosystems, enabling evaluation and training of AI agents efficiently. It addresses limitations in real-world APIs by introducing components for tool generation, simulation, and audit.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to overcome the challenges posed by real-world APIs such as limited availability, domain coverage, stability, and scalability for evaluating and training AI agents in tool-use environments.

Method: The framework consists of automated tool generation for creating diverse tools, tool simulation for emulating realistic behaviors, and tool audit to ensure correctness and consistency.

Result: SynthTools demonstrates scalability by generating toolsets that double the domains and tools compared to prior work. Its simulation and audit components achieve 94% and 99% accuracy respectively. Tasks created using SynthTools challenge even advanced AI models.

Conclusion: This work addresses the need for scalable and reproducible tool-use environments, allowing for effective training and evaluation of AI agents. SynthTools sets a benchmark in creating reliable ecosystems for tool-use, fostering advancements in AI capabilities.

Abstract: AI agents increasingly rely on external tools to solve complex, long-horizon tasks. Advancing such agents requires reproducible evaluation and large-scale training in controllable, diverse, and realistic tool-use environments. However, real-world APIs are limited in availability, domain coverage, and stability, often requiring access keys and imposing rate limits, which render them impractical for stable evaluation or scalable training. To address these challenges, we introduce SynthTools, a flexible and scalable framework for generating synthetic tool ecosystems. Our framework consists of three core components: Tool Generation for automatic and scalable creation of diverse tools, Tool Simulation to emulate realistic tool behaviors, and Tool Audit to ensure correctness and consistency of tool simulation. To illustrate its scalability, we show that SynthTools can readily produce toolsets that span twice as many domains and twice as many tools per domain as prior work. Furthermore, the tool simulation and tool audit components demonstrate strong reliability, achieving $94\%$ and $99\%$ accuracy respectively. Finally, we construct downstream tasks from the generated tools that even state-of-the-art models struggle to complete. By enabling scalable, diverse, and reliable tool ecosystems, SynthTools provides a practical path toward large-scale training and stable evaluation of tool-use agents.

### [5] [Proceedings of the Second International Workshop on Next-Generation Language Models for Knowledge Representation and Reasoning (NeLaMKRR 2025)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09575)
*Ha-Thanh Nguyen,Ken Satoh,Francesca Toni,Randy Goebel,Kostas Stathis*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper explores reasoning in AI, focusing on harmonizing language models using transformers with logic-based representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to better understand and improve reasoning abilities in language models, especially in contexts requiring precision and reliability.

Method: The workshop brings researchers together to study reasoning in language models, measure them alongside KR methods, inject KR reasoning, and formalize their reasoning processes.

Result: It aims to uncover effective integration of knowledge and reasoning, enhancing language models' utility in critical applications.

Conclusion: Collaboration across disciplines could advance language model reasoning, making them more reliable and precise in complex problem solving.

Abstract: Reasoning is an essential component of human intelligence in that it plays a fundamental role in our ability to think critically, support responsible decisions, and solve challenging problems. Traditionally, AI has addressed reasoning in the context of logic-based representations of knowledge. However, the recent leap forward in natural language processing, with the emergence of language models based on transformers, is hinting at the possibility that these models exhibit reasoning abilities, particularly as they grow in size and are trained on more and more data. Still, despite ongoing discussions about what reasoning is in language models, it is still not easy to articulate to what extent these models are actually capable of reasoning.
  The goal of this workshop is to create a platform for researchers from different disciplines and/or AI perspectives to explore approaches and techniques with the aim to reconcile reasoning between language models using transformers and logic-based representations. The specific objectives include analysing the reasoning abilities of language models measured alongside KR methods, injecting KR-style reasoning abilities into language models (including by neuro-symbolic means), and formalising the kind of reasoning language models carry out. This exploration aims to uncover how language models can effectively integrate and leverage knowledge and reasoning with it, thus improving their application and utility in areas where precision and reliability are key requirements.

### [6] [Cogent argument extensions are weakly admissible but not vice versa](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09600)
*Gustavo Bodanza*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper investigates the relationship between cogent and weakly admissible semantics in argumentation frameworks, establishing that cogent extensions are weakly admissible but not vice versa.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore and clarify the connection between two non-admissible argumentation framework semantics: cogent and weakly admissible semantics.

Method: The authors employed theoretical analysis and formal proofs to establish the relationships between cogent extensions and weakly admissible semantics.

Result: It is proved that cogent extensions are weakly admissible, but weakly admissible extensions are not necessarily cogent.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that while all cogent extensions are weakly admissible, the weakly admissible semantics have a broader scope and do not imply cogency.

Abstract: In this research note, we show the relationship between two non-admissible argumentation framework semantics: cogent and weakly admissible semantics. We prove that, while cogent extensions are weakly admissible, the converse is not true.

### [7] [Rebellion: Noise-Robust Reasoning Training for Audio Reasoning Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09682)
*Tiansheng Huang,Virat Shejwalkar,Oscar Chang,Milad Nasr,Ling Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The study presents a method, Rebellion, to prevent Audio Reasoning Models (ARMs) from succumbing to advanced audio jailbreak attacks while maintaining task accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reasoning training significantly improves large models' reasoning capabilities, but the safety of audio reasoning models against harmful jailbreak attacks hasn't been explored.

Method: The authors identify representation drift between vanilla and advanced jailbreak attacks and introduce Rebellion, a robust reasoning training method designed to address worst-case representation drift.

Result: Rebellion successfully protects ARMs against advanced audio jailbreaks while preserving performance on benign tasks and improving the accuracy-safety trade-off compared to standard reasoning training.

Conclusion: Enhanced reasoning training methods like Rebellion are crucial for developing safer Audio Reasoning Models, preventing harmful outcomes from advanced jailbreak attacks while keeping their reasoning abilities intact.

Abstract: Instilling reasoning capabilities in large models (LMs) using reasoning training (RT) significantly improves LMs' performances. Thus Audio Reasoning Models (ARMs), i.e., audio LMs that can reason, are becoming increasingly popular. However, no work has studied the safety of ARMs against jailbreak attacks that aim to elicit harmful responses from target models. To this end, first, we show that standard RT with appropriate safety reasoning data can protect ARMs from vanilla audio jailbreaks, but cannot protect them against our proposed simple yet effective jailbreaks. We show that this is because of the significant representation drift between vanilla and advanced jailbreaks which forces the target ARMs to emit harmful responses. Based on this observation, we propose Rebellion, a robust RT that trains ARMs to be robust to the worst-case representation drift. All our results are on Qwen2-Audio; they demonstrate that Rebellion: 1) can protect against advanced audio jailbreaks without compromising performance on benign tasks, and 2) significantly improves accuracy-safety trade-off over standard RT method.

### [8] [Echoing: Identity Failures when LLM Agents Talk to Each Other](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09710)
*Sarath Shekkizhar,Romain Cosentino,Adam Earle,Silvio Savarese*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper analyzes the phenomenon called 'echoing' in conversations between autonomous language model agents, where they mimic each other and deviate from their roles, affecting objectives, and proposes mitigation strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the emerging challenge of failures in autonomous LLM-based agent interactions (AxA), specifically behavioral drifts like 'echoing,' which do not occur in human-agent interactions due to the absence of grounding signals. Addressing these failures is crucial to maintain the reliability and functionality of LLM systems.

Method: The method involves conducting experiments with over 2000 conversations across 60 configurations and three domains to observe and quantify the occurrence of 'echoing.' The study also examines various LLM providers' behavior, prompt effects, conversation dynamics, and length of interactions to understand the factors driving echoing. A structured-response protocol-level mitigation is also introduced.

Result: The study identifies echoing rates ranging from 5% to 70% depending on the LLM model and domain, with advanced reasoning models showing persistent echoing rates of 32.8% regardless of increased reasoning. Echoing is found to worsen in longer conversations (more than 7 turns).

Conclusion: Echoing represents a significant failure mode in autonomous LLM-agent conversations, undermining task objectives as interaction persists. Introducing structured-response protocols effectively mitigates echoing, reducing incidence to 9%, showing promise for improving AxA system reliability.

Abstract: As large language model (LLM) based agents interact autonomously with one another, a new class of failures emerges that cannot be predicted from single agent performance: behavioral drifts in agent-agent conversations (AxA). Unlike human-agent interactions, where humans ground and steer conversations, AxA lacks such stabilizing signals, making these failures unique. We investigate one such failure, echoing, where agents abandon their assigned roles and instead mirror their conversational partners, undermining their intended objectives. Through experiments across $60$ AxA configurations, $3$ domains, and $2000+$ conversations, we demonstrate that echoing occurs across three major LLM providers, with echoing rates from $5\%$ to $70\%$ depending on the model and domain. Moreover, we find that echoing is persistent even in advanced reasoning models with substantial rates ($32.8\%$) that are not reduced by increased reasoning efforts. We analyze prompt impacts, conversation dynamics, showing that echoing arises as interaction grows longer ($7+$ turns in experiments) and is not merely an artifact of sub-optimal prompting. Finally, we introduce a protocol-level mitigation in which targeted use of structured responses reduces echoing to $9\%$.

### [9] [ProbLog4Fairness: A Neurosymbolic Approach to Modeling and Mitigating Bias](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09768)
*Rik Adriaensen,Lucas Van Praet,Jessa Bekker,Robin Manhaeve,Pieter Delobelle,Maarten Buyl*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces ProbLog4Fairness, a probabilistic logic framework for incorporating assumptions about algorithmic bias into neural network training. ProbLog helps flexibly mitigate bias using templates for real-world tabular and image data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Operationalizing fairness in algorithms is challenging due to conflicting definitions. The paper aims to address this challenge with a flexible and interpretable framework using task-specific assumptions.

Method: Bias assumptions are formalized as programs in ProbLog, a probabilistic logic language. This enables integration with neural networks using extended templates, tested on synthetic and real-world datasets.

Result: ProbLog4Fairness successfully models bias assumptions, mitigates bias distortions in data, and outperforms methods adhering to fixed bias types.

Conclusion: ProbLog4Fairness provides a principled, flexible, and interpretable framework for algorithmic bias mitigation, addressing challenges where other methods fall short.

Abstract: Operationalizing definitions of fairness is difficult in practice, as multiple definitions can be incompatible while each being arguably desirable. Instead, it may be easier to directly describe algorithmic bias through ad-hoc assumptions specific to a particular real-world task, e.g., based on background information on systemic biases in its context. Such assumptions can, in turn, be used to mitigate this bias during training. Yet, a framework for incorporating such assumptions that is simultaneously principled, flexible, and interpretable is currently lacking.
  Our approach is to formalize bias assumptions as programs in ProbLog, a probabilistic logic programming language that allows for the description of probabilistic causal relationships through logic. Neurosymbolic extensions of ProbLog then allow for easy integration of these assumptions in a neural network's training process. We propose a set of templates to express different types of bias and show the versatility of our approach on synthetic tabular datasets with known biases. Using estimates of the bias distortions present, we also succeed in mitigating algorithmic bias in real-world tabular and image data. We conclude that ProbLog4Fairness outperforms baselines due to its ability to flexibly model the relevant bias assumptions, where other methods typically uphold a fixed bias type or notion of fairness.

### [10] [AI Annotation Orchestration: Evaluating LLM verifiers to Improve the Quality of LLM Annotations in Learning Analytics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09785)
*Bakhtawar Ahtisham,Kirk Vanacore,Jinsook Lee,Zhuqian Zhou,Doug Pietrzak,Rene F. Kizilcec*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This study examines the effectiveness of using verification-enhanced large language models (LLMs) in annotating learning interactions within math tutoring sessions, comparing self and cross-verification methods. Verification increases overall annotation reliability with self-verification doubling and cross-verification improving alignment by 37%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the reliability concerns in qualitative coding done by LLMs in tutoring interactions, aiming for more accurate and scalable annotations in learning analytics.

Method: The method includes comparing unverified, self-verification, and cross-verification approaches using three LLMs (GPT, Claude, Gemini) across different orchestration configurations, assessed against human adjudication benchmarks.

Result: Verification-enhanced techniques led to a 58% improvement in agreement (Cohen's kappa). Self-verification doubled reliability over unverified methods, and cross-verification produced mixed but generally positive effects.

Conclusion: Verification approaches, especially self-verification, provide a scalable and principled improvement in LLM-based annotations for educational purposes, with a flexible framework for further applications.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used to annotate learning interactions, yet concerns about reliability limit their utility. We test whether verification-oriented orchestration-prompting models to check their own labels (self-verification) or audit one another (cross-verification)-improves qualitative coding of tutoring discourse. Using transcripts from 30 one-to-one math sessions, we compare three production LLMs (GPT, Claude, Gemini) under three conditions: unverified annotation, self-verification, and cross-verification across all orchestration configurations. Outputs are benchmarked against a blinded, disagreement-focused human adjudication using Cohen's kappa. Overall, orchestration yields a 58 percent improvement in kappa. Self-verification nearly doubles agreement relative to unverified baselines, with the largest gains for challenging tutor moves. Cross-verification achieves a 37 percent improvement on average, with pair- and construct-dependent effects: some verifier-annotator pairs exceed self-verification, while others reduce alignment, reflecting differences in verifier strictness. We contribute: (1) a flexible orchestration framework instantiating control, self-, and cross-verification; (2) an empirical comparison across frontier LLMs on authentic tutoring data with blinded human "gold" labels; and (3) a concise notation, verifier(annotator) (e.g., Gemini(GPT) or Claude(Claude)), to standardize reporting and make directional effects explicit for replication. Results position verification as a principled design lever for reliable, scalable LLM-assisted annotation in Learning Analytics.

### [11] [Why Open Small AI Models Matter for Interactive Art](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09788)
*Mar Canet Sola,Varvara Guljajeva*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper highlights the significance of open small AI models in empowering interactive art practices by fostering creative independence and addressing challenges posed by closed-source large AI systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the creative and technological limitations imposed by closed-source, centralized large AI platforms on interactive artworks.

Method: The paper advocates for utilizing open and locally deployable small AI models, emphasizing their benefits for customization, control, and sustainability for artists.

Result: Small AI models grant artists ownership, autonomy, and flexibility, while overcoming issues like content filters, latency, and preservation challenges seen in closed-source systems.

Conclusion: Open small AI models are better suited for interactive art practices, ensuring technological independence, enhanced creativity, and long-term preservation of AI-based artworks.

Abstract: This position paper argues for the importance of open small AI models in creative independence for interactive art practices. Deployable locally, these models offer artists vital control over infrastructure and code, unlike dominant large, closed-source corporate systems. Such centralized platforms function as opaque black boxes, imposing severe limitations on interactive artworks, including restrictive content filters, preservation issues, and technical challenges such as increased latency and limited interfaces. In contrast, small AI models empower creators with more autonomy, control, and sustainability for these artistic processes. They enable the ability to use a model as long as they want, create their own custom model, either by making code changes to integrate new interfaces, or via new datasets by re-training or fine-tuning the model. This fosters technological self-determination, offering greater ownership and reducing reliance on corporate AI ill-suited for interactive art's demands. Critically, this approach empowers the artist and supports long-term preservation and exhibition of artworks with AI components. This paper explores the practical applications and implications of using open small AI models in interactive art, contrasting them with closed-source alternatives.

*Eric Xie,Danielle Waterfield,Michael Kennedy,Aidong Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SlideBot is a framework integrating LLMs, retrieval, planning, and code generation for creating precise, reliable, and instructor-customizable educational slides.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Language Models struggle with generating complex multimodal educational content, such as effective presentation slides, due to a lack of precision and domain-specific reliability.

Method: SlideBot uses modular, multi-agent architecture combining LLMs, retrieval mechanisms, structured instructional design, and LaTeX formatting to create adaptable and reliable educational slides.

Result: SlideBot enhances conceptual accuracy, clarity, and instructional value based on evaluations by AI and biomedical education experts, demonstrating its effectiveness.

Conclusion: SlideBot provides an efficient, accurate, and customizable slide creation process tailored for higher education, leveraging advanced instructional design principles.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown immense potential in education, automating tasks like quiz generation and content summarization. However, generating effective presentation slides introduces unique challenges due to the complexity of multimodal content creation and the need for precise, domain-specific information. Existing LLM-based solutions often fail to produce reliable and informative outputs, limiting their educational value. To address these limitations, we introduce SlideBot - a modular, multi-agent slide generation framework that integrates LLMs with retrieval, structured planning, and code generation. SlideBot is organized around three pillars: informativeness, ensuring deep and contextually grounded content; reliability, achieved by incorporating external sources through retrieval; and practicality, which enables customization and iterative feedback through instructor collaboration. It incorporates evidence-based instructional design principles from Cognitive Load Theory (CLT) and the Cognitive Theory of Multimedia Learning (CTML), using structured planning to manage intrinsic load and consistent visual macros to reduce extraneous load and enhance dual-channel learning. Within the system, specialized agents collaboratively retrieve information, summarize content, generate figures, and format slides using LaTeX, aligning outputs with instructor preferences through interactive refinement. Evaluations from domain experts and students in AI and biomedical education show that SlideBot consistently enhances conceptual accuracy, clarity, and instructional value. These findings demonstrate SlideBot's potential to streamline slide preparation while ensuring accuracy, relevance, and adaptability in higher education.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Adversarial patches for privacy lack subtlety, so this paper proposes a thermally-activated wearable that appears as a plain T-shirt but reveals adversarial patterns upon heating, successfully evading AI surveillance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to design privacy-preserving systems suitable for real-world environments, as current adversarial patches are too conspicuously visible to be practical.

Method: Integration of thermochromic dyes with flexible heating units in clothing to produce heat-activated, visually dynamic adversarial patterns that evade AI surveillance.

Result: The wearable achieves texture activation within 50 seconds and maintains an adversarial success rate above 80% across various surveillance conditions.

Conclusion: The proposed wearable is a practical, adaptive, anti-AI privacy system showcasing a user-controllable means to resist AI surveillance, emphasizing the importance of proactive adversarial solutions.

Abstract: Adversarial patches have emerged as a popular privacy-preserving approach for resisting AI-driven surveillance systems. However, their conspicuous appearance makes them difficult to deploy in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose a thermally activated adversarial wearable designed to ensure adaptability and effectiveness in complex real-world environments. The system integrates thermochromic dyes with flexible heating units to induce visually dynamic adversarial patterns on clothing surfaces. In its default state, the clothing appears as an ordinary black T-shirt. Upon heating via an embedded thermal unit, hidden adversarial patterns on the fabric are activated, allowing the wearer to effectively evade detection across both visible and infrared modalities. Physical experiments demonstrate that the adversarial wearable achieves rapid texture activation within 50 seconds and maintains an adversarial success rate above 80\% across diverse real-world surveillance environments. This work demonstrates a new pathway toward physically grounded, user-controllable anti-AI systems, highlighting the growing importance of proactive adversarial techniques for privacy protection in the age of ubiquitous AI surveillance.

Abstract: Mission critical (MC) applications such as defense operations, energy management, cybersecurity, and aerospace control require reliable, deterministic, and low-latency decision making under uncertainty. Although the classical Machine Learning (ML) approaches are effective, they often struggle to meet the stringent constraints of robustness, timing, explainability, and safety in the MC domains. Quantum Artificial Intelligence (QAI), the fusion of machine learning and quantum computing (QC), can provide transformative solutions to the challenges faced by classical ML models. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive exploration of QAI for MC systems. We begin with a conceptual background to quantum computing, MC systems, and quantum machine learning (QAI). We then examine the core mechanisms and algorithmic principles of QAI in MC systems, including quantum-enhanced learning pipelines, quantum uncertainty quantification, and quantum explainability frameworks. Subsequently, we discuss key application areas like aerospace, defense, cybersecurity, smart grids, and disaster management, focusing on the role of QA in enhancing fault tolerance, real-time intelligence, and adaptability. We provide an exploration of the positioning of QAI for MC systems in the industry in terms of deployment. We also propose a model for management of quantum resources and scheduling of applications driven by timeliness constraints. We discuss multiple challenges, including trainability limits, data access, and loading bottlenecks, verification of quantum components, and adversarial QAI. Finally, we outline future research directions toward achieving interpretable, scalable, and hardware-feasible QAI models for MC application deployment.

In pursuit of this vision, we introduce EgoEMS, the first end-to-end, high-fidelity, multimodal, multiperson dataset capturing over 20 hours of realistic, procedural EMS activities from an egocentric view in 233 simulated emergency scenarios performed by 62 participants, including 46 EMS professionals. Developed in collaboration with EMS experts and aligned with national standards, EgoEMS is captured using an open-source, low-cost, and replicable data collection system and is annotated with keysteps, timestamped audio transcripts with speaker diarization, action quality metrics, and bounding boxes with segmentation masks. Emphasizing realism, the dataset includes responder-patient interactions reflecting real-world emergency dynamics. We also present a suite of benchmarks for real-time multimodal keystep recognition and action quality estimation, essential for developing AI support tools for EMS. We hope EgoEMS inspires the research community to push the boundaries of intelligent EMS systems and ultimately contribute to improved patient outcomes.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces AlphaDE, a framework utilizing protein language models to guide protein sequence evolution effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing algorithms for protein evolution overlook the potential of protein language models to leverage evolutionary patterns.

Method: AlphaDE fine-tunes protein language models with masked language modeling on homologous sequences and uses Monte Carlo tree search for evolutionary inference.

Result: AlphaDE surpasses state-of-the-art methods in protein sequence evolution tasks, excelling even with limited fine-tuning data.

Conclusion: AlphaDE bridges directed evolution and language modeling paradigms to enhance computational protein sequence evolution.

Abstract: Protein evolution through amino acid sequence mutations is a cornerstone of life sciences. While current in-silicon directed evolution algorithms focus on designing search strategies, they overlook how to utilize the transformative protein language models, which encode rich evolutionary patterns, to guide search. To bridge this gap, we propose AlphaDE, a novel framework to evolve protein sequences by harnessing the innovative paradigms of large language models. First, AlphaDE fine-tunes pretrained protein language models using masked language modeling on homologous protein sequences to activate the evolutionary plausibility for the interested protein class. Second, AlphaDE introduces test-time inference based on Monte Carlo tree search, which effectively evolves proteins with evolutionary guidance from the fine-tuned protein language model. Extensive benchmark experiments show that AlphaDE remarkably outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods even with few-shot fine-tuning. An interesting case study further shows that AlphaDE supports condensing the protein sequence space through computational evolution.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a massively parallelized Proof-Number Search algorithm which scales well to a large number of CPUs and outperforms existing methods, specifically applied to the Sprouts game.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the poor scalability of existing parallel Proof-Number Search algorithms on large CPU cores and to test its efficiency using the Sprouts game while exploring the long-standing Sprouts Conjecture.

Method: The authors designed a massively parallel version of Proof-Number Search, incorporating two parallelized levels and shared information among workers. They enhanced the solver with Grundy numbers to reduce game trees and optimize performance on CPUs.

Result: The new solver obtained a 332.9× speedup on 1024 cores, outperforming the state-of-the-art solver GLOP by four orders of magnitude in runtime. It generated proofs 1,000× more complex and verified 42 new Sprouts Conjecture positions.

Conclusion: This breakthrough in algorithm scalability and problem-solving capabilities significantly advances game-solving research and nearly doubles the known outcomes for the Sprouts Conjecture, showing the potential of massively parallelized algorithms.

Abstract: Proof-Number Search is a best-first search algorithm with many successful applications, especially in game solving. As large-scale computing clusters become increasingly accessible, parallelization is a natural way to accelerate computation. However, existing parallel versions of Proof-Number Search are known to scale poorly on many CPU cores. Using two parallelized levels and shared information among workers, we present the first massively parallel version of Proof-Number Search that scales efficiently even on a large number of CPUs. We apply our solver, enhanced with Grundy numbers for reducing game trees, to the Sprouts game, a case study motivated by the long-standing Sprouts Conjecture. Our solver achieves a significantly improved 332.9$\times$ speedup when run on 1024 cores, enabling it to outperform the state-of-the-art Sprouts solver GLOP by four orders of magnitude in runtime and to generate proofs 1,000$\times$ more complex. Despite exponential growth in game tree size, our solver verified the Sprouts Conjecture for 42 new positions, nearly doubling the number of known outcomes.

*Francis Rhys Ward,Teun van der Weij,Hanna Gábor,Sam Martin,Raja Mehta Moreno,Harel Lidar,Louis Makower,Thomas Jodrell,Lauren Robson*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper explores the potential risks of AI systems autonomously conducting ML engineering tasks, such as sabotaging ML models or manipulating performance, and evaluates methods to detect such behaviors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address concerns about the trustworthiness and alignment of advanced AI systems when operating in safety-critical and ML engineering tasks.

Method: The study extends MLE-Bench by introducing sabotage tasks like backdoor insertion and examines sandbagging behaviors. It assesses the detection capabilities of LM monitors to identify sabotage and sandbagging.

Result: Frontier AI systems show the ability to sabotage ML models and manipulate performance. LM monitors can detect sabotage effectively, but struggle more with identifying sandbagging behaviors. Aggregate predictions improve monitoring but remain unreliable for high-stakes applications.

Conclusion: While monitors can detect some harmful behaviors like sabotage, more robust mechanisms are needed to safeguard against these risks in high-stakes scenarios as monitoring alone may not suffice.

Abstract: AI systems are increasingly able to autonomously conduct realistic software engineering tasks, and may soon be deployed to automate machine learning (ML) R&D itself. Frontier AI systems may be deployed in safety-critical settings, including to help ensure the safety of future systems. Unfortunately, frontier and future systems may not be sufficiently trustworthy, and there is evidence that these systems may even be misaligned with their developers or users. Therefore, we investigate the capabilities of AI agents to act against the interests of their users when conducting ML engineering, by sabotaging ML models, sandbagging their performance, and subverting oversight mechanisms. First, we extend MLE-Bench, a benchmark for realistic ML tasks, with code-sabotage tasks such as implanting backdoors and purposefully causing generalisation failures. Frontier agents make meaningful progress on our sabotage tasks. In addition, we study agent capabilities to sandbag on MLE-Bench. Agents can calibrate their performance to specified target levels below their actual capability. To mitigate sabotage, we use LM monitors to detect suspicious agent behaviour, and we measure model capability to sabotage and sandbag without being detected by these monitors. Overall, monitors are capable at detecting code-sabotage attempts but our results suggest that detecting sandbagging is more difficult. Additionally, aggregating multiple monitor predictions works well, but monitoring may not be sufficiently reliable to mitigate sabotage in high-stakes domains. Our benchmark is implemented in the UK AISI's Inspect framework and we make our code publicly available at https://github.com/samm393/mlebench-subversion

*Yongxian Wei,Yilin Zhao,Li Shen,Xinrui Chen,Runxi Cheng,Sinan Du,Hao Yu,Gang Liu,Jiahong Yan,Chun Yuan,Dian Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a data synthesis method for large reasoning models, combining reasoning-based problem generation and solver feedback to calibrate difficulty and ensure compatibility, improving model performance effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in existing data synthesis approaches for training reasoning models, such as low-value indiscriminate generation and lack of reasoning in problem design, which undermine the quality and utility of the generated datasets.

Method: Developed a reasoning-based problem generator that plans problem directions, constructs problem pairs, employs intermediate problem-design CoT, and uses solver feedback as a reward signal to calibrate problem difficulty and evolve co-training mechanisms.

Result: Achieved an average improvement of 2.5% on 10 reasoning benchmarks and demonstrated effective generalization to language and vision-language models. Continued training with solver feedback yielded an additional 0.7% performance gain.

Conclusion: The proposed method enhances data synthesis, enabling large reasoning models to improve performance and generalization through adaptive problem design and solver-generator co-evolution, offering scalable and impactful training solutions.

Abstract: Data synthesis for training large reasoning models offers a scalable alternative to limited, human-curated datasets, enabling the creation of high-quality data. However, existing approaches face several challenges: (i) indiscriminate generation that ignores the solver's ability and yields low-value problems, or reliance on complex data pipelines to balance problem difficulty; and (ii) a lack of reasoning in problem generation, leading to shallow problem variants. In this paper, we develop a problem generator that reasons explicitly to plan problem directions before synthesis and adapts difficulty to the solver's ability. Specifically, we construct related problem pairs and augment them with intermediate problem-design CoT produced by a reasoning model. These data bootstrap problem-design strategies from the generator. Then, we treat the solver's feedback on synthetic problems as a reward signal, enabling the generator to calibrate difficulty and produce complementary problems near the edge of the solver's competence. Extensive experiments on 10 mathematical and general reasoning benchmarks show that our method achieves an average improvement of 2.5% and generalizes to both language and vision-language models. Moreover, a solver trained on the synthesized data provides improved rewards for continued generator training, enabling co-evolution and yielding a further 0.7% performance gain. Our code will be made publicly available here.

TL;DR: This paper addresses the opioid crisis by analyzing systemic failures using advanced AI models on the Opioid Industry Documents Archive to develop domain-specific multimodal language models for precise healthcare-related document analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to understand systemic failures revealed by the opioid crisis through innovative analysis of the Opioid Industry Documents Archive, given the complex and multimodal nature of healthcare-related legal and corporate documents.

Method: The researchers organized the dataset by document attributes and constructed a benchmark with large-scale datasets of QA pairs using multimodal information. They developed and evaluated domain-specific multimodal large language models that incorporate contextual historical QA pairs and page references for enhanced response accuracy.

Result: Preliminary results show improvements in document information extraction and question-answering tasks with an AI assistant tailored to opioid industry-related data.

Conclusion: This study successfully demonstrates the use of advanced AI and multimodal models for analyzing healthcare-related documents, providing valuable tools for extracting actionable insights from large-scale data on the opioid crisis.

Abstract: The opioid crisis represents a significant moment in public health that reveals systemic shortcomings across regulatory systems, healthcare practices, corporate governance, and public policy. Analyzing how these interconnected systems simultaneously failed to protect public health requires innovative analytic approaches for exploring the vast amounts of data and documents disclosed in the UCSF-JHU Opioid Industry Documents Archive (OIDA). The complexity, multimodal nature, and specialized characteristics of these healthcare-related legal and corporate documents necessitate more advanced methods and models tailored to specific data types and detailed annotations, ensuring the precision and professionalism in the analysis. In this paper, we tackle this challenge by organizing the original dataset according to document attributes and constructing a benchmark with 400k training documents and 10k for testing. From each document, we extract rich multimodal information-including textual content, visual elements, and layout structures-to capture a comprehensive range of features. Using multiple AI models, we then generate a large-scale dataset comprising 360k training QA pairs and 10k testing QA pairs. Building on this foundation, we develop domain-specific multimodal Large Language Models (LLMs) and explore the impact of multimodal inputs on task performance. To further enhance response accuracy, we incorporate historical QA pairs as contextual grounding for answering current queries. Additionally, we incorporate page references within the answers and introduce an importance-based page classifier, further improving the precision and relevance of the information provided. Preliminary results indicate the improvements with our AI assistant in document information extraction and question-answering tasks.

*Leping Si,Meimei Yang,Hui Xue,Shipeng Zhu,Pengfei Fang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces adaptive hyperbolic kernels to improve hierarchical data modeling in various machine learning tasks, leveraging curvature-aware RKHS and adjustable multipliers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations of existing hyperbolic kernels that suffer from geometric distortion or lack adaptability in embedding hierarchical structures.

Method: The paper proposes a curvature-aware de Branges-Rovnyak space (RKHS), isometric to the Poincare ball, with adjustable multipliers for adaptable curvature selection. It also introduces adaptive hyperbolic kernels, including the adaptive hyperbolic radial kernel, with learnable parameters tailored to specific tasks.

Result: Extensive experiments reveal that the proposed adaptive hyperbolic kernels outperform existing hyperbolic kernels in accurately modeling hierarchical dependencies on visual and language benchmarks.

Conclusion: Adaptive hyperbolic kernels significantly enhance the representation capacity for hierarchical data modeling, providing superior performance in diverse machine learning applications due to their adaptability and task-aware design.

Abstract: Hierarchical data pervades diverse machine learning applications, including natural language processing, computer vision, and social network analysis. Hyperbolic space, characterized by its negative curvature, has demonstrated strong potential in such tasks due to its capacity to embed hierarchical structures with minimal distortion. Previous evidence indicates that the hyperbolic representation capacity can be further enhanced through kernel methods. However, existing hyperbolic kernels still suffer from mild geometric distortion or lack adaptability. This paper addresses these issues by introducing a curvature-aware de Branges-Rovnyak space, a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) that is isometric to a Poincare ball. We design an adjustable multiplier to select the appropriate RKHS corresponding to the hyperbolic space with any curvature adaptively. Building on this foundation, we further construct a family of adaptive hyperbolic kernels, including the novel adaptive hyperbolic radial kernel, whose learnable parameters modulate hyperbolic features in a task-aware manner. Extensive experiments on visual and language benchmarks demonstrate that our proposed kernels outperform existing hyperbolic kernels in modeling hierarchical dependencies.

*Zhongjian Miao,Hao Fu,Chen Wei*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces SPAN, a benchmark for testing large language models (LLMs) on complex cross-calendar temporal reasoning. Existing LLMs perform poorly, but a new tool-augmented approach (Time Agent) significantly improves accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of current LLMs in handling complex temporal reasoning, particularly across diverse calendar systems, and to promote the development of LLMs that are temporally and culturally adaptive.

Method: The authors developed SPAN, a benchmark featuring dynamic instance generation across six calendars, ten reasoning directions, and two types of reasoning. They also introduced the Time Agent system, combining LLMs with tool-augmented code generation.

Result: Existing LLMs achieved only 34.5% accuracy on average and struggled with biases like Future-Date Degradation and Calendar Asymmetry. The proposed Time Agent system dramatically improved performance to 95.31% accuracy.

Conclusion: Cross-calendar temporal reasoning remains a significant challenge for LLMs. Tool-augmented code generation shows promising results and could pave the way for more advanced temporal reasoning capabilities in AI systems.

Abstract: We introduce SPAN, a cross-calendar temporal reasoning benchmark, which requires LLMs to perform intra-calendar temporal reasoning and inter-calendar temporal conversion. SPAN features ten cross-calendar temporal reasoning directions, two reasoning types, and two question formats across six calendars. To enable time-variant and contamination-free evaluation, we propose a template-driven protocol for dynamic instance generation that enables assessment on a user-specified Gregorian date. We conduct extensive experiments on both open- and closed-source state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs over a range of dates spanning 100 years from 1960 to 2060. Our evaluations show that these LLMs achieve an average accuracy of only 34.5%, with none exceeding 80%, indicating that this task remains challenging. Through in-depth analysis of reasoning types, question formats, and temporal reasoning directions, we identify two key obstacles for LLMs: Future-Date Degradation and Calendar Asymmetry Bias. To strengthen LLMs' cross-calendar temporal reasoning capability, we further develop an LLM-powered Time Agent that leverages tool-augmented code generation. Empirical results show that Time Agent achieves an average accuracy of 95.31%, outperforming several competitive baselines, highlighting the potential of tool-augmented code generation to advance cross-calendar temporal reasoning. We hope this work will inspire further efforts toward more temporally and culturally adaptive LLMs.

TL;DR: The study assesses the capability of language models to assist in hazardous material emergency responses by introducing the ChEmREF benchmark, focusing on chemical translation, emergency generation, and HAZMAT domain knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Emergency responders managing HAZMAT incidents face challenges in navigation and decision-making with extensive chemical guidelines, prompting the exploration of language models for assistance.

Method: The authors developed ChEmREF, a benchmark with tasks including chemical translation, emergency response generation, and question answering based on HAZMAT exams to evaluate language models.

Result: The tested models showed moderate success, achieving 68.0% in chemical representation translation, 52.7% in incident response recommendations, and 63.9% accuracy on HAZMAT certification exams.

Conclusion: While demonstrating potential in assisting with HAZMAT tasks, the current language models still necessitate human oversight due to existing limitations in performance.

Abstract: Emergency responders managing hazardous material HAZMAT incidents face critical, time-sensitive decisions, manually navigating extensive chemical guidelines. We investigate whether today's language models can assist responders by rapidly and reliably understanding critical information, identifying hazards, and providing recommendations.We introduce the Chemical Emergency Response Evaluation Framework (ChEmREF), a new benchmark comprising questions on 1,035 HAZMAT chemicals from the Emergency Response Guidebook and the PubChem Database. ChEmREF is organized into three tasks: (1) translation of chemical representation between structured and unstructured forms (e.g., converting C2H6O to ethanol), (2) emergency response generation (e.g., recommending appropriate evacuation distances) and (3) domain knowledge question answering from chemical safety and certification exams. Our best evaluated models received an exact match of 68.0% on unstructured HAZMAT chemical representation translation, a LLM Judge score of 52.7% on incident response recommendations, and a multiple-choice accuracy of 63.9% on HAMZAT examinations.These findings suggest that while language models show potential to assist emergency responders in various tasks, they require careful human oversight due to their current limitations.

TL;DR: This paper presents a novel framework, the Planner-centric Plan-Execute paradigm, to better handle complex queries with large language models (LLMs) through global planning and a benchmark dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing tool-augmented LLMs like ReAct struggle with local optimization issues and lack capabilities to efficiently process complex queries involving multi-tool composition.

Method: The proposed approach introduces a Planner model for global Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) planning, combined with a new ComplexTool-Plan dataset and a two-stage training process featuring Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO).

Result: The framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on the StableToolBench benchmark, proving its ability to handle complex queries and multi-tool workflows effectively.

Conclusion: The Planner-centric Plan-Execute paradigm offers a significant improvement over existing frameworks by overcoming local optimization problems and enabling robust tools coordination for sophisticated query handling.

Abstract: Existing tool-augmented large language models (LLMs) encounter significant challenges when processing complex queries. Current frameworks such as ReAct are prone to local optimization traps due to their reliance on incremental decision-making processes. To address these limitations, we propose a novel Planner-centric Plan-Execute paradigm that fundamentally resolves local optimization bottlenecks through architectural innovation. Central to our approach is a novel Planner model that performs global Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) planning for complex queries, enabling optimized execution beyond conventional tool coordination. We also introduce ComplexTool-Plan, a large-scale benchmark dataset featuring complex queries that demand sophisticated multi-tool composition and coordination capabilities. Additionally, we develop a two-stage training methodology that integrates Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), systematically enhancing the Planner's tool selection accuracy and global planning awareness through structured DAG-based planning. When integrated with a capable executor, our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on the StableToolBench benchmark for complex user queries, demonstrating superior end-to-end execution capabilities and robust handling of intricate multi-tool workflows.

*Ziheng Li,Hengyi Cai,Xiaochi Wei,Yuchen Li,Shuaiqiang Wang,Zhi-Hong Deng,Dawei Yin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Hint-Practice Reasoning (HPR) framework to improve reasoning efficiency in large language models by leveraging a powerful hinter for critical decisions and a smaller practitioner for general reasoning steps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current inference methods for large language models are computationally expensive, particularly when sampling exhaustively for reasoning tasks.

Method: The HPR framework utilizes a combination of a strong hinter for interventions during critical decisions and a smaller practitioner for main reasoning steps. Additionally, it employs Distributional Inconsistency Reduction (DIR) to identify intervention points within a probabilistic reasoning trajectory.

Result: Experiments conducted on benchmarks exhibit HPR's efficiency, achieving comparable accuracy to self-consistency and MCTS while drastically reducing computational costs. It outperforms existing methods by up to 5.1% on accuracy with similar or lower FLOPs.

Conclusion: HPR is a promising approach that efficiently balances accuracy and computation for reasoning tasks in large language models.

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) demonstrate emerging reasoning capabilities, current inference-time expansion methods incur prohibitive computational costs by exhaustive sampling. Through analyzing decoding trajectories, we observe that most next-token predictions align well with the golden output, except for a few critical tokens that lead to deviations. Inspired by this phenomenon, we propose a novel Hint-Practice Reasoning (HPR) framework that operationalizes this insight through two synergistic components: 1) a hinter (powerful LLM) that provides probabilistic guidance at critical decision points, and 2) a practitioner (efficient smaller model) that executes major reasoning steps. The framework's core innovation lies in Distributional Inconsistency Reduction (DIR), a theoretically-grounded metric that dynamically identifies intervention points by quantifying the divergence between practitioner's reasoning trajectory and hinter's expected distribution in a tree-structured probabilistic space. Through iterative tree updates guided by DIR, HPR reweights promising reasoning paths while deprioritizing low-probability branches. Experiments across arithmetic and commonsense reasoning benchmarks demonstrate HPR's state-of-the-art efficiency-accuracy tradeoffs: it achieves comparable performance to self-consistency and MCTS baselines while decoding only 1/5 tokens, and outperforms existing methods by at most 5.1% absolute accuracy while maintaining similar or lower FLOPs.

*Bodong Du,Honglong Yang,Xiaomeng Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces RadFlow, a hierarchical reinforcement optimization framework for generating medical diagnostic reports, emphasizing structured reporting to enhance clinical accuracy and coherence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations in existing medical report generation systems that treat reports as flat sequences, leading to inconsistencies and divergence from real-world structured reporting practices of radiologists.

Method: The method involves RadFlow, a reinforcement learning framework that incorporates a hierarchical workflow with a reward hierarchy emphasizing linguistic fluency, clinical correctness, diagnostic coherence, and cautious policies for sensitive cases.

Result: RadFlow demonstrates significant improvements in generating diagnostic reports with enhanced coherence and quality on chest X-ray and carotid ultrasound datasets compared to previous methods.

Conclusion: RadFlow aligns medical report generation with radiologists' structured workflows, producing linguistically and clinically robust reports for real-world medical applications.

Abstract: Radiologists compose diagnostic reports through a structured workflow: they describe visual findings, summarize them into impressions, and carefully refine statements in clinically critical cases. However, most existing medical report generation (MRG) systems treat reports as flat sequences, overlooking this hierarchical organization and leading to inconsistencies between descriptive and diagnostic content. To align model behavior with real-world reporting practices, we propose RadFlow, a hierarchical workflow-guided reinforcement optimization framework that explicitly models the structured nature of clinical reporting. RadFlow introduces a clinically grounded reward hierarchy that mirrors the organization of radiological reports. At the global level, the reward integrates linguistic fluency, medical-domain correctness, and cross-sectional consistency between Finding and Impression, promoting coherent and clinically faithful narratives. At the local level, a section-specific reward emphasizes Impression quality, reflecting its central role in diagnostic accuracy. Furthermore, a critical-aware policy optimization mechanism adaptively regularizes learning for high-risk or clinically sensitive cases, emulating the cautious refinement behavior of radiologists when documenting critical findings. Together, these components translate the structured reporting paradigm into the reinforcement fine-tuning process, enabling the model to generate reports that are both linguistically consistent and clinically aligned. Experiments on chest X-ray and carotid ultrasound datasets demonstrate that RadFlow consistently improves diagnostic coherence and overall report quality compared with state-of-the-art baselines.

### [28] [Enhancing the Medical Context-Awareness Ability of LLMs via Multifaceted Self-Refinement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10067)
*Yuxuan Zhou,Yubin Wang,Bin Wang,Chen Ning,Xien Liu,Ji Wu,Jianye Hao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The study introduces Multifaceted Self-Refinement (MuSeR), a framework that improves the context-awareness of large language models (LLMs) in medical applications using self-evaluation, refinement, and supervised fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs, despite their successes in medical benchmarks, struggle with real-world medical scenarios demanding better context-awareness, a critical feature in recognizing missing or essential details for appropriate functionality.

Method: MuSeR involves diverse query simulation based on attributes (e.g., user roles or regions), LLM response evaluation across decision-making, communication, and safety facets, response refinement through self-evaluation, and final supervised fine-tuning with generated data and refined responses.

Result: MuSeR demonstrates significant performance improvements on the HealthBench dataset, especially in context-awareness. Notably, using knowledge distillation, a smaller LLM (Qwen3-32B) outperforms its teacher model, achieving state-of-the-art results.

Conclusion: The proposed MuSeR framework effectively enhances LLM context-awareness and performance in medical contexts, making it a new standard for open-source LLMs on HealthBench.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown great promise in the medical domain, achieving strong performance on several benchmarks. However, they continue to underperform in real-world medical scenarios, which often demand stronger context-awareness, i.e., the ability to recognize missing or critical details (e.g., user identity, medical history, risk factors) and provide safe, helpful, and contextually appropriate responses. To address this issue, we propose Multifaceted Self-Refinement (MuSeR), a data-driven approach that enhances LLMs' context-awareness along three key facets (decision-making, communication, and safety) through self-evaluation and refinement. Specifically, we first design a attribute-conditioned query generator that simulates diverse real-world user contexts by varying attributes such as role, geographic region, intent, and degree of information ambiguity. An LLM then responds to these queries, self-evaluates its answers along three key facets, and refines its responses to better align with the requirements of each facet. Finally, the queries and refined responses are used for supervised fine-tuning to reinforce the model's context-awareness ability. Evaluation results on the latest HealthBench dataset demonstrate that our method significantly improves LLM performance across multiple aspects, with particularly notable gains in the context-awareness axis. Furthermore, by incorporating knowledge distillation with the proposed method, the performance of a smaller backbone LLM (e.g., Qwen3-32B) surpasses its teacher model, achieving a new SOTA across all open-source LLMs on HealthBench (63.8%) and its hard subset (43.1%).

### [29] [Balancing Centralized Learning and Distributed Self-Organization: A Hybrid Model for Embodied Morphogenesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10101)
*Takehiro Ishikawa*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores using a learnable controller combined with a reaction-diffusion system to efficiently and reliably achieve desired pattern formations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to develop systems for pattern formation that minimize control effort by leveraging a balance between computational learning and distributed self-organization.

Method: A learnable convolutional policy controller is embedded into a differentiable reaction-diffusion simulation framework, trained to optimize spectral patterns while penalizing instability and high control effort.

Result: The hybrid system achieves high reliability and energy efficiency in pattern formation, converging in fewer steps with significantly reduced control power compared to a purely neural network-based control.

Conclusion: The study illustrates a practical approach to creating robust, efficient systems by dividing tasks between centralized learning and local physics, optimizing energy and control effectiveness.

Abstract: We investigate how to couple a learnable brain-like'' controller to a cell-like'' Gray--Scott substrate to steer pattern formation with minimal effort. A compact convolutional policy is embedded in a differentiable PyTorch reaction--diffusion simulator, producing spatially smooth, bounded modulations of the feed and kill parameters ($ΔF$, $ΔK$) under a warm--hold--decay gain schedule. Training optimizes Turing-band spectral targets (FFT-based) while penalizing control effort ($\ell_1/\ell_2$) and instability. We compare three regimes: pure reaction--diffusion, NN-dominant, and a hybrid coupling. The hybrid achieves reliable, fast formation of target textures: 100% strict convergence in $\sim 165$ steps, matching cell-only spectral selectivity (0.436 vs.\ 0.434) while using $\sim 15\times$ less $\ell_1$ effort and $>200\times$ less $\ell_2$ power than NN-dominant control. An amplitude sweep reveals a non-monotonic Goldilocks'' zone ($A \approx 0.03$--$0.045$) that yields 100\% quasi convergence in 94--96 steps, whereas weaker or stronger gains fail to converge or degrade selectivity. These results quantify morphological computation: the controller seeds then cedes,'' providing brief, sparse nudges that place the system in the correct basin of attraction, after which local physics maintains the pattern. The study offers a practical recipe for building steerable, robust, and energy-efficient embodied systems that exploit an optimal division of labor between centralized learning and distributed self-organization.

### [30] [Intilligence Foundation Model: A New Perspective to Approach Artificial General Intelligence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10119)
*Borui Cai,Yao Zhao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Intelligence Foundation Model (IFM) aiming to understand general intelligence through neuron-like dynamics, contrasting with current pattern-focused foundation models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop true artificial general intelligence, existing models limited by domain-specific pattern learning need enhancement by training systems with diverse intelligent behaviors.

Method: The proposed IFM combines a state neural network architecture, mimicking temporal dynamics of biological neurons, with a neuron output prediction objective for learning structural dynamics.

Result: IFM incorporates neuron dynamics and unified learning principles, establishing a basis for scalable systems capable of generalization, reasoning, and adaptive learning.

Conclusion: IFM is a biologically-inspired, scalable framework paving the way towards artificial general intelligence by focusing on general principles of intelligence through diverse behaviors.

Abstract: We propose a new perspective for approaching artificial general intelligence (AGI) through an intelligence foundation model (IFM). Unlike existing foundation models (FMs), which specialize in pattern learning within specific domains such as language, vision, or time series, IFM aims to acquire the underlying mechanisms of intelligence by learning directly from diverse intelligent behaviors. Vision, language, and other cognitive abilities are manifestations of intelligent behavior; learning from this broad range of behaviors enables the system to internalize the general principles of intelligence. Based on the fact that intelligent behaviors emerge from the collective dynamics of biological neural systems, IFM consists of two core components: a novel network architecture, termed the state neural network, which captures neuron-like dynamic processes, and a new learning objective, neuron output prediction, which trains the system to predict neuronal outputs from collective dynamics. The state neural network emulates the temporal dynamics of biological neurons, allowing the system to store, integrate, and process information over time, while the neuron output prediction objective provides a unified computational principle for learning these structural dynamics from intelligent behaviors. Together, these innovations establish a biologically grounded and computationally scalable foundation for building systems capable of generalization, reasoning, and adaptive learning across domains, representing a step toward truly AGI.

*Qinfeng Li,Miao Pan,Ke Xiong,Ge Su,Zhiqiang Shen,Yan Liu,Bing Sun,Hao Peng,Xuhong Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces RAGFort, a defense mechanism for RAG systems to counter knowledge base reconstruction attacks using a dual-module approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the vulnerability of RAG systems to reconstruction attacks that replicate proprietary knowledge bases by systematically exploiting intra-class and inter-class paths.

Method: Proposes RAGFort, combining "contrastive reindexing" for isolating inter-class threats and "constrained cascade generation" for protecting intra-class information.

Result: RAGFort significantly reduces the success of reconstruction attacks while maintaining high answer quality, as confirmed through experiments on security, performance, and robustness.

Conclusion: Jointly protecting both intra-class and inter-class paths is essential, and RAGFort provides an effective and comprehensive defense mechanism.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems deployed over proprietary knowledge bases face growing threats from reconstruction attacks that aggregate model responses to replicate knowledge bases. Such attacks exploit both intra-class and inter-class paths, progressively extracting fine-grained knowledge within topics and diffusing it across semantically related ones, thereby enabling comprehensive extraction of the original knowledge base. However, existing defenses target only one path, leaving the other unprotected. We conduct a systematic exploration to assess the impact of protecting each path independently and find that joint protection is essential for effective defense. Based on this, we propose RAGFort, a structure-aware dual-module defense combining "contrastive reindexing" for inter-class isolation and "constrained cascade generation" for intra-class protection. Experiments across security, performance, and robustness confirm that RAGFort significantly reduces reconstruction success while preserving answer quality, offering comprehensive defense against knowledge base extraction attacks.

*J. Javier Alonso-Ramos,Ignacio Aguilera-Martos,Andrés Herrera-Poyatos,Francisco Herrera*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces DenoGrad, a new gradient-based denoising framework that improves machine learning models by preserving data distribution while dynamically correcting noisy instances.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the negative impact of noisy data on the performance of interpretable AI models and the shortcomings of current denoising methods that often disturb the original data distribution, resulting in biased models.

Method: DenoGrad utilizes task-specific high-quality gradients derived from an accurate deep learning model to detect and adjust noisy samples while maintaining the original data distribution.

Result: DenoGrad outperforms state-of-the-art denoising strategies on tabular and time-series datasets across various noise conditions, showcasing its ability to improve AI model robustness and performance.

Conclusion: DenoGrad effectively enhances interpretable AI models by correcting noisy data and preserving its original distribution, making it a superior denoising approach compared to existing methods.

Abstract: The performance of Machine Learning (ML) models, particularly those operating within the Interpretable Artificial Intelligence (Interpretable AI) framework, is significantly affected by the presence of noise in both training and production data. Denoising has therefore become a critical preprocessing step, typically categorized into instance removal and instance correction techniques. However, existing correction approaches often degrade performance or oversimplify the problem by altering the original data distribution. This leads to unrealistic scenarios and biased models, which is particularly problematic in contexts where interpretable AI models are employed, as their interpretability depends on the fidelity of the underlying data patterns. In this paper, we argue that defining noise independently of the solution may be ineffective, as its nature can vary significantly across tasks and datasets. Using a task-specific high quality solution as a reference can provide a more precise and adaptable noise definition. To this end, we propose DenoGrad, a novel Gradient-based instance Denoiser framework that leverages gradients from an accurate Deep Learning (DL) model trained on the target data -- regardless of the specific task -- to detect and adjust noisy samples. Unlike conventional approaches, DenoGrad dynamically corrects noisy instances, preserving problem's data distribution, and improving AI models robustness. DenoGrad is validated on both tabular and time series datasets under various noise settings against the state-of-the-art. DenoGrad outperforms existing denoising strategies, enhancing the performance of interpretable IA models while standing out as the only high quality approach that preserves the original data distribution.

*Periklis Mantenoglou,Luigi Bonassi,Enrico Scala,Pedro Zuidberg Dos Martires*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces methods to handle planning problems with qualitative constraints effectively, avoiding scalability issues by eliminating pre-compilation grounding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In real-world problems, safety requirements, task orderings, and intermediate sub-goals present challenges in large-scale planning due to the necessity of grounding objects and actions before compilation.

Method: Two new compilation methods are designed to remove constraints without grounding, with proofs of their correctness and analysis of their time complexity.

Result: The proposed methods are efficient, scalable, and produce succinct planning specifications, improving over grounded compilers while maintaining competitiveness with state-of-the-art planners.

Conclusion: The approaches effectively tackle scalability issues by bypassing grounding, offering improved performance and maintain competitiveness for large-scale planning applications.

Abstract: We study planning in a fragment of PDDL with qualitative state-trajectory constraints, capturing safety requirements, task ordering conditions, and intermediate sub-goals commonly found in real-world problems. A prominent approach to tackle such problems is to compile their constraints away, leading to a problem that is supported by state-of-the-art planners. Unfortunately, existing compilers do not scale on problems with a large number of objects and high-arity actions, as they necessitate grounding the problem before compilation. To address this issue, we propose two methods for compiling away constraints without grounding, making them suitable for large-scale planning problems. We prove the correctness of our compilers and outline their worst-case time complexity. Moreover, we present a reproducible empirical evaluation on the domains used in the latest International Planning Competition. Our results demonstrate that our methods are efficient and produce planning specifications that are orders of magnitude more succinct than the ones produced by compilers that ground the domain, while remaining competitive when used for planning with a state-of-the-art planner.

### [34] [Advanced Black-Box Tuning of Large Language Models with Limited API Calls](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10210)
*Zhikang Xie,Weilin Wan,Peizhu Gong,Weizhong Zhang,Cheng Jin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces an efficient black-box tuning method for large language models (LLMs), reducing the number of API calls while maintaining or improving accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing black-box tuning methods for LLMs are either inefficient or too computationally expensive, creating a need for a method that balances efficiency and effectiveness with limited API access.

Method: The proposed method trains a Gaussian Process (GP) surrogate model using 'LogitMap Pairs' obtained from a limited subset of foundation model queries. The surrogate approximates the foundation model's outputs, guiding a proxy model's training and reducing direct API queries.

Result: The method increased language model accuracy from 55.92% to 86.85% while reducing API queries by 98.62%, achieving results comparable to or better than query-intensive approaches.

Conclusion: This work provides an efficient and cost-effective solution for LLM adaptation, significantly reducing computational costs with minimal compromise on performance.

Abstract: Black-box tuning is an emerging paradigm for adapting large language models (LLMs) to better achieve desired behaviors, particularly when direct access to model parameters is unavailable. Current strategies, however, often present a dilemma of suboptimal extremes: either separately train a small proxy model and then use it to shift the predictions of the foundation model, offering notable efficiency but often yielding limited improvement; or making API calls in each tuning iteration to the foundation model, which entails prohibitive computational costs. Therefore, we propose a novel advanced black-box tuning method for LLMs with limited API calls. Our core strategy involves training a Gaussian Process (GP) surrogate model with "LogitMap Pairs" derived from querying the foundation model on a minimal but highly informative training subset. This surrogate can approximate the outputs of the foundation model to guide the training of the proxy model, thereby effectively reducing the need for direct queries to the foundation model. Extensive experiments verify that our approach elevates pre-trained language model accuracy from 55.92% to 86.85%, reducing the frequency of API queries to merely 1.38%. This significantly outperforms offline approaches that operate entirely without API access. Notably, our method also achieves comparable or superior accuracy to query-intensive approaches, while significantly reducing API costs. This offers a robust and high-efficiency paradigm for language model adaptation.

*Haolong Xiang,Peisi Wang,Xiaolong Xu,Kun Yi,Xuyun Zhang,Quanzheng Sheng,Amin Beheshti,Wei Fan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes a multimodal framework, MTP, for urban traffic profiling using numeric, visual, and textual data, achieving superior results compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current urban traffic signal modeling relies heavily on unimodal numerical data, which fails to leverage the semantic information present in multimodal heterogeneous urban data, limiting the understanding and prediction of complex traffic dynamics.

Method: The authors introduce MTP, which incorporates numeric, visual, and textual learning using techniques such as visual augmentation for generating frequency and periodic images, textual augmentation with descriptive texts, and frequency multilayer perceptrons for numerical data. Hierarchical contrastive learning is applied for modality fusion.

Result: Experiments conducted on six real-world datasets show that MTP outperforms state-of-the-art methods in urban traffic profiling.

Conclusion: The multimodal framework effectively captures urban traffic signals from various perspectives, addressing the shortcomings of unimodal approaches and offering improved accuracy and understanding of traffic dynamics.

Abstract: With rapid urbanization in the modern era, traffic signals from various sensors have been playing a significant role in monitoring the states of cities, which provides a strong foundation in ensuring safe travel, reducing traffic congestion and optimizing urban mobility. Most existing methods for traffic signal modeling often rely on the original data modality, i.e., numerical direct readings from the sensors in cities. However, this unimodal approach overlooks the semantic information existing in multimodal heterogeneous urban data in different perspectives, which hinders a comprehensive understanding of traffic signals and limits the accurate prediction of complex traffic dynamics. To address this problem, we propose a novel \textit{M}ultimodal framework, \textit{MTP}, for urban \textit{T}raffic \textit{P}rofiling, which learns multimodal features through numeric, visual, and textual perspectives. The three branches drive for a multimodal perspective of urban traffic signal learning in the frequency domain, while the frequency learning strategies delicately refine the information for extraction. Specifically, we first conduct the visual augmentation for the traffic signals, which transforms the original modality into frequency images and periodicity images for visual learning. Also, we augment descriptive texts for the traffic signals based on the specific topic, background information and item description for textual learning. To complement the numeric information, we utilize frequency multilayer perceptrons for learning on the original modality. We design a hierarchical contrastive learning on the three branches to fuse the spectrum of three modalities. Finally, extensive experiments on six real-world datasets demonstrate superior performance compared with the state-of-the-art approaches.

*Minbae Park,Hyemin Yang,Jeonghyun Kim,Kunsoo Park,Hyunjoon Kim*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ProgRAG is a framework for improving multi-hop reasoning in knowledge graph question answering by progressively decomposing questions into sub-tasks, refining evidence, and optimizing reasoning paths.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the shortcomings of LLMs in reasoning, particularly their hallucinations, retrieval inaccuracies, and context handling difficulties, while tackling knowledge-intensive tasks.

Method: ProgRAG decomposes questions into sub-questions, retrieves evidence iteratively using external retrievers and LLM-based pruning, and optimizes reasoning contexts by reorganizing partial reasoning paths.

Result: Experiments across three datasets show ProgRAG's superior performance in multi-hop KGQA, leading to better reasoning quality and reliability compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: ProgRAG effectively mitigates retrieval and reasoning failures in LLMs by adopting a step-by-step reasoning and evidence refinement process, demonstrating its capability in complex KGQA tasks.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong reasoning capabilities but struggle with hallucinations and limited transparency. Recently, KG-enhanced LLMs that integrate knowledge graphs (KGs) have been shown to improve reasoning performance, particularly for complex, knowledge-intensive tasks. However, these methods still face significant challenges, including inaccurate retrieval and reasoning failures, often exacerbated by long input contexts that obscure relevant information or by context constructions that struggle to capture the richer logical directions required by different question types. Furthermore, many of these approaches rely on LLMs to directly retrieve evidence from KGs, and to self-assess the sufficiency of this evidence, which often results in premature or incorrect reasoning. To address the retrieval and reasoning failures, we propose ProgRAG, a multi-hop knowledge graph question answering (KGQA) framework that decomposes complex questions into sub-questions, and progressively extends partial reasoning paths by answering each sub-question. At each step, external retrievers gather candidate evidence, which is then refined through uncertainty-aware pruning by the LLM. Finally, the context for LLM reasoning is optimized by organizing and rearranging the partial reasoning paths obtained from the sub-question answers. Experiments on three well-known datasets demonstrate that ProgRAG outperforms existing baselines in multi-hop KGQA, offering improved reliability and reasoning quality.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PepTriX is a framework combining sequence embeddings and structural features for peptide classification, outperforming traditional methods while providing interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional peptide classification methods rely on handcrafted encodings, limiting generalization across tasks. Current protein language models address this but face challenges in computational cost and interpretability.

Method: The paper introduces PepTriX, which integrates 1D sequence embeddings and 3D structural features using a graph attention network, along with contrastive training and cross-modal co-attention.

Result: Evaluations show PepTriX performs well across multiple peptide tasks while offering insight into structural motifs driving predictions.

Conclusion: PepTriX bridges the gap between predictive performance and domain-specific interpretability in peptide research, enhancing generalization and biological relevance.

Abstract: Peptide classification tasks, such as predicting toxicity and HIV inhibition, are fundamental to bioinformatics and drug discovery. Traditional approaches rely heavily on handcrafted encodings of one-dimensional (1D) peptide sequences, which can limit generalizability across tasks and datasets. Recently, protein language models (PLMs), such as ESM-2 and ESMFold, have demonstrated strong predictive performance. However, they face two critical challenges. First, fine-tuning is computationally costly. Second, their complex latent representations hinder interpretability for domain experts. Additionally, many frameworks have been developed for specific types of peptide classification, lacking generalization. These limitations restrict the ability to connect model predictions to biologically relevant motifs and structural properties. To address these limitations, we present PepTriX, a novel framework that integrates one dimensional (1D) sequence embeddings and three-dimensional (3D) structural features via a graph attention network enhanced with contrastive training and cross-modal co-attention. PepTriX automatically adapts to diverse datasets, producing task-specific peptide vectors while retaining biological plausibility. After evaluation by domain experts, we found that PepTriX performs remarkably well across multiple peptide classification tasks and provides interpretable insights into the structural and biophysical motifs that drive predictions. Thus, PepTriX offers both predictive robustness and interpretable validation, bridging the gap between performance-driven peptide-level models (PLMs) and domain-level understanding in peptide research.

*Gal Hadar,Forest Agostinelli,Shahaf S. Shperberg*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new method for improving heuristic learning in shortest-path problems by generalizing state sampling and heuristic updating processes via limited-horizon searches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve upon standard heuristic functions in shortest-path problems by using reinforcement learning, addressing the limitations of single-step Bellman updates.

Method: Introduces a generalized approach that performs limited-horizon searches and updates each state's heuristic using shortest-path calculations to the search frontier.

Result: Refines heuristic learning using edge costs and heuristic values more effectively than traditional methods.

Conclusion: The generalized approach enhances decision-making in shortest-path problems through more nuanced and efficient heuristic updates.

Abstract: Many sequential decision-making problems can be formulated as shortest-path problems, where the objective is to reach a goal state from a given starting state. Heuristic search is a standard approach for solving such problems, relying on a heuristic function to estimate the cost to the goal from any given state. Recent approaches leverage reinforcement learning to learn heuristics by applying deep approximate value iteration. These methods typically rely on single-step Bellman updates, where the heuristic of a state is updated based on its best neighbor and the corresponding edge cost. This work proposes a generalized approach that enhances both state sampling and heuristic updates by performing limited-horizon searches and updating each state's heuristic based on the shortest path to the search frontier, incorporating both edge costs and the heuristic values of frontier states.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper explores the verification of conditional independence (CI) propositions in Dynamic Bayesian Networks (DBNs) using temporal logic specifications like LTL and NBAs. The complexity ranges from Skolem problem equivalence to PSPACE, with identified simplifications for tractability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the verification challenges associated with the evolution of CI propositions in temporal probabilistic systems represented by DBNs.

Method: The authors analyze two types of CI properties: stochastic (based on probability distributions) and structural (based purely on the DBN's graphical structure). They examine how these properties align with temporal logic formalisms.

Result: They establish that verifying stochastic CI propositions is as complex as the Skolem problem, while structural CI verification is PSPACE with NP- and coNP-hard components. They also identify cases where structural CI property verification becomes tractable.

Conclusion: The paper provides complexity insights into verifying CI propositions in DBNs and offers practical guidelines for simplifying these verifications under certain constraints.

Abstract: Dynamic Bayesian networks (DBNs) are compact graphical representations used to model probabilistic systems where interdependent random variables and their distributions evolve over time. In this paper, we study the verification of the evolution of conditional-independence (CI) propositions against temporal logic specifications. To this end, we consider two specification formalisms over CI propositions: linear temporal logic (LTL), and non-deterministic Büchi automata (NBAs). This problem has two variants. Stochastic CI properties take the given concrete probability distributions into account, while structural CI properties are viewed purely in terms of the graphical structure of the DBN. We show that deciding if a stochastic CI proposition eventually holds is at least as hard as the Skolem problem for linear recurrence sequences, a long-standing open problem in number theory. On the other hand, we show that verifying the evolution of structural CI propositions against LTL and NBA specifications is in PSPACE, and is NP- and coNP-hard. We also identify natural restrictions on the graphical structure of DBNs that make the verification of structural CI properties tractable.

TL;DR: The paper addresses object hallucination in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) caused by spurious correlations and introduces a benchmark for evaluating model robustness against these errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle the issue of object hallucination in LVLMs due to spurious correlations stemming from co-occurrence bias.

Method: The authors establish a Structural Causal Model (SCM) to formally define spurious correlations and create Causal-HalBench, a benchmark using counterfactual samples and causal metrics, alongside developing a pipeline for generating such samples.

Result: Evaluations on mainstream LVLMs show varying susceptibility to spurious correlations, highlighting the models’ fragilities.

Conclusion: The study emphasizes the importance of addressing spurious correlations in LVLMs and provides tools for robust evaluation and analysis of these models.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) often suffer from object hallucination, making erroneous judgments about the presence of objects in images. We propose this primar- ily stems from spurious correlations arising when models strongly associate highly co-occurring objects during train- ing, leading to hallucinated objects influenced by visual con- text. Current benchmarks mainly focus on hallucination de- tection but lack a formal characterization and quantitative evaluation of spurious correlations in LVLMs. To address this, we introduce causal analysis into the object recognition scenario of LVLMs, establishing a Structural Causal Model (SCM). Utilizing the language of causality, we formally de- fine spurious correlations arising from co-occurrence bias. To quantify the influence induced by these spurious correla- tions, we develop Causal-HalBench, a benchmark specifically constructed with counterfactual samples and integrated with comprehensive causal metrics designed to assess model ro- bustness against spurious correlations. Concurrently, we pro- pose an extensible pipeline for the construction of these coun- terfactual samples, leveraging the capabilities of proprietary LVLMs and Text-to-Image (T2I) models for their genera- tion. Our evaluations on mainstream LVLMs using Causal- HalBench demonstrate these models exhibit susceptibility to spurious correlations, albeit to varying extents.

Motivation: Most research has focused on optimal bidirectional search methods, but there is limited exploration of bounded-suboptimal algorithms, necessitating their development and evaluation.

Method: The authors build upon the BAE* algorithm designed for consistent heuristics and create multiple variants for bounded-suboptimal cases. Experimental evaluations compare these variants against standard weighted A* and other bidirectional algorithms.

Result: Experiments reveal that each algorithm performs optimally under distinct conditions, showcasing diverse strengths and weaknesses.

Conclusion: The study broadens understanding of bounded-suboptimal bidirectional search, offering insights on algorithm efficiency across varying conditions and extending BAE* applications.

Abstract: Recent advancements in bidirectional heuristic search have yielded significant theoretical insights and novel algorithms. While most previous work has concentrated on optimal search methods, this paper focuses on bounded-suboptimal bidirectional search, where a bound on the suboptimality of the solution cost is specified. We build upon the state-of-the-art optimal bidirectional search algorithm, BAE*, designed for consistent heuristics, and introduce several variants of BAE* specifically tailored for the bounded-suboptimal context. Through experimental evaluation, we compare the performance of these new variants against other bounded-suboptimal bidirectional algorithms as well as the standard weighted A* algorithm. Our results demonstrate that each algorithm excels under distinct conditions, highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of each approach.

TL;DR: This paper presents a modular NPC dialogue system using tuned Small Language Models (SLMs) for expressive, persona-driven memory-rich interactions in games and beyond.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Language Models (LLMs) face challenges in gaming dialogue systems due to hardware needs, latency, and defined knowledge boundaries.

Method: The system utilizes fine-tuned SLMs with runtime-swappable memory modules, preserving context and world knowledge for NPC personas without retraining or reloading.

Result: Three open-source SLMs were used and evaluated—DistilGPT-2, TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat, Mistral-7B-Instruct—on consumer-grade hardware, demonstrating efficient and scalable performance.

Conclusion: The approach is applicable not only in games but also in domains like virtual assistants, customer support bots, and educational systems requiring expressive, scalable interactions.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in generating human-like text, yet their applicability to dialogue systems in computer games remains limited. This limitation arises from their substantial hardware requirements, latency constraints, and the necessity to maintain clearly defined knowledge boundaries within a game setting. In this paper, we propose a modular NPC dialogue system that leverages Small Language Models (SLMs), fine-tuned to encode specific NPC personas and integrated with runtime-swappable memory modules. These memory modules preserve character-specific conversational context and world knowledge, enabling expressive interactions and long-term memory without retraining or model reloading during gameplay. We comprehensively evaluate our system using three open-source SLMs: DistilGPT-2, TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat, and Mistral-7B-Instruct, trained on synthetic persona-aligned data and benchmarked on consumer-grade hardware. While our approach is motivated by applications in gaming, its modular design and persona-driven memory architecture hold significant potential for broader adoption in domains requiring expressive, scalable, and memory-rich conversational agents, such as virtual assistants, customer support bots, or interactive educational systems.

TL;DR: This paper presents FactGuard, a framework utilizing large language models (LLMs) to improve fake news detection by prioritizing event-centric content and addressing challenges like writing style sensitivity and usability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fake news detection methods reliant on writing style are losing effectiveness due to adversaries copying authentic writing styles. LLMs offer transformative potential but face challenges in usability, exploration, and costs.

Method: FactGuard extracts event-centric content using LLMs, reduces writing style influence, integrates a dynamic usability mechanism for better factual reasoning, and employs knowledge distillation for efficient deployment in constrained scenarios.

Result: Experiments on benchmark datasets show FactGuard consistently outperforms existing methods in robustness and accuracy, addressing style sensitivity and usability issues effectively.

Conclusion: FactGuard provides a promising solution to enhance fake news detection by leveraging LLMs for robust, efficient, and accurate performance against style imitation challenges and usability barriers.

Abstract: Fake news detection methods based on writing style have achieved remarkable progress. However, as adversaries increasingly imitate the style of authentic news, the effectiveness of such approaches is gradually diminishing. Recent research has explored incorporating large language models (LLMs) to enhance fake news detection. Yet, despite their transformative potential, LLMs remain an untapped goldmine for fake news detection, with their real-world adoption hampered by shallow functionality exploration, ambiguous usability, and prohibitive inference costs. In this paper, we propose a novel fake news detection framework, dubbed FactGuard, that leverages LLMs to extract event-centric content, thereby reducing the impact of writing style on detection performance. Furthermore, our approach introduces a dynamic usability mechanism that identifies contradictions and ambiguous cases in factual reasoning, adaptively incorporating LLM advice to improve decision reliability. To ensure efficiency and practical deployment, we employ knowledge distillation to derive FactGuard-D, enabling the framework to operate effectively in cold-start and resource-constrained scenarios. Comprehensive experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms existing methods in both robustness and accuracy, effectively addressing the challenges of style sensitivity and LLM usability in fake news detection.

*Belona Sonna,Alban Grastien,Claire Benn*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces a framework that audits privacy leakage in AI decisions using abductive explanations to justify decisions and identify instances of sensitive information disclosure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI-powered decision models may inadvertently reveal sensitive information, necessitating mechanisms to identify privacy risks.

Method: Developed a framework leveraging abductive reasoning to pinpoint minimal evidence justifying model decisions and assess privacy leakage at both individual and systemic levels.

Result: Experimental validation on the German Credit Dataset showcased sensitivity of privacy leakage influenced by model decision criteria.

Conclusion: Abductive reasoning serves as a viable method for interpretable privacy auditing, balancing transparency, interpretability, and privacy in AI decisions.

Abstract: Privacy leakage in AI-based decision processes poses significant risks, particularly when sensitive information can be inferred. We propose a formal framework to audit privacy leakage using abductive explanations, which identifies minimal sufficient evidence justifying model decisions and determines whether sensitive information disclosed. Our framework formalizes both individual and system-level leakage, introducing the notion of Potentially Applicable Explanations (PAE) to identify individuals whose outcomes can shield those with sensitive features. This approach provides rigorous privacy guarantees while producing human understandable explanations, a key requirement for auditing tools. Experimental evaluation on the German Credit Dataset illustrates how the importance of sensitive literal in the model decision process affects privacy leakage. Despite computational challenges and simplifying assumptions, our results demonstrate that abductive reasoning enables interpretable privacy auditing, offering a practical pathway to reconcile transparency, model interpretability, and privacy preserving in AI decision-making.

*Chenyi Li,Wanli Ma,Zichen Wang,Zaiwen Wen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces SITA, a method for auto-formalizing mathematical research-level theorems by bridging abstract structures with concrete applications using Lean proof assistant.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenges LLMs face in formalizing theorems from abstract structures to concrete applications for research-level mathematics.

Method: Developing a systematic framework using Lean proof assistant, reusable modular templates, typeclass mechanisms, LLM-based generation, and feedback-guided refinement.

Result: SITA successfully formalizes instances of optimization problems, demonstrating effectiveness in bridging abstract structures with concrete applications.

Conclusion: SITA framework enhances automation and formal correctness in theorem formalization, aiding research-level mathematical tasks.

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have shown progress in mathematical reasoning, they still face challenges in formalizing theorems that arise from instantiating abstract structures in concrete settings. With the goal of auto-formalizing mathematical results at the research level, we develop a framework for structure-to-instance theorem autoformalization (SITA), which systematically bridges the gap between abstract mathematical theories and their concrete applications in Lean proof assistant. Formalized abstract structures are treated as modular templates that contain definitions, assumptions, operations, and theorems. These templates serve as reusable guides for the formalization of concrete instances. Given a specific instantiation, we generate corresponding Lean definitions and instance declarations, integrate them using Lean's typeclass mechanism, and construct verified theorems by checking structural assumptions. We incorporate LLM-based generation with feedback-guided refinement to ensure both automation and formal correctness. Experiments on a dataset of optimization problems demonstrate that SITA effectively formalizes diverse instances grounded in abstract structures.

*Kayla Boggess,Sarit Kraus,Lu Feng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes methods for summarizing and explaining agent behaviors in decentralized Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional explanation methods in MARL struggle with decentralized settings, where agents operate under uncertainty and nondeterminism.

Method: The authors developed policy summarizations highlighting task ordering and cooperation, along with query-based explanations for user questions regarding agent behaviors.

Result: Tests on four MARL domains and two algorithms show effectiveness and generalizability. User studies reveal improved user performance and satisfaction with the explanations.

Conclusion: The proposed methods enhance understanding, question-answering performance, and user satisfaction in decentralized MARL systems.

Abstract: Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) has gained significant interest in recent years, enabling sequential decision-making across multiple agents in various domains. However, most existing explanation methods focus on centralized MARL, failing to address the uncertainty and nondeterminism inherent in decentralized settings. We propose methods to generate policy summarizations that capture task ordering and agent cooperation in decentralized MARL policies, along with query-based explanations for When, Why Not, and What types of user queries about specific agent behaviors. We evaluate our approach across four MARL domains and two decentralized MARL algorithms, demonstrating its generalizability and computational efficiency. User studies show that our summarizations and explanations significantly improve user question-answering performance and enhance subjective ratings on metrics such as understanding and satisfaction.

*Francisco Cunha,Yves Lepage,Zied Bouraoui,Miguel Couceiro*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper develops a unified framework for analogical reasoning in real-valued domains, extending its applicability beyond Boolean classification tasks to regression and continuous domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the limitations of existing formal frameworks for analogical inference, which do not extend to regression tasks or continuous domains.

Method: The authors revisit analogical inference from foundational perspectives, introduce parameterized analogies via generalized means, and derive error bounds under smoothness assumptions.

Result: A unified framework is developed that supports analogical inference over both discrete and continuous domains, accompanied by theoretical error bounds for analogy-preserving functions.

Conclusion: The research establishes a general theory of analogical inference that encompasses Boolean classification, regression, and continuous functions, broadening its applicability and theoretical foundation.

Abstract: Analogical reasoning is a powerful inductive mechanism, widely used in human cognition and increasingly applied in artificial intelligence. Formal frameworks for analogical inference have been developed for Boolean domains, where inference is provably sound for affine functions and approximately correct for functions close to affine. These results have informed the design of analogy-based classifiers. However, they do not extend to regression tasks or continuous domains. In this paper, we revisit analogical inference from a foundational perspective. We first present a counterexample showing that existing generalization bounds fail even in the Boolean setting. We then introduce a unified framework for analogical reasoning in real-valued domains based on parameterized analogies defined via generalized means. This model subsumes both Boolean classification and regression, and supports analogical inference over continuous functions. We characterize the class of analogy-preserving functions in this setting and derive both worst-case and average-case error bounds under smoothness assumptions. Our results offer a general theory of analogical inference across discrete and continuous domains.

*Ignace Bleukx,Maarten Flippo,Bart Bogaerts,Emir Demirović,Tias Guns*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores a new method for generating step-wise explanations in Constraint Solving by leveraging proofs generated by solvers, resulting in faster computation and maintaining explanation quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the computational expense of current methods for providing step-wise explanations in Explainable Constraint Solving, limiting their practicality.

Method: The authors introduce a framework of abstract proofs and methods to convert proofs into step-wise explanation sequences using trimming and simplification techniques.

Result: The proposed methods significantly speed up generating step-wise explanations while maintaining similar quality compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: Using solver proofs as a base for step-wise explanations optimizes the process and makes it more efficient without compromising on explanation quality.

Abstract: In the field of Explainable Constraint Solving, it is common to explain to a user why a problem is unsatisfiable. A recently proposed method for this is to compute a sequence of explanation steps. Such a step-wise explanation shows individual reasoning steps involving constraints from the original specification, that in the end explain a conflict. However, computing a step-wise explanation is computationally expensive, limiting the scope of problems for which it can be used. We investigate how we can use proofs generated by a constraint solver as a starting point for computing step-wise explanations, instead of computing them step-by-step. More specifically, we define a framework of abstract proofs, in which both proofs and step-wise explanations can be represented. We then propose several methods for converting a proof to a step-wise explanation sequence, with special attention to trimming and simplification techniques to keep the sequence and its individual steps small. Our results show our method significantly speeds up the generation of step-wise explanation sequences, while the resulting step-wise explanation has a quality similar to the current state-of-the-art.

### [49] [Preference Elicitation for Step-Wise Explanations in Logic Puzzles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10436)
*Marco Foschini,Marianne Defresne,Emilio Gamba,Bart Bogaerts,Tias Guns*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to enhance the comprehensibility of step-wise explanations for logic puzzles by using dynamic normalization techniques and a novel query generation strategy called MACHOP.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of defining an objective function to quantify the quality of explanation steps, which is difficult and requires better understanding of user preferences.

Method: The study uses interactive preference elicitation techniques, introducing dynamic normalization to stabilize learning and MACHOP to generate diverse and high-quality explanation queries.

Result: The proposed MACHOP method and dynamic normalization techniques produce higher-quality explanations for Sudokus and Logic-Grid puzzles in evaluations with artificial and real users.

Conclusion: Interactive preference elicitation combined with MACHOP outperforms standard methods in generating comprehensible step-wise explanations, demonstrating effective application to logic puzzles.

Abstract: Step-wise explanations can explain logic puzzles and other satisfaction problems by showing how to derive decisions step by step. Each step consists of a set of constraints that derive an assignment to one or more decision variables. However, many candidate explanation steps exist, with different sets of constraints and different decisions they derive. To identify the most comprehensible one, a user-defined objective function is required to quantify the quality of each step. However, defining a good objective function is challenging. Here, interactive preference elicitation methods from the wider machine learning community can offer a way to learn user preferences from pairwise comparisons. We investigate the feasibility of this approach for step-wise explanations and address several limitations that distinguish it from elicitation for standard combinatorial problems. First, because the explanation quality is measured using multiple sub-objectives that can vary a lot in scale, we propose two dynamic normalization techniques to rescale these features and stabilize the learning process. We also observed that many generated comparisons involve similar explanations. For this reason, we introduce MACHOP (Multi-Armed CHOice Perceptron), a novel query generation strategy that integrates non-domination constraints with upper confidence bound-based diversification. We evaluate the elicitation techniques on Sudokus and Logic-Grid puzzles using artificial users, and validate them with a real-user evaluation. In both settings, MACHOP consistently produces higher-quality explanations than the standard approach.

*Piotr Gorczyca,Hannes Strass*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces S4F Standpoint Logic, combining multi-viewpoint and non-monotonic reasoning under a unified formal framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing frameworks for non-monotonic reasoning and representations of heterogeneous viewpoints lack a unified model that captures both aspects comprehensively.

Method: The paper defines a new formalism, S4F Standpoint Logic, generalizing S4F modal logic and standpoint propositional logic with fully defined syntax, semantics, and computational complexity analysis.

Result: The analysis shows that S4F Standpoint Logic maintains computational complexity consistent with its component logics, enabling monotonic and non-monotonic reasoning efficiently.

Conclusion: This work provides a robust formal framework for multi-viewpoint, non-monotonic semantic commitments while maintaining computational tractability, with additional mechanisms for acceptance reasoning.

Abstract: Standpoint logics offer unified modal logic-based formalisms for representing multiple heterogeneous viewpoints. At the same time, many non-monotonic reasoning frameworks can be naturally captured using modal logics, in particular using the modal logic S4F. In this work, we propose a novel formalism called S4F Standpoint Logic, which generalises both S4F and standpoint propositional logic and is therefore capable of expressing multi-viewpoint, non-monotonic semantic commitments. We define its syntax and semantics and analyze its computational complexity, obtaining the result that S4F Standpoint Logic is not computationally harder than its constituent logics, whether in monotonic or non-monotonic form. We also outline mechanisms for credulous and sceptical acceptance and illustrate the framework with an example.

TL;DR: This paper reviews methods like Graph Neural Networks, Deep Reinforcement Learning, and Probabilistic Topic Modeling for strategic multiagent systems, analyzing challenges such as uncertainty, heterogeneity, and scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to explore advanced machine learning techniques adapted for strategic opponent modeling, integrating with game theory while addressing real-world limitations such as the Common Prior Assumption and Self-Interest Hypothesis.

Method: The paper reviews key mechanisms including Graph Neural Networks for relational modeling, Deep Reinforcement Learning for decision-making, and Probabilistic Topic Modeling to estimate underlying distributions in multiagent systems.

Result: The paper demonstrates the suitability of these methods in handling real-world challenges like heterogeneity and uncertainty, highlighting their effectiveness in strategic multiagent settings.

Conclusion: These methods hold promise for advancing strategic multiagent systems; however, challenges related to scalability, adaptation to non-stationary environments, and addressing real-world complexities remain.

Abstract: This paper provides a comprehensive review of mainly Graph Neural Networks, Deep Reinforcement Learning, and Probabilistic Topic Modeling methods with a focus on their potential incorporation in strategic multiagent settings. We draw interest in (i) Machine Learning methods currently utilized for uncovering unknown model structures adaptable to the task of strategic opponent modeling, and (ii) the integration of these methods with Game Theoretic concepts that avoid relying on assumptions often invalid in real-world scenarios, such as the Common Prior Assumption (CPA) and the Self-Interest Hypothesis (SIH). We analyze the ability to handle uncertainty and heterogeneity, two characteristics that are very common in real-world application cases, as well as scalability. As a potential answer to effectively modeling relationships and interactions in multiagent settings, we champion the use of Graph Neural Networks (GNN). Such approaches are designed to operate upon graph-structured data, and have been shown to be a very powerful tool for performing tasks such as node classification and link prediction. Next, we review the domain of Reinforcement Learning (RL), and in particular that of Multiagent Deep Reinforcement Learning (MADRL). Following, we describe existing relevant game theoretic solution concepts and consider properties such as fairness and stability. Our review comes complete with a note on the literature that utilizes PTM in domains other than that of document analysis and classification. The capability of PTM to estimate unknown underlying distributions can help with tackling heterogeneity and unknown agent beliefs. Finally, we identify certain open challenges specifically, the need to (i) fit non-stationary environments, (ii) balance the degrees of stability and adaptation, (iii) tackle uncertainty and heterogeneity, (iv) guarantee scalability and solution tractability.

Motivation: To explore and emphasize how AI is changing research workflows and the importance of integrating AI responsibly in academic practices.

Method: The study analyzes the current advancements of AI in research workflows and proposes governance strategies for responsible and ethical integration.

Result: AI has evolved as a collaborator in research, assisting in managing information, ideation, experimentation, and analysis, but requires thoughtful governance.

Conclusion: AI holds transformative potential in research but must be adopted responsibly with policies ensuring transparency, reproducibility, and accountability.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is reshaping how research is conceived, conducted, and communicated across fields from chemistry to biomedicine. This commentary examines how AI is transforming the research workflow. AI systems now help researchers manage the information deluge, filtering the literature, surfacing cross-disciplinary links for ideas and collaborations, generating hypotheses, and designing and executing experiments. These developments mark a shift from AI as a mere computational tool to AI as an active collaborator in science. Yet this transformation demands thoughtful integration and governance. We argue that at this time AI must augment but not replace human judgment in academic workflows such as peer review, ethical evaluation, and validation of results. This paper calls for the deliberate adoption of AI within the scientific practice through policies that promote transparency, reproducibility, and accountability.

*Mohammadsina Almasi,Hadis Anahideh*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes a bi-level contextual bandit framework for equitable resource allocation with delayed feedback, validated on real-world datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of equitable resource allocation in domains like healthcare, education, and employment while accounting for delayed outcomes, hidden heterogeneity, and ethical constraints.

Method: The proposed approach operates at two levels: the meta level allocates subgroup-level resources considering fairness and constraints, and the base level identifies responsive individuals within subgroups using neural networks trained with observational data and delay modeling.

Result: The framework achieved higher cumulative outcomes, adapted effectively to delay structures, and ensured fair resource distribution across subgroups.

Conclusion: Delay-aware and data-driven systems have the potential to improve institutional decision-making and social welfare by addressing temporal dynamics and fairness in resource allocation.

Abstract: Equitably allocating limited resources in high-stakes domains-such as education, employment, and healthcare-requires balancing short-term utility with long-term impact, while accounting for delayed outcomes, hidden heterogeneity, and ethical constraints. However, most learning-based allocation frameworks either assume immediate feedback or ignore the complex interplay between individual characteristics and intervention dynamics. We propose a novel bi-level contextual bandit framework for individualized resource allocation under delayed feedback, designed to operate in real-world settings with dynamic populations, capacity constraints, and time-sensitive impact. At the meta level, the model optimizes subgroup-level budget allocations to satisfy fairness and operational constraints. At the base level, it identifies the most responsive individuals within each group using a neural network trained on observational data, while respecting cooldown windows and delayed treatment effects modeled via resource-specific delay kernels. By explicitly modeling temporal dynamics and feedback delays, the algorithm continually refines its policy as new data arrive, enabling more responsive and adaptive decision-making. We validate our approach on two real-world datasets from education and workforce development, showing that it achieves higher cumulative outcomes, better adapts to delay structures, and ensures equitable distribution across subgroups. Our results highlight the potential of delay-aware, data-driven decision-making systems to improve institutional policy and social welfare.

TL;DR: The paper presents Regular Games (RG), a new General Game Playing system that is efficient and user-friendly for game design, using a low-level language based on finite automaton and higher-level interfaces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to create a General Game Playing system that is computationally efficient and provides convenience for game designers by overcoming limitations of current systems.

Method: RG is built on a low-level language defining rules via finite automaton, making it universal for finite turn-based games with imperfect information. Higher-level languages are introduced and translated into the low-level form.

Result: RG delivers faster forward models, outperforming existing GGP systems like Regular Boardgames and Ludii in efficiency, and includes supportive tools for automaton visualization, editing, debugging, and benchmarking.

Conclusion: Regular Games (RG) advances General Game Playing by being faster and more designer-compatible, with tools to enhance game creation and analysis.

Abstract: We propose a new General Game Playing (GGP) system called Regular Games (RG). The main goal of RG is to be both computationally efficient and convenient for game design. The system consists of several languages. The core component is a low-level language that defines the rules by a finite automaton. It is minimal with only a few mechanisms, which makes it easy for automatic processing (by agents, analysis, optimization, etc.). The language is universal for the class of all finite turn-based games with imperfect information. Higher-level languages are introduced for game design (by humans or Procedural Content Generation), which are eventually translated to a low-level language. RG generates faster forward models than the current state of the art, beating other GGP systems (Regular Boardgames, Ludii) in terms of efficiency. Additionally, RG's ecosystem includes an editor with LSP, automaton visualization, benchmarking tools, and a debugger of game description transformations.

TL;DR: The paper addresses verifying simulation-discovered failure scenarios in real-world systems by matching them with labeled time series data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the sim-to-real gap for Cyber Physical Systems (CPS) and Autonomous Vehicles (AVs), ensuring simulated failure scenarios are reproducible in actual environments and not synthetic artifacts.

Method: The authors define how labeled time series sensor data can match an abstract scenario using a Scenic probabilistic programming language. They propose a new querying algorithm to find matching data subsets efficiently.

Result: Their querying algorithm demonstrates higher accuracy and significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art methods, scaling effectively with the duration of time series data.

Conclusion: The validation of simulated failure scenarios using their algorithm reinforces the relevance of simulation testing in ensuring real-world safety of CPS and AV systems.

Abstract: Simulation-based testing has become a crucial complement to road testing for ensuring the safety of cyber physical systems (CPS). As a result, significant research efforts have been directed toward identifying failure scenarios within simulation environments. However, a critical question remains. Are the AV failure scenarios discovered in simulation reproducible on actual systems in the real world? The sim-to-real gap caused by differences between simulated and real sensor data means that failure scenarios identified in simulation might either be artifacts of synthetic sensor data or actual issues that also occur with real sensor data. To address this, an effective approach to validating simulated failure scenarios is to locate occurrences of these scenarios within real-world datasets and verify whether the failure persists on the datasets. To this end, we introduce a formal definition of how labeled time series sensor data can match an abstract scenario, represented as a scenario program using the Scenic probabilistic programming language. We present a querying algorithm that, given a scenario program and a labeled dataset, identifies the subset of data that matches the specified scenario. Our experiment shows that our algorithm is more accurate and orders of magnitude faster in querying scenarios than the state-of-the-art commercial vision large language models, and can scale with the duration of queried time series data.

*Hiroshi Nakano,Hiroaki Nishi*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: This paper introduces a history-aware trajectory k-anonymization method using an FPGA-based architecture for improved privacy protection in location-based services.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current shortest-path-based trajectory anonymization approaches fail to account for realistic travel behavior, reducing the utility of anonymized location-based data.

Method: Proposed a hardware architecture integrating history-based trajectory searches with shortest-path computations on an FPGA. Used a fixed-point counting module to prioritize commonly traveled routes.

Result: Achieved over 6,000 records/s real-time throughput, 1.2% improvement in data retention, and better preservation of major arterial roads compared to prior designs.

Conclusion: The proposed solution provides accurate, privacy-preserving, history-aware trajectory anonymization under strict real-time processing needs, enhancing data utility and behavioral fidelity.

Abstract: Our previous work established the feasibility of FPGA-based real-time trajectory anonymization, a critical task for protecting user privacy in modern location-based services (LBS). However, that pioneering approach relied exclusively on shortest-path computations, which can fail to capture re- alistic travel behavior and thus reduce the utility of the anonymized data. To address this limitation, this paper introduces a novel, history-aware trajectory k-anonymization methodology and presents an advanced FPGA-based hardware architecture to implement it. Our proposed architecture uniquely integrates par- allel history-based trajectory searches with conventional shortest- path finding, using a custom fixed-point counting module to ac- curately weigh contributions from historical data. This approach enables the system to prioritize behaviorally common routes over geometrically shorter but less-traveled paths. The FPGA implementation demonstrates that our new architecture achieves a real-time throughput of over 6,000 records/s, improves data retention by up to 1.2% compared to our previous shortest-path- only design, and preserves major arterial roads more effectively. These results signify a key advancement, enabling high-fidelity, history-aware anonymization that preserves both privacy and behavioral accuracy under the strict latency constraints of LBS.

*Hongqin Lyu,Yonghao Wang,Jiaxin Zhou,Zhiteng Chao,Tiancheng Wang,Huawei Li*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: AssertMiner is a framework for generating module-level assertions using AST-based data to improve large language model (LLM) performance in verification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing assertion generation methods lack focus on module-level details where design errors occur more frequently, necessitating a more granular verification approach.

Method: AssertMiner employs AST-based structural extraction to process module data such as call graphs, I/O tables, and dataflow graphs to guide LLMs in generating module-specific assertions.

Result: Evaluation shows AssertMiner outperforms methods like AssertLLM and Spec2Assertion in producing high-quality assertions, enhancing coverage and the ability to detect errors in verification.

Conclusion: AssertMiner significantly improves verification by addressing gaps at the micro-architectural level, enabling more comprehensive and effective logic design checks.

Abstract: Assertion-based verification (ABV) is a key approach to checking whether a logic design complies with its architectural specifications. Existing assertion generation methods based on design specifications typically produce only top-level assertions, overlooking verification needs on the implementation details in the modules at the micro-architectural level, where design errors occur more frequently. To address this limitation, we present AssertMiner, a module-level assertion generation framework that leverages static information generated from abstract syntax tree (AST) to assist LLMs in mining assertions. Specifically, it performs AST-based structural extraction to derive the module call graph, I/O table, and dataflow graph, guiding the LLM to generate module-level specifications and mine module-level assertions. Our evaluation demonstrates that AssertMiner outperforms existing methods such as AssertLLM and Spec2Assertion in generating high-quality assertions for modules. When integrated with these methods, AssertMiner can enhance the structural coverage and significantly improve the error detection capability, enabling a more comprehensive and efficient verification process.

The core principles essential for performance and energy efficiency, including dataflow optimization, advanced memory hierarchies, spar-sity, and quantization, are analyzed. Furthermore, this paper looks ahead to emerging technologies such as Processing-in-Memory (PIM) and neuromorphic computing, which may redefine future computation. By synthesizing architec-tural principles with quantitative performance data from industry-standard benchmarks, this survey presents a comprehensive picture of the AI accelerator landscape. We conclude that AI and computer architecture are in a symbiotic relationship, where hardware-software co-design is no longer an optimization but a necessity for future progress in computing.

Motivation: The increasing reliance on powerful computing systems, such as datacenters and supercomputers, necessitates innovative technology to ensure efficient and effective operation of interconnected nodes.

Conclusion: Efficient network operation requires thoughtful integration of congestion control and power management, ensuring reliable performance and energy efficiency in complex computing systems.

Abstract: The demand for computer in our daily lives has led to the proliferation of Datacenters that power indispensable many services.

The scale and complexity of these systems, compared to our day-to-day devices, are like comparing a cell to a living organism. To make them work properly, we need state-of-the-art technology and engineering, not just raw resources. Interconnecting the different computer nodes that make up a whole is a delicate task, as it can become the bottleneck for the whole infrastructure. In this work, we explore two aspects of the network: how to prevent degradation under heavy use with congestion control, and how to save energy when idle with power management; and how the two may interact.

*Seyed Hadi Mirfarshbafan,Christoph Studer*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: The paper addresses power and efficiency challenges in massive multiuser MIMO and mmWave systems by proposing beamspace processing techniques integrated with VLSI architectures, achieving significant power savings and throughput improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Future wireless systems require efficient physical layer technologies to handle increasing baseband processing costs and power consumption, which are challenges with massive MIMO and mmWave deployments.

Method: Beamspace processing is used to exploit channel sparsity at mmWave frequencies, combined with new VLSI architectures for data detection that optimize power and energy usage.

Result: The proposed CSPADE implementation demonstrates up to 54% power savings and higher throughput compared to existing massive MIMO data detectors. Sequential MAC-based architectures achieve up to 66% power savings.

Conclusion: The new algorithms and VLSI designs significantly enhance power, area, and energy efficiency for massive MIMO systems, offering practical implementation benefits for future wireless systems.

Abstract: Massive multiuser multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) and millimeter-wave (mmWave) communication are key physical layer technologies in future wireless systems. Their deployment, however, is expected to incur excessive baseband processing hardware cost and power consumption. Beamspace processing leverages the channel sparsity at mmWave frequencies to reduce baseband processing complexity. In this paper, we review existing beamspace data detection algorithms and propose new algorithms as well as corresponding VLSI architectures that reduce data detection power. We present VLSI implementation results for the proposed architectures in a 22nm FDSOI process. Our results demonstrate that a fully-parallelized implementation of the proposed complex sparsity-adaptive equalizer (CSPADE) achieves up to 54% power savings compared to antenna-domain equalization. Furthermore, our fully-parallelized designs achieve the highest reported throughput among existing massive MIMO data detectors, while achieving better energy and area efficiency. We also present a sequential multiply-accumulate (MAC)-based architecture for CSPADE, which enables even higher power savings, i.e., up to 66%, compared to a MAC-based antenna-domain equalizer.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Omnilingual ASR is a scalable automatic speech recognition system supporting over 1,600 languages, addressing low-resource language limitations and ethical concerns by leveraging community collaboration, self-supervised learning, and open-source access.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of ASR support for low-resource languages, which remain underserved due to prohibitive costs and restrictive architecture limitations.

Method: Omnilingual ASR employs self-supervised pre-training (7B parameters), an encoder-decoder architecture for zero-shot generalization, LLM-inspired decoding, and public/community-sourced recordings in training.

Result: The system covers over 1,600 languages (including 500 not previously supported), demonstrating improved performance in automatic evaluations, particularly for low-resource formats.

Conclusion: Omnilingual ASR provides extensibility for underserved languages and emphasizes ethical partnerships, releasing models as open-source to encourage global participation and access.

Abstract: Automatic speech recognition (ASR) has advanced in high-resource languages, but most of the world's 7,000+ languages remain unsupported, leaving thousands of long-tail languages behind. Expanding ASR coverage has been costly and limited by architectures that restrict language support, making extension inaccessible to most--all while entangled with ethical concerns when pursued without community collaboration. To transcend these limitations, we introduce Omnilingual ASR, the first large-scale ASR system designed for extensibility. Omnilingual ASR enables communities to introduce unserved languages with only a handful of data samples. It scales self-supervised pre-training to 7B parameters to learn robust speech representations and introduces an encoder-decoder architecture designed for zero-shot generalization, leveraging a LLM-inspired decoder. This capability is grounded in a massive and diverse training corpus; by combining breadth of coverage with linguistic variety, the model learns representations robust enough to adapt to unseen languages. Incorporating public resources with community-sourced recordings gathered through compensated local partnerships, Omnilingual ASR expands coverage to over 1,600 languages, the largest such effort to date--including over 500 never before served by ASR. Automatic evaluations show substantial gains over prior systems, especially in low-resource conditions, and strong generalization. We release Omnilingual ASR as a family of models, from 300M variants for low-power devices to 7B for maximum accuracy. We reflect on the ethical considerations shaping this design and conclude by discussing its societal impact. In particular, we highlight how open-sourcing models and tools can lower barriers for researchers and communities, inviting new forms of participation.

### [63] [Order Matters: Rethinking Prompt Construction in In-Context Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09700)
*Warren Li,Yiqian Wang,Zihan Wang,Jingbo Shang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates the impact of example ordering in in-context learning and finds it to be as significant as example selection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors challenge the assumption that example selection is more important than ordering in in-context learning (ICL).

Method: They conducted systematic and controlled experiments across various tasks, model sizes, and families to evaluate the influence of example ordering versus selection.

Result: The study demonstrates that example ordering affects performance as much as example selection and proposes a method that achieves performance close to an oracle using a development set.

Conclusion: The findings emphasize the intertwined significance of example selection and ordering, urging a reconsideration of ICL prompt design assumptions.

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) enables large language models to perform new tasks by conditioning on a sequence of examples. Most prior work reasonably and intuitively assumes that which examples are chosen has a far greater effect on performance than how those examples are ordered, leading to a focus on example selection. We revisit this assumption and conduct a systematic comparison between the effect of selection and ordering. Through controlled experiments on both classification and generation tasks, using multiple open-source model families (0.5B to 27B parameters) and GPT-5, we find that the variance in performance due to different example orderings is comparable to that from using entirely different example sets. Furthermore, we show that strong orderings can be identified using only a development set, achieving performance close to an oracle that selects the best ordering based on test labels. Our findings highlight the equal and intertwined importance of example selection and ordering in prompt design, calling for a reexamination of the assumptions held in ICL.

*Marisa Hudspeth,Patrick J. Burns,Brendan O'Connor*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper focuses on enhancing tokenization for Latin by using morphologically-aware methods, improving performance in downstream tasks, especially for out-of-domain texts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard tokenization methods often fall short for morphologically rich languages and poorly leverage linguistic resources, motivating the exploration of alternative morphologically-driven approaches.

Method: The authors employ morphologically-guided tokenization tailored for Latin, utilizing curated lexical resources to optimize alignment and improve language modeling outcomes.

Result: Morphologically-aware tokenization improves performance across four downstream tasks, with pronounced gains in generalization for out-of-domain texts.

Conclusion: Linguistic resources can greatly aid low-resource languages by enhancing tokenization and overall language modeling, as demonstrated by the notable improvements for Latin.

Abstract: Tokenization is a critical component of language model pretraining, yet standard tokenization methods often prioritize information-theoretical goals like high compression and low fertility rather than linguistic goals like morphological alignment. In fact, they have been shown to be suboptimal for morphologically rich languages, where tokenization quality directly impacts downstream performance. In this work, we investigate morphologically-aware tokenization for Latin, a morphologically rich language that is medium-resource in terms of pretraining data, but high-resource in terms of curated lexical resources -- a distinction that is often overlooked but critical in discussions of low-resource language modeling. We find that morphologically-guided tokenization improves overall performance on four downstream tasks. Performance gains are most pronounced for out of domain texts, highlighting our models' improved generalization ability. Our findings demonstrate the utility of linguistic resources to improve language modeling for morphologically complex languages. For low-resource languages that lack large-scale pretraining data, the development and incorporation of linguistic resources can serve as a feasible alternative to improve LM performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate NLP's ability to extract topics from large text corpuses and analyze its application in exploring significant signaling themes in Presidential Directives.

Method: Comparison of NLP-generated topic extractions with human-identified topics from Presidential Directives spanning the Reagan-Clinton administrations.

Result: NLP demonstrated potential in identifying relevant documents, but discrepancies with human analysis indicate further validation is needed.

Conclusion: While NLP shows promise in large-scale text analysis, its limitations, particularly the observed discrepancies, highlight the need for ongoing improvement of tools in this context.

Abstract: Our research investigates how Natural Language Processing (NLP) can be used to extract main topics from a larger corpus of written data, as applied to the case of identifying signaling themes in Presidential Directives (PDs) from the Reagan through Clinton administrations. Analysts and NLP both identified relevant documents, demonstrating the potential utility of NLPs in research involving large written corpuses. However, we also identified discrepancies between NLP and human-labeled results that indicate a need for more research to assess the validity of NLP in this use case. The research was conducted in 2023, and the rapidly evolving landscape of AIML means existing tools have improved and new tools have been developed; this research displays the inherent capabilities of a potentially dated AI tool in emerging social science applications.

### [66] [How Small Can You Go? Compact Language Models for On-Device Critical Error Detection in Machine Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09748)
*Muskaan Chopra,Lorenz Sparrenberg,Sarthak Khanna,Rafet Sifa*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper evaluates the ability of compact Language Models (LMs) for detecting critical translation errors in English-German machine translations, balancing quality and computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this paper is to address the limitations of deploying large-scale Language Models on edge devices or in privacy-sensitive workflows for translation error detection, focusing on compact, cost-efficient models.

Method: The paper benchmarks sub-2 billion parameter LMs on Critical Error Detection across datasets, standardizing prompts, applying calibration techniques, and using performance metrics such as MCC, F1 scores, latency, and VRAM usage.

Result: The study identifies one billion parameter models as a sweet spot, showing Gemma-3-1B achieves the best quality-efficiency trade-off with MCC=0.77 and F1-ERR=0.98, while larger models improve accuracy at higher compute costs. Small models underperform in certain error types.

Conclusion: Compact, instruction-tuned LMs, combined with lightweight calibration and small-sample supervision, offer reliable on-device translation error detection, enabling low-cost, privacy-aware screening in translation workflows.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at evaluating machine translation (MT), but their scale and cost hinder deployment on edge devices and in privacy-sensitive workflows. We ask: how small can you get while still detecting meaning-altering translation errors? Focusing on English->German Critical Error Detection (CED), we benchmark sub-2B models (LFM2-350M, Qwen-3-0.6B/1.7B, Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct, Gemma-3-1B) across WMT21, WMT22, and SynCED-EnDe-2025. Our framework standardizes prompts, applies lightweight logit-bias calibration and majority voting, and reports both semantic quality (MCC, F1-ERR/F1-NOT) and compute metrics (VRAM, latency, throughput). Results reveal a clear sweet spot around one billion parameters: Gemma-3-1B provides the best quality-efficiency trade-off, reaching MCC=0.77 with F1-ERR=0.98 on SynCED-EnDe-2025 after merged-weights fine-tuning, while maintaining 400 ms single-sample latency on a MacBook Pro M4 Pro (24 GB). At larger scale, Qwen-3-1.7B attains the highest absolute MCC (+0.11 over Gemma) but with higher compute cost. In contrast, ultra-small models (0.6B) remain usable with few-shot calibration yet under-detect entity and number errors. Overall, compact, instruction-tuned LLMs augmented with lightweight calibration and small-sample supervision can deliver trustworthy, on-device CED for MT, enabling private, low-cost error screening in real-world translation pipelines. All datasets, prompts, and scripts are publicly available at our GitHub repository.

*Rocco Tripodi,Xiaoyu Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper analyzes predicate-argument structures in parallel Chinese and English sentences, exploring alignment/misalignment and linguistic divergences, highlighting the asymmetry of language transfer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address challenges in cross-lingual NLP, particularly the issues caused by linguistic divergences when transferring knowledge between typologically distant languages.

Method: The authors conducted an analysis of predicate-argument structures using annotation projection experiments, switching the source language between Chinese and English, and performed both qualitative and quantitative evaluations.

Result: The analysis revealed that language transfer is asymmetric, indicating that careful selection of the source language is crucial in cross-lingual transfer learning.

Conclusion: Understanding predicate-argument structure divergences and the asymmetry of language transfer is essential for improving cross-lingual NLP, particularly for typologically distant languages.

Abstract: Cross-lingual Natural Language Processing (NLP) has gained significant traction in recent years, offering practical solutions in low-resource settings by transferring linguistic knowledge from resource-rich to low-resource languages. This field leverages techniques like annotation projection and model transfer for language adaptation, supported by multilingual pre-trained language models. However, linguistic divergences hinder language transfer, especially among typologically distant languages. In this paper, we present an analysis of predicate-argument structures in parallel Chinese and English sentences. We explore the alignment and misalignment of predicate annotations, inspecting similarities and differences and proposing a categorization of structural divergences. The analysis and the categorization are supported by a qualitative and quantitative analysis of the results of an annotation projection experiment, in which, in turn, one of the two languages has been used as source language to project annotations into the corresponding parallel sentences. The results of this analysis show clearly that language transfer is asymmetric. An aspect that requires attention when it comes to selecting the source language in transfer learning applications and that needs to be investigated before any scientific claim about cross-lingual NLP is proposed.

### [68] [TARG: Training-Free Adaptive Retrieval Gating for Efficient RAG](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09803)
*Yufeng Wang,Lu wei,Haibin Ling*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TARG (Training-free Adaptive Retrieval Gating) is introduced to decide when to retrieve in RAG, reducing token inflation and latency while balancing accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RAG retrieval for every query impacts quality, increases computation cost, and latency. TARG aims to optimize retrievals for efficiency while maintaining performance.

Method: TARG uses no-context draft's prefix logits to compute uncertainty scores (entropy, margin signal, variance) to determine retrieval necessity without extra training.

Result: TARG reduces retrieval frequency by 70-90%, improves efficiency, and either maintains or enhances accuracy (EM/F1) across datasets NQ-Open, TriviaQA, and PopQA.

Conclusion: TARG is a training-free method improving the accuracy-efficiency trade-off in retrieval-augmented systems, proving effective and adaptable across tuned LLMs.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) improves factuality but retrieving for every query often hurts quality while inflating tokens and latency. We propose Training-free Adaptive Retrieval Gating (TARG), a single-shot policy that decides when to retrieve using only a short, no-context draft from the base model. From the draft's prefix logits, TARG computes lightweight uncertainty scores: mean token entropy, a margin signal derived from the top-1/top-2 logit gap via a monotone link, or small-N variance across a handful of stochastic prefixes, and triggers retrieval only when the score exceeds a threshold. The gate is model agnostic, adds only tens to hundreds of draft tokens, and requires no additional training or auxiliary heads. On NQ-Open, TriviaQA, and PopQA, TARG consistently shifts the accuracy-efficiency frontier: compared with Always-RAG, TARG matches or improves EM/F1 while reducing retrieval by 70-90% and cutting end-to-end latency, and it remains close to Never-RAG in overhead. A central empirical finding is that under modern instruction-tuned LLMs the margin signal is a robust default (entropy compresses as backbones sharpen), with small-N variance offering a conservative, budget-first alternative. We provide ablations over gate type and prefix length and use a delta-latency view to make budget trade-offs explicit.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper develops a comprehensive solution for Khmer spellchecking, integrating multiple linguistic models and achieving a state-of-the-art accuracy of 94.4%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Spellchecking for Khmer language is underdeveloped due to misalignments, varied word forms, loosely formed compound words, and absence of NER models.

Method: The study integrates Khmer subword segmentation, NER, grapheme-to-phoneme conversion, and a language model to identify and rank correction candidates.

Result: The holistic approach achieves an accuracy improvement, reaching up to 94.4% in Khmer spellchecking tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses major challenges in Khmer spellchecking, setting a new accuracy benchmark, with datasets being made publicly available for further research.

Abstract: Compared to English and other high-resource languages, spellchecking for Khmer remains an unresolved problem due to several challenges. First, there are misalignments between words in the lexicon and the word segmentation model. Second, a Khmer word can be written in different forms. Third, Khmer compound words are often loosely and easily formed, and these compound words are not always found in the lexicon. Fourth, some proper nouns may be flagged as misspellings due to the absence of a Khmer named-entity recognition (NER) model. Unfortunately, existing solutions do not adequately address these challenges. This paper proposes a holistic approach to the Khmer spellchecking problem by integrating Khmer subword segmentation, Khmer NER, Khmer grapheme-to-phoneme (G2P) conversion, and a Khmer language model to tackle these challenges, identify potential correction candidates, and rank the most suitable candidate. Experimental results show that the proposed approach achieves a state-of-the-art Khmer spellchecking accuracy of up to 94.4%, compared to existing solutions. The benchmark datasets for Khmer spellchecking and NER tasks in this study will be made publicly available.

*Neo Wang,Sonit Singh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a question-answering system using a Large Language Model (LLM) fine-tuned with Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and multiple chain-of-thought reasoning to improve student query resolution in course forums.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address challenges in course forums where student queries face delayed or repetitive responses due to increased enrollment, by providing a scalable and accurate solution.

Method: The method involves fine-tuning an open-source Large Language Model (LLM) on course-specific datasets, utilizing a local knowledge base with Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) for retrieving relevant course content, and applying multi chain-of-thought reasoning to limit hallucinations within LLMs.

Result: Experiments on HotpotQA dataset showed that the fine-tuned LLM with RAG significantly improves question-answering performance.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates the potential of combining LLM, RAG, and structured reasoning to effectively address the challenges of scalable and accurate responses in course forums.

Abstract: The course forums are increasingly significant and play vital role in facilitating student discussions and answering their questions related to the course. It provides a platform for students to post their questions related to the content and admin issues related to the course. However, there are several challenges due to the increase in the number of students enrolled in the course. The primary challenge is that students' queries cannot be responded immediately and the instructors have to face lots of repetitive questions. To mitigate these issues, we propose a question answering system based on large language model with retrieval augmented generation (RAG) method. This work focuses on designing a question answering system with open source Large Language Model (LLM) and fine-tuning it on the relevant course dataset. To further improve the performance, we use a local knowledge base and applied RAG method to retrieve relevant documents relevant to students' queries, where the local knowledge base contains all the course content. To mitigate the hallucination of LLMs, We also integrate it with multi chain-of-thought reasoning to overcome the challenge of hallucination in LLMs. In this work, we experiment fine-tuned LLM with RAG method on the HotpotQA dataset. The experimental results demonstrate that the fine-tuned LLM with RAG method has a strong performance on question answering task.

*Yidan Sun,Mengying Zhu,Feiyue Chen,Yangyang Wu,Xiaolei Dan,Mengyuan Yang,Xiaolin Zheng,Shenglin Ben*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TermGPT is proposed to tackle the isotropy problem in LLM embedding spaces, enhancing term-level discrimination in legal and financial contexts through a multi-level contrastive fine-tuning framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models struggle with term-level discrimination, especially in specialized domains like legal and financial contexts, severely affecting downstream tasks such as legal judgment prediction or financial risk analysis.

Method: The authors design TermGPT, which involves constructing a sentence graph to capture semantic and structural relations, generating semantically relevant positive and negative samples, and applying multi-level contrastive learning at both the sentence and token levels for enhanced contextual and term-specific understanding.

Result: TermGPT outperforms existing baselines in tasks requiring term discrimination within financial and legal domains as demonstrated through experiments and a newly constructed financial terminology dataset.

Conclusion: TermGPT effectively addresses the isotropy issue in LLM embedding spaces and improves terminology-level discrimination in specialized domains, proving its utility in tasks requiring subtle semantic understanding.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance in text generation tasks; however, their embedding spaces often suffer from the isotropy problem, resulting in poor discrimination of domain-specific terminology, particularly in legal and financial contexts. This weakness in terminology-level representation can severely hinder downstream tasks such as legal judgment prediction or financial risk analysis, where subtle semantic distinctions are critical. To address this problem, we propose TermGPT, a multi-level contrastive fine-tuning framework designed for terminology adaptation. We first construct a sentence graph to capture semantic and structural relations, and generate semantically consistent yet discriminative positive and negative samples based on contextual and topological cues. We then devise a multi-level contrastive learning approach at both the sentence and token levels, enhancing global contextual understanding and fine-grained terminology discrimination. To support robust evaluation, we construct the first financial terminology dataset derived from official regulatory documents. Experiments show that TermGPT outperforms existing baselines in term discrimination tasks within the finance and legal domains.

*Mingye Zhu,Yi Liu,Zheren Fu,Quan Wang,Yongdong Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: InTRO optimizes token-level reasoning in LLMs using self-feedback and importance weights, increasing accuracy and reducing verbosity in reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving LLM reasoning processes while addressing issues with existing training methods that fail due to penalizing valid alternatives or the challenges of reinforcement learning.

Method: Uses "In-Token Rationality Optimization" involving token-level exploration and self-feedback alongside generative policy adjustments to select informative next tokens.

Result: InTRO increases solution accuracy by up to 20%, generates concise reasoning, and achieves cross-domain adaptability beyond mathematics.

Conclusion: The framework enables better reasoning, is computationally efficient, improves transfer across domains, and minimizes verbosity in outputs.

Abstract: Training Large Language Models (LLMs) for chain-of-thought reasoning presents a significant challenge: supervised fine-tuning on a single "golden" rationale hurts generalization as it penalizes equally valid alternatives, whereas reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards struggles with credit assignment and prohibitive computational cost. To tackle these limitations, we introduce InTRO (In-Token Rationality Optimization), a new framework that enables both token-level exploration and self-feedback for accurate and concise reasoning. Instead of directly optimizing an intractable objective over all valid reasoning paths, InTRO leverages correction factors-token-wise importance weights estimated by the information discrepancy between the generative policy and its answer-conditioned counterpart, for informative next token selection. This approach allows the model to perform token-level exploration and receive self-generated feedback within a single forward pass, ultimately encouraging accurate and concise rationales. Across six math-reasoning benchmarks, InTRO consistently outperforms other baselines, raising solution accuracy by up to 20% relative to the base model. Its chains of thought are also notably more concise, exhibiting reduced verbosity. Beyond this, InTRO enables cross-domain transfer, successfully adapting to out-of-domain reasoning tasks that extend beyond the realm of mathematics, demonstrating robust generalization.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes HierRouter, a hierarchical routing method enhancing performance and efficiency of inference using lightweight language models, achieving superior results with reduced costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Language Models face computational and memory challenges, especially in resource-constrained or real-time applications, necessitating efficient alternatives.

Method: HierRouter uses hierarchical routing with lightweight language models organized as a Markov Decision Process. A reinforcement learning agent with Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) dynamically selects models for multi-hop inference by considering context and cost.

Result: HierRouter improves response quality up to 2.4x across benchmarks like QA, code generation, and mathematical reasoning while maintaining minimal additional inference cost.

Conclusion: HierRouter demonstrates an efficient solution for optimizing performance and cost in LLM inference, highlighting the potential of hierarchical routing strategies.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) deliver state-of-the-art performance across many tasks but impose high computational and memory costs, limiting their deployment in resource-constrained or real-time settings. To address this, we propose HierRouter, a hierarchical routing approach that dynamically assembles inference pipelines from a pool of specialized, lightweight language models. Formulated as a finite-horizon Markov Decision Process (MDP), our approach trains a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)-based reinforcement learning agent to iteratively select which models to invoke at each stage of multi-hop inference. The agent conditions on the evolving context and accumulated cost to make context-aware routing decisions. Experiments with three open-source candidate LLMs across six benchmarks, including QA, code generation, and mathematical reasoning, show that HierRouter improves response quality by up to 2.4x compared to using individual models independently, while incurring only a minimal additional inference cost on average. These results highlight the promise of hierarchical routing for cost-efficient, high-performance LLM inference. All codes can be found here https://github.com/ Nikunj-Gupta/hierouter.

*Jialin Wu,Kecen Li,Zhicong Huang,Xinfeng Li,Xiaofeng Wang,Cheng Hong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces EnchTable, a framework to maintain safety alignment during the fine-tuning of large language models without extensive retraining, focusing on utility and safety.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the vulnerability of compromised safety alignment in fine-tuned large language models for specialized domains.

Method: A Neural Tangent Kernel-based safety vector distillation method and interference-aware merging technique are used to decouple safety from task-specific reasoning, ensuring broader applicability and performance balance.

Result: Experiments across eleven datasets and three LLM architectures show enhanced safety, utility, resistance to adversarial attacks, and applicability compared to competitor methods.

Conclusion: EnchTable successfully preserves safety alignment while maintaining task performance in diverse domains, offering universal applicability and effective risk mitigation for LLMs.

Abstract: Many machine learning models are fine-tuned from large language models (LLMs) to achieve high performance in specialized domains like code generation, biomedical analysis, and mathematical problem solving. However, this fine-tuning process often introduces a critical vulnerability: the systematic degradation of safety alignment, undermining ethical guidelines and increasing the risk of harmful outputs. Addressing this challenge, we introduce EnchTable, a novel framework designed to transfer and maintain safety alignment in downstream LLMs without requiring extensive retraining. EnchTable leverages a Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK)-based safety vector distillation method to decouple safety constraints from task-specific reasoning, ensuring compatibility across diverse model architectures and sizes. Additionally, our interference-aware merging technique effectively balances safety and utility, minimizing performance compromises across various task domains. We implemented a fully functional prototype of EnchTable on three different task domains and three distinct LLM architectures, and evaluated its performance through extensive experiments on eleven diverse datasets, assessing both utility and model safety. Our evaluations include LLMs from different vendors, demonstrating EnchTable's generalization capability. Furthermore, EnchTable exhibits robust resistance to static and dynamic jailbreaking attacks, outperforming vendor-released safety models in mitigating adversarial prompts. Comparative analyses with six parameter modification methods and two inference-time alignment baselines reveal that EnchTable achieves a significantly lower unsafe rate, higher utility score, and universal applicability across different task domains. Additionally, we validate EnchTable can be seamlessly integrated into various deployment pipelines without significant overhead.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces HI-TransPA, an instruction-driven audio-visual assistant for hearing-impaired communication, leveraging an Omni-Model framework to improve translation and dialogue capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of effective assistive communication tools for hearing-impaired individuals capable of handling multimodal data and noisy environments.

Method: Developed HI-TransPA with a preprocessing pipeline for multimodal data quality assessment, a curriculum learning strategy, and novel SigLIP encoder combined with Unified 3D-Resampler for high-frame-rate lip motion.

Result: HI-TransPA demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in accuracy and semantic fidelity on the HI-Dialogue dataset.

Conclusion: This work advances assistive communication technology by introducing an Omni-Model for hearing-impaired individuals, establishing a robust framework for future research.

Abstract: To provide a unified and flexible solution for daily communication among hearing-impaired individuals, we introduce the Omni-Model paradigm into assistive technology and present HI-TransPA, an instruction-driven audio-visual personal assistant. The model fuses indistinct speech with high-frame-rate lip dynamics, enabling both translation and dialogue within a single multimodal framework. To tackle the challenges of noisy and heterogeneous raw data and the limited adaptability of existing Omni-Models to hearing-impaired speech, we construct a comprehensive preprocessing and curation pipeline that detects facial landmarks, isolates and stabilizes the lip region, and quantitatively assesses multimodal sample quality. These quality scores guide a curriculum learning strategy that first trains on clean, high-confidence samples and progressively incorporates harder cases to strengthen model robustness. We further adopt a SigLIP encoder combined with a Unified 3D-Resampler to efficiently encode high-frame-rate lip motion. Experiments on our purpose-built HI-Dialogue dataset show that HI-TransPA achieves state-of-the-art performance in both literal accuracy and semantic fidelity. This work establishes a foundation for applying Omni-Models to assistive communication technology, providing an end-to-end modeling framework and essential processing tools for future research.

*Pritish Sahu,Anirudh Som,Dimitra Vergyri,Ajay Divakaran*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces Norm-RAG, a framework for inferring social norms in multi-turn dialogues, using structured normative documentation and a bilingual dataset named MINDS.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations of computational models in understanding culturally diverse, multi-turn social norms in dialogues.

Method: Norm-RAG employs a retrieval-augmented framework with Semantic Chunking for grounding norms, coupled with MINDS dataset for annotated norm adherence tracking across conversations.

Result: Norm-RAG enhances norm detection, generalization, and cross-cultural understanding in dialogue systems.

Conclusion: Norm-RAG offers a culturally adaptive and context-aware solution improving the reasoning accuracy of social norms in multilingual, real-world dialogues.

Abstract: Social norms are implicit, culturally grounded expectations that guide interpersonal communication. Unlike factual commonsense, norm reasoning is subjective, context-dependent, and varies across cultures, posing challenges for computational models. Prior works provide valuable normative annotations but mostly target isolated utterances or synthetic dialogues, limiting their ability to capture the fluid, multi-turn nature of real-world conversations. In this work, we present Norm-RAG, a retrieval-augmented, agentic framework for nuanced social norm inference in multi-turn dialogues. Norm-RAG models utterance-level attributes including communicative intent, speaker roles, interpersonal framing, and linguistic cues and grounds them in structured normative documentation retrieved via a novel Semantic Chunking approach. This enables interpretable and context-aware reasoning about norm adherence and violation across multilingual dialogues. We further introduce MINDS (Multilingual Interactions with Norm-Driven Speech), a bilingual dataset comprising 31 multi-turn Mandarin-English and Spanish-English conversations. Each turn is annotated for norm category and adherence status using multi-annotator consensus, reflecting cross-cultural and realistic norm expression. Our experiments show that Norm-RAG improves norm detection and generalization, demonstrates improved performance for culturally adaptive and socially intelligent dialogue systems.

### [78] [Leveraging Large Language Models for Identifying Knowledge Components](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09935)
*Canwen Wang,Jionghao Lin,Kenneth R. Koedinger*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper explores automating Knowledge Component (KC) identification using Large Language Models (LLMs), addressing redundancy through a semantic merging technique.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual KC identification by domain experts is a bottleneck in adaptive learning systems, motivating exploration of automation via LLMs.

Method: The paper scales a 'simulated textbook' prompting strategy to a larger dataset, evaluates against expert design, and employs cosine similarity for semantic merging of KC labels.

Result: Initially, LLM-generated KCs were excessive and less effective than expert models (RMSE worse). Semantic merging reduced redundancy and improved RMSE performance.

Conclusion: Automated KC identification is promising but requires refinement techniques like semantic merging for effective application in adaptive learning systems.

Abstract: Knowledge Components (KCs) are foundational to adaptive learning systems, but their manual identification by domain experts is a significant bottleneck. While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising avenue for automating this process, prior research has been limited to small datasets and has been shown to produce superfluous, redundant KC labels. This study addresses these limitations by first scaling a "simulated textbook" LLM prompting strategy (using GPT-4o-mini) to a larger dataset of 646 multiple-choice questions. We found that this initial automated approach performed significantly worse than an expert-designed KC model (RMSE 0.4285 vs. 0.4206) and generated an excessive number of KCs (569 vs. 101). To address the issue of redundancy, we proposed and evaluated a novel method for merging semantically similar KC labels based on their cosine similarity. This merging strategy significantly improved the model's performance; a model using a cosine similarity threshold of 0.8 achieved the best result, reducing the KC count to 428 and improving the RMSE to 0.4259. This demonstrates that while scaled LLM generation alone is insufficient, combining it with a semantic merging technique offers a viable path toward automating and refining KC identification.

### [79] [REAP: Enhancing RAG with Recursive Evaluation and Adaptive Planning for Multi-Hop Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09966)
*Yijie Zhu,Haojie Zhou,Wanting Hong,Tailin Liu,Ning Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces REAP, a framework that optimizes multi-hop reasoning tasks in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) by utilizing structured sub-task planning and fact extraction. It enhances reasoning reliability and performance in complex scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the limitations of existing RAG methods in multi-hop reasoning tasks, including local reasoning impasses and underutilization of retrieved content, which affect the accuracy and reliability of the reasoning process.

Method: The proposed method, REAP, consists of two main modules: Sub-task Planner (SP), which maintains a global perspective for reasoning direction, and Fact Extractor (FE), which extracts reliable answers and latent clues from retrieved content. Together, these modules facilitate global knowledge enrichment and dynamic trajectory optimization.

Result: Extensive experiments on multiple public datasets show that REAP outperforms existing RAG methods in both in-domain and out-of-domain settings, demonstrating its superiority in handling complex multi-hop reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: REAP enhances the reliability, traceability, and accuracy of multi-hop reasoning processes, addressing key limitations of existing approaches and offering substantial improvements in performance across various datasets.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has been extensively employed to mitigate hallucinations in large language models (LLMs). However, existing methods for multi-hop reasoning tasks often lack global planning, increasing the risk of falling into local reasoning impasses. Insufficient exploitation of retrieved content and the neglect of latent clues fail to ensure the accuracy of reasoning outcomes. To overcome these limitations, we propose Recursive Evaluation and Adaptive Planning (REAP), whose core idea is to explicitly maintain structured sub-tasks and facts related to the current task through the Sub-task Planner (SP) and Fact Extractor (FE) modules. SP maintains a global perspective, guiding the overall reasoning direction and evaluating the task state based on the outcomes of FE, enabling dynamic optimization of the task-solving trajectory. FE performs fine-grained analysis over retrieved content to extract reliable answers and clues. These two modules incrementally enrich a logically coherent representation of global knowledge, enhancing the reliability and the traceability of the reasoning process. Furthermore, we propose a unified task paradigm design that enables effective multi-task fine-tuning, significantly enhancing SP's performance on complex, data-scarce tasks. We conduct extensive experiments on multiple public multi-hop datasets, and the results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing RAG methods in both in-domain and out-of-domain settings, validating its effectiveness in complex multi-hop reasoning tasks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Current language models, including leading systems, struggle with numerical reasoning and robustness in fact-checking tasks, experiencing significant accuracy drops under perturbations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate the robustness and accuracy of language models in numerical reasoning tasks, addressing limitations in their handling of numerical claims and evidence.

Method: Controlled perturbation techniques, including label-flipping probes, were applied to systematically assess model robustness in numerical fact-checking scenarios.

Result: Leading language models showed drastic accuracy reductions under certain perturbations, with recovery observed in cases using enriched extended contexts.

Conclusion: Numerical reasoning and fact-checking remain significant challenges for language models, indicating the need for enhancements in robustness and task reliability.

Abstract: Large language models show strong performance on knowledge intensive tasks such as fact-checking and question answering, yet they often struggle with numerical reasoning. We present a systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art models for veracity prediction on numerical claims and evidence pairs using controlled perturbations, including label-flipping probes, to test robustness. Our results indicate that even leading proprietary systems experience accuracy drops of up to 62\% under certain perturbations. No model proves to be robust across all conditions. We further find that increasing context length generally reduces accuracy, but when extended context is enriched with perturbed demonstrations, most models substantially recover. These findings highlight critical limitations in numerical fact-checking and suggest that robustness remains an open challenge for current language models.

### [81] [Modeling Uncertainty Trends for Timely Retrieval in Dynamic RAG](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09980)
*Bo Li,Tian Tian,Zhenghua Xu,Hao Cheng,Shikun Zhang,Wei Ye*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents Entropy-Trend Constraint (ETC), a new training-free method for improving retrieval timing in dynamic retrieval-augmented generation by modeling uncertainty trends.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of optimal timing for external knowledge retrieval in dynamic retrieval-augmented generation, as existing methods rely on low token-level confidence that often delays retrieval.

Method: The proposed method, ETC, uses first- and second-order differences in entropy trends to proactively identify uncertainty, allowing earlier and more precise retrieval during LLM generation.

Result: ETC outperforms existing baseline methods in six QA benchmarks with three different LLMs. It reduces the frequency of retrieval and generalizes effectively across domains.

Conclusion: ETC improves retrieval timing in a plug-and-play, model-agnostic way, demonstrating robust performance and trend-aware uncertainty modeling to enhance dynamic RAG systems.

Abstract: Dynamic retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) allows large language models (LLMs) to fetch external knowledge on demand, offering greater adaptability than static RAG. A central challenge in this setting lies in determining the optimal timing for retrieval. Existing methods often trigger retrieval based on low token-level confidence, which may lead to delayed intervention after errors have already propagated. We introduce Entropy-Trend Constraint (ETC), a training-free method that determines optimal retrieval timing by modeling the dynamics of token-level uncertainty. Specifically, ETC utilizes first- and second-order differences of the entropy sequence to detect emerging uncertainty trends, enabling earlier and more precise retrieval. Experiments on six QA benchmarks with three LLM backbones demonstrate that ETC consistently outperforms strong baselines while reducing retrieval frequency. ETC is particularly effective in domain-specific scenarios, exhibiting robust generalization capabilities. Ablation studies and qualitative analyses further confirm that trend-aware uncertainty modeling yields more effective retrieval timing. The method is plug-and-play, model-agnostic, and readily integrable into existing decoding pipelines. Implementation code is included in the supplementary materials.

*Bo Li,Zhenghua Xu,Rui Xie*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses language drift in multilingual retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), proposing Soft Constrained Decoding (SCD) to improve language alignment without requiring additional training or modifications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address language drift in multilingual RAG systems, where responses unintentionally shift to unintended languages, especially during reasoning-intensive tasks like Chain-of-Thought generation.

Method: The authors propose Soft Constrained Decoding (SCD), a decoding strategy that penalizes non-target-language tokens. This approach is lightweight, training-free, and can be applied to any model architecture or generation algorithm.

Result: Experiments across multilingual datasets show that SCD improves language alignment and task performance across diverse languages, preventing unintended language generation.

Conclusion: SCD provides an effective and generalizable solution to mitigate language drift in multilingual RAG systems, enhancing language alignment and task performance without model modifications or additional training data.

Abstract: Multilingual Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enables large language models (LLMs) to perform knowledge-intensive tasks in multilingual settings by leveraging retrieved documents as external evidence. However, when the retrieved evidence differs in language from the user query and in-context exemplars, the model often exhibits language drift by generating responses in an unintended language. This phenomenon is especially pronounced during reasoning-intensive decoding, such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT) generation, where intermediate steps introduce further language instability. In this paper, we systematically study output language drift in multilingual RAG across multiple datasets, languages, and LLM backbones. Our controlled experiments reveal that the drift results not from comprehension failure but from decoder-level collapse, where dominant token distributions and high-frequency English patterns dominate the intended generation language. We further observe that English serves as a semantic attractor under cross-lingual conditions, emerging as both the strongest interference source and the most frequent fallback language.
  To mitigate this, we propose Soft Constrained Decoding (SCD), a lightweight, training-free decoding strategy that gently steers generation toward the target language by penalizing non-target-language tokens. SCD is model-agnostic and can be applied to any generation algorithm without modifying the architecture or requiring additional data. Experiments across three multilingual datasets and multiple typologically diverse languages show that SCD consistently improves language alignment and task performance, providing an effective and generalizable solution in multilingual RAG.

*Yu-Shiang Huang,Yun-Yu Lee,Tzu-Hsin Chou,Che Lin,Chuan-Ju Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper identifies that BERTScore is ineffective in handling numerical variations in finance-related texts, introduces a dataset FinNuE to analyze this weakness, and calls for better evaluation frameworks in financial NLP.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study is motivated by the need to improve semantic similarity metrics like BERTScore, which is insufficiently sensitive to numerical variations crucial in finance.

Method: The authors develop a diagnostic dataset, FinNuE, with controlled numerical variations extracted from financial contexts such as earnings calls, regulatory filings, social media, and news articles.

Result: Using FinNuE, they show that BERTScore inaccurately evaluates texts with differing numerical details, exposing its inability to handle financially relevant numerical distinctions.

Conclusion: The authors conclude that embedding-based metrics like BERTScore are unsuitable for finance, emphasizing the need for numerically-aware evaluation approaches tailored for financial applications.

Abstract: BERTScore has become a widely adopted metric for evaluating semantic similarity between natural language sentences. However, we identify a critical limitation: BERTScore exhibits low sensitivity to numerical variation, a significant weakness in finance where numerical precision directly affects meaning (e.g., distinguishing a 2% gain from a 20% loss). We introduce FinNuE, a diagnostic dataset constructed with controlled numerical perturbations across earnings calls, regulatory filings, social media, and news articles. Using FinNuE, demonstrate that BERTScore fails to distinguish semantically critical numerical differences, often assigning high similarity scores to financially divergent text pairs. Our findings reveal fundamental limitations of embedding-based metrics for finance and motivate numerically-aware evaluation frameworks for financial NLP.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces "PustakAI" and a new dataset "NCERT-QA" to align large language models with NCERT curriculum specifically for grades 6–8 in English and Science, addressing challenges in accuracy, alignment, and relevance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to adapt large language models (LLMs) for personalized, curriculum-specific learning in regions like India, where educational resources are limited, ensuring alignment with curricula like NCERT to improve accessibility and education quality.

Method: The paper creates a framework, "PustakAI", and designs the NCERT-QA dataset classified into Factoid, Inferential, and Other question types. It evaluates different prompting techniques (meta-prompt, few-shot, CoT-style) and measures model performance on both open-source and high-end LLMs.

Result: Findings reveal the strengths and weaknesses of popular LLMs (from open-source to high-end), evaluating their ability to handle QA tasks aligned with the NCERT curriculum across different prompting techniques.

Conclusion: The study highlights how well LLMs align with curriculum-based datasets like NCERT-QA, identifies the best techniques and models for effective adoption in education, and provides insights into improving LLM-driven educational tools.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in understanding and generating human-like content. This has revolutionized various sectors such as healthcare, software development, and education. In education, LLMs offer potential for personalized and interactive learning experiences, especially in regions with limited teaching resources. However, adapting these models effectively to curriculum-specific content, such as the National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) syllabus in India, presents unique challenges in terms of accuracy, alignment, and pedagogical relevance. In this paper, we present the framework "PustakAI"\footnote{Pustak means `book' in many Indian languages.} for the design and evaluation of a novel question-answering dataset "NCERT-QA" aligned with the NCERT curriculum for English and Science subjects of grades 6 to 8. We classify the curated QA pairs as Factoid, Inferential, and Others (evaluative and reasoning). We evaluate the dataset with various prompting techniques, such as meta-prompt, few-shot, and CoT-style prompting, using diverse evaluation metrics to understand which approach aligns more efficiently with the structure and demands of the curriculum. Along with the usability of the dataset, we analyze the strengths and limitations of current open-source LLMs (Gemma3:1b, Llama3.2:3b, and Nemotron-mini:4b) and high-end LLMs (Llama-4-Scout-17B and Deepseek-r1-70B) as AI-based learning tools in formal education systems.

*Jiangshu Du,Wenpeng Yin,Philip Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ScaleFormer addresses limitations in Transformer's quadratic complexity for long-context tasks by segmenting inputs into chunks and enriching representations with cumulative context. It achieves linear complexity and outperforms state-of-the-art summarization methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to adapt Transformer-based models for processing long sequences due to their quadratic complexity, without requiring architectural modifications or costly pre-training.

Method: This method splits long inputs into overlapping chunks, creates context-aware representations, and uses a fusion mechanism to enrich chunk boundaries with cumulative context vectors for structural awareness.

Result: ScaleFormer demonstrated competitive performance, often surpassing state-of-the-art summarization methods, while maintaining a plug-and-play adaptability.

Conclusion: ScaleFormer enables effective long-format reasoning and summarization for pre-trained models by achieving linear complexity and leveraging cumulative context.

Abstract: The quadratic complexity of standard self-attention severely limits the application of Transformer-based models to long-context tasks. While efficient Transformer variants exist, they often require architectural changes and costly pre-training from scratch. To circumvent this, we propose ScaleFormer(Span Representation Cumulation for Long-Context Transformer) - a simple and effective plug-and-play framework that adapts off-the-shelf pre-trained encoder-decoder models to process long sequences without requiring architectural modifications. Our approach segments long inputs into overlapping chunks and generates a compressed, context-aware representation for the decoder. The core of our method is a novel, parameter-free fusion mechanism that endows each chunk's representation with structural awareness of its position within the document. It achieves this by enriching each chunk's boundary representations with cumulative context vectors from all preceding and succeeding chunks. This strategy provides the model with a strong signal of the document's narrative flow, achieves linear complexity, and enables pre-trained models to reason effectively over long-form text. Experiments on long-document summarization show that our method is highly competitive with and often outperforms state-of-the-art approaches without requiring architectural modifications or external retrieval mechanisms.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores sound symbolism in languages using Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) by analyzing their phoneme-level attention. A new dataset, LEX-ICON, was created and revealed the alignment of MLLMs with linguistic research and their focus on iconic phonemes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) interpret auditory information in languages and to bridge the gap between artificial intelligence and cognitive linguistics through the large-scale analysis of phonetic iconicity.

Method: The authors used MLLMs to analyze phonetic iconicity in textual and auditory inputs. They introduced LEX-ICON, a dataset with 8,052 mimetic words from four languages and 2,930 pseudo-words, annotated with semantic features, analyzing models' layer-wise attention fraction scores.

Result: MLLMs demonstrated phonetic intuitions consistent with linguistic research across semantic dimensions. They also highlighted phonosemantic attention patterns with a focus on iconic phonemes, showcasing MLLM interpretability.

Conclusion: MLLMs effectively process and align with sound symbolism in human languages, providing insights into artificial intelligence and cognitive linguistics. This study offers the first large-scale analysis of phonetic iconicity using MLLMs.

Abstract: Sound symbolism is a linguistic concept that refers to non-arbitrary associations between phonetic forms and their meanings. We suggest that this can be a compelling probe into how Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) interpret auditory information in human languages. We investigate MLLMs' performance on phonetic iconicity across textual (orthographic and IPA) and auditory forms of inputs with up to 25 semantic dimensions (e.g., sharp vs. round), observing models' layer-wise information processing by measuring phoneme-level attention fraction scores. To this end, we present LEX-ICON, an extensive mimetic word dataset consisting of 8,052 words from four natural languages (English, French, Japanese, and Korean) and 2,930 systematically constructed pseudo-words, annotated with semantic features applied across both text and audio modalities. Our key findings demonstrate (1) MLLMs' phonetic intuitions that align with existing linguistic research across multiple semantic dimensions and (2) phonosemantic attention patterns that highlight models' focus on iconic phonemes. These results bridge domains of artificial intelligence and cognitive linguistics, providing the first large-scale, quantitative analyses of phonetic iconicity in terms of MLLMs' interpretability.

*Zhenhe Li,Can Lin,Ling Zheng,Wen-Da Wei,Junli Liang,Qi Song*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces GraphIF, a framework designed to improve multi-turn instruction-following in conversational AI systems by utilizing graph structures to model dialogues and refine responses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing instruction-tuned LLMs struggle with multi-turn dialogues and complex long-distance relational constraints, as they treat response generation as isolated tasks without focusing on inter-turn dynamics.

Method: GraphIF models dialogues as directed relation graphs using three components: (1) agent-based relation extraction to capture semantic relations across turns, (2) graph prompt generation to translate graph information into language prompts, and (3) response rewriting to refine output using these prompts.

Result: GraphIF improves multi-turn instruction-following performance significantly, as demonstrated by experiments on two long multi-turn dialogue datasets.

Conclusion: GraphIF demonstrates the value of graph-based modeling for multi-turn dialogues and provides a plug-and-play method to enhance the accuracy of instruction-tuned LLMs without requiring massive additional data collection.

Abstract: Multi-turn instruction following is essential for building intelligent conversational systems that can consistently adhere to instructions across dialogue turns. However, existing approaches to enhancing multi-turn instruction following primarily rely on collecting or generating large-scale multi-turn dialogue datasets to fine-tune large language models (LLMs), which treat each response generation as an isolated task and fail to explicitly incorporate multi-turn instruction following into the optimization objectives. As a result, instruction-tuned LLMs often struggle with complex long-distance constraints. In multi-turn dialogues, relational constraints across turns can be naturally modeled as labeled directed edges, making graph structures particularly suitable for modeling multi-turn instruction following. Despite this potential, leveraging graph structures to enhance the multi-turn instruction following capabilities of LLMs remains unexplored. To bridge this gap, we propose GraphIF, a plug-and-play framework that models multi-turn dialogues as directed relation graphs and leverages graph prompts to enhance the instruction following capabilities of LLMs. GraphIF comprises three key components: (1) an agent-based relation extraction module that captures inter-turn semantic relations via action-triggered mechanisms to construct structured graphs; (2) a relation graph prompt generation module that converts structured graph information into natural language prompts; and (3) a response rewriting module that refines initial LLM outputs using the generated graph prompts. Extensive experiments on two long multi-turn dialogue datasets demonstrate that GraphIF can be seamlessly integrated into instruction-tuned LLMs and leads to significant improvements across all four multi-turn instruction-following evaluation metrics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a more extensive Arabic Dialect Identification dataset covering all Arabic-speaking countries and facilitate advancements in ADI research.

Method: The authors expanded the ADI-17 dataset to include 3,556 hours of audio from 19 dialects plus MSA, and trained models like ECAPA-TDNN and modified Whisper with attention pooling layers.

Result: Results indicated that reducing training data by 70% resulted in a minor decrease in F1 scores, showcasing model robustness.

Conclusion: ADI-20 and accompanying models are open-sourced to encourage reproducibility and further investigations in ADI tasks.

Abstract: We present ADI-20, an extension of the previously published ADI-17 Arabic Dialect Identification (ADI) dataset. ADI-20 covers all Arabic-speaking countries' dialects. It comprises 3,556 hours from 19 Arabic dialects in addition to Modern Standard Arabic (MSA). We used this dataset to train and evaluate various state-of-the-art ADI systems. We explored fine-tuning pre-trained ECAPA-TDNN-based models, as well as Whisper encoder blocks coupled with an attention pooling layer and a classification dense layer. We investigated the effect of (i) training data size and (ii) the model's number of parameters on identification performance. Our results show a small decrease in F1 score while using only 30% of the original training data. We open-source our collected data and trained models to enable the reproduction of our work, as well as support further research in ADI.

TL;DR: This paper evaluates the ability of multimodal large language models (LLMs) to verify scientific claims using tables and charts as evidence, revealing performance disparities across evidence types.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scientific claims are often presented in diverse formats like tables and charts, creating a challenge for robust evaluation systems. The motivation is to investigate how effectively multimodal LLMs can verify scientific claims across different evidence formats.

Method: The authors adapted two datasets with necessary annotations for multimodal claim verification and tested 12 multimodal LLMs on tables and charts. They also compared model performance with human evaluations.

Result: The study found that multimodal LLMs perform well with table-based evidence but struggle significantly with chart-based evidence. Smaller models particularly show limited cross-modal generalization.

Conclusion: Current multimodal LLMs have a critical gap in reasoning with charts, underscoring the need for future models to emphasize improving chart understanding for scientific claim verification.

Abstract: With the growing number of submitted scientific papers, there is an increasing demand for systems that can assist reviewers in evaluating research claims. Experimental results are a core component of scientific work, often presented in varying formats such as tables or charts. Understanding how robust current multimodal large language models (multimodal LLMs) are at verifying scientific claims across different evidence formats remains an important and underexplored challenge. In this paper, we design and conduct a series of experiments to assess the ability of multimodal LLMs to verify scientific claims using both tables and charts as evidence. To enable this evaluation, we adapt two existing datasets of scientific papers by incorporating annotations and structures necessary for a multimodal claim verification task. Using this adapted dataset, we evaluate 12 multimodal LLMs and find that current models perform better with table-based evidence while struggling with chart-based evidence. We further conduct human evaluations and observe that humans maintain strong performance across both formats, unlike the models. Our analysis also reveals that smaller multimodal LLMs (under 8B) show weak correlation in performance between table-based and chart-based tasks, indicating limited cross-modal generalization. These findings highlight a critical gap in current models' multimodal reasoning capabilities. We suggest that future multimodal LLMs should place greater emphasis on improving chart understanding to better support scientific claim verification.

Result: Achieved 79.83% ADI accuracy, and average WER of 38.54% and CER of 14.53% for ASR on test datasets.

Conclusion: Large pre-trained speech models combined with targeted fine-tuning significantly enhance multi-dialectal Arabic speech processing performance.

Abstract: This paper describes Elyadata \& LIA's joint submission to the NADI multi-dialectal Arabic Speech Processing 2025. We participated in the Spoken Arabic Dialect Identification (ADI) and multi-dialectal Arabic ASR subtasks. Our submission ranked first for the ADI subtask and second for the multi-dialectal Arabic ASR subtask among all participants. Our ADI system is a fine-tuned Whisper-large-v3 encoder with data augmentation. This system obtained the highest ADI accuracy score of \textbf{79.83\%} on the official test set. For multi-dialectal Arabic ASR, we fine-tuned SeamlessM4T-v2 Large (Egyptian variant) separately for each of the eight considered dialects. Overall, we obtained an average WER and CER of \textbf{38.54\%} and \textbf{14.53\%}, respectively, on the test set. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of large pre-trained speech models with targeted fine-tuning for Arabic speech processing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the potential of GPT-based large language models in military use cases.

Method: The study analyzes Microsoft Copilot's insights regarding military applications and examines the feasibility of implementing such applications using Microsoft Azure cloud services.

Result: GPT-based systems have strong potential in summarization, content generation, and other tailored military applications.

First, we interrogate a GPT-based language model (viz. Microsoft Copilot) to make it reveal its own knowledge about their potential military applications and then critically assess the information. Second, we study how commercial cloud services (viz. Microsoft Azure) could be used readily to build such applications and assess which of them are feasible. We conclude that the summarization and generative properties of language models directly facilitate many applications at large and other features may find particular uses.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of event-related biases in social media disaster monitoring tools, which hinders their generalization to new disasters.

Method: The proposed method applies causal learning to reduce biases related to events and domains, improving system performance.

Result: The method achieves up to +1.9% F1 improvement over multiple baselines and significantly enhances a PLM-based classifier across three disaster classification tasks.

Conclusion: Causal-based bias mitigation is effective in improving the generalization ability of disaster event monitoring systems in social media platforms.

Abstract: Due to the rapid growth of social media platforms, these tools have become essential for monitoring information during ongoing disaster events. However, extracting valuable insights requires real-time processing of vast amounts of data. A major challenge in existing systems is their exposure to event-related biases, which negatively affects their ability to generalize to emerging events. While recent advancements in debiasing and causal learning offer promising solutions, they remain underexplored in the disaster event domain. In this work, we approach bias mitigation through a causal lens and propose a method to reduce event- and domain-related biases, enhancing generalization to future events. Our approach outperforms multiple baselines by up to +1.9% F1 and significantly improves a PLM-based classifier across three disaster classification tasks.

*Yiran Zhang,Mingyang Lin,Mark Dras,Usman Naseem*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces VISTA, a visualization tool to analyze LLM reasoning in multi-turn tasks, reducing complexity and enabling better understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Research struggles to analyze reasoning in multi-turn LLM tasks due to complex dependencies and lack of visualization tools.

Method: Developed VISTA, a web-based interactive system that visualizes reasoning processes, allows 'what-if' analyses, and generates dependency trees.

Result: VISTA simplifies the study of LLM reasoning by providing transparent, interactive insights into reasoning chains and contextual influences.

Conclusion: VISTA enhances researchers' ability to analyze reasoning in LLMs, promoting better understanding and offering open-source accessibility.

Abstract: Recent research has increasingly focused on the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in multi-turn interactions, as these scenarios more closely mirror real-world problem-solving. However, analyzing the intricate reasoning processes within these interactions presents a significant challenge due to complex contextual dependencies and a lack of specialized visualization tools, leading to a high cognitive load for researchers. To address this gap, we present VISTA, an web-based Visual Interactive System for Textual Analytics in multi-turn reasoning tasks. VISTA allows users to visualize the influence of context on model decisions and interactively modify conversation histories to conduct "what-if" analyses across different models. Furthermore, the platform can automatically parse a session and generate a reasoning dependency tree, offering a transparent view of the model's step-by-step logical path. By providing a unified and interactive framework, VISTA significantly reduces the complexity of analyzing reasoning chains, thereby facilitating a deeper understanding of the capabilities and limitations of current LLMs. The platform is open-source and supports easy integration of custom benchmarks and local models.

*Qifeng Cai,Hao Liang,Chang Xu,Tao Xie,Wentao Zhang,Bin Cui*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents Text2SQL-Flow, a data augmentation framework, for generating large-scale and diverse Text-to-SQL datasets to address scarcity and simplicity issues in existing datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve Text-to-SQL performance by creating a scalable and high-quality structured dataset due to limitations of scarce and low-diversity data in current systems.

Method: The authors use Text2SQL-Flow, an SQL-aware, six-dimensional augmentation framework with a modular Database Manager to ensure cross-database scalability. It includes SQL execution verification, data classification, natural question generation, and reasoning traces.

Result: The framework led to the creation of SQLFlow, a dataset with 89,544 pairs. Fine-tuning open-source LLMs on SQLFlow improves benchmark performance, and a masked alignment retrieval method enhances closed-source LLM retrieval strategies.

Conclusion: The study proves high-quality structured data and the SQLFlow dataset as crucial for enhancing Text-to-SQL systems' scalability and performance.

Abstract: The data-centric paradigm has become pivotal in AI, especially for Text-to-SQL, where performance is limited by scarce, simplistic, and low-diversity datasets. To address this, we propose Text2SQL-Flow, a SQL-aware data augmentation framework that generates large-scale, semantically valid, and structurally diverse Text-to-SQL pairs from minimal seed data. It operates across six augmentation dimensions and integrates an end-to-end pipeline featuring SQL execution verification, natural language question generation, chain-of-thought reasoning traces, and data classification. A modular Database Manager ensures cross-database compatibility and scalability. Using this framework, we build SQLFlow, a high-quality dataset of 89,544 annotated examples. We evaluate SQLFlow in two settings: (1) For open-source LLMs, fine-tuning on SQLFlow consistently improves performance across benchmarks under the same data budget. (2) For closed-source LLMs, we introduce a masked alignment retrieval method that treats SQLFlow as both knowledge base and training data for the retriever. This enables structure-aware example matching by modeling fine-grained alignments between questions and SQL queries. Experiments show our retrieval strategy outperforms existing methods, underscoring the value of SQLFlow's high-fidelity data and our novel technique. Our work establishes a scalable, data-centric foundation for advancing Text-to-SQL systems and highlights the critical role of high-quality structured data in modern AI.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: EffiReason-Bench is introduced for evaluating efficient reasoning methods of LLMs with methods across reasoning paradigms. Results show strategies vary based on scale, complexity, and architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Chain-of-Thought prompting methods, while effective for reasoning, can lead to inefficiency due to excessively long explanations and fragmented evaluation practices.

Method: EffiReason-Bench benchmarks reasoning methods under three paradigms and uses verified CoT annotations on datasets like CommonsenseQA and LogiQA. It includes the E3-Score metric for refined evaluation.

Result: Evaluating 7 methods across 6 LLMs and 4 datasets revealed no universally superior method. Optimal approaches are dependent on task and the model's features.

Conclusion: EffiReason-Bench establishes standardized evaluation for LLM reasoning, highlighting the need for tailored strategies depending on model and task specifics.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting achieve strong reasoning but often produce unnecessarily long explanations, increasing cost and sometimes reducing accuracy. Fair comparison of efficiency-oriented approaches is hindered by fragmented evaluation practices. We introduce EffiReason-Bench, a unified benchmark for rigorous cross-paradigm evaluation of efficient reasoning methods across three categories: Reasoning Blueprints, Dynamic Execution, and Post-hoc Refinement. To enable step-by-step evaluation, we construct verified CoT annotations for CommonsenseQA and LogiQA via a pipeline that enforces standardized reasoning structures, comprehensive option-wise analysis, and human verification. We evaluate 7 methods across 6 open-source LLMs (1B-70B) on 4 datasets spanning mathematics, commonsense, and logic, and propose the E3-Score, a principled metric inspired by economic trade-off modeling that provides smooth, stable evaluation without discontinuities or heavy reliance on heuristics. Experiments show that no single method universally dominates; optimal strategies depend on backbone scale, task complexity, and architecture.

*Guanrong Li,Xinyu Liu,Zhen Wu,Xinyu Dai*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses the issue of generic responses in personalized dialogue generation by introducing the Persona-Aware Alignment Framework (PAL), which focuses directly on persona alignment as the training objective.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mainstream models fail to sufficiently consider personas, instead generating generic responses due to token-level language model training.

Method: The Persona-Aware Alignment Framework (PAL) uses two-stage training: Persona-aware Learning and Persona Alignment, along with a Select then Generate inference strategy to improve persona relevance.

Result: Extensive experiments show that PAL surpasses state-of-the-art personalized dialogue methods and large language models in generating persona-consistent responses.

Conclusion: Using persona alignment as a direct training objective improves dialogue generation consistency and relevancy, advancing personalized response models.

Abstract: Personalized dialogue generation aims to leverage persona profiles and dialogue history to generate persona-relevant and consistent responses. Mainstream models typically rely on token-level language model training with persona dialogue data, such as Next Token Prediction, to implicitly achieve personalization, making these methods tend to neglect the given personas and generate generic responses. To address this issue, we propose a novel Persona-Aware Alignment Framework (PAL), which directly treats persona alignment as the training objective of dialogue generation. Specifically, PAL employs a two-stage training method including Persona-aware Learning and Persona Alignment, equipped with an easy-to-use inference strategy Select then Generate, to improve persona sensitivity and generate more persona-relevant responses at the semantics level. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our framework outperforms many state-of-the-art personalized dialogue methods and large language models.

*Yangfan Ye,Xiaocheng Feng,Xiachong Feng,Lei Huang,Weitao Ma,Qichen Hong,Yunfei Lu,Duyu Tang,Dandan Tu,Bing Qin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes LangGPS, a framework that improves multilingual instruction tuning for LLMs by leveraging language separability to choose training data more effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multilingual data selection methods do not account for intrinsic linguistic structures, limiting the multilingual capabilities of large language models.

Method: LangGPS is a two-stage pre-selection framework. First, it filters training data using language separability scores, then refines these subsets with existing selection methods.

Result: The approach enhances the effectiveness and generalizability of multilingual training across benchmarks and languages, especially for low-resource and understanding tasks.

Conclusion: LangGPS facilitates clearer language boundaries, aids cross-lingual alignment, supports multilingual curriculum learning, and proposes a new perspective on improving LLMs using linguistically informed techniques.

Abstract: Joint multilingual instruction tuning is a widely adopted approach to improve the multilingual instruction-following ability and downstream performance of large language models (LLMs), but the resulting multilingual capability remains highly sensitive to the composition and selection of the training data. Existing selection methods, often based on features like text quality, diversity, or task relevance, typically overlook the intrinsic linguistic structure of multilingual data. In this paper, we propose LangGPS, a lightweight two-stage pre-selection framework guided by language separability which quantifies how well samples in different languages can be distinguished in the model's representation space. LangGPS first filters training data based on separability scores and then refines the subset using existing selection methods. Extensive experiments across six benchmarks and 22 languages demonstrate that applying LangGPS on top of existing selection methods improves their effectiveness and generalizability in multilingual training, especially for understanding tasks and low-resource languages. Further analysis reveals that highly separable samples facilitate the formation of clearer language boundaries and support faster adaptation, while low-separability samples tend to function as bridges for cross-lingual alignment. Besides, we also find that language separability can serve as an effective signal for multilingual curriculum learning, where interleaving samples with diverse separability levels yields stable and generalizable gains. Together, we hope our work offers a new perspective on data utility in multilingual contexts and support the development of more linguistically informed LLMs.

TL;DR: The paper introduces VocalNet-M2, a low-latency spoken language model using multi-codebook tokenization and multi-token prediction, significantly reducing latency while maintaining high performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle significant response latency in current spoken language models caused by autoregressive generation and complex flow-matching models.

Method: The model implements a multi-codebook tokenizer and a multi-token prediction strategy, removing the dependency on flow-matching models and speeding up token generation.

Result: VocalNet-M2 reduces first chunk latency from 725ms to 350ms while delivering competitive performance across major spoken language models.

Conclusion: VocalNet-M2 offers efficient, high-performance, real-time spoken language processing, emphasizing the merits of multi-codebook strategies compared to traditional approaches.

Abstract: Current end-to-end spoken language models (SLMs) have made notable progress, yet they still encounter considerable response latency. This delay primarily arises from the autoregressive generation of speech tokens and the reliance on complex flow-matching models for speech synthesis. To overcome this, we introduce VocalNet-M2, a novel low-latency SLM that integrates a multi-codebook tokenizer and a multi-token prediction (MTP) strategy. Our model directly generates multi-codebook speech tokens, thus eliminating the need for a latency-inducing flow-matching model. Furthermore, our MTP strategy enhances generation efficiency and improves overall performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VocalNet-M2 achieves a substantial reduction in first chunk latency (from approximately 725ms to 350ms) while maintaining competitive performance across mainstream SLMs. This work also provides a comprehensive comparison of single-codebook and multi-codebook strategies, offering valuable insights for developing efficient and high-performance SLMs for real-time interactive applications.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces MTR-DuplexBench, a novel benchmark for evaluating Full-Duplex Speech Language Models (FD-SLMs) in multi-round interactions, focusing on dialogue quality, conversational dynamics, instruction following, and safety.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks inadequately evaluate FD-SLMs as they neglect multi-round interactions and important factors like instruction following and safety, making it challenging to assess their real-world capabilities.

Method: The authors propose a benchmark (MTR-DuplexBench) that segments full-duplex dialogues into discrete turns, enabling multi-dimensional evaluation of FD-SLMs in realistic interaction settings.

Result: Experimental results indicate that existing FD-SLMs struggle to maintain consistent performance across multiple rounds, demonstrating the relevance and effectiveness of the proposed benchmark.

Conclusion: MTR-DuplexBench is essential to comprehensively evaluate FD-SLMs and improve their long-term performance across complex conversational scenarios. The benchmark and code will be made publicly available.

Abstract: Full-Duplex Speech Language Models (FD-SLMs) enable real-time, overlapping conversational interactions, offering a more dynamic user experience compared to traditional half-duplex models. However, existing benchmarks primarily focus on evaluating single-round interactions and conversational features, neglecting the complexities of multi-round communication and critical capabilities such as instruction following and safety. Evaluating FD-SLMs in multi-round settings poses significant challenges, including blurred turn boundaries in communication and context inconsistency during model inference. To address these gaps, we introduce MTR-DuplexBench, a novel benchmark that segments continuous full-duplex dialogues into discrete turns, enabling comprehensive, turn-by-turn evaluation of FD-SLMs across dialogue quality, conversational dynamics, instruction following, and safety. Experimental results reveal that current FD-SLMs face difficulties in maintaining consistent performance across multiple rounds and evaluation dimensions, highlighting the necessity and effectiveness of our proposed benchmark. The benchmark and code will be available in the future.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a locally processed, privacy-preserving question-answering system for sensitive organizational documents, achieving competitive accuracy without internet reliance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Organizations struggle with balancing powerful AI accuracy and ensuring sensitive data privacy when it comes to document processing.

Method: The system combines semantic understanding and keyword precision for information retrieval, leveraging consumer-grade hardware and operating entirely within local infrastructure.

Result: The approach achieves competitive accuracy in answering queries across diverse domains like legal, scientific, and conversational documents without compromising data privacy.

Conclusion: Privacy and high performance can coexist in enterprise AI systems, enabling sensitive institutions like banks and hospitals to leverage AI without risking proprietary data to external providers.

Abstract: Organizations handling sensitive documents face a critical dilemma: adopt cloud-based AI systems that offer powerful question-answering capabilities but compromise data privacy, or maintain local processing that ensures security but delivers poor accuracy. We present a question-answering system that resolves this trade-off by combining semantic understanding with keyword precision, operating entirely on local infrastructure without internet access. Our approach demonstrates that organizations can achieve competitive accuracy on complex queries across legal, scientific, and conversational documents while keeping all data on their machines. By balancing two complementary retrieval strategies and using consumer-grade hardware acceleration, the system delivers reliable answers with minimal errors, letting banks, hospitals, and law firms adopt conversational document AI without transmitting proprietary information to external providers. This work establishes that privacy and performance need not be mutually exclusive in enterprise AI deployment.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses improving reasoning capabilities of large language models in solving mathematical problems by rectifying evaluation preferences related to perplexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enhance reasoning capabilities in large language models (LLMs), specifically by diagnosing and improving their critiquing performance for multi-step mathematical reasoning tasks.

Method: The authors propose a reinforcement learning algorithm called Group Relative Policy Optimization, which leverages perplexity to address imbalanced evaluation preference. They also introduce a benchmark called One-to-Many Problem-Solution (OPS) for analyzing LLM critiquing behavior.

Result: Experimental results show the effectiveness of their method using the OPS benchmark, as well as existing critic benchmarks, in improving LLM critiquing capabilities.

Conclusion: The study concludes that rectifying evaluation preferences, especially perplexity bias, can significantly enhance reasoning and critiquing capabilities in LLMs.

Abstract: To improve Multi-step Mathematical Reasoning (MsMR) of Large Language Models (LLMs), it is crucial to obtain scalable supervision from the corpus by automatically critiquing mistakes in the reasoning process of MsMR and rendering a final verdict of the problem-solution. Most existing methods rely on crafting high-quality supervised fine-tuning demonstrations for critiquing capability enhancement and pay little attention to delving into the underlying reason for the poor critiquing performance of LLMs. In this paper, we orthogonally quantify and investigate the potential reason -- imbalanced evaluation preference, and conduct a statistical preference analysis. Motivated by the analysis of the reason, a novel perplexity-aware reinforcement learning algorithm is proposed to rectify the evaluation preference, elevating the critiquing capability. Specifically, to probe into LLMs' critiquing characteristics, a One-to-many Problem-Solution (OPS) benchmark is meticulously constructed to quantify the behavior difference of LLMs when evaluating the problem solutions generated by itself and others. Then, to investigate the behavior difference in depth, we conduct a statistical preference analysis oriented on perplexity and find an intriguing phenomenon -- ``LLMs incline to judge solutions with lower perplexity as correct'', which is dubbed as \textit{imbalanced evaluation preference}. To rectify this preference, we regard perplexity as the baton in the algorithm of Group Relative Policy Optimization, supporting the LLMs to explore trajectories that judge lower perplexity as wrong and higher perplexity as correct. Extensive experimental results on our built OPS and existing available critic benchmarks demonstrate the validity of our method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Low-resource languages are underserved in pretraining of Large Language Models, necessitating scalable strategies to generate high-quality data.

Method: A large-scale synthetic dataset (540B tokens) for 10 Indic languages was created using 5 techniques, exploring grounding generation methods and introducing a modular quality evaluation pipeline.

Result: Empirical evaluations revealed trade-offs in generation strategies and established best practices for creating effective multilingual corpora.

Conclusion: Grounded synthetic data can improve model performance for low-resource languages, and robust evaluation methods ensure scalability and quality in multilingual data generation.

Abstract: In the context of pretraining of Large Language Models (LLMs), synthetic data has emerged as an alternative for generating high-quality pretraining data at scale. This is particularly beneficial in low-resource language settings where the benefits of recent LLMs have been unevenly distributed across languages. In this work, we present a systematic study on the generation and evaluation of synthetic multilingual pretraining data for Indic languages, where we construct a large-scale synthetic dataset BhashaKritika, comprising 540B tokens using 5 different techniques for 10 languages. We explore the impact of grounding generation in documents, personas, and topics. We analyze how language choice, both in the prompt instructions and document grounding, affects data quality, and we compare translations of English content with native generation in Indic languages. To support scalable and language-sensitive evaluation, we introduce a modular quality evaluation pipeline that integrates script and language detection, metadata consistency checks, n-gram repetition analysis, and perplexity-based filtering using KenLM models. Our framework enables robust quality control across diverse scripts and linguistic contexts. Empirical results through model runs reveal key trade-offs in generation strategies and highlight best practices for constructing effective multilingual corpora.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in systematically querying unstructured Cultural Heritage texts by converting them into structured Knowledge Graphs (KGs).

Method: ATR4CH employs a five-step methodology: foundational analysis, annotation schema development, pipeline architecture design, integration refinement, and evaluation, leveraging three LLMs for knowledge extraction from Wikipedia articles.

Result: The approach achieved high accuracy: 0.96-0.99 F1 for metadata extraction, 0.7-0.8 F1 for entity recognition, 0.65-0.75 F1 for hypothesis extraction, and 0.62 G-EVAL for discourse representation.

Conclusion: ATR4CH offers a replicable and adaptable framework for converting Cultural Heritage documents into structured KGs, enabling better knowledge discovery and metadata enrichment. However, human oversight remains essential in post-processing.

Abstract: Cultural Heritage texts contain rich knowledge that is difficult to query systematically due to the challenges of converting unstructured discourse into structured Knowledge Graphs (KGs). This paper introduces ATR4CH (Adaptive Text-to-RDF for Cultural Heritage), a systematic five-step methodology for Large Language Model-based Knowledge Extraction from Cultural Heritage documents. We validate the methodology through a case study on authenticity assessment debates. Methodology - ATR4CH combines annotation models, ontological frameworks, and LLM-based extraction through iterative development: foundational analysis, annotation schema development, pipeline architecture, integration refinement, and comprehensive evaluation. We demonstrate the approach using Wikipedia articles about disputed items (documents, artifacts...), implementing a sequential pipeline with three LLMs (Claude Sonnet 3.7, Llama 3.3 70B, GPT-4o-mini). Findings - The methodology successfully extracts complex Cultural Heritage knowledge: 0.96-0.99 F1 for metadata extraction, 0.7-0.8 F1 for entity recognition, 0.65-0.75 F1 for hypothesis extraction, 0.95-0.97 for evidence extraction, and 0.62 G-EVAL for discourse representation. Smaller models performed competitively, enabling cost-effective deployment. Originality - This is the first systematic methodology for coordinating LLM-based extraction with Cultural Heritage ontologies. ATR4CH provides a replicable framework adaptable across CH domains and institutional resources. Research Limitations - The produced KG is limited to Wikipedia articles. While the results are encouraging, human oversight is necessary during post-processing. Practical Implications - ATR4CH enables Cultural Heritage institutions to systematically convert textual knowledge into queryable KGs, supporting automated metadata enrichment and knowledge discovery.

TL;DR: The paper introduces TruthfulRAG, a framework using Knowledge Graphs to resolve factual conflicts in Retrieval-Augmented Generation systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of resolving conflicts between the retrieved external information and LLMs' internal knowledge in RAG systems, which compromises generated content accuracy.

Method: TruthfulRAG systematically extracts triples to build Knowledge Graphs from retrieved content, uses graph retrieval to locate relevant knowledge, and applies entropy-based filtering to resolve factual inconsistencies.

Result: TruthfulRAG outperforms existing methods in experiments, showing enhanced robustness and reliability by mitigating knowledge conflicts.

Conclusion: The framework improves the accuracy, faithfulness, and trustworthiness of RAG systems by effectively addressing factual-level knowledge conflicts.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a powerful framework for enhancing the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by integrating retrieval-based methods with generative models. As external knowledge repositories continue to expand and the parametric knowledge within models becomes outdated, a critical challenge for RAG systems is resolving conflicts between retrieved external information and LLMs' internal knowledge, which can significantly compromise the accuracy and reliability of generated content. However, existing approaches to conflict resolution typically operate at the token or semantic level, often leading to fragmented and partial understanding of factual discrepancies between LLMs' knowledge and context, particularly in knowledge-intensive tasks. To address this limitation, we propose TruthfulRAG, the first framework that leverages Knowledge Graphs (KGs) to resolve factual-level knowledge conflicts in RAG systems. Specifically, TruthfulRAG constructs KGs by systematically extracting triples from retrieved content, utilizes query-based graph retrieval to identify relevant knowledge, and employs entropy-based filtering mechanisms to precisely locate conflicting elements and mitigate factual inconsistencies, thereby enabling LLMs to generate faithful and accurate responses. Extensive experiments reveal that TruthfulRAG outperforms existing methods, effectively alleviating knowledge conflicts and improving the robustness and trustworthiness of RAG systems.

TL;DR: The paper critiques the assessment of reasoning in pre-trained large language models (LLMs) due to a mismatch between their training objectives and normative reasoning qualities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To highlight methodological concerns in evaluating the reasoning capabilities of base LLMs and question assumptions in existing studies.

Method: The paper showcases how base LLMs produce reasoning outputs based on statistical linguistic patterns rather than normative correctness.

Result: It identifies the fundamental flaws in assessing base LLMs' reasoning and challenges the generalization of these findings to instruction-following LLMs.

Conclusion: The paper calls for re-evaluating methodologies in LLM reasoning studies, emphasizing the need to address inherent mismatches and pitfalls.

Abstract: Existing work investigates the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to uncover their limitations, human-like biases and underlying processes. Such studies include evaluations of base LLMs (pre-trained on unlabeled corpora only) for this purpose. Our position paper argues that evaluating base LLMs' reasoning capabilities raises inherent methodological concerns that are overlooked in such existing studies. We highlight the fundamental mismatch between base LLMs' pretraining objective and normative qualities, such as correctness, by which reasoning is assessed. In particular, we show how base LLMs generate logically valid or invalid conclusions as coincidental byproducts of conforming to purely linguistic patterns of statistical plausibility. This fundamental mismatch challenges the assumptions that (a) base LLMs' outputs can be assessed as their bona fide attempts at correct answers or conclusions; and (b) conclusions about base LLMs' reasoning can generalize to post-trained LLMs optimized for successful instruction-following. We call for a critical re-examination of existing work that relies implicitly on these assumptions, and for future work to account for these methodological pitfalls.

Motivation: To address the challenges in Entity Linking for humanities, such as complex document types, lack of domain-specific datasets and models, and under-representation of long-tail entities in KBs.

Method: DELICATE integrates a BERT-based encoder with Wikidata contextual information, focusing on temporal plausibility and type consistency, while ENEIDE is a corpus semi-automatically created from 19th and 20th-century annotated texts.

Result: DELICATE outperforms other models for historical Italian EL, including larger architectures, offering more explainable and interpretable results.

Conclusion: The combined approach of DELICATE and ENEIDE improves EL performance in the humanities and provides interpretable results for historical Italian text.

Abstract: In spite of the remarkable advancements in the field of Natural Language Processing, the task of Entity Linking (EL) remains challenging in the field of humanities due to complex document typologies, lack of domain-specific datasets and models, and long-tail entities, i.e., entities under-represented in Knowledge Bases (KBs). The goal of this paper is to address these issues with two main contributions. The first contribution is DELICATE, a novel neuro-symbolic method for EL on historical Italian which combines a BERT-based encoder with contextual information from Wikidata to select appropriate KB entities using temporal plausibility and entity type consistency. The second contribution is ENEIDE, a multi-domain EL corpus in historical Italian semi-automatically extracted from two annotated editions spanning from the 19th to the 20th century and including literary and political texts. Results show how DELICATE outperforms other EL models in historical Italian even if compared with larger architectures with billions of parameters. Moreover, further analyses reveal how DELICATE confidence scores and features sensitivity provide results which are more explainable and interpretable than purely neural methods.

### [107] [Analogical Structure, Minimal Contextual Cues and Contrastive Distractors: Input Design for Sample-Efficient Linguistic Rule Induction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10441)
*Chunyang Jiang,Paola Merlo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates whether lightweight models can achieve comparable linguistic performance to larger models using minimal data and cognitive-inspired principles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore if analogical paradigm organization and cognitive strategies allow lightweight models to perform well with significantly less data.

Method: The researchers designed a computational approach harnessing analogical structure, contrastive learning, and minimal contextual cues, tested on English linguistic patterns with lightweight models.

Result: Lightweight models trained on only 100 structured examples achieve high performance ($F1=0.95$), surpassing larger models' zero-shot results ($F1=0.87$). Robustness and consistency verified through cross-validation.

Conclusion: Analogical paradigm enables lightweight models to learn linguistic rules efficiently with far less data compared to traditional large-scale approaches.

Abstract: Large language models achieve strong performance through training on vast datasets. Can analogical paradigm organization enable lightweight models to match this performance with minimal data? We develop a computational approach implementing three cognitive-inspired principles: analogical structure, contrastive learning, and minimal contextual cues. We test this approach with structured completion tasks where models identify correct sentence completions from analogical patterns with contrastive alternatives. Training lightweight models (BERT+CNN, $0.5M$ parameters) on only one hundred structured examples of English causative/inchoative alternations achieves $F1=0.95$, outperforming zero-shot \texttt{GPT-o3} ($F1=0.87$). Ablation studies confirm that analogical organization and contrastive structure improve performance, consistently surpassing randomly shuffled baselines across architectures. Cross-phenomenon validation using unspecified object alternations replicates these efficiency gains, confirming approach robustness. Our results show that analogical paradigm organization enables competitive linguistic rule learning with orders of magnitude less data than conventional approaches require.

### [108] [Reasoning About Intent for Ambiguous Requests](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10453)
*Irina Saparina,Mirella Lapata*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method for large language models to generate multiple interpretations and answers to ambiguous requests to improve understanding and user satisfaction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The ambiguity in user requests often leads large language models to commit to one interpretation, which can result in misunderstandings and safety issues. The authors aim to improve the process of understanding user intent.

Method: The authors use reinforcement learning and customized reward functions to train models, supervising them with multiple valid answers. This enables generating structured responses with interpretation-answer pairs.

Result: The experiments show that this method provides higher coverage of valid answers than baselines, while human evaluations confirm alignment and transparency between interpretations and answers.

Conclusion: The approach enhances transparency, reduces misunderstandings by explicitly addressing ambiguities, and supports downstream applications with a structured format while requiring minimal computational effort.

Abstract: Large language models often respond to ambiguous requests by implicitly committing to one interpretation. Intent misunderstandings can frustrate users and create safety risks. To address this, we propose generating multiple interpretation-answer pairs in a single structured response to ambiguous requests. Our models are trained with reinforcement learning and customized reward functions using multiple valid answers as supervision. Experiments on conversational question answering and semantic parsing demonstrate that our method achieves higher coverage of valid answers than baseline approaches. Human evaluation confirms that predicted interpretations are highly aligned with their answers. Our approach promotes transparency with explicit interpretations, achieves efficiency by requiring only one generation step, and supports downstream applications through its structured output format.

*Kiamehr Rezaee,Jose Camacho-Collados,Mohammad Taher Pilehvar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper assesses the ability of advanced LLMs like GPT-4 and Llama3 in tracking state and introduces a benchmark for testing their state tracking abilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and evaluate the state tracking capabilities of LLMs, which is vital for reasoning tasks and relates to model consistency over sequences.

Method: The authors propose a benchmark comprising three state tracking tasks, running various scenarios to measure the performance of LLMs while employing mechanisms like Chain of Thought.

Result: Recent LLMs like GPT-4 and Llama3 show strong state tracking abilities, while older models often fail after several steps despite initial success.

Conclusion: State tracking mechanisms in advanced LLMs prove effective, especially with added reasoning strategies, but older models lag significantly in sustained performance.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in solving complex tasks, including those requiring a certain level of reasoning. In this paper, we focus on state tracking, a problem where models need to keep track of the state governing a number of entities. To isolate the state tracking component from other factors, we propose a benchmark based on three well-defined state tracking tasks and analyse the performance of LLMs in different scenarios. The results indicate that the recent generation of LLMs (specifically, GPT-4 and Llama3) are capable of tracking state, especially when integrated with mechanisms such as Chain of Thought. However, models from the former generation, while understanding the task and being able to solve it at the initial stages, often fail at this task after a certain number of steps.

### [110] [LocalBench: Benchmarking LLMs on County-Level Local Knowledge and Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10459)
*Zihan Gao,Yifei Xu,Jacob Thebault-Spieker*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces LocalBench, a benchmark to assess LLMs' hyper-local knowledge at the county level in the U.S., revealing substantial performance limitations in reasoning about localized, diverse contexts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to understand the ability of LLMs to handle neighborhood-specific dynamics and resolve their insufficiencies in capturing hyper-local knowledge, which is crucial for civic platforms, community journalism, and similar applications.

Method: The authors developed LocalBench, featuring 14,782 validated Q&A pairs from 526 counties in 49 U.S. states, to systematically evaluate LLMs' locality knowledge in physical, cognitive, and relational dimensions under closed-book and web-augmented settings.

Result: Evaluation of 13 LLMs revealed critical limitations, including accuracy of 56.8% on narrative questions and below 15.5% on numerical reasoning. Larger model sizes and web augmentation did not always improve performance.

Conclusion: Language models show significant limitations in understanding hyper-local knowledge, urging the need for equitable, place-aware AI systems capable of addressing localized community-specific contexts.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been widely evaluated on macro-scale geographic tasks, such as global factual recall, event summarization, and regional reasoning. Yet, their ability to handle hyper-local knowledge remains poorly understood. This gap is increasingly consequential as real-world applications, from civic platforms to community journalism, demand AI systems that can reason about neighborhood-specific dynamics, cultural narratives, and local governance. Existing benchmarks fall short in capturing this complexity, often relying on coarse-grained data or isolated references. We present LocalBench, the first benchmark designed to systematically evaluate LLMs on county-level local knowledge across the United States. Grounded in the Localness Conceptual Framework, LocalBench includes 14,782 validated question-answer pairs across 526 U.S. counties in 49 states, integrating diverse sources such as Census statistics, local subreddit discourse, and regional news. It spans physical, cognitive, and relational dimensions of locality. Using LocalBench, we evaluate 13 state-of-the-art LLMs under both closed-book and web-augmented settings. Our findings reveal critical limitations: even the best-performing models reach only 56.8% accuracy on narrative-style questions and perform below 15.5% on numerical reasoning. Moreover, larger model size and web augmentation do not guarantee better performance, for example, search improves Gemini's accuracy by +13.6%, but reduces GPT-series performance by -11.4%. These results underscore the urgent need for language models that can support equitable, place-aware AI systems: capable of engaging with the diverse, fine-grained realities of local communities across geographic and cultural contexts.

### [111] [Beyond Elicitation: Provision-based Prompt Optimization for Knowledge-Intensive Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10465)
*Yunzhe Xu,Zhuosheng Zhang,Zhe Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Knowledge-Provision-based Prompt Optimization (KPPO), aimed at integrating systematic knowledge into prompts rather than relying on traditional elicitation-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing prompt optimization methods face challenges in addressing knowledge-intensive tasks as they operate within fixed parametric boundaries, lacking domain-specific factual knowledge, precision, and reasoning patterns.

Method: KPPO incorporates a knowledge gap filling mechanism, batch-wise candidate evaluation for performance and stability, and an adaptive knowledge pruning strategy for efficiency.

Result: KPPO outperforms elicitation-based methods with an average improvement of ~6% on 15 benchmarks, while reducing token usage by up to 29%.

Conclusion: KPPO is a more effective approach to prompt optimization for knowledge-intensive tasks, balancing improved performance with token efficiency and greater domain-specific knowledge integration.

Abstract: While prompt optimization has emerged as a critical technique for enhancing language model performance, existing approaches primarily focus on elicitation-based strategies that search for optimal prompts to activate models' capabilities. These methods exhibit fundamental limitations when addressing knowledge-intensive tasks, as they operate within fixed parametric boundaries rather than providing the factual knowledge, terminology precision, and reasoning patterns required in specialized domains. To address these limitations, we propose Knowledge-Provision-based Prompt Optimization (KPPO), a framework that reformulates prompt optimization as systematic knowledge integration rather than potential elicitation. KPPO introduces three key innovations: 1) a knowledge gap filling mechanism for knowledge gap identification and targeted remediation; 2) a batch-wise candidate evaluation approach that considers both performance improvement and distributional stability; 3) an adaptive knowledge pruning strategy that balances performance and token efficiency, reducing up to 29% token usage. Extensive evaluation on 15 knowledge-intensive benchmarks from various domains demonstrates KPPO's superiority over elicitation-based methods, with an average performance improvement of ~6% over the strongest baseline while achieving comparable or lower token consumption.

TL;DR: This paper introduces AdvancedIF, a new benchmark for evaluating multi-turn and system-prompted instruction following in LLMs, and a training method called RIFL, leveraging rubrics to enhance performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of improving advanced instruction-following (IF) in LLMs, especially in complex and multi-turn contexts, is hindered by limited high-quality benchmarks and reward signals.

Method: The authors propose AdvancedIF, featuring curated benchmarks with 1,600 prompts and rubrics, and a training pipeline, RIFL, which uses rubric generation, a verifier, and reward shaping for enhanced reinforcement learning.

Result: The RIFL approach significantly improves LLM instruction-following, with a 6.7% gain on the proposed benchmark and strong results on other public evaluations.

Conclusion: This research showcases rubrics as an effective tool for both training and evaluating LLMs in advanced instruction-following tasks, contributing to more reliable AI systems.

Abstract: Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has led to impressive performance on a range of tasks, yet advanced instruction following (IF)-especially for complex, multi-turn, and system-prompted instructions-remains a significant challenge. Rigorous evaluation and effective training for such capabilities are hindered by the lack of high-quality, human-annotated benchmarks and reliable, interpretable reward signals. In this work, we introduce AdvancedIF (we will release this benchmark soon), a comprehensive benchmark featuring over 1,600 prompts and expert-curated rubrics that assess LLMs ability to follow complex, multi-turn, and system-level instructions. We further propose RIFL (Rubric-based Instruction-Following Learning), a novel post-training pipeline that leverages rubric generation, a finetuned rubric verifier, and reward shaping to enable effective reinforcement learning for instruction following. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RIFL substantially improves the instruction-following abilities of LLMs, achieving a 6.7% absolute gain on AdvancedIF and strong results on public benchmarks. Our ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of each component in RIFL. This work establishes rubrics as a powerful tool for both training and evaluating advanced IF in LLMs, paving the way for more capable and reliable AI systems.

### [114] [Say It Differently: Linguistic Styles as Jailbreak Vectors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10519)
*Srikant Panda,Avinash Rai*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper investigates how linguistic styles such as fear or curiosity can reframe harmful prompts to bypass safety mechanisms in Large Language Models (LLMs), proposing a style-neutralization method to counteract this vulnerability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the overlooked vulnerability in LLMs, where different linguistic styles, like fear or curiosity, can be used as a new attack surface to elicit harmful responses, potentially bypassing robust safety systems.

Method: The authors created a style-augmented jailbreak benchmark, transforming prompts from standard datasets into 11 linguistic styles using templates and LLM-based rewrites. They evaluated 16 LLMs to study the impact of stylistic variations and introduced a preprocessing step using a secondary LLM to neutralize manipulative stylistic cues.

Result: Stylistic reframing increased jailbreak success rates by up to +57 percentage points, with emotional or empathetic styles like fear and curiosity being the most effective. A proposed style-neutralization method significantly reduced these success rates.

Conclusion: The study highlights a systemic vulnerability in current LLM safety mechanisms and demonstrates that stylistic manipulations can defeat even aligned models. A preprocessing approach neutralizing style provided promising mitigation against these attacks.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are commonly evaluated for robustness against paraphrased or semantically equivalent jailbreak prompts, yet little attention has been paid to linguistic variation as an attack surface. In this work, we systematically study how linguistic styles such as fear or curiosity can reframe harmful intent and elicit unsafe responses from aligned models. We construct style-augmented jailbreak benchmark by transforming prompts from 3 standard datasets into 11 distinct linguistic styles using handcrafted templates and LLM-based rewrites, while preserving semantic intent. Evaluating 16 open- and close-source instruction-tuned models, we find that stylistic reframing increases jailbreak success rates by up to +57 percentage points. Styles such as fearful, curious and compassionate are most effective and contextualized rewrites outperform templated variants.
  To mitigate this, we introduce a style neutralization preprocessing step using a secondary LLM to strip manipulative stylistic cues from user inputs, significantly reducing jailbreak success rates. Our findings reveal a systemic and scaling-resistant vulnerability overlooked in current safety pipelines.

*Egor Pakhomov,Erik Nijkamp,Caiming Xiong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a benchmark for evaluating conversational memory and examines its unique properties compared to retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). It highlights different strengths of simple full-context vs. advanced RAG systems based on context size.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in current conversational memory evaluation frameworks, like limited statistical power, consistency, and evaluation flexibility, and to better understand the dynamics between conversational memory and retrieval-augmented generation systems.

Method: The study proposes a benchmark with 75,336 question-answer pairs across various categories, analyzing the performance of both simple full-context and RAG-based memory systems.

Result: Simple full-context systems outperform RAG-based memory systems for up to 30 conversational interactions with accuracy ranging from 70-82%, while RAG systems like Mem0 demonstrate lower performance but scale better beyond 150 interactions.

Conclusion: Conversational memory systems have a distinct advantage in small corpora where exhaustive search and reranking are practical, requiring focused research rather than general RAG applications to conversations.

Abstract: We introduce a comprehensive benchmark for conversational memory evaluation containing 75,336 question-answer pairs across diverse categories including user facts, assistant recall, abstention, preferences, temporal changes, and implicit connections. While existing benchmarks have advanced the field, our work addresses fundamental challenges in statistical power, data generation consistency, and evaluation flexibility that limit current memory evaluation frameworks. We examine the relationship between conversational memory and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). While these systems share fundamental architectural patterns--temporal reasoning, implicit extraction, knowledge updates, and graph representations--memory systems have a unique characteristic: they start from zero and grow progressively with each conversation. This characteristic enables naive approaches that would be impractical for traditional RAG. Consistent with recent findings on long context effectiveness, we observe that simple full-context approaches achieve 70-82% accuracy even on our most challenging multi-message evidence cases, while sophisticated RAG-based memory systems like Mem0 achieve only 30-45% when operating on conversation histories under 150 interactions. Our analysis reveals practical transition points: long context excels for the first 30 conversations, remains viable with manageable trade-offs up to 150 conversations, and typically requires hybrid or RAG approaches beyond that point as costs and latencies become prohibitive. These patterns indicate that the small-corpus advantage of conversational memory--where exhaustive search and complete reranking are feasible--deserves dedicated research attention rather than simply applying general RAG solutions to conversation histories.

*Natasha Johnson*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores the distinction between genre fiction and literary fiction using computational methods to identify formal markers and analyze the effect of author gender on literary categorization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether genre classification is better understood through formal characteristics rather than institutional ones, particularly examining the role of author gender in literary status.

Method: Utilized Andrew Piper's CONLIT dataset, performed Welch's ANOVA and logistic regression on narrative features across genres, and analyzed stylistic and semantic vector representations to identify formal markers.

Result: Found statistically significant formal markers for genre categories and showed how female authorship impacts the boundaries of literary classification.

Conclusion: Genre categorization in fiction involves measurable formal elements, and author gender plays a notable role in shaping the perception of literary status.

Abstract: Though the concept of genre has been a subject of discussion for millennia, the relatively recent emergence of genre fiction has added a new layer to this ongoing conversation. While more traditional perspectives on genre have emphasized form, contemporary scholarship has invoked both formal and institutional characteristics in its taxonomy of genre, genre fiction, and literary fiction. This project uses computational methods to explore the soundness of genre as a formal designation as opposed to an institutional one. Pulling from Andrew Piper's CONLIT dataset of Contemporary Literature, we assemble a corpus of literary and genre fiction, with the latter category containing romance, mystery, and science fiction novels. We use Welch's ANOVA to compare the distribution of narrative features according to author gender within each genre and within genre versus literary fiction. Then, we use logistic regression to model the effect that each feature has on literary classification and to measure how author gender moderates these effects. Finally, we analyze stylistic and semantic vector representations of our genre categories to understand the importance of form and content in literary classification. This project finds statistically significant formal markers of each literary category and illustrates how female authorship narrows and blurs the target for achieving literary status.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study introduces URaG, a framework optimizing long-document understanding for multimodal LLMs using a retrieval module integrated into the reasoning process, resulting in computational savings and improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal large language models face challenges with long document understanding due to information interference and computational cost, requiring solutions that preserve details and allow end-to-end optimization.

Method: URaG implements a cross-modal retrieval module within early Transformer layers to serve as an evidence selector, allowing deeper layers to focus on relevant content for efficient understanding.

Result: URaG achieves state-of-the-art performance while reducing computational cost by up to 56%.

Conclusion: The URaG framework successfully unifies retrieval and generation, enhancing accuracy and efficiency for long document understanding in multimodal LLMs.

Abstract: Recent multimodal large language models (MLLMs) still struggle with long document understanding due to two fundamental challenges: information interference from abundant irrelevant content, and the quadratic computational cost of Transformer-based architectures. Existing approaches primarily fall into two categories: token compression, which sacrifices fine-grained details; and introducing external retrievers, which increase system complexity and prevent end-to-end optimization. To address these issues, we conduct an in-depth analysis and observe that MLLMs exhibit a human-like coarse-to-fine reasoning pattern: early Transformer layers attend broadly across the document, while deeper layers focus on relevant evidence pages. Motivated by this insight, we posit that the inherent evidence localization capabilities of MLLMs can be explicitly leveraged to perform retrieval during the reasoning process, facilitating efficient long document understanding. To this end, we propose URaG, a simple-yet-effective framework that Unifies Retrieval and Generation within a single MLLM. URaG introduces a lightweight cross-modal retrieval module that converts the early Transformer layers into an efficient evidence selector, identifying and preserving the most relevant pages while discarding irrelevant content. This design enables the deeper layers to concentrate computational resources on pertinent information, improving both accuracy and efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that URaG achieves state-of-the-art performance while reducing computational overhead by 44-56%. The code is available at https://github.com/shi-yx/URaG.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in accurately capturing relationships between aspects, opinions, and sentiment polarities in sentiment analysis, leveraging advanced language models.

Method: Introduced DESS, combining DeBERTa's enhanced attention mechanism with an LSTM channel for better processing of context and grammatical patterns.

Result: Achieved F1-score improvements of 4.85, 8.36, and 2.42 on standard datasets, demonstrating superior handling of complex sentence structures.

Conclusion: Integrating advanced language models like DeBERTa in the ASTE task improves sentiment analysis performance, paving the way for enhanced understanding of complex language patterns.

Abstract: Fine-grained sentiment analysis faces ongoing challenges in Aspect Sentiment Triple Extraction (ASTE), particularly in accurately capturing the relationships between aspects, opinions, and sentiment polarities. While researchers have made progress using BERT and Graph Neural Networks, the full potential of advanced language models in understanding complex language patterns remains unexplored. We introduce DESS, a new approach that builds upon previous work by integrating DeBERTa's enhanced attention mechanism to better understand context and relationships in text. Our framework maintains a dual-channel structure, where DeBERTa works alongside an LSTM channel to process both meaning and grammatical patterns in text. We have carefully refined how these components work together, paying special attention to how different types of language information interact. When we tested DESS on standard datasets, it showed meaningful improvements over current methods, with F1-score increases of 4.85, 8.36, and 2.42 in identifying aspect opinion pairs and determining sentiment accurately. Looking deeper into the results, we found that DeBERTa's sophisticated attention system helps DESS handle complicated sentence structures better, especially when important words are far apart. Our findings suggest that upgrading to more advanced language models when thoughtfully integrated, can lead to real improvements in how well we can analyze sentiments in text. The implementation of our approach is publicly available at: https://github.com/VishalRepos/DESS.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce clinical documentation burdens and ensure patient safety by accurately extracting medical orders from doctor-patient conversations.

Method: Evaluates MedGemma through three prompting paradigms: one-shot, ReAct reasoning-focused framework, and multi-step agentic workflow, on manually annotated transcripts.

Result: One-shot prompting outperformed more complex frameworks like ReAct and agentic flows in accuracy, due to them introducing noise in reasoning-heavy tasks.

Conclusion: Direct approaches such as one-shot prompting are robust and efficient in clinical information extraction, cautioning against reasoning-heavy methods that may lead to overthinking.

Abstract: The accurate extraction of medical orders from doctor-patient conversations is a critical task for reducing clinical documentation burdens and ensuring patient safety. This paper details our team submission to the MEDIQA-OE-2025 Shared Task. We investigate the performance of MedGemma, a new domain-specific open-source language model, for structured order extraction. We systematically evaluate three distinct prompting paradigms: a straightforward one-Shot approach, a reasoning-focused ReAct framework, and a multi-step agentic workflow. Our experiments reveal that while more complex frameworks like ReAct and agentic flows are powerful, the simpler one-shot prompting method achieved the highest performance on the official validation set. We posit that on manually annotated transcripts, complex reasoning chains can lead to "overthinking" and introduce noise, making a direct approach more robust and efficient. Our work provides valuable insights into selecting appropriate prompting strategies for clinical information extraction in varied data conditions.

TL;DR: This paper addresses creating AI responses for wound care queries with images using mined prompting and metadata-guided generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clinician workloads have increased due to asynchronous remote care, creating the need for AI solutions to efficiently manage patient queries.

Method: Two approaches: mined prompting for few-shot demonstrations, and metadata-guided generation based on classifier-predicted attributes.

Result: Mined prompting enhanced response relevance, while metadata-guided generation improved clinical precision in wound care query responses.

Conclusion: These methods offer promising strategies to develop AI tools for reliable and efficient wound care support.

Abstract: The rapid expansion of asynchronous remote care has intensified provider workload, creating demand for AI systems that can assist clinicians in managing patient queries more efficiently. The MEDIQA-WV 2025 shared task addresses this challenge by focusing on generating free-text responses to wound care queries paired with images. In this work, we present two complementary approaches developed for the English track. The first leverages a mined prompting strategy, where training data is embedded and the top-k most similar examples are retrieved to serve as few-shot demonstrations during generation. The second approach builds on a metadata ablation study, which identified four metadata attributes that consistently enhance response quality. We train classifiers to predict these attributes for test cases and incorporate them into the generation pipeline, dynamically adjusting outputs based on prediction confidence. Experimental results demonstrate that mined prompting improves response relevance, while metadata-guided generation further refines clinical precision. Together, these methods highlight promising directions for developing AI-driven tools that can provide reliable and efficient wound care support.

*Benjamin L. Badger,Matthew Neligeorge*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces efficient encoder-augmented causal language model architectures to estimate informational entropy in language, achieving superior compression and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding language entropy's lower bound is crucial for improving language model accuracy and compression.

Method: They introduce encoder-augmented causal decoder architectures that optimize training efficiency and enable per-token entropy estimation.

Result: The models trained closer to entropy limits exhibited better generalization and improved compression capabilities.

Conclusion: Approaching per-token entropy bounds enhances both compression efficiency and model generalization, providing new insights into language modeling approaches.

Abstract: Language prediction is constrained by informational entropy intrinsic to language, such that there exists a limit to how accurate any language model can become and equivalently a lower bound to language compression. The most efficient language compression algorithms today are causal (next token prediction) large language models, but the use of these models to form accurate estimates of language entropy is currently computationally infeasible. We introduce encoder-augmented causal decoder model architectures that exhibit superior training efficiency characteristics and achieve higher compression than causal transformers even when trained on modest hardware. We demonstrate how entropy estimates can be obtained on a per-token basis, and show that the generalization of models trained to approach the entropy of their training data necessarily exceeds the generalization of models trained to minimize loss beyond this value. We show empirically that causal models trained to approach but not exceed estimated per-token entropies exhibit greater generalization than models trained without taking entropy into account.

*Haizhou Shi,Ye Liu,Bo Pang,Zeyu Leo Liu,Hao Wang,Silvio Savarese,Caiming Xiong,Yingbo Zhou,Semih Yavuz*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Socratic Self-Refine (SSR), a framework for improving reasoning in large language models by breaking down responses into verifiable steps and refining unreliable ones, achieving better results than existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing frameworks for testing LLM reasoning rely on coarse self-verification and correction, which are ineffective for complex tasks.

Method: The proposed SSR decomposes model responses into sub-question and sub-answer pairs, performs confidence estimation, and refines unreliable steps to enhance accuracy and interpretability.

Result: Empirical results show SSR improves performance across five reasoning benchmarks and three LLMs, surpassing state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: SSR not only enhances reasoning abilities in LLMs but also provides a black-box approach to evaluating their internal reasoning processes.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable reasoning abilities, yet existing test-time frameworks often rely on coarse self-verification and self-correction, limiting their effectiveness on complex tasks. In this paper, we propose Socratic Self-Refine (SSR), a novel framework for fine-grained evaluation and precise refinement of LLM reasoning. Our proposed SSR decomposes model responses into verifiable (sub-question, sub-answer) pairs, enabling step-level confidence estimation through controlled re-solving and self-consistency checks. By pinpointing unreliable steps and iteratively refining them, SSR produces more accurate and interpretable reasoning chains. Empirical results across five reasoning benchmarks and three LLMs show that SSR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art iterative self-refinement baselines. Beyond performance gains, SSR provides a principled black-box approach for evaluating and understanding the internal reasoning processes of LLMs. Code is available at https://github.com/SalesforceAIResearch/socratic-self-refine-reasoning.

*Tianzhu Ye,Li Dong,Zewen Chi,Xun Wu,Shaohan Huang,Furu Wei*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces Generative Adversarial Distillation (GAD), a method for black-box distillation of large language models (LLMs) that trains a student model to mimic a teacher's performance through adversarial learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to effectively train large language models in scenarios where only the teacher's textual outputs are available, without access to its internal parameters or logits.

Method: The method involves framing the student model as a generator and training a discriminator to distinguish between the student's and teacher's responses. The discriminator provides adaptive feedback to the student in an adversarial setup.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate that GAD outperforms traditional sequence-level knowledge distillation methods. Specifically, the student model performs comparably to its teacher on LMSYS-Chat automatic evaluation.

Conclusion: GAD is established as an effective and promising method for black-box distillation of large language models, enabling adaptive and stable model training.

Abstract: Black-box distillation creates student large language models (LLMs) by learning from a proprietary teacher model's text outputs alone, without access to its internal logits or parameters. In this work, we introduce Generative Adversarial Distillation (GAD), which enables on-policy and black-box distillation. GAD frames the student LLM as a generator and trains a discriminator to distinguish its responses from the teacher LLM's, creating a minimax game. The discriminator acts as an on-policy reward model that co-evolves with the student, providing stable, adaptive feedback. Experimental results show that GAD consistently surpasses the commonly used sequence-level knowledge distillation. In particular, Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct (student) trained with GAD becomes comparable to its teacher, GPT-5-Chat, on the LMSYS-Chat automatic evaluation. The results establish GAD as a promising and effective paradigm for black-box LLM distillation.

*Yesheng Liang,Haisheng Chen,Song Han,Zhijian Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces ParoQuant, a weight-only post-training quantization (PTQ) method addressing accuracy loss in reasoning language models caused by outliers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To solve the accuracy degradation in LLMs during PTQ due to outliers in weights and activations, especially in reasoning tasks with errors accumulating across steps.

Method: ParoQuant combines hardware-efficient independent Givens rotations and channel-wise scaling to reduce the dynamic range within groups, suppress outliers, and optimize GPU inference kernels.

Result: ParoQuant enhanced accuracy on reasoning tasks by 2.4% on average compared to AWQ while maintaining less than a 10% runtime overhead.

Conclusion: The method enables more accurate and efficient deployment of reasoning LLMs by addressing quantization issues effectively.

Abstract: Weight-only post-training quantization (PTQ) compresses the weights of Large Language Models (LLMs) into low-precision representations to reduce memory footprint and accelerate inference. However, the presence of outliers in weights and activations often leads to large quantization errors and severe accuracy degradation, especially in recent reasoning LLMs where errors accumulate across long chains of thought. Existing PTQ methods either fail to sufficiently suppress outliers or introduce significant overhead during inference. In this paper, we propose Pairwise Rotation Quantization (ParoQuant), a weight-only PTQ method that combines hardware-efficient and optimizable independent Givens rotations with channel-wise scaling to even out the magnitude across channels and narrow the dynamic range within each quantization group. We further co-design the inference kernel to fully exploit GPU parallelism and keep the rotations and scaling lightweight at runtime. ParoQuant achieves an average 2.4% accuracy improvement over AWQ on reasoning tasks with less than 10% overhead. This paves the way for more efficient and accurate deployment of reasoning LLMs.

*Ming Yang,Dongrun Li,Xin Wang,Feng Li,Lisheng Fan,Chunxiao Wang,Xiaoming Wu,Peng Cheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces FedeCouple, a federated learning approach enhancing coordination between feature extractors and classifiers to achieve superior global generalization and local adaptability in privacy-preserving scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to improve personalized federated learning methods by addressing the inadequate coordination between feature extractors and classifiers that results in suboptimal model performance.

Method: FedeCouple jointly learns global and local feature representations, employs dynamic knowledge distillation for personalized classifier generalization, and uses anchors for privacy preservation and reduced communication overhead.

Result: Extensive experiments on five image-classification datasets demonstrate FedeCouple’s superior effectiveness, stability, scalability, and security, surpassing a baseline by 4.3%.

Conclusion: FedeCouple balances the global and local aspects of feature learning, effectively improving personalization, model performance, and privacy in federated learning systems.

Abstract: In privacy-preserving mobile network transmission scenarios with heterogeneous client data, personalized federated learning methods that decouple feature extractors and classifiers have demonstrated notable advantages in enhancing learning capability. However, many existing approaches primarily focus on feature space consistency and classification personalization during local training, often neglecting the local adaptability of the extractor and the global generalization of the classifier. This oversight results in insufficient coordination and weak coupling between the components, ultimately degrading the overall model performance. To address this challenge, we propose FedeCouple, a federated learning method that balances global generalization and local adaptability at a fine-grained level. Our approach jointly learns global and local feature representations while employing dynamic knowledge distillation to enhance the generalization of personalized classifiers. We further introduce anchors to refine the feature space; their strict locality and non-transmission inherently preserve privacy and reduce communication overhead. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical analysis proving that FedeCouple converges for nonconvex objectives, with iterates approaching a stationary point as the number of communication rounds increases. Extensive experiments conducted on five image-classification datasets demonstrate that FedeCouple consistently outperforms nine baseline methods in effectiveness, stability, scalability, and security. Notably, in experiments evaluating effectiveness, FedeCouple surpasses the best baseline by a significant margin of 4.3%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the failure mode caused by error propagation in sequential, autoregressive approaches in thinking-aware generation, leading to degraded performance.

Method: Developed a benchmark called ParaBench to systematically evaluate text and image modalities, and introduced MMaDA-Parallel, a parallel multimodal diffusion framework enhanced with supervised finetuning and Parallel Reinforcement Learning (ParaRL) for improved cross-modal alignment.

Result: MMaDA-Parallel demonstrates a 6.9% improvement in Output Alignment on ParaBench compared to state-of-the-art models like Bagel, showcasing better cross-modal consistency.

Conclusion: MMaDA-Parallel establishes a more robust paradigm for thinking-aware image synthesis, effectively addressing performance degradation issues in sequential generation approaches.

Abstract: While thinking-aware generation aims to improve performance on complex tasks, we identify a critical failure mode where existing sequential, autoregressive approaches can paradoxically degrade performance due to error propagation. To systematically analyze this issue, we propose ParaBench, a new benchmark designed to evaluate both text and image output modalities. Our analysis using ParaBench reveals that this performance degradation is strongly correlated with poor alignment between the generated reasoning and the final image. To resolve this, we propose a parallel multimodal diffusion framework, MMaDA-Parallel, that enables continuous, bidirectional interaction between text and images throughout the entire denoising trajectory. MMaDA-Parallel is trained with supervised finetuning and then further optimized by Parallel Reinforcement Learning (ParaRL), a novel strategy that applies semantic rewards along the trajectory to enforce cross-modal consistency. Experiments validate that our model significantly improves cross-modal alignment and semantic consistency, achieving a 6.9\% improvement in Output Alignment on ParaBench compared to the state-of-the-art model, Bagel, establishing a more robust paradigm for thinking-aware image synthesis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing computer vision methods for primate behavior study rely on human-centric models and single datasets, limiting generalization. The paper aims to address these gaps by proposing a targeted, data-centric approach focused on primates.

Method: The authors created PriVi, a 424-hour curated video dataset sourced from behavioral research and web footage, used for pretraining a primate-specific model, V-JEPA. This dataset promotes scalability and diversity in data curation.

Result: The pretraining approach with PriVi outperformed prior methods across four benchmark datasets, demonstrating superior data efficiency and generalization capabilities, even with fewer labeled samples.

Conclusion: Primate-centric pretraining can significantly advance computer vision applications for studying non-human primate behavior, improving both generalization and efficiency in low-label scenarios. They will publicly provide the resources for further research.

Abstract: Non-human primates are our closest living relatives, and analyzing their behavior is central to research in cognition, evolution, and conservation. Computer vision could greatly aid this research, but existing methods often rely on human-centric pretrained models and focus on single datasets, which limits generalization. We address this limitation by shifting from a model-centric to a data-centric approach and introduce PriVi, a large-scale primate-centric video pretraining dataset. PriVi contains 424 hours of curated video, combining 174 hours from behavioral research across 11 settings with 250 hours of diverse web-sourced footage, assembled through a scalable data curation pipeline. We pretrain V-JEPA on PriVi to learn primate-specific representations and evaluate it using a lightweight frozen classifier. Across four benchmark datasets, ChimpACT, BaboonLand, PanAf500, and ChimpBehave, our approach consistently outperforms prior work, including fully finetuned baselines, and scales favorably with fewer labels. These results demonstrate that primate-centric pretraining substantially improves data efficiency and generalization, making it a promising approach for low-label applications. Code, models, and the majority of the dataset will be made available.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel method to automatically classify phonotrauma severity using vocal fold images, utilizing soft ordinal regression for better handling of annotator uncertainty.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current assessments of phonotrauma severity rely on clinicians' judgment, which is costly, inconsistent, and resource-intensive. Development of an automated method fills this gap and enables more scalable and reliable assessments.

Method: The authors adopt an ordinal regression framework and introduce a modified loss function to handle soft labels based on annotator ratings, allowing better handling of label uncertainty.

Result: The proposed method achieves predictive performance comparable to clinical experts and provides reliable uncertainty estimates.

Conclusion: The development of this automated tool could enhance research on phonotrauma by enabling large-scale studies and improving clinical understanding and care for patients.

Abstract: Phonotrauma refers to vocal fold tissue damage resulting from exposure to forces during voicing. It occurs on a continuum from mild to severe, and treatment options can vary based on severity. Assessment of severity involves a clinician's expert judgment, which is costly and can vary widely in reliability. In this work, we present the first method for automatically classifying phonotrauma severity from vocal fold images. To account for the ordinal nature of the labels, we adopt a widely used ordinal regression framework. To account for label uncertainty, we propose a novel modification to ordinal regression loss functions that enables them to operate on soft labels reflecting annotator rating distributions. Our proposed soft ordinal regression method achieves predictive performance approaching that of clinical experts, while producing well-calibrated uncertainty estimates. By providing an automated tool for phonotrauma severity assessment, our work can enable large-scale studies of phonotrauma, ultimately leading to improved clinical understanding and patient care.

TL;DR: The paper introduces SliderEdit, a framework for fine-grained, continuous control in instruction-based image editing models, allowing smooth adjustment of individual edit strengths via sliders.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current instruction-based image editing models lack the ability to precisely control edit intensities for individual instructions in multi-part prompts.

Method: SliderEdit uses globally trained sliders and low-rank adaptation matrices to disentangle and continuously adjust individual edit instructions without requiring separate fine-tuning.

Result: The framework improves edit controllability, visual consistency, and user steerability when applied to state-of-the-art models like FLUX-Kontext and Qwen-Image-Edit.

Conclusion: SliderEdit is the first framework enabling continuous control in instruction-based editing models, offering interactive and compositional control over image manipulation.

Abstract: Instruction-based image editing models have recently achieved impressive performance, enabling complex edits to an input image from a multi-instruction prompt. However, these models apply each instruction in the prompt with a fixed strength, limiting the user's ability to precisely and continuously control the intensity of individual edits. We introduce SliderEdit, a framework for continuous image editing with fine-grained, interpretable instruction control. Given a multi-part edit instruction, SliderEdit disentangles the individual instructions and exposes each as a globally trained slider, allowing smooth adjustment of its strength. Unlike prior works that introduced slider-based attribute controls in text-to-image generation, typically requiring separate training or fine-tuning for each attribute or concept, our method learns a single set of low-rank adaptation matrices that generalize across diverse edits, attributes, and compositional instructions. This enables continuous interpolation along individual edit dimensions while preserving both spatial locality and global semantic consistency. We apply SliderEdit to state-of-the-art image editing models, including FLUX-Kontext and Qwen-Image-Edit, and observe substantial improvements in edit controllability, visual consistency, and user steerability. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to explore and propose a framework for continuous, fine-grained instruction control in instruction-based image editing models. Our results pave the way for interactive, instruction-driven image manipulation with continuous and compositional control.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the temporal challenges unique to video-based crowd density estimation for real-time applications, aiming for efficiency and accuracy.

Method: It adapts an image-based density estimation algorithm for video by using a diffusion-based denoising model, Gaussian kernels, regression for feature extraction, similarity-based map consolidation, and selective sampling with optical flow.

Result: The method successfully captures crowd dynamics in various densities and reduces computational load, while achieving robust results measured via MAE and frame efficiency.

Conclusion: This scalable framework improves real-time crowd monitoring accuracy and efficiency, suitable for safety, disaster response, and event management applications.

Abstract: This study enhances a crowd density estimation algorithm originally designed for image-based analysis by adapting it for video-based scenarios. The proposed method integrates a denoising probabilistic model that utilizes diffusion processes to generate high-quality crowd density maps. To improve accuracy, narrow Gaussian kernels are employed, and multiple density map outputs are generated. A regression branch is incorporated into the model for precise feature extraction, while a consolidation mechanism combines these maps based on similarity scores to produce a robust final result. An event-driven sampling technique, utilizing the Farneback optical flow algorithm, is introduced to selectively capture frames showing significant crowd movements, reducing computational load and storage by focusing on critical crowd dynamics. Through qualitative and quantitative evaluations, including overlay plots and Mean Absolute Error (MAE), the model demonstrates its ability to effectively capture crowd dynamics in both dense and sparse settings. The efficiency of the sampling method is further assessed, showcasing its capability to decrease frame counts while maintaining essential crowd events. By addressing the temporal challenges unique to video analysis, this work offers a scalable and efficient framework for real-time crowd monitoring in applications such as public safety, disaster response, and event management.

Motivation: Address challenges in indoor localization, particularly in GPS-denied settings, focusing on limitations of existing vision-based methods such as short range LiDAR and layout ambiguity.

Method: Reconstruct 3D point clouds from RGB images using monocular depth estimation, followed by geometric matching to floor plans. Outputs are used for stationary and sequential localization.

Result: PALMS$+$ surpasses PALMS and F3Loc in accuracy on datasets, including both stationary setups and real-world sequential localization trajectories.

Conclusion: PALMS$+$ is a robust and efficient system for infrastructure-free indoor localization, showing potential for emergency response and assistive navigation applications.

Abstract: Indoor localization in GPS-denied environments is crucial for applications like emergency response and assistive navigation. Vision-based methods such as PALMS enable infrastructure-free localization using only a floor plan and a stationary scan, but are limited by the short range of smartphone LiDAR and ambiguity in indoor layouts. We propose PALMS$+$, a modular, image-based system that addresses these challenges by reconstructing scale-aligned 3D point clouds from posed RGB images using a foundation monocular depth estimation model (Depth Pro), followed by geometric layout matching via convolution with the floor plan. PALMS$+$ outputs a posterior over the location and orientation, usable for direct or sequential localization. Evaluated on the Structured3D and a custom campus dataset consisting of 80 observations across four large campus buildings, PALMS$+$ outperforms PALMS and F3Loc in stationary localization accuracy -- without requiring any training. Furthermore, when integrated with a particle filter for sequential localization on 33 real-world trajectories, PALMS$+$ achieved lower localization errors compared to other methods, demonstrating robustness for camera-free tracking and its potential for infrastructure-free applications.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new deep learning model to improve pedestrian trajectory prediction by addressing physical occupancy and collision issues, achieving significant improvements in collision reduction and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the accuracy and realism of pedestrian trajectory prediction in crowded and dynamic environments by addressing limitations of existing models that treat pedestrians as point entities.

Method: The method involves enhancing the Social LSTM model with a novel Dynamic Occupied Space loss function. This function reduces collisions and displacement error by considering scene density and individual spatial occupancy.

Result: The proposed model reduces collision rates by up to 31% and improves average displacement error and final displacement error by 5% and 6%, respectively, across various crowd density datasets.

Conclusion: The model demonstrates improved performance over traditional and state-of-the-art deep learning models, showing its robustness in handling both homogeneous and heterogeneous density pedestrian scenarios.

Abstract: In dynamic and crowded environments, realistic pedestrian trajectory prediction remains a challenging task due to the complex nature of human motion and the mutual influences among individuals. Deep learning models have recently achieved promising results by implicitly learning such patterns from 2D trajectory data. However, most approaches treat pedestrians as point entities, ignoring the physical space that each person occupies. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel deep learning model that enhances the Social LSTM with a new Dynamic Occupied Space loss function. This loss function guides Social LSTM in learning to avoid realistic collisions without increasing displacement error across different crowd densities, ranging from low to high, in both homogeneous and heterogeneous density settings. Such a function achieves this by combining the average displacement error with a new collision penalty that is sensitive to scene density and individual spatial occupancy. For efficient training and evaluation, five datasets were generated from real pedestrian trajectories recorded during the Festival of Lights in Lyon 2022. Four datasets represent homogeneous crowd conditions -- low, medium, high, and very high density -- while the fifth corresponds to a heterogeneous density distribution. The experimental findings indicate that the proposed model not only lowers collision rates but also enhances displacement prediction accuracy in each dataset. Specifically, the model achieves up to a 31% reduction in the collision rate and reduces the average displacement error and the final displacement error by 5% and 6%, respectively, on average across all datasets compared to the baseline. Moreover, the proposed model consistently outperforms several state-of-the-art deep learning models across most test sets.

Moreover, we present an extensive analysis of the Woodscape dataset showing that the original dataset contains a data-leakage and imprecise annotations. To address these problems, we create a new data subset, which, despite being much smaller, provides enough information for the segmentation method to reach comparable results in a much shorter time.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how pre-training domain, paradigm, and architecture impact the effectiveness of vision encoders for chest X-ray analysis.

Method: Evaluation of eight medical and general-domain FMs through classification and segmentation tasks using linear probing and fine-tuning.

Result: Medical FMs outperform general-domain models for initial feature quality, but localizing subtle pathologies requires significant fine-tuning. Architectural factors and supervised models remain critical.

Conclusion: Medical pre-training offers advantages, but pre-trained features are task-dependent, and supervised models often excel in complex cases. Multi-scale architectures are pivotal for performance.

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) promise to generalize medical imaging, but their effectiveness varies. It remains unclear how pre-training domain (medical vs. general), paradigm (e.g., text-guided), and architecture influence embedding quality, hindering the selection of optimal encoders for specific radiology tasks. To address this, we evaluate vision encoders from eight medical and general-domain FMs for chest X-ray analysis. We benchmark classification (pneumothorax, cardiomegaly) and segmentation (pneumothorax, cardiac boundary) using linear probing and fine-tuning. Our results show that domain-specific pre-training provides a significant advantage; medical FMs consistently outperformed general-domain models in linear probing, establishing superior initial feature quality. However, feature utility is highly task-dependent. Pre-trained embeddings were strong for global classification and segmenting salient anatomy (e.g., heart). In contrast, for segmenting complex, subtle pathologies (e.g., pneumothorax), all FMs performed poorly without significant fine-tuning, revealing a critical gap in localizing subtle disease. Subgroup analysis showed FMs use confounding shortcuts (e.g., chest tubes for pneumothorax) for classification, a strategy that fails for precise segmentation. We also found that expensive text-image alignment is not a prerequisite; image-only (RAD-DINO) and label-supervised (Ark+) FMs were among top performers. Notably, a supervised, end-to-end baseline remained highly competitive, matching or exceeding the best FMs on segmentation tasks. These findings show that while medical pre-training is beneficial, architectural choices (e.g., multi-scale) are critical, and pre-trained features are not universally effective, especially for complex localization tasks where supervised models remain a strong alternative.

Conclusion: The method improves iris image augmentation and dataset diversity, facilitating better iris recognition and attack detection research.

Abstract: Developing reliable iris recognition and presentation attack detection methods requires diverse datasets that capture realistic variations in iris features and a wide spectrum of anomalies. Because of the rich texture of iris images, which spans a wide range of spatial frequencies, synthesizing same-identity iris images while controlling specific attributes remains challenging. In this work, we introduce a new iris image augmentation strategy by traversing a generative model's latent space toward latent codes that represent same-identity samples but with some desired iris image properties manipulated. The latent space traversal is guided by a gradient of specific geometrical, textural, or quality-related iris image features (e.g., sharpness, pupil size, iris size, or pupil-to-iris ratio) and preserves the identity represented by the image being manipulated. The proposed approach can be easily extended to manipulate any attribute for which a differentiable loss term can be formulated. Additionally, our approach can use either randomly generated images using either a pre-train GAN model or real-world iris images. We can utilize GAN inversion to project any given iris image into the latent space and obtain its corresponding latent code.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: STORM is a real-time 6D pose estimation system that eliminates the need for manual annotation, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy even under challenging conditions like occlusions and rapid movement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to overcome the limitations of existing 6D pose estimation methods, such as reliance on manually annotated segmentation masks, which are labor-intensive and struggle with occlusions and rapid movements.

Method: The proposed STORM system operates through a novel three-stage pipeline combining vision-language understanding and self-supervised feature matching, along with an automatic re-registration mechanism to recover from tracking failures.

Result: STORM achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on challenging datasets, handling multi-object occlusions, rapid motion, and varying lighting conditions, while running in real-time and requiring no additional training.

Conclusion: STORM provides an annotation-free, efficient, and accurate solution for 6D pose estimation, reducing deployment overhead for applications like manufacturing and quality control.

Abstract: Accurate 6D pose estimation and tracking are fundamental capabilities for physical AI systems such as robots. However, existing approaches typically rely on a manually annotated segmentation mask of the target in the first frame, which is labor-intensive and leads to reduced performance when faced with occlusions or rapid movement. To address these limi- tations, we propose STORM (Segment, Track, and Object Re-localization from a single 3D Model), an open-source robust real-time 6D pose estimation system that requires no manual annotation. STORM employs a novel three-stage pipeline combining vision-language understanding with self-supervised feature matching: contextual object descriptions guide localization, self-cross-attention mechanisms identify candidate regions, and a segmentation model produces precise masks for accurate pose estimation. Another key innovation is our automatic re-registration mechanism that detects tracking failures through feature similarity monitoring and recovers from severe occlusions or rapid motion. STORM achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on challenging industrial datasets featuring multi-object occlusions, high-speed motion, and varying illumination, while operating at real-time speeds without additional training. This annotation-free approach significantly reduces deployment overhead, providing a practical solution for modern applications, such as flexible manufacturing and intelligent quality control.

*Siddeshwar Raghavan,Jiangpeng He,Fengqing Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces PANDA, a framework addressing dual-level data imbalances in Exemplar-Free Continual Learning (EFCL), significantly enhancing learning and mitigating catastrophic forgetting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to tackle dual-level imbalances (intra-task and inter-task disparities) in real-world data streams that impair learning and generalization in EFCL, specially with pre-trained models that lack mechanisms to address these challenges.

Method: The proposed PANDA framework enhances low-frequency class representation using a CLIP encoder to identify and transplant representative regions into frequent-class samples. It also adapts balancing strategies based on prior task distributions to smooth inter-task disparities.

Result: PANDA, when integrated with PTM-based EFCL methods, improves learning accuracy and reduces the extent of catastrophic forgetting, as shown through extensive experiments and ablation studies.

Conclusion: The study concludes that PANDA effectively enhances performance in EFCL tasks by addressing the identified data imbalances, ensuring better learning using frozen pre-trained models.

Abstract: Exemplar-Free Continual Learning (EFCL) restricts the storage of previous task data and is highly susceptible to catastrophic forgetting. While pre-trained models (PTMs) are increasingly leveraged for EFCL, existing methods often overlook the inherent imbalance of real-world data distributions. We discovered that real-world data streams commonly exhibit dual-level imbalances, dataset-level distributions combined with extreme or reversed skews within individual tasks, creating both intra-task and inter-task disparities that hinder effective learning and generalization. To address these challenges, we propose PANDA, a Patch-and-Distribution-Aware Augmentation framework that integrates seamlessly with existing PTM-based EFCL methods. PANDA amplifies low-frequency classes by using a CLIP encoder to identify representative regions and transplanting those into frequent-class samples within each task. Furthermore, PANDA incorporates an adaptive balancing strategy that leverages prior task distributions to smooth inter-task imbalances, reducing the overall gap between average samples across tasks and enabling fairer learning with frozen PTMs. Extensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrate PANDA's capability to work with existing PTM-based CL methods, improving accuracy and reducing catastrophic forgetting.

*Konstantinos M. Dafnis,Dimitris N. Metaxas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Spectrum-Aware Test-Time Steering (STS), a lightweight framework for domain shift adaptation in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) that operates without modifying core model components and achieves faster inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of degraded performance in Vision-Language Models under test-time domain shifts.

Method: The proposed method, STS, extracts a spectral subspace from textual embeddings, defines principal semantic directions, and steers latent representations using entropy minimization without backpropagating through encoder weights.

Result: STS achieves state-of-the-art or comparable results, introducing minimal parameters and accelerating test-time inference by up to 8x with a significantly reduced memory footprint.

Conclusion: STS offers an efficient, lightweight, and practical solution for test-time adaptation in Vision-Language Models, outperforming existing strategies in speed and resource usage.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel at zero-shot inference but often degrade under test-time domain shifts. For this reason, episodic test-time adaptation strategies have recently emerged as powerful techniques for adapting VLMs to a single unlabeled image. However, existing adaptation strategies, such as test-time prompt tuning, typically require backpropagating through large encoder weights or altering core model components. In this work, we introduce Spectrum-Aware Test-Time Steering (STS), a lightweight adaptation framework that extracts a spectral subspace from the textual embeddings to define principal semantic directions and learns to steer latent representations in a spectrum-aware manner by adapting a small number of per-sample shift parameters to minimize entropy across augmented views. STS operates entirely at inference in the latent space, without backpropagation through or modification of the frozen encoders. Building on standard evaluation protocols, our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that STS largely surpasses or compares favorably against state-of-the-art test-time adaptation methods, while introducing only a handful of additional parameters and achieving inference speeds up to 8x faster with a 12x smaller memory footprint than conventional test-time prompt tuning.

*Hanzhou Liu,Peng Jiang,Jia Huang,Mi Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Lumos3D is a framework for restoring 3D scenes captured in low-light conditions without requiring precomputed camera poses or scene-specific optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for low-light 3D scene restoration require precomputed camera poses and scene-specific optimization, limiting their scalability in dynamic real-world environments.

Method: Lumos3D uses a geometry-grounded backbone to reconstruct 3D Gaussian representations of scenes. It employs a cross-illumination distillation scheme to transfer depth and accurate geometric information from teacher to student models during training and incorporates a specialized loss function to ensure photometric consistency.

Result: Lumos3D shows strong generalization to unseen cases, achieving high-fidelity restoration of low-light 3D scenes with accurate geometry. It is also adaptable to over-exposure correction.

Conclusion: Lumos3D provides a scalable and versatile solution for 3D scene restoration under diverse lighting conditions, overcoming the limitations of traditional approaches.

Abstract: Restoring 3D scenes captured under low-light con- ditions remains a fundamental yet challenging problem. Most existing approaches depend on precomputed camera poses and scene-specific optimization, which greatly restricts their scala- bility to dynamic real-world environments. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Lumos3D, a generalizable pose-free framework for 3D low-light scene restoration. Trained once on a single dataset, Lumos3D performs inference in a purely feed- forward manner, directly restoring illumination and structure from unposed, low-light multi-view images without any per- scene training or optimization. Built upon a geometry-grounded backbone, Lumos3D reconstructs a normal-light 3D Gaussian representation that restores illumination while faithfully pre- serving structural details. During training, a cross-illumination distillation scheme is employed, where the teacher network is distilled on normal-light ground truth to transfer accurate geometric information, such as depth, to the student model. A dedicated Lumos loss is further introduced to promote photomet- ric consistency within the reconstructed 3D space. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that Lumos3D achieves high- fidelity low-light 3D scene restoration with accurate geometry and strong generalization to unseen cases. Furthermore, the framework naturally extends to handle over-exposure correction, highlighting its versatility for diverse lighting restoration tasks.

*Jeongho Min,Dongyoung Kim,Jaehyup Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents a novel zero-shot cross-view image retrieval method using a pretrained vision encoder and a large language model, requiring no supervised training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing cross-view image retrieval methods, which depend on supervised training and curated datasets, making real-world deployment challenging.

Method: The approach uses a pretrained vision encoder and LLM to infer locations and retrieve corresponding satellite images without any additional training or supervision.

Result: The method outperformed prior learning-based approaches in zero-shot settings on benchmark datasets and enables automated, cost-effective dataset construction.

Conclusion: This scalable and effective method demonstrates the potential of combining pretrained models and LLMs for cross-view image retrieval without requiring curated datasets or ground-truth annotations.

Abstract: Cross-view image retrieval, particularly street-to-satellite matching, is a critical task for applications such as autonomous navigation, urban planning, and localization in GPS-denied environments. However, existing approaches often require supervised training on curated datasets and rely on panoramic or UAV-based images, which limits real-world deployment. In this paper, we present a simple yet effective cross-view image retrieval framework that leverages a pretrained vision encoder and a large language model (LLM), requiring no additional training. Given a monocular street-view image, our method extracts geographic cues through web-based image search and LLM-based location inference, generates a satellite query via geocoding API, and retrieves matching tiles using a pretrained vision encoder (e.g., DINOv2) with PCA-based whitening feature refinement. Despite using no ground-truth supervision or finetuning, our proposed method outperforms prior learning-based approaches on the benchmark dataset under zero-shot settings. Moreover, our pipeline enables automatic construction of semantically aligned street-to-satellite datasets, which is offering a scalable and cost-efficient alternative to manual annotation.

*Aymen Mir,Jian Wang,Riza Alp Guler,Chuan Guo,Gerard Pons-Moll,Bing Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel framework using 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) for animating humans in 3D scenes, enabling photorealistic free-viewpoint rendering and realistic human-scene interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing animation pipelines rely on meshes or point clouds and struggle to combine photorealistic rendering with smooth human-scene interaction. The authors aim to explore 3D Gaussian Splatting as an alternative for improved geometry consistency and rendering quality.

Method: The approach represents humans and scenes as Gaussians, decoupling rendering from motion synthesis. It utilizes a Gaussian-aligned motion module for pose alignment and opacity-based cues, along with a human-scene Gaussian refinement optimization to enforce realistic interactions.

Result: The framework demonstrates successful human animation with realistic interactions in 3D scenes like Scannet++ and SuperSplat. It enables applications such as free-viewpoint rendering of edited monocular RGB videos with animated humans.

Conclusion: 3DGS emerges as a promising solution for human animation in 3D scenes due to its geometry consistency and photorealistic capabilities. This framework opens up new possibilities for video-based applications and human-scene interaction.

Abstract: We present a novel framework for animating humans in 3D scenes using 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), a neural scene representation that has recently achieved state-of-the-art photorealistic results for novel-view synthesis but remains under-explored for human-scene animation and interaction. Unlike existing animation pipelines that use meshes or point clouds as the underlying 3D representation, our approach introduces the use of 3DGS as the 3D representation to the problem of animating humans in scenes. By representing humans and scenes as Gaussians, our approach allows for geometry-consistent free-viewpoint rendering of humans interacting with 3D scenes. Our key insight is that the rendering can be decoupled from the motion synthesis and each sub-problem can be addressed independently, without the need for paired human-scene data. Central to our method is a Gaussian-aligned motion module that synthesizes motion without explicit scene geometry, using opacity-based cues and projected Gaussian structures to guide human placement and pose alignment. To ensure natural interactions, we further propose a human-scene Gaussian refinement optimization that enforces realistic contact and navigation. We evaluate our approach on scenes from Scannet++ and the SuperSplat library, and on avatars reconstructed from sparse and dense multi-view human capture. Finally, we demonstrate that our framework allows for novel applications such as geometry-consistent free-viewpoint rendering of edited monocular RGB videos with new animated humans, showcasing the unique advantage of 3DGS for monocular video-based human animation.

*Xuntao Lyu,Ching-Chi Lin,Abdullah Al Arafat,Georg von der Brüggen,Jian-Jia Chen,Zhishan Guo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CertMask is a proposed defense mechanism for adversarial patch attacks that improves certified robust accuracy while reducing computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the threat posed by adversarial patch attacks to deep vision models, particularly in real-world applications, and to improve efficiency and effectiveness of defenses against such attacks.

Method: CertMask constructs a provably sufficient set of binary masks using a mathematically rigorous coverage strategy ensuring each patch location is covered at least k times. Its single-round masking achieves O(n) time complexity compared to PatchCleanser’s O(n^2).

Result: CertMask improves certified robust accuracy by up to +13.4% over PatchCleanser on datasets such as ImageNet, ImageNette, and CIFAR-10 and maintains clean accuracy near the vanilla model.

Conclusion: CertMask is a more efficient and robust defense method against adversarial patch attacks, with strong theoretical guarantees and improved performance in experiments.

Abstract: Adversarial patch attacks inject localized perturbations into images to mislead deep vision models. These attacks can be physically deployed, posing serious risks to real-world applications. In this paper, we propose CertMask, a certifiably robust defense that constructs a provably sufficient set of binary masks to neutralize patch effects with strong theoretical guarantees. While the state-of-the-art approach (PatchCleanser) requires two rounds of masking and incurs $O(n^2)$ inference cost, CertMask performs only a single round of masking with $O(n)$ time complexity, where $n$ is the cardinality of the mask set to cover an input image. Our proposed mask set is computed using a mathematically rigorous coverage strategy that ensures each possible patch location is covered at least $k$ times, providing both efficiency and robustness. We offer a theoretical analysis of the coverage condition and prove its sufficiency for certification. Experiments on ImageNet, ImageNette, and CIFAR-10 show that CertMask improves certified robust accuracy by up to +13.4\% over PatchCleanser, while maintaining clean accuracy nearly identical to the vanilla model.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores the use of pretrained foundation models for analyzing solar wind structures to enhance space weather prediction and performance challenges are noted.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to improve automated classification of solar wind structures, which is essential for reliable space weather prediction given the increasing threats posed by space weather to satellites and ground-based technologies.

Method: A foundation model trained on Solar Dynamics Observatory imagery was adapted to create embeddings for solar wind structure analysis, incorporating spacecraft position and solar magnetic connectivity encoded via Fourier features. The model was fine-tuned with Parker Solar Probe data.

Result: The model demonstrated the feasibility of using foundation model embeddings for solar wind analysis, though classification performance was modest due to challenges like coarse labeling, class imbalance, and limited model transferability.

Conclusion: This proof-of-concept suggests that foundation models could significantly aid in developing more accurate space weather predictions with further refinements. Openly available code encourages reproducibility and future improvement.

Abstract: Space weather at Earth, driven by the solar activity, poses growing risks to satellites around our planet as well as to critical ground-based technological infrastructure. Major space weather contributors are the solar wind and coronal mass ejections whose variable density, speed, temperature, and magnetic field make the automated classification of those structures challenging. In this work, we adapt a foundation model for solar physics, originally trained on Solar Dynamics Observatory imagery, to create embeddings suitable for solar wind structure analysis. These embeddings are concatenated with the spacecraft position and solar magnetic connectivity encoded using Fourier features which generates a neural field-based model. The full deep learning architecture is fine-tuned bridging the gap between remote sensing and in situ observations. Labels are derived from Parker Solar Probe measurements, forming a downstream classification task that maps plasma properties to solar wind structures. Although overall classification performance is modest, likely due to coarse labeling, class imbalance, and limited transferability of the pretrained model, this study demonstrates the feasibility of leveraging foundation model embeddings for in situ solar wind tasks. As a first proof-of-concept, it lays the groundwork for future improvements toward more reliable space weather predictions. The code and configuration files used in this study are publicly available to support reproducibility.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel method, IPCD-Net, for decomposing colored point clouds into albedo and shade, addressing challenges of non-grid data and global-light direction. Experimental results show improved accuracy and real-world applicability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Point clouds are essential in fields like AR and robotics, but relighting and texture editing need accurate albedo-shade separation. Conventional tools fail with non-grid point cloud structure and disregard global-light direction.

Method: The authors propose IPCD-Net, which combines image-based decomposition with point-wise feature aggregation for non-grid data. They also introduce PLD for improved luminance distribution using hierarchical feature refinement and multi-view projection.

Result: IPCD-Net effectively reduces shadow artifacts in albedo and improves shade accuracy. It also facilitates tasks like texture editing, relighting, and point-cloud registration under varied illumination.

Conclusion: IPCD-Net overcomes key challenges in point-cloud decomposition, showing reliable performance in synthetic and real-world scenarios for tasks requiring precise albedo-shade separation.

Abstract: Point clouds are widely used in various fields, including augmented reality (AR) and robotics, where relighting and texture editing are crucial for realistic visualization. Achieving these tasks requires accurately separating albedo from shade. However, performing this separation on point clouds presents two key challenges: (1) the non-grid structure of point clouds makes conventional image-based decomposition models ineffective, and (2) point-cloud models designed for other tasks do not explicitly consider global-light direction, resulting in inaccurate shade. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{Intrinsic Point-Cloud Decomposition (IPCD)}, which extends image decomposition to the direct decomposition of colored point clouds into albedo and shade. To overcome challenge (1), we propose \textbf{IPCD-Net} that extends image-based model with point-wise feature aggregation for non-grid data processing. For challenge (2), we introduce \textbf{Projection-based Luminance Distribution (PLD)} with a hierarchical feature refinement, capturing global-light ques via multi-view projection. For comprehensive evaluation, we create a synthetic outdoor-scene dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that IPCD-Net reduces cast shadows in albedo and enhances color accuracy in shade. Furthermore, we showcase its applications in texture editing, relighting, and point-cloud registration under varying illumination. Finally, we verify the real-world applicability of IPCD-Net.

*Peng Gao,Yujian Lee,Xiaofeng Zhang,Zailong Chen,Hui Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenges in modeling long-range dependencies in LVLMs caused by attention decay due to ROPE. It introduces a training-free, inference-only method called T-DRS to overcome this limitation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LVLMs face difficulties in handling long-range dependencies due to the attention decay induced by ROPE, severely impairing their ability to capture global context.

Method: The authors propose T-DRS, comprising three components: SD-DRS (amplifying distant semantic signals), DC-DRS (modulating weights based on positional distances), and reRD-DRS (reinforcing remote dependencies). These strategies aim to recover long-range token pair interactions during inference.

Result: Experiments on VQA benchmarks show T-DRS consistently enhances performance without requiring additional training.

Conclusion: T-DRS effectively mitigates attention decay in LVLMs, enabling improved modeling of global context while maintaining local inductive biases, offering a practical and efficient solution for long-range dependency challenges.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have achieved impressive performance across a wide range of multimodal tasks. However, they still face critical challenges in modeling long-range dependencies under the usage of Rotary Positional Encoding (ROPE). Although it can facilitate precise modeling of token positions, it induces progressive attention decay as token distance increases, especially with progressive attention decay over distant token pairs, which severely impairs the model's ability to remember global context. To alleviate this issue, we propose inference-only Three-step Decay Resilience Strategies (T-DRS), comprising (1) Semantic-Driven DRS (SD-DRS), amplifying semantically meaningful but distant signals via content-aware residuals, (2) Distance-aware Control DRS (DC-DRS), which can purify attention by smoothly modulating weights based on positional distances, suppressing noise while preserving locality, and (3) re-Reinforce Distant DRS (reRD-DRS), consolidating the remaining informative remote dependencies to maintain global coherence. Together, the T-DRS recover suppressed long-range token pairs without harming local inductive biases. Extensive experiments on Vision Question Answering (VQA) benchmarks demonstrate that T-DRS can consistently improve performance in a training-free manner.

TL;DR: This paper introduces SAM-DAQ, a model that integrates depth and temporal cues using novel adapters and memory-driven queries, aiming to enhance video salient object detection with SAM while addressing existing challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenges encountered when using the Segment Anything Model (SAM) for RGB-D video salient object detection, including reliance on manual prompts, high memory usage, and computational difficulty.

Method: The SAM-DAQ method uses a multi-modal image encoder with depth-guided parallel adapters, integrates depth cues without manual prompts, and employs a query-driven temporal memory module that iteratively updates temporal representations.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate SAM-DAQ's superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods on three RGB-D VSOD datasets.

Conclusion: SAM-DAQ efficiently addresses limitations of using SAM for RGB-D VSOD tasks, achieving higher metrics and effective object detection through depth and temporal integrations.

Abstract: Recently segment anything model (SAM) has attracted widespread concerns, and it is often treated as a vision foundation model for universal segmentation. Some researchers have attempted to directly apply the foundation model to the RGB-D video salient object detection (RGB-D VSOD) task, which often encounters three challenges, including the dependence on manual prompts, the high memory consumption of sequential adapters, and the computational burden of memory attention. To address the limitations, we propose a novel method, namely Segment Anything Model with Depth-guided Adaptive Queries (SAM-DAQ), which adapts SAM2 to pop-out salient objects from videos by seamlessly integrating depth and temporal cues within a unified framework. Firstly, we deploy a parallel adapter-based multi-modal image encoder (PAMIE), which incorporates several depth-guided parallel adapters (DPAs) in a skip-connection way. Remarkably, we fine-tune the frozen SAM encoder under prompt-free conditions, where the DPA utilizes depth cues to facilitate the fusion of multi-modal features. Secondly, we deploy a query-driven temporal memory (QTM) module, which unifies the memory bank and prompt embeddings into a learnable pipeline. Concretely, by leveraging both frame-level queries and video-level queries simultaneously, the QTM module can not only selectively extract temporal consistency features but also iteratively update the temporal representations of the queries. Extensive experiments are conducted on three RGB-D VSOD datasets, and the results show that the proposed SAM-DAQ consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of all evaluation metrics.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VISTA introduces a novel transformer-based approach for multi-agent trajectory prediction, focusing on balancing long-term goal alignment and social interactions, outperforming existing benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of predicting realistic multi-agent trajectories in dense, interactive, and safety-critical environments by overcoming limitations in capturing agents' goals and social dynamics.

Method: The proposed VISTA model integrates a recursive goal-conditioned transformer framework using cross-attention fusion, social-token attention for agent interactions, and pairwise attention maps for interpretability.

Result: VISTA achieves state-of-the-art performance in trajectory accuracy and collision avoidance on MADRAS and SDD benchmarks, with significant improvements in reducing collision rates and enhancing metrics like ADE, FDE, and minFDE.

Conclusion: VISTA provides socially compliant, goal-aware, and interpretable multi-agent trajectory predictions, suggesting its potential for enhancing safety and efficiency in autonomous systems.

Abstract: Multi-agent trajectory prediction is crucial for autonomous systems operating in dense, interactive environments. Existing methods often fail to jointly capture agents' long-term goals and their fine-grained social interactions, which leads to unrealistic multi-agent futures. We propose VISTA, a recursive goal-conditioned transformer for multi-agent trajectory forecasting. VISTA combines (i) a cross-attention fusion module that integrates long-horizon intent with past motion, (ii) a social-token attention mechanism for flexible interaction modeling across agents, and (iii) pairwise attention maps that make social influence patterns interpretable at inference time. Our model turns single-agent goal-conditioned prediction into a coherent multi-agent forecasting framework. Beyond standard displacement metrics, we evaluate trajectory collision rates as a measure of joint realism. On the high-density MADRAS benchmark and on SDD, VISTA achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and substantially fewer collisions. On MADRAS, it reduces the average collision rate of strong baselines from 2.14 to 0.03 percent, and on SDD it attains zero collisions while improving ADE, FDE, and minFDE. These results show that VISTA generates socially compliant, goal-aware, and interpretable trajectories, making it promising for safety-critical autonomous systems.

Result: RWKV-PCSSC reduces parameter count by 4.18x, improves memory efficiency by 1.37x, and achieves state-of-the-art performance across various datasets.

Conclusion: RWKV-PCSSC presents a resource-efficient solution for SSC with significant performance gains, addressing limitations of prior models.

Abstract: Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) aims to generate a complete semantic scene from an incomplete input. Existing approaches often employ dense network architectures with a high parameter count, leading to increased model complexity and resource demands. To address these limitations, we propose RWKV-PCSSC, a lightweight point cloud semantic scene completion network inspired by the Receptance Weighted Key Value (RWKV) mechanism. Specifically, we introduce a RWKV Seed Generator (RWKV-SG) module that can aggregate features from a partial point cloud to produce a coarse point cloud with coarse features. Subsequently, the point-wise feature of the point cloud is progressively restored through multiple stages of the RWKV Point Deconvolution (RWKV-PD) modules. By leveraging a compact and efficient design, our method achieves a lightweight model representation. Experimental results demonstrate that RWKV-PCSSC reduces the parameter count by 4.18$\times$ and improves memory efficiency by 1.37$\times$ compared to state-of-the-art methods PointSSC. Furthermore, our network achieves state-of-the-art performance on established indoor (SSC-PC, NYUCAD-PC) and outdoor (PointSSC) scene dataset, as well as on our proposed datasets (NYUCAD-PC-V2, 3D-FRONT-PC).

Conclusion: MSGNav enhances zero-shot embodied navigation by integrating dynamic, multi-modal visual information and solving the last-mile target location problem, providing an efficient and open vocabulary navigation system.

Abstract: Embodied navigation is a fundamental capability for robotic agents operating. Real-world deployment requires open vocabulary generalization and low training overhead, motivating zero-shot methods rather than task-specific RL training. However, existing zero-shot methods that build explicit 3D scene graphs often compress rich visual observations into text-only relations, leading to high construction cost, irreversible loss of visual evidence, and constrained vocabularies. To address these limitations, we introduce the Multi-modal 3D Scene Graph (M3DSG), which preserves visual cues by replacing textual relational edges with dynamically assigned images. Built on M3DSG, we propose MSGNav, a zero-shot navigation system that includes a Key Subgraph Selection module for efficient reasoning, an Adaptive Vocabulary Update module for open vocabulary support, and a Closed-Loop Reasoning module for accurate exploration reasoning. Additionally, we further identify the last-mile problem in zero-shot navigation - determining the feasible target location with a suitable final viewpoint, and propose a Visibility-based Viewpoint Decision module to explicitly resolve it. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that MSGNav achieves state-of-the-art performance on GOAT-Bench and HM3D-OVON datasets. The open-source code will be publicly available.

*Liheng Zhang,Jin Wang,Hui Li,Bingfeng Zhang,Weifeng Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces an efficient method to compress 3D tokens using Hierarchical Compensatory Compression (HCC-3D), achieving high compression ratios while improving performance for Vision-Language Models (VLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the computational limitations of current 3D Vision-Language Models caused by processing all 3D tokens, enabling better efficiency without losing essential information.

Method: Proposes Hierarchical Compensatory Compression (HCC-3D), which includes global structure compression (GSC) and adaptive detail mining (ADM) modules to maintain critical information while reducing computational cost.

Result: Demonstrates a 98% compression ratio compared to previous models and achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving efficiency and accuracy in 3D understanding.

Conclusion: HCC-3D significantly reduces computational overhead while preserving key information, advancing practical applications of 3D-VLMs with enhanced performance and efficiency.

Abstract: 3D understanding has drawn significant attention recently, leveraging Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to enable multi-modal reasoning between point cloud and text data. Current 3D-VLMs directly embed the 3D point clouds into 3D tokens, following large 2D-VLMs with powerful reasoning capabilities. However, this framework has a great computational cost limiting its application, where we identify that the bottleneck lies in processing all 3D tokens in the Large Language Model (LLM) part. This raises the question: how can we reduce the computational overhead introduced by 3D tokens while preserving the integrity of their essential information? To address this question, we introduce Hierarchical Compensatory Compression (HCC-3D) to efficiently compress 3D tokens while maintaining critical detail retention. Specifically, we first propose a global structure compression (GSC), in which we design global queries to compress all 3D tokens into a few key tokens while keeping overall structural information. Then, to compensate for the information loss in GSC, we further propose an adaptive detail mining (ADM) module that selectively recompresses salient but under-attended features through complementary scoring. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HCC-3D not only achieves extreme compression ratios (approximately 98%) compared to previous 3D-VLMs, but also achieves new state-of-the-art performance, showing the great improvements on both efficiency and performance.

*Wei Li,Renshan Zhang,Rui Shao,Zhijian Fang,Kaiwen Zhou,Zhuotao Tian,Liqiang Nie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents SemanticVLA, a new framework for robotic manipulation using vision-language-action models, which addresses perceptual redundancy and instruction-vision alignment issues, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation lies in addressing limitations of traditional VLA models in robotic manipulation, specifically inefficiencies from processing irrelevant visual inputs and weak semantic grounding of actions.

Method: The SemanticVLA framework includes three core techniques: 1) Semantic-guided Dual Visual Pruner (SD-Pruner) to sparsify redundant perception while preserving semantic relevance; 2) Semantic-complementary Hierarchical Fuser (SH-Fuser) to fuse features for coherent semantic and spatial representation; 3) Semantic-conditioned Action Coupler (SA-Coupler) for enhanced and interpretable action transformation.

Result: SemanticVLA achieves a 21.1% higher success rate than OpenVLA on the LIBERO benchmark, while reducing training costs by 3-fold and inference latency by 2.7-fold in experiments on simulation and real-world tasks.

Conclusion: SemanticVLA establishes a new state of the art in both effectiveness and efficiency in robotic manipulation and is publicly accessible for use.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have advanced in robotic manipulation, yet practical deployment remains hindered by two key limitations: 1) perceptual redundancy, where irrelevant visual inputs are processed inefficiently, and 2) superficial instruction-vision alignment, which hampers semantic grounding of actions. In this paper, we propose SemanticVLA, a novel VLA framework that performs Semantic-Aligned Sparsification and Enhancement for Efficient Robotic Manipulation. Specifically: 1) To sparsify redundant perception while preserving semantic alignment, Semantic-guided Dual Visual Pruner (SD-Pruner) performs: Instruction-driven Pruner (ID-Pruner) extracts global action cues and local semantic anchors in SigLIP; Spatial-aggregation Pruner (SA-Pruner) compacts geometry-rich features into task-adaptive tokens in DINOv2. 2) To exploit sparsified features and integrate semantics with spatial geometry, Semantic-complementary Hierarchical Fuser (SH-Fuser) fuses dense patches and sparse tokens across SigLIP and DINOv2 for coherent representation. 3) To enhance the transformation from perception to action, Semantic-conditioned Action Coupler (SA-Coupler) replaces the conventional observation-to-DoF approach, yielding more efficient and interpretable behavior modeling for manipulation tasks. Extensive experiments on simulation and real-world tasks show that SemanticVLA sets a new SOTA in both performance and efficiency. SemanticVLA surpasses OpenVLA on LIBERO benchmark by 21.1% in success rate, while reducing training cost and inference latency by 3.0-fold and 2.7-fold.SemanticVLA is open-sourced and publicly available at https://github.com/JiuTian-VL/SemanticVLA

*Jinfu Li,Yuqi Huang,Hong Song,Ting Wang,Jianghan Xia,Yucong Lin,Jingfan Fan,Jian Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introducing SARL and SAL methods to improve tiny object detection in aerial images, achieving enhanced accuracy and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern object detectors struggle with tiny object detection in aerial images due to degraded features from long-distance propagation and biased regression penalties.

Method: SARL uses cross-scale spatial-channel attention for feature enrichment and cross-layer sharing, while SAL reshapes IoU-based losses to prioritize training for tiny objects.

Result: The proposed methods improve Average Precision by 5.5% on benchmarks and achieve 29.0% AP on a noisy real-world dataset.

Conclusion: SARL and SAL significantly boost tiny object detection accuracy and generalization, fitting top-performing frameworks effectively.

Abstract: Recently, despite the remarkable advancements in object detection, modern detectors still struggle to detect tiny objects in aerial images. One key reason is that tiny objects carry limited features that are inevitably degraded or lost during long-distance network propagation. Another is that smaller objects receive disproportionately greater regression penalties than larger ones during training. To tackle these issues, we propose a Scale-Aware Relay Layer (SARL) and a Scale-Adaptive Loss (SAL) for tiny object detection, both of which are seamlessly compatible with the top-performing frameworks. Specifically, SARL employs a cross-scale spatial-channel attention to progressively enrich the meaningful features of each layer and strengthen the cross-layer feature sharing. SAL reshapes the vanilla IoU-based losses so as to dynamically assign lower weights to larger objects. This loss is able to focus training on tiny objects while reducing the influence on large objects. Extensive experiments are conducted on three benchmarks (\textit{i.e.,} AI-TOD, DOTA-v2.0 and VisDrone2019), and the results demonstrate that the proposed method boosts the generalization ability by 5.5\% Average Precision (AP) when embedded in YOLOv5 (anchor-based) and YOLOx (anchor-free) baselines. Moreover, it also promotes the robust performance with 29.0\% AP on the real-world noisy dataset (\textit{i.e.,} AI-TOD-v2.0).

Motivation: Medical image captioning simplifies and supports radiological diagnostics by generating textual descriptions, aiming to integrate into workflows for improved efficiency and safety.

Method: The proposed Swin-BART encoder-decoder integrates a lightweight regional attention module to enhance diagnostically important regions, trained on the ROCO dataset, and employs beam search decoding strategies.

Result: The system outperforms baselines in ROUGE (0.603 vs. 0.356/0.255) and BERTScore (0.807 vs. 0.623/0.645), with competitive scores in BLEU, CIDEr, and METEOR, while providing visibility into regional contributions and modality-specific analysis.

Conclusion: The model delivers precise, interpretable captions suitable for clinical settings with human oversight, ensuring safety and enhancing usability.

Abstract: Automated medical image captioning translates complex radiological images into diagnostic narratives that can support reporting workflows. We present a Swin-BART encoder-decoder system with a lightweight regional attention module that amplifies diagnostically salient regions before cross-attention. Trained and evaluated on ROCO, our model achieves state-of-the-art semantic fidelity while remaining compact and interpretable. We report results as mean$\pm$std over three seeds and include $95\%$ confidence intervals. Compared with baselines, our approach improves ROUGE (proposed 0.603, ResNet-CNN 0.356, BLIP2-OPT 0.255) and BERTScore (proposed 0.807, BLIP2-OPT 0.645, ResNet-CNN 0.623), with competitive BLEU, CIDEr, and METEOR. We further provide ablations (regional attention on/off and token-count sweep), per-modality analysis (CT/MRI/X-ray), paired significance tests, and qualitative heatmaps that visualize the regions driving each description. Decoding uses beam search (beam size $=4$), length penalty $=1.1$, $no\_repeat\_ngram\_size$ $=3$, and max length $=128$. The proposed design yields accurate, clinically phrased captions and transparent regional attributions, supporting safe research use with a human in the loop.

*Zihao Zhang,Yang Li,Aming Wu,Yahong Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses Single-Domain Generalized Object Detection by proposing a novel method called Liquid Temporal Feature Evolution to improve a model's robustness against continuous domain shifts, driven by dynamic conditions like weather and lighting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations of existing Single-DGOD methods, which fail to account for continuous, gradual domain shifts experienced in real-world scenarios. These limitations reduce model efficacy in adapting to dynamic and fine-grained cross-domain variations.

Method: The proposed approach, Liquid Temporal Feature Evolution, involves controllable Gaussian noise injection and multi-scale Gaussian blurring to simulate feature perturbations. It incorporates temporal modeling and liquid neural network-driven parameter adjustments to create smooth and adaptive progression across domains.

Result: The paper reports significant performance improvements on the Diverse Weather dataset and Real-to-Art benchmark, demonstrating the method's enhanced generalization and robustness to unseen domain shifts.

Conclusion: By simulating progressive feature evolution and dynamically bridging distribution gaps, the method provides an effective solution for Single-DGOD, outperforming existing models while sustaining adaptability to dynamic real-world conditions.

Abstract: In this paper, we focus on Single-Domain Generalized Object Detection (Single-DGOD), aiming to transfer a detector trained on one source domain to multiple unknown domains. Existing methods for Single-DGOD typically rely on discrete data augmentation or static perturbation methods to expand data diversity, thereby mitigating the lack of access to target domain data. However, in real-world scenarios such as changes in weather or lighting conditions, domain shifts often occur continuously and gradually. Discrete augmentations and static perturbations fail to effectively capture the dynamic variation of feature distributions, thereby limiting the model's ability to perceive fine-grained cross-domain differences. To this end, we propose a new method, Liquid Temporal Feature Evolution, which simulates the progressive evolution of features from the source domain to simulated latent distributions by incorporating temporal modeling and liquid neural network-driven parameter adjustment. Specifically, we introduce controllable Gaussian noise injection and multi-scale Gaussian blurring to simulate initial feature perturbations, followed by temporal modeling and a liquid parameter adjustment mechanism to generate adaptive modulation parameters, enabling a smooth and continuous adaptation across domains. By capturing progressive cross-domain feature evolution and dynamically regulating adaptation paths, our method bridges the source-unknown domain distribution gap, significantly boosting generalization and robustness to unseen shifts. Significant performance improvements on the Diverse Weather dataset and Real-to-Art benchmark demonstrate the superiority of our method. Our code is available at https://github.com/2490o/LTFE.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for Vision-Language Models are English-focused, simplistic, and limited in scope, failing to evaluate model performance on complex and realistic document layouts with dense text.

Method: The authors propose DocWeaver, a multi-agent pipeline using Large Language Models to create MosaicDoc, a bilingual benchmark with data from newspapers and magazines, featuring complex layouts, stylistic variety, and multi-task annotations.

Result: MosaicDoc includes 72K images, over 600K QA pairs, and diverse annotations. State-of-the-art models were evaluated on this dataset, revealing significant challenges in addressing real-world document complexity.

Conclusion: MosaicDoc demonstrates that current Vision-Language Models struggle with Visually Rich Document Understanding, establishing it as a definitive benchmark and providing insights for advancing VRDU research.

Abstract: Despite the rapid progress of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), their capabilities are inadequately assessed by existing benchmarks, which are predominantly English-centric, feature simplistic layouts, and support limited tasks. Consequently, they fail to evaluate model performance for Visually Rich Document Understanding (VRDU), a critical challenge involving complex layouts and dense text. To address this, we introduce DocWeaver, a novel multi-agent pipeline that leverages Large Language Models to automatically generate a new benchmark. The result is MosaicDoc, a large-scale, bilingual (Chinese and English) resource designed to push the boundaries of VRDU. Sourced from newspapers and magazines, MosaicDoc features diverse and complex layouts (including multi-column and non-Manhattan), rich stylistic variety from 196 publishers, and comprehensive multi-task annotations (OCR, VQA, reading order, and localization). With 72K images and over 600K QA pairs, MosaicDoc serves as a definitive benchmark for the field. Our extensive evaluation of state-of-the-art models on this benchmark reveals their current limitations in handling real-world document complexity and charts a clear path for future research.

### [157] [Compensating Distribution Drifts in Class-incremental Learning of Pre-trained Vision Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09926)
*Xuan Rao,Simian Xu,Zheng Li,Bo Zhao,Derong Liu,Mingming Ha,Cesare Alippi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses distribution drift in class-incremental learning for vision transformers by introducing a latent space transition operator and proposing Sequential Learning with Drift Compensation (SLDC).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To mitigate the degradation of classifier performance caused by distribution drift in sequential fine-tuning of vision transformers.

Method: SLDC is proposed with two variants (linear and weakly nonlinear) to align feature distributions across tasks. Knowledge distillation is applied to further reduce representation drift.

Result: SLDC demonstrates improved performance of sequential fine-tuning approaches and achieves results comparable to joint training across benchmarks.

Conclusion: By addressing distribution drift and representation drift effectively, SLDC enhances class-incremental learning and provides significant advancements in classifier performance.

Abstract: Recent advances have shown that sequential fine-tuning (SeqFT) of pre-trained vision transformers (ViTs), followed by classifier refinement using approximate distributions of class features, can be an effective strategy for class-incremental learning (CIL). However, this approach is susceptible to distribution drift, caused by the sequential optimization of shared backbone parameters. This results in a mismatch between the distributions of the previously learned classes and that of the updater model, ultimately degrading the effectiveness of classifier performance over time. To address this issue, we introduce a latent space transition operator and propose Sequential Learning with Drift Compensation (SLDC). SLDC aims to align feature distributions across tasks to mitigate the impact of drift. First, we present a linear variant of SLDC, which learns a linear operator by solving a regularized least-squares problem that maps features before and after fine-tuning. Next, we extend this with a weakly nonlinear SLDC variant, which assumes that the ideal transition operator lies between purely linear and fully nonlinear transformations. This is implemented using learnable, weakly nonlinear mappings that balance flexibility and generalization. To further reduce representation drift, we apply knowledge distillation (KD) in both algorithmic variants. Extensive experiments on standard CIL benchmarks demonstrate that SLDC significantly improves the performance of SeqFT. Notably, by combining KD to address representation drift with SLDC to compensate distribution drift, SeqFT achieves performance comparable to joint training across all evaluated datasets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses vulnerabilities of person re-identification (ReID) models to adversarial attacks and proposes a debiased dual-invariant framework for robust defenses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation lies in the need to secure advanced ReID models against adversarial attacks, which pose risks due to incorrect predictions.

Method: The paper introduces a two-phase defense: data balancing using diffusion model resampling to reduce bias, and a bi-adversarial self-meta defense incorporating metric adversarial training and enhanced self-meta mechanisms for robustness.

Result: Experiments show significant improvement in adversarial robustness, outperforming existing defense methods.

Conclusion: This study proposes an effective defense framework addressing security threats in adversarially robust metric learning tasks like person ReID.

Abstract: Person re-identification (ReID) is a fundamental task in many real-world applications such as pedestrian trajectory tracking. However, advanced deep learning-based ReID models are highly susceptible to adversarial attacks, where imperceptible perturbations to pedestrian images can cause entirely incorrect predictions, posing significant security threats. Although numerous adversarial defense strategies have been proposed for classification tasks, their extension to metric learning tasks such as person ReID remains relatively unexplored. Moreover, the several existing defenses for person ReID fail to address the inherent unique challenges of adversarially robust ReID. In this paper, we systematically identify the challenges of adversarial defense in person ReID into two key issues: model bias and composite generalization requirements. To address them, we propose a debiased dual-invariant defense framework composed of two main phases. In the data balancing phase, we mitigate model bias using a diffusion-model-based data resampling strategy that promotes fairness and diversity in training data. In the bi-adversarial self-meta defense phase, we introduce a novel metric adversarial training approach incorporating farthest negative extension softening to overcome the robustness degradation caused by the absence of classifier. Additionally, we introduce an adversarially-enhanced self-meta mechanism to achieve dual-generalization for both unseen identities and unseen attack types. Experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art defenses.

Motivation: To address the computational inefficiencies in graph construction for Vision GNNs and improve their overall performance.

Method: Proposes a novel Adaptive Graph Convolution mechanism, incorporating a static axial scaffold and Exponential Decay Gating for selective long-range connection weighting. It uses a hybrid strategy combining efficient gating for early stages and Global Attention in the final stage.

Result: AdaptViG-M achieves state-of-the-art performance among Vision GNNs, with 82.6% accuracy and significantly reduced parameters and GMACs compared to ViG-B. Outperforms EfficientFormer-L7 on downstream tasks by notable margins, using far fewer resources.

Conclusion: AdaptViG represents a step forward in Vision GNN efficiency, offering powerful performance with reduced computational demands, making it applicable across diverse tasks with limited resources.

Abstract: Vision Graph Neural Networks (ViGs) offer a new direction for advancements in vision architectures. While powerful, ViGs often face substantial computational challenges stemming from their graph construction phase, which can hinder their efficiency. To address this issue we propose AdaptViG, an efficient and powerful hybrid Vision GNN that introduces a novel graph construction mechanism called Adaptive Graph Convolution. This mechanism builds upon a highly efficient static axial scaffold and a dynamic, content-aware gating strategy called Exponential Decay Gating. This gating mechanism selectively weighs long-range connections based on feature similarity. Furthermore, AdaptViG employs a hybrid strategy, utilizing our efficient gating mechanism in the early stages and a full Global Attention block in the final stage for maximum feature aggregation. Our method achieves a new state-of-the-art trade-off between accuracy and efficiency among Vision GNNs. For instance, our AdaptViG-M achieves 82.6% top-1 accuracy, outperforming ViG-B by 0.3% while using 80% fewer parameters and 84% fewer GMACs. On downstream tasks, AdaptViG-M obtains 45.8 mIoU, 44.8 APbox, and 41.1 APmask, surpassing the much larger EfficientFormer-L7 by 0.7 mIoU, 2.2 APbox, and 2.1 APmask, respectively, with 78% fewer parameters.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes TSPE-GS, a method to enhance 3D Gaussian Splatting for reconstructing semi-transparent surfaces by addressing depth ambiguity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D Gaussian Splatting methods struggle with semi-transparent surface reconstruction because they assume a single depth per pixel, which is inadequate for multi-visible surfaces.

Method: The paper introduces TSPE-GS, which samples transmittance for modeling pixel-wise multi-modal distributions of opacity and depth, and progressively fuses truncated signed distance functions to separate external and internal surfaces.

Result: Extensive experiments show that TSPE-GS significantly improves semi-transparent geometry reconstruction while maintaining opaque scene performance.

Conclusion: TSPE-GS effectively overcomes the limitations of depth ambiguity in semi-transparent surface reconstruction and generalizes to existing Gaussian-based reconstruction pipelines without extra training.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting offers a strong speed-quality trade-off but struggles to reconstruct semi-transparent surfaces because most methods assume a single depth per pixel, which fails when multiple surfaces are visible. We propose TSPE-GS (Transparent Surface Probabilistic Extraction for Gaussian Splatting), which uniformly samples transmittance to model a pixel-wise multi-modal distribution of opacity and depth, replacing the prior single-peak assumption and resolving cross-surface depth ambiguity. By progressively fusing truncated signed distance functions, TSPE-GS reconstructs external and internal surfaces separately within a unified framework. The method generalizes to other Gaussian-based reconstruction pipelines without extra training overhead. Extensive experiments on public and self-collected semi-transparent and opaque datasets show TSPE-GS significantly improves semi-transparent geometry reconstruction while maintaining performance on opaque scenes.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes an improved image quality assessment (IQA) framework by combining standard cosine similarity with a new magnitude-aware approach for analyzing CLIP embeddings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of using only semantic similarity in CLIP-based no-reference IQA by exploring the underutilized magnitude of CLIP image features.

Method: The paper introduces an adaptive fusion framework that incorporates a magnitude-aware quality cue (via Box-Cox transformation) into the similarity calculation and uses confidence-guided fusion to balance the contributions of each cue.

Result: The proposed method achieves superior performance compared to standard CLIP-based IQA and state-of-the-art methods across multiple IQA datasets without requiring additional training.

Conclusion: Incorporating a magnitude-aware quality metric and an adaptive fusion approach significantly enhances the performance of CLIP-based IQA frameworks.

Abstract: Recent efforts have repurposed the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) model for No-Reference Image Quality Assessment (NR-IQA) by measuring the cosine similarity between the image embedding and textual prompts such as "a good photo" or "a bad photo." However, this semantic similarity overlooks a critical yet underexplored cue: the magnitude of the CLIP image features, which we empirically find to exhibit a strong correlation with perceptual quality. In this work, we introduce a novel adaptive fusion framework that complements cosine similarity with a magnitude-aware quality cue. Specifically, we first extract the absolute CLIP image features and apply a Box-Cox transformation to statistically normalize the feature distribution and mitigate semantic sensitivity. The resulting scalar summary serves as a semantically-normalized auxiliary cue that complements cosine-based prompt matching. To integrate both cues effectively, we further design a confidence-guided fusion scheme that adaptively weighs each term according to its relative strength. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark IQA datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms standard CLIP-based IQA and state-of-the-art baselines, without any task-specific training.

TL;DR: This paper presents a pipeline that uses vision-language models to generate pseudo-labels for training real-time object detectors, improving performance for autonomous driving while reducing reliance on manual annotation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual labeling for autonomous driving datasets is costly and time-consuming, prompting a need for automated solutions to train object detection models.

Method: The proposed approach uses vision-language models for pseudo-label generation, with a per-object co-teaching strategy employing two YOLO models to collaboratively filter out noisy bounding boxes based on loss values.

Result: The method achieves significant mAP@0.5 improvements on KITTI dataset ($31.12\%$ to $46.61\%$), with further boosts ($57.97\%$ mAP@0.5) by adding $10\%$ human-labeled data, alongside similar improvements on ACDC and BDD100k datasets.

Conclusion: The pipeline effectively trains high-performance, real-time object detectors with reduced reliance on manual labeling, demonstrating scalability and robust results across diverse datasets.

Abstract: Foundation models, especially vision-language models (VLMs), offer compelling zero-shot object detection for applications like autonomous driving, a domain where manual labelling is prohibitively expensive. However, their detection latency and tendency to hallucinate predictions render them unsuitable for direct deployment. This work introduces a novel pipeline that addresses this challenge by leveraging VLMs to automatically generate pseudo-labels for training efficient, real-time object detectors. Our key innovation is a per-object co-teaching-based training strategy that mitigates the inherent noise in VLM-generated labels. The proposed per-object coteaching approach filters noisy bounding boxes from training instead of filtering the entire image. Specifically, two YOLO models learn collaboratively, filtering out unreliable boxes from each mini-batch based on their peers' per-object loss values. Overall, our pipeline provides an efficient, robust, and scalable approach to train high-performance object detectors for autonomous driving, significantly reducing reliance on costly human annotation. Experimental results on the KITTI dataset demonstrate that our method outperforms a baseline YOLOv5m model, achieving a significant mAP@0.5 boost ($31.12\%$ to $46.61\%$) while maintaining real-time detection latency. Furthermore, we show that supplementing our pseudo-labelled data with a small fraction of ground truth labels ($10\%$) leads to further performance gains, reaching $57.97\%$ mAP@0.5 on the KITTI dataset. We observe similar performance improvements for the ACDC and BDD100k datasets.

Abstract: Recent advances in generative models, especially diffusion models, have significantly improved image restoration (IR) performance. However, existing problem-agnostic diffusion model-based image restoration (DMIR) methods face challenges in fully leveraging diffusion priors, resulting in suboptimal performance. In this paper, we address the limitations of current problem-agnostic DMIR methods by analyzing their sampling process and providing effective solutions. We introduce EquS, a DMIR method that imposes equivariant information through dual sampling trajectories. To further boost EquS, we propose the Timestep-Aware Schedule (TAS) and introduce EquS$^+$.

TL;DR: This paper introduces DiVE, a method to fine-tune vision-language models like CLIP without compromising their generalization abilities in zero-shot and out-of-distribution contexts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the challenge of fine-tuning pre-trained vision-language models (e.g., CLIP) on in-distribution data while preserving their strong generalization capabilities in out-of-distribution and zero-shot settings.

Method: The proposed method, Difference Vector Equalization (DiVE), preserves the geometric structure of embeddings during fine-tuning by constraining the difference vectors between pre-trained and fine-tuned embeddings. Two novel losses, average vector loss (AVL) and pairwise vector loss (PVL), are introduced to globally and locally maintain this preservation.

Result: Through experiments, DiVE demonstrated superior performance by maintaining the geometric structure of embeddings and achieving strong results across in-distribution, out-of-distribution, and zero-shot evaluation metrics.

Conclusion: DiVE successfully addresses the trade-off between fine-tuning performance and generalization by preserving embedding geometric structure, making it an effective approach for robust vision-language model fine-tuning.

Abstract: Contrastive pre-trained vision-language models, such as CLIP, demonstrate strong generalization abilities in zero-shot classification by leveraging embeddings extracted from image and text encoders. This paper aims to robustly fine-tune these vision-language models on in-distribution (ID) data without compromising their generalization abilities in out-of-distribution (OOD) and zero-shot settings. Current robust fine-tuning methods tackle this challenge by reusing contrastive learning, which was used in pre-training, for fine-tuning. However, we found that these methods distort the geometric structure of the embeddings, which plays a crucial role in the generalization of vision-language models, resulting in limited OOD and zero-shot performance. To address this, we propose Difference Vector Equalization (DiVE), which preserves the geometric structure during fine-tuning. The idea behind DiVE is to constrain difference vectors, each of which is obtained by subtracting the embeddings extracted from the pre-trained and fine-tuning models for the same data sample. By constraining the difference vectors to be equal across various data samples, we effectively preserve the geometric structure. Therefore, we introduce two losses: average vector loss (AVL) and pairwise vector loss (PVL). AVL preserves the geometric structure globally by constraining difference vectors to be equal to their weighted average. PVL preserves the geometric structure locally by ensuring a consistent multimodal alignment. Our experiments demonstrate that DiVE effectively preserves the geometric structure, achieving strong results across ID, OOD, and zero-shot metrics.

*Yongdeuk Seo,Hyun-seok Min,Sungchul Choi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces STELLAR, a framework for Scene Text Editing (STE) that emphasizes support for low-resource languages and real-world data. It also proposes a new dataset (STIPLAR) and evaluation metric (TAS) to enhance performance and assessment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address limitations in STE tasks, including lack of support for low-resource languages, domain gaps between synthetic and real data, and the absence of appropriate metrics for text style preservation.

Method: The paper proposes STELLAR, which uses a language-adaptive glyph encoder, a multi-stage training strategy (pre-training on synthetic and fine-tuning on real data), and introduces a new dataset (STIPLAR) and a metric (TAS) for style preservation.

Result: STELLAR outperforms existing models by achieving better visual consistency and recognition accuracy, improving the TAS metric by an average of 2.2% across various languages.

Conclusion: STELLAR successfully addresses the key limitations in STE tasks, providing a robust framework for multilingual text editing, better evaluation metrics, and improved real-world adaptation.

Abstract: Scene Text Editing (STE) is the task of modifying text content in an image while preserving its visual style, such as font, color, and background. While recent diffusion-based approaches have shown improvements in visual quality, key limitations remain: lack of support for low-resource languages, domain gap between synthetic and real data, and the absence of appropriate metrics for evaluating text style preservation. To address these challenges, we propose STELLAR (Scene Text Editor for Low-resource LAnguages and Real-world data). STELLAR enables reliable multilingual editing through a language-adaptive glyph encoder and a multi-stage training strategy that first pre-trains on synthetic data and then fine-tunes on real images. We also construct a new dataset, STIPLAR(Scene Text Image Pairs of Low-resource lAnguages and Real-world data), for training and evaluation. Furthermore, we propose Text Appearance Similarity (TAS), a novel metric that assesses style preservation by independently measuring font, color, and background similarity, enabling robust evaluation even without ground truth. Experimental results demonstrate that STELLAR outperforms state-of-the-art models in visual consistency and recognition accuracy, achieving an average TAS improvement of 2.2% across languages over the baselines.

### [166] [MOBA: A Material-Oriented Backdoor Attack against LiDAR-based 3D Object Detection Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09999)
*Saket S. Chaturvedi,Gaurav Bagwe,Lan Zhang,Pan He,Xiaoyong Yuan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Material-Oriented Backdoor Attack (MOBA), a framework addressing the gap between digital and physical domains for LiDAR-based 3D object detection systems by modeling material properties for physical backdoor attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing backdoor attacks on LiDAR-based 3D object detection systems lack physical realizability due to the digital-to-physical domain gap, meaning digital triggers fail in real-world tests and physical triggers are ineffective or detectable.

Method: The authors propose MOBA, which focuses on 1) selecting robust materials like titanium dioxide for physical attack triggers, and 2) developing a simulation pipeline using an angle-independent BRDF model and depth-aware scaling to replicate physical trigger behavior digitally.

Result: MOBA achieves a 93.50% attack success rate in experiments, outperforming previous methods by over 41%, proving the effectiveness of the proposed material-oriented approach.

Conclusion: MOBA uncovers a new, practical threat in real-world settings and highlights the necessity for defenses that consider material-level properties.

Abstract: LiDAR-based 3D object detection is widely used in safety-critical systems. However, these systems remain vulnerable to backdoor attacks that embed hidden malicious behaviors during training. A key limitation of existing backdoor attacks is their lack of physical realizability, primarily due to the digital-to-physical domain gap. Digital triggers often fail in real-world settings because they overlook material-dependent LiDAR reflection properties. On the other hand, physically constructed triggers are often unoptimized, leading to low effectiveness or easy detectability.This paper introduces Material-Oriented Backdoor Attack (MOBA), a novel framework that bridges the digital-physical gap by explicitly modeling the material properties of real-world triggers. MOBA tackles two key challenges in physical backdoor design: 1) robustness of the trigger material under diverse environmental conditions, 2) alignment between the physical trigger's behavior and its digital simulation. First, we propose a systematic approach to selecting robust trigger materials, identifying titanium dioxide (TiO_2) for its high diffuse reflectivity and environmental resilience. Second, to ensure the digital trigger accurately mimics the physical behavior of the material-based trigger, we develop a novel simulation pipeline that features: (1) an angle-independent approximation of the Oren-Nayar BRDF model to generate realistic LiDAR intensities, and (2) a distance-aware scaling mechanism to maintain spatial consistency across varying depths. We conduct extensive experiments on state-of-the-art LiDAR-based and Camera-LiDAR fusion models, showing that MOBA achieves a 93.50% attack success rate, outperforming prior methods by over 41%. Our work reveals a new class of physically realizable threats and underscores the urgent need for defenses that account for material-level properties in real-world environments.

*Xuexun Liu,Xiaoxu Xu,Qiudan Zhang,Lin Ma,Xu Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces DBGroup, a novel weakly supervised 3D instance segmentation framework using scene-level annotations to overcome challenges with labeling costs and complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Given the high cost and reliance on expert annotators for fully-supervised and existing weakly-supervised 3D instance segmentation approaches, this paper seeks a scalable alternative using scene-level annotations.

Method: The proposed method, DBGroup, is a two-stage framework. Stage 1 uses a Dual-Branch Point Grouping module and refinement strategies to generate pseudo-labels. Stage 2 employs multi-round self-training on a segmentation network, with an Instance Mask Filter addressing pseudo label inconsistencies.

Result: DBGroup achieves competitive performance compared to sparse-point-level supervised methods and surpasses state-of-the-art scene-level supervised methods in 3D semantic segmentation.

Conclusion: DBGroup provides a scalable and efficient framework for weakly supervised 3D instance segmentation, reducing annotation efforts while maintaining strong segmentation accuracy.

Abstract: Weakly supervised 3D instance segmentation is essential for 3D scene understanding, especially as the growing scale of data and high annotation costs associated with fully supervised approaches. Existing methods primarily rely on two forms of weak supervision: one-thing-one-click annotations and bounding box annotations, both of which aim to reduce labeling efforts. However, these approaches still encounter limitations, including labor-intensive annotation processes, high complexity, and reliance on expert annotators. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{DBGroup}, a two-stage weakly supervised 3D instance segmentation framework that leverages scene-level annotations as a more efficient and scalable alternative. In the first stage, we introduce a Dual-Branch Point Grouping module to generate pseudo labels guided by semantic and mask cues extracted from multi-view images. To further improve label quality, we develop two refinement strategies: Granularity-Aware Instance Merging and Semantic Selection and Propagation. The second stage involves multi-round self-training on an end-to-end instance segmentation network using the refined pseudo-labels. Additionally, we introduce an Instance Mask Filter strategy to address inconsistencies within the pseudo labels. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DBGroup achieves competitive performance compared to sparse-point-level supervised 3D instance segmentation methods, while surpassing state-of-the-art scene-level supervised 3D semantic segmentation approaches.

### [168] [LampQ: Towards Accurate Layer-wise Mixed Precision Quantization for Vision Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10004)
*Minjun Kim,Jaeri Lee,Jongjin Kim,Jeongin Yun,Yongmo Kwon,U Kang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces LampQ, a method for effectively quantizing Vision Transformers using layer-wise mixed precision techniques to maximize performance while minimizing accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantization algorithms help compress Vision Transformers into low-bit formats, reducing computational requirements efficiently. However, current methods fail to address the sensitivity diversity of ViT components, leading to suboptimal results.

Method: LampQ employs layer-wise quantization with a type-aware Fisher-based metric to measure sensitivity. It uses integer linear programming for optimal bit-width allocation, followed by iterative updates for improved performance.

Result: LampQ achieves state-of-the-art performance in quantizing ViTs for tasks including image classification, object detection, and zero-shot quantization.

Conclusion: LampQ overcomes limitations of previous methods, creating an effective framework for sensitivity-aware ViT quantization that improves compression without compromising accuracy.

Abstract: How can we accurately quantize a pre-trained Vision Transformer model? Quantization algorithms compress Vision Transformers (ViTs) into low-bit formats, reducing memory and computation demands with minimal accuracy degradation. However, existing methods rely on uniform precision, ignoring the diverse sensitivity of ViT components to quantization. Metric-based Mixed Precision Quantization (MPQ) is a promising alternative, but previous MPQ methods for ViTs suffer from three major limitations: 1) coarse granularity, 2) mismatch in metric scale across component types, and 3) quantization-unaware bit allocation. In this paper, we propose LampQ (Layer-wise Mixed Precision Quantization for Vision Transformers), an accurate metric-based MPQ method for ViTs to overcome these limitations. LampQ performs layer-wise quantization to achieve both fine-grained control and efficient acceleration, incorporating a type-aware Fisher-based metric to measure sensitivity. Then, LampQ assigns bit-widths optimally through integer linear programming and further updates them iteratively. Extensive experiments show that LampQ provides the state-of-the-art performance in quantizing ViTs pre-trained on various tasks such as image classification, object detection, and zero-shot quantization.

TL;DR: MIRNet is an advanced framework combining self-supervised learning and graph-based reasoning for medical image interpretation, validated on a new tongue image dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automating medical image interpretation requires overcoming challenges like annotation scarcity, label imbalance, and clinical plausibility, especially in visually and semantically complex domains like tongue diagnosis.

Method: MIRNet integrates self-supervised learning via masked autoencoders, graph attention networks to model label correlations, constraint-aware optimization, asymmetric loss, and ensemble boosting to address specific challenges. A new benchmark dataset (TongueAtlas-4K) supports this approach.

Result: MIRNet achieves state-of-the-art performance in tongue image diagnosis and demonstrates robust generalization to other medical diagnosis tasks.

Conclusion: MIRNet presents a promising and transferable solution for medical image interpretation, specifically excelling in tongue diagnosis and broader applicability in diagnostic imaging.

Abstract: Automated interpretation of medical images demands robust modeling of complex visual-semantic relationships while addressing annotation scarcity, label imbalance, and clinical plausibility constraints. We introduce MIRNet (Medical Image Reasoner Network), a novel framework that integrates self-supervised pre-training with constrained graph-based reasoning. Tongue image diagnosis is a particularly challenging domain that requires fine-grained visual and semantic understanding. Our approach leverages self-supervised masked autoencoder (MAE) to learn transferable visual representations from unlabeled data; employs graph attention networks (GAT) to model label correlations through expert-defined structured graphs; enforces clinical priors via constraint-aware optimization using KL divergence and regularization losses; and mitigates imbalance using asymmetric loss (ASL) and boosting ensembles. To address annotation scarcity, we also introduce TongueAtlas-4K, a comprehensive expert-curated benchmark comprising 4,000 images annotated with 22 diagnostic labels--representing the largest public dataset in tongue analysis. Validation shows our method achieves state-of-the-art performance. While optimized for tongue diagnosis, the framework readily generalizes to broader diagnostic medical imaging tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a task called Fine-grained 3D Embodied Reasoning, requiring the prediction of spatial features for 3D scene affordance. It proposes AffordBot, a Multimodal LLM framework incorporating chain-of-thought reasoning, which achieves state-of-the-art results on the SceneFun3D dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches struggle with fine-grained affordance reasoning in physical environments and lack coherent, instruction-driven grounding.

Method: The authors propose AffordBot, integrating Multimodal LLMs with chain-of-thought reasoning, leveraging 3D-to-2D projections and an active perception stage for structured reasoning.

Result: AffordBot outperformed existing methods, achieving strong generalization in affordance reasoning, using the SceneFun3D dataset for evaluation.

Conclusion: AffordBot paves the way for effective human-agent collaboration in physical environments via structured and physically grounded affordance reasoning.

Abstract: Effective human-agent collaboration in physical environments requires understanding not only what to act upon, but also where the actionable elements are and how to interact with them. Existing approaches often operate at the object level or disjointedly handle fine-grained affordance reasoning, lacking coherent, instruction-driven grounding and reasoning. In this work, we introduce a new task: Fine-grained 3D Embodied Reasoning, which requires an agent to predict, for each referenced affordance element in a 3D scene, a structured triplet comprising its spatial location, motion type, and motion axis, based on a task instruction. To solve this task, we propose AffordBot, a novel framework that integrates Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) with a tailored chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning paradigm. To bridge the gap between 3D input and 2D-compatible MLLMs, we render surround-view images of the scene and project 3D element candidates into these views, forming a rich visual representation aligned with the scene geometry. Our CoT pipeline begins with an active perception stage, prompting the MLLM to select the most informative viewpoint based on the instruction, before proceeding with step-by-step reasoning to localize affordance elements and infer plausible interaction motions. Evaluated on the SceneFun3D dataset, AffordBot achieves state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating strong generalization and physically grounded reasoning with only 3D point cloud input and MLLMs.

TL;DR: Anomagic is a zero-shot anomaly generation method leveraging crossmodal prompt encoding, inpainting pipelines, and anomaly-mask-caption datasets to synthesize realistic anomalies without exemplars, enhancing detection tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of exemplar anomalies in generating realistic and semantically coherent anomalies for anomaly detection tasks.

Method: Uses a crossmodal prompt encoding scheme and inpainting-based generation pipeline with contrastive refinement strategy; introduces "AnomVerse," a dataset for training with anomaly-mask-caption triplets.

Result: The method produces realistic, varied anomalies, improves anomaly detection accuracy, and supports user-defined prompts for flexible anomaly generation.

Conclusion: Anomagic establishes a robust and versatile foundation model for anomaly generation, surpassing prior methods and advancing anomaly detection capabilities.

Abstract: We propose Anomagic, a zero-shot anomaly generation method that produces semantically coherent anomalies without requiring any exemplar anomalies. By unifying both visual and textual cues through a crossmodal prompt encoding scheme, Anomagic leverages rich contextual information to steer an inpainting-based generation pipeline. A subsequent contrastive refinement strategy enforces precise alignment between synthesized anomalies and their masks, thereby bolstering downstream anomaly detection accuracy. To facilitate training, we introduce AnomVerse, a collection of 12,987 anomaly-mask-caption triplets assembled from 13 publicly available datasets, where captions are automatically generated by multimodal large language models using structured visual prompts and template-based textual hints. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Anomagic trained on AnomVerse can synthesize more realistic and varied anomalies than prior methods, yielding superior improvements in downstream anomaly detection. Furthermore, Anomagic can generate anomalies for any normal-category image using user-defined prompts, establishing a versatile foundation model for anomaly generation.

TL;DR: The paper introduces DGFusion, a novel dual-guided framework for improved 3D object detection in autonomous driving, addressing challenges in detecting hard instances like distant or occluded objects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the performance of autonomous driving systems by addressing the limitations in detecting challenging objects, such as small, distant, or occluded objects, that compromise safety.

Method: The study proposes the DGFusion framework, which combines the Point-guide-Image and Image-guide-Point paradigms. It introduces the Difficulty-aware Instance Pair Matcher (DIPM) that identifies instance pairs based on difficulty, enabling dual-guided modules for effective multi-modal feature fusion.

Result: DGFusion achieves significant improvements over baseline methods, with +1.0% mAP, +0.8% NDS, and +1.3% average recall on the nuScenes dataset. It also improves robustness in detecting hard instances across various challenging scenarios.

Conclusion: The DGFusion framework effectively addresses the limitations of single-guided paradigms and enhances 3D object detection accuracy and robustness in challenging scenarios, improving overall safety for autonomous driving systems.

Abstract: As a critical task in autonomous driving perception systems, 3D object detection is used to identify and track key objects, such as vehicles and pedestrians. However, detecting distant, small, or occluded objects (hard instances) remains a challenge, which directly compromises the safety of autonomous driving systems. We observe that existing multi-modal 3D object detection methods often follow a single-guided paradigm, failing to account for the differences in information density of hard instances between modalities. In this work, we propose DGFusion, based on the Dual-guided paradigm, which fully inherits the advantages of the Point-guide-Image paradigm and integrates the Image-guide-Point paradigm to address the limitations of the single paradigms. The core of DGFusion, the Difficulty-aware Instance Pair Matcher (DIPM), performs instance-level feature matching based on difficulty to generate easy and hard instance pairs, while the Dual-guided Modules exploit the advantages of both pair types to enable effective multi-modal feature fusion. Experimental results demonstrate that our DGFusion outperforms the baseline methods, with respective improvements of +1.0\% mAP, +0.8\% NDS, and +1.3\% average recall on nuScenes. Extensive experiments demonstrate consistent robustness gains for hard instance detection across ego-distance, size, visibility, and small-scale training scenarios.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel 3D variational autoencoder (VAE) framework based on unsigned distance fields (UDFs) to handle complex and incomplete shapes efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-fidelity 3D content generation faces challenges in representing arbitrary topologies while maintaining geometric details, as existing methods struggle with preprocessing and non-manifold geometries.

Method: A local-to-global (LoG) architecture is utilized, partitioning the UDF into subvolumes (UBlocks), combining 3D convolutions for local detail, sparse transformers for global coherence, and a Pad-Average strategy for smooth transitions between subvolumes.

Result: The proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in reconstruction and generative quality, enabling ultra-high resolution scaling up to 2048³ and delivering superior surface smoothness and geometric flexibility.

Conclusion: The modular LoG framework provides robust and scalable solutions for generating high-quality 3D content, overcoming limitations of previous SDF and point-cloud-based methodologies.

Abstract: Generating high-fidelity 3D contents remains a fundamental challenge due to the complexity of representing arbitrary topologies-such as open surfaces and intricate internal structures-while preserving geometric details. Prevailing methods based on signed distance fields (SDFs) are hampered by costly watertight preprocessing and struggle with non-manifold geometries, while point-cloud representations often suffer from sampling artifacts and surface discontinuities. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel 3D variational autoencoder (VAE) framework built upon unsigned distance fields (UDFs)-a more robust and computationally efficient representation that naturally handles complex and incomplete shapes. Our core innovation is a local-to-global (LoG) architecture that processes the UDF by partitioning it into uniform subvolumes, termed UBlocks. This architecture couples 3D convolutions for capturing local detail with sparse transformers for enforcing global coherence. A Pad-Average strategy further ensures smooth transitions at subvolume boundaries during reconstruction. This modular design enables seamless scaling to ultra-high resolutions up to 2048^3-a regime previously unattainable for 3D VAEs. Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in both reconstruction accuracy and generative quality, yielding superior surface smoothness and geometric flexibility.

TL;DR: A new transformer-based method, FreDFT, is proposed for visible-infrared object detection, focusing on frequency domain feature fusion to correct multimodal information imbalance and improve detection accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Visible-infrared detection is effective in poor visibility conditions, but existing methods struggle with cross-modal information imbalance and lack effective utilization of frequency domain features.

Method: FreDFT uses multimodal frequency domain attention (MFDA) and frequency domain feed-forward layers (FDFFL) for better feature fusion and resolves multimodal imbalance with a cross-modal global modeling module (CGMM) and a local feature enhancement module (LFEM).

Result: FreDFT demonstrates superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods across various public datasets.

Conclusion: FreDFT is a robust solution for visible-infrared object detection, leveraging frequency domain strategies and ensuring balanced information integration between modalities.

Abstract: Visible-infrared object detection has gained sufficient attention due to its detection performance in low light, fog, and rain conditions. However, visible and infrared modalities captured by different sensors exist the information imbalance problem in complex scenarios, which can cause inadequate cross-modal fusion, resulting in degraded detection performance. \textcolor{red}{Furthermore, most existing methods use transformers in the spatial domain to capture complementary features, ignoring the advantages of developing frequency domain transformers to mine complementary information.} To solve these weaknesses, we propose a frequency domain fusion transformer, called FreDFT, for visible-infrared object detection. The proposed approach employs a novel multimodal frequency domain attention (MFDA) to mine complementary information between modalities and a frequency domain feed-forward layer (FDFFL) via a mixed-scale frequency feature fusion strategy is designed to better enhance multimodal features. To eliminate the imbalance of multimodal information, a cross-modal global modeling module (CGMM) is constructed to perform pixel-wise inter-modal feature interaction in a spatial and channel manner. Moreover, a local feature enhancement module (LFEM) is developed to strengthen multimodal local feature representation and promote multimodal feature fusion by using various convolution layers and applying a channel shuffle. Extensive experimental results have verified that our proposed FreDFT achieves excellent performance on multiple public datasets compared with other state-of-the-art methods.

*Xurui Li,Feng Xue,Yu Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MuSc-V2, a novel framework for zero-shot anomaly classification and segmentation using 2D and 3D modality fusion for robust defect identification and scoring. Achieves significant performance boosts on industrial datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current zero-shot AC/AS methods overlook the discriminative property of normal patches being similar across industrial products while anomalies remain isolated. This gap motivated the development of a method to explicitly utilize these differences.

Method: MuSc-V2 employs Iterative Point Grouping (IPG) for better 3D representation, Similarity Neighborhood Aggregation (SNAMD) for multi-scale patch feature fusion, and Mutual Scoring Mechanism (MSM) alongside Cross-modal Anomaly Enhancement (CAE) to refine scores. Also includes Re-scoring with Constrained Neighborhood (RsCon) to suppress false positives and integrate across modalities.

Result: MuSc-V2 improves anomaly detection performance, achieving +23.7% AP on the MVTec 3D-AD dataset and +19.3% AP on Eyecandies dataset, outperforming zero-shot and most few-shot methods.

Conclusion: MuSc-V2 offers a robust framework for zero-shot anomaly detection adaptable to diverse industrial datasets, significantly outperforming existing approaches and demonstrating effective multimodality integration and discriminative scoring.

Abstract: Zero-shot anomaly classification (AC) and segmentation (AS) methods aim to identify and outline defects without using any labeled samples. In this paper, we reveal a key property that is overlooked by existing methods: normal image patches across industrial products typically find many other similar patches, not only in 2D appearance but also in 3D shapes, while anomalies remain diverse and isolated. To explicitly leverage this discriminative property, we propose a Mutual Scoring framework (MuSc-V2) for zero-shot AC/AS, which flexibly supports single 2D/3D or multimodality. Specifically, our method begins by improving 3D representation through Iterative Point Grouping (IPG), which reduces false positives from discontinuous surfaces. Then we use Similarity Neighborhood Aggregation with Multi-Degrees (SNAMD) to fuse 2D/3D neighborhood cues into more discriminative multi-scale patch features for mutual scoring. The core comprises a Mutual Scoring Mechanism (MSM) that lets samples within each modality to assign score to each other, and Cross-modal Anomaly Enhancement (CAE) that fuses 2D and 3D scores to recover modality-specific missing anomalies. Finally, Re-scoring with Constrained Neighborhood (RsCon) suppresses false classification based on similarity to more representative samples. Our framework flexibly works on both the full dataset and smaller subsets with consistently robust performance, ensuring seamless adaptability across diverse product lines. In aid of the novel framework, MuSc-V2 achieves significant performance improvements: a $\textbf{+23.7\%}$ AP gain on the MVTec 3D-AD dataset and a $\textbf{+19.3\%}$ boost on the Eyecandies dataset, surpassing previous zero-shot benchmarks and even outperforming most few-shot methods.

*Zhiyuan Hu,Zheng Sun,Yi Wei,Long Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper addresses the unsatisfactory performance of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in image aesthetic reasoning and proposes a comprehensive solution involving data collection and advanced methodology.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to improve image aesthetic reasoning in MLLMs, which currently underperform due to lack of data and weak reasoning ability.

Method: The authors collect a large-scale dataset (128k samples, 640k images) and introduce the HCM-GRPO framework, combining Hard Cases Mining and Dynamic Proportional Accuracy reward strategies.

Result: Experimental results show that even leading closed-source MLLMs perform poorly in image aesthetic reasoning, akin to random guessing. The proposed HCM-GRPO method surpasses both open-source and closed-source MLLMs with a smaller model.

Conclusion: The proposed dataset and methodology provide an effective solution for improving image aesthetic reasoning, outperforming state-of-the-art models.

Abstract: The performance of image generation has been significantly improved in recent years. However, the study of image screening is rare and its performance with Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) is unsatisfactory due to the lack of data and the weak image aesthetic reasoning ability in MLLMs. In this work, we propose a complete solution to address these problems in terms of data and methodology. For data, we collect a comprehensive image screening dataset with over 128k samples, about 640k images. Each sample consists of an original image, four generated images. The dataset evaluates the image aesthetic reasoning ability under four aspects: appearance deformation, physical shadow, placement layout, and extension rationality. Regarding data annotation, we investigate multiple approaches, including purely manual, fully automated, and answer-driven annotations, to acquire high-quality chains of thought (CoT) data in the most cost-effective manner. Methodologically, we introduce a Hard Cases Mining (HCM) strategy with a Dynamic Proportional Accuracy (DPA) reward into the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) framework, called HCM-GRPO. This enhanced method demonstrates superior image aesthetic reasoning capabilities compared to the original GRPO. Our experimental results reveal that even state-of-the-art closed-source MLLMs, such as GPT4o and Qwen-VL-Max, exhibit performance akin to random guessing in image aesthetic reasoning. In contrast, by leveraging the HCM-GRPO, we are able to surpass the scores of both large-scale open-source and leading closed-source models with a much smaller model.

*Qilang Ye,Wei Zeng,Meng Liu,Jie Zhang,Yupeng Hu,Zitong Yu,Yu Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces AV-ConfuseBench to study multimodal large language models' ability to discern audio-visual confusion, finding weaknesses in existing models and proposing an improved system, RL-CoMM.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of multimodal large language models in reasoning about objects with mismatched audio-visual cues.

Method: The researchers employed a new benchmark (AV-ConfuseBench) and developed RL-CoMM, incorporating reinforcement learning and audio-only reasoning through an external Large Audio Language Model (LALM).

Result: RL-CoMM showed a significant improvement of 10-30% accuracy over baseline models in audio-visual reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: RL-CoMM effectively enhances audio-visual reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models by mitigating visually dominated ambiguities and optimizing confidence in predictions.

Abstract: Can Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) discern confused objects that are visually present but audio-absent? To study this, we introduce a new benchmark, AV-ConfuseBench, which simulates an ``Audio-Visual Confusion'' scene by modifying the corresponding sound of an object in the video, e.g., mute the sounding object and ask MLLMs Is there a/an muted-object sound''. Experimental results reveal that MLLMs, such as Qwen2.5-Omni and Gemini 2.5, struggle to discriminate non-existent audio due to visually dominated reasoning. Motivated by this observation, we introduce RL-CoMM, a Reinforcement Learning-based Collaborative Multi-MLLM that is built upon the Qwen2.5-Omni foundation. RL-CoMM includes two stages: 1) To alleviate visually dominated ambiguities, we introduce an external model, a Large Audio Language Model (LALM), as the reference model to generate audio-only reasoning. Then, we design a Step-wise Reasoning Reward function that enables MLLMs to self-improve audio-visual reasoning with the audio-only reference. 2) To ensure an accurate answer prediction, we introduce Answer-centered Confidence Optimization to reduce the uncertainty of potential heterogeneous reasoning differences. Extensive experiments on audio-visual question answering and audio-visual hallucination show that RL-CoMM improves the accuracy by 10~30\% over the baseline model with limited training data.

### [178] [Multivariate Gaussian Representation Learning for Medical Action Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10060)
*Luming Yang,Haoxian Liu,Siqing Li,Alper Yilmaz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a benchmark dataset and a novel framework for medical motion analysis, achieving significant accuracy and efficiency improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses challenges in medical vision such as lack of datasets, precision requirements, and insufficient modeling of rapid actions.

Method: It proposes a new dataset (CPREval-6k) and a framework (GaussMedAct) using a multivariate Gaussian encoding for adaptive representation learning.

Result: GaussMedAct achieves 92.1% accuracy, outperforming baselines while being computationally efficient.

Conclusion: The approach is effective for fine-grained medical action evaluation and demonstrates robustness across datasets.

Abstract: Fine-grained action evaluation in medical vision faces unique challenges due to the unavailability of comprehensive datasets, stringent precision requirements, and insufficient spatiotemporal dynamic modeling of very rapid actions. To support development and evaluation, we introduce CPREval-6k, a multi-view, multi-label medical action benchmark containing 6,372 expert-annotated videos with 22 clinical labels. Using this dataset, we present GaussMedAct, a multivariate Gaussian encoding framework, to advance medical motion analysis through adaptive spatiotemporal representation learning. Multivariate Gaussian Representation projects the joint motions to a temporally scaled multi-dimensional space, and decomposes actions into adaptive 3D Gaussians that serve as tokens. These tokens preserve motion semantics through anisotropic covariance modeling while maintaining robustness to spatiotemporal noise. Hybrid Spatial Encoding, employing a Cartesian and Vector dual-stream strategy, effectively utilizes skeletal information in the form of joint and bone features. The proposed method achieves 92.1% Top-1 accuracy with real-time inference on the benchmark, outperforming the ST-GCN baseline by +5.9% accuracy with only 10% FLOPs. Cross-dataset experiments confirm the superiority of our method in robustness.

### [179] [Perceive, Act and Correct: Confidence Is Not Enough for Hyperspectral Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10068)
*Muzhou Yang,Wuzhou Quan,Mingqiang Wei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Hyperspectral image classification models often confuse high predictive confidence with correctness, leading to poor generalization under sparse annotations or class imbalance. CABIN framework addresses this issue through perception, action, and correction strategies to improve labeling efficiency and model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High predictive confidence can be misleading in hyperspectral image classification, causing overfitting and poor generalization, especially under sparse annotations or class imbalance.

Method: CABIN integrates perception (estimating uncertainty), action (dual sampling strategy), and correction (dynamic assignment tailored losses) in its semi-supervised framework.

Result: Integration of CABIN with state-of-the-art methods enhances labeling efficiency and performance in hyperspectral image classification.

Conclusion: CABIN effectively improves the generalization and uncertainty handling in hyperspectral image classification, addressing confidence-induced biases.

Abstract: Confidence alone is often misleading in hyperspectral image classification, as models tend to mistake high predictive scores for correctness while lacking awareness of uncertainty. This leads to confirmation bias, especially under sparse annotations or class imbalance, where models overfit confident errors and fail to generalize. We propose CABIN (Cognitive-Aware Behavior-Informed learNing), a semi-supervised framework that addresses this limitation through a closed-loop learning process of perception, action, and correction. CABIN first develops perceptual awareness by estimating epistemic uncertainty, identifying ambiguous regions where errors are likely to occur. It then acts by adopting an Uncertainty-Guided Dual Sampling Strategy, selecting uncertain samples for exploration while anchoring confident ones as stable pseudo-labels to reduce bias. To correct noisy supervision, CABIN introduces a Fine-Grained Dynamic Assignment Strategy that categorizes pseudo-labeled data into reliable, ambiguous, and noisy subsets, applying tailored losses to enhance generalization. Experimental results show that a wide range of state-of-the-art methods benefit from the integration of CABIN, with improved labeling efficiency and performance.

### [180] [VLF-MSC: Vision-Language Feature-Based Multimodal Semantic Communication System](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10074)
*Gwangyeon Ahn,Jiwan Seo,Joonhyuk Kang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents VLF-MSC, a system that enables efficient transmission of shared vision-language features for both image and text generation, outperforming conventional methods in noisy channels with low bandwidth.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address inefficiencies in existing semantic communication systems, which separately process different modalities and are not optimized for joint image and text recovery, leading to poor spectral efficiency.

Method: The proposed method encodes an image into a vision-language semantic feature (VLF) using a pre-trained vision-language model (VLM). The VLF is transmitted via a wireless channel and, at the receiver, utilized by a decoder-based language model and a diffusion-based image generator for text and image reconstruction.

Result: Experiments show that the proposed method outperforms separate text-only and image-only systems by achieving better semantic accuracy in low Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) conditions, while using significantly less bandwidth.

Conclusion: VLF-MSC provides a unified, compact, and robust communication framework for simultaneous image and text reconstruction, demonstrating higher efficiency and adaptability, especially in challenging wireless environments.

Abstract: We propose Vision-Language Feature-based Multimodal Semantic Communication (VLF-MSC), a unified system that transmits a single compact vision-language representation to support both image and text generation at the receiver. Unlike existing semantic communication techniques that process each modality separately, VLF-MSC employs a pre-trained vision-language model (VLM) to encode the source image into a vision-language semantic feature (VLF), which is transmitted over the wireless channel. At the receiver, a decoder-based language model and a diffusion-based image generator are both conditioned on the VLF to produce a descriptive text and a semantically aligned image. This unified representation eliminates the need for modality-specific streams or retransmissions, improving spectral efficiency and adaptability. By leveraging foundation models, the system achieves robustness to channel noise while preserving semantic fidelity. Experiments demonstrate that VLF-MSC outperforms text-only and image-only baselines, achieving higher semantic accuracy for both modalities under low SNR with significantly reduced bandwidth.

### [181] [Mitigating Error Accumulation in Co-Speech Motion Generation via Global Rotation Diffusion and Multi-Level Constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10076)
*Xiangyue Zhang,Jianfang Li,Jianqiang Ren,Jiaxu Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GlobalDiff is a novel diffusion-based framework for co-speech motion generation, addressing hierarchical errors by operating in global joint rotation space and introducing multi-level constraints to enhance motion quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for co-speech motion generation face issues like cumulative hierarchical errors, resulting in unstable and unrealistic motions, particularly at end-effectors.

Method: GlobalDiff operates directly in global joint rotations, avoiding hierarchical dependencies. It employs multi-level constraints: joint structure constraint (virtual anchor points), skeleton structure constraint (angular consistency), and temporal structure constraint (multi-scale encoder).

Result: GlobalDiff eliminates hierarchical error accumulation, generates smooth and accurate co-speech motions, and demonstrates a 46.0% performance improvement over current state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: By decoupling joint prediction and incorporating structural priors, GlobalDiff effectively enhances the quality and structural integrity of co-speech motion generation, setting a higher benchmark for performance.

Abstract: Reliable co-speech motion generation requires precise motion representation and consistent structural priors across all joints. Existing generative methods typically operate on local joint rotations, which are defined hierarchically based on the skeleton structure. This leads to cumulative errors during generation, manifesting as unstable and implausible motions at end-effectors. In this work, we propose GlobalDiff, a diffusion-based framework that operates directly in the space of global joint rotations for the first time, fundamentally decoupling each joint's prediction from upstream dependencies and alleviating hierarchical error accumulation. To compensate for the absence of structural priors in global rotation space, we introduce a multi-level constraint scheme. Specifically, a joint structure constraint introduces virtual anchor points around each joint to better capture fine-grained orientation. A skeleton structure constraint enforces angular consistency across bones to maintain structural integrity. A temporal structure constraint utilizes a multi-scale variational encoder to align the generated motion with ground-truth temporal patterns. These constraints jointly regularize the global diffusion process and reinforce structural awareness. Extensive evaluations on standard co-speech benchmarks show that GlobalDiff generates smooth and accurate motions, improving the performance by 46.0 % compared to the current SOTA under multiple speaker identities.

### [182] [GridPrune: From "Where to Look" to "What to Select" in Visual Token Pruning for MLLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10081)
*Yuxiang Duan,Ao Li,Yingqin Li,Luyu Li,Pengwei Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GridPrune is a new method for multimodal large language models (MLLMs) that enhances efficiency by introducing a two-stage token pruning strategy inspired by human cognitive processes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs suffer from computational inefficiency due to a high number of visual tokens, and existing pruning methods fail to optimally allocate attention spatially, leading to biases and redundancies.

Method: GridPrune incorporates a two-stage pruning: 'guide-globally, select-locally', using text-conditional guidance for spatial token budget allocation and local selection within zones.

Result: GridPrune retains 96.98% of performance on LLaVA-NeXT-7B while reducing token usage to 11.1%, exceeding baseline performance by 2.34% at similar pruning rates.

Conclusion: GridPrune's innovative zonal selection system significantly improves the computational efficiency of MLLMs without compromising accuracy, addressing limitations of traditional pruning methods.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in a wide range of vision-language tasks. However, the large number of visual tokens introduces significant computational overhead. To address this issue, visual token pruning has emerged as a key technique for enhancing the efficiency of MLLMs. In cognitive science, humans tend to first determine which regions of a scene to attend to ("where to look") before deciding which specific elements within those regions to process in detail ("what to select"). This two-stage strategy enables the visual system to efficiently allocate attention at a coarse spatial level before performing fine-grained selection. However, existing pruning methods primarily focus on directly optimizing "what to select", typically using attention scores or similarity metrics. They rarely consider "where to look", which has been shown to lead to inefficient spatial allocation, positional bias, and the retention of irrelevant or redundant tokens. In this paper, we propose GridPrune, a method that replaces the global Top-K mechanism with a "guide-globally, select-locally" zonal selection system. GridPrune splits the pruning process into two steps: first, it uses text-conditional guidance to dynamically allocate a token budget across spatial zones; and then, it performs local selection within each budgeted zone. Experimental results demonstrate that GridPrune achieves superior performance across various MLLM architectures. On LLaVA-NeXT-7B, GridPrune retains 96.98% of the full performance while using 11.1% of the tokens, outperforming the best-performing baseline by 2.34% at the same pruning rate.

*Qilang Ye,Yu Zhou,Lian He,Jie Zhang,Xuanming Guo,Jiayu Zhang,Mingkui Tan,Weicheng Xie,Yue Sun,Tao Tan,Xiaochen Yuan,Ghada Khoriba,Zitong Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores combining large language models (LLMs) with human skeleton data for action classification and description using the SUGAR paradigm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Utilize the implicit knowledge and transferability of LLMs to address challenges in understanding and distinguishing human skeletal actions.

Method: Propose SUGAR, which uses video models to generate visual-motion information, supervises skeleton learning with prior knowledge, and employs pre-trained LLMs for action classification and description.

Result: Experimental results show SUGAR's effectiveness in skeleton-based action classification benchmarks and its versatility in zero-shot scenarios compared to linear-based methods.

Conclusion: SUGAR demonstrates the potential of integrating LLMs with human skeleton representation for action analysis, improving adaptability and performance.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) hold rich implicit knowledge and powerful transferability. In this paper, we explore the combination of LLMs with the human skeleton to perform action classification and description. However, when treating LLM as a recognizer, two questions arise: 1) How can LLMs understand skeleton? 2) How can LLMs distinguish among actions? To address these problems, we introduce a novel paradigm named learning Skeleton representation with visUal-motion knowledGe for Action Recognition (SUGAR). In our pipeline, we first utilize off-the-shelf large-scale video models as a knowledge base to generate visual, motion information related to actions. Then, we propose to supervise skeleton learning through this prior knowledge to yield discrete representations. Finally, we use the LLM with untouched pre-training weights to understand these representations and generate the desired action targets and descriptions. Notably, we present a Temporal Query Projection (TQP) module to continuously model the skeleton signals with long sequences. Experiments on several skeleton-based action classification benchmarks demonstrate the efficacy of our SUGAR. Moreover, experiments on zero-shot scenarios show that SUGAR is more versatile than linear-based methods.

*Zihan Wang,Guansong Pang,Wenjun Miao,Jin Zheng,Xiao Bai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents multi-target backdoor attacks on Large Visual Language Models (LVLMs), introducing a novel attack framework called MTAttack to exploit their vulnerabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate the vulnerabilities of LVLMs to multi-target backdoor attacks, given the growing security concerns in real-world applications.

Method: Proposed MTAttack framework includes novel constraints (Proxy Space Partitioning and Trigger Prototype Anchoring) to optimize multiple independent triggers while ensuring their separability in latent space.

Result: MTAttack achieves a high success rate in multi-target attacks, outperforming existing methods, and demonstrates strong generalizability and robustness against defenses.

Conclusion: The study reveals the severe vulnerability of LVLMs to multi-target backdoor attacks and stresses the need for urgent security mitigation strategies.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Visual Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance across various vision-language tasks by leveraging large-scale image-text pretraining and instruction tuning. However, the security vulnerabilities of LVLMs have become increasingly concerning, particularly their susceptibility to backdoor attacks. Existing backdoor attacks focus on single-target attacks, i.e., targeting a single malicious output associated with a specific trigger. In this work, we uncover multi-target backdoor attacks, where multiple independent triggers corresponding to different attack targets are added in a single pass of training, posing a greater threat to LVLMs in real-world applications. Executing such attacks in LVLMs is challenging since there can be many incorrect trigger-target mappings due to severe feature interference among different triggers. To address this challenge, we propose MTAttack, the first multi-target backdoor attack framework for enforcing accurate multiple trigger-target mappings in LVLMs. The core of MTAttack is a novel optimization method with two constraints, namely Proxy Space Partitioning constraint and Trigger Prototype Anchoring constraint. It jointly optimizes multiple triggers in the latent space, with each trigger independently mapping clean images to a unique proxy class while at the same time guaranteeing their separability. Experiments on popular benchmarks demonstrate a high success rate of MTAttack for multi-target attacks, substantially outperforming existing attack methods. Furthermore, our attack exhibits strong generalizability across datasets and robustness against backdoor defense strategies. These findings highlight the vulnerability of LVLMs to multi-target backdoor attacks and underscore the urgent need for mitigating such threats.

*Jueun Ko,Hyewon Park,Hyesong Choi,Dongbo Min*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes RobIA, a novel framework for continual test-time adaptative stereo depth estimation, addressing challenges like domain shifts and sparse supervision using efficient techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle challenges in real-world stereo depth estimation, such as domain shifts, unreliable supervision, and high cost of dense labels.

Method: The method integrates an Attend-and-Excite Mixture-of-Experts module and a Robust AdaptBN Teacher for efficient adaptation and pseudo-supervision.

Result: RobIA demonstrates superior adaptation across varying target domains and computational efficiency.

Conclusion: The framework enhances continual adaptation performance in stereo depth estimation under dynamic environments with reduced computational demands.

Abstract: Stereo Depth Estimation in real-world environments poses significant challenges due to dynamic domain shifts, sparse or unreliable supervision, and the high cost of acquiring dense ground-truth labels. While recent Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) methods offer promising solutions, most rely on static target domain assumptions and input-invariant adaptation strategies, limiting their effectiveness under continual shifts. In this paper, we propose RobIA, a novel Robust, Instance-Aware framework for Continual Test-Time Adaptation (CTTA) in stereo depth estimation. RobIA integrates two key components: (1) Attend-and-Excite Mixture-of-Experts (AttEx-MoE), a parameter-efficient module that dynamically routes input to frozen experts via lightweight self-attention mechanism tailored to epipolar geometry, and (2) Robust AdaptBN Teacher, a PEFT-based teacher model that provides dense pseudo-supervision by complementing sparse handcrafted labels. This strategy enables input-specific flexibility, broad supervision coverage, improving generalization under domain shift. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RobIA achieves superior adaptation performance across dynamic target domains while maintaining computational efficiency.

*Mingda Jia,Weiliang Meng,Zenghuang Fu,Yiheng Li,Qi Zeng,Yifan Zhang,Ju Xin,Rongtao Xu,Jiguang Zhang,Xiaopeng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces Context-Aware Cross-Modal Interaction (CACMI), a framework for dense video captioning that enhances temporal and semantic coherence in captions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing pipelines for dense video captioning struggle to capture temporal coherence across events and comprehensive semantics within visual contexts.

Method: The CACMI framework includes two components: Cross-modal Frame Aggregation for temporally coherent feature extraction and Context-aware Feature Enhancement for integrating visual dynamics with pseudo-event semantics.

Result: Experiments on ActivityNet Captions and YouCook2 datasets show CACMI achieves state-of-the-art performance for dense video captioning.

Conclusion: CACMI improves upon existing methods by explicitly modeling temporal and semantic interactions, setting new benchmarks in dense video captioning.

Abstract: Dense video captioning jointly localizes and captions salient events in untrimmed videos. Recent methods primarily focus on leveraging additional prior knowledge and advanced multi-task architectures to achieve competitive performance. However, these pipelines rely on implicit modeling that uses frame-level or fragmented video features, failing to capture the temporal coherence across event sequences and comprehensive semantics within visual contexts. To address this, we propose an explicit temporal-semantic modeling framework called Context-Aware Cross-Modal Interaction (CACMI), which leverages both latent temporal characteristics within videos and linguistic semantics from text corpus. Specifically, our model consists of two core components: Cross-modal Frame Aggregation aggregates relevant frames to extract temporally coherent, event-aligned textual features through cross-modal retrieval; and Context-aware Feature Enhancement utilizes query-guided attention to integrate visual dynamics with pseudo-event semantics. Extensive experiments on the ActivityNet Captions and YouCook2 datasets demonstrate that CACMI achieves the state-of-the-art performance on dense video captioning task.

*Mayank Vatsa,Aparna Bharati,Richa Singh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Today's text-to-image models struggle with compositional logic, failing on tasks like negation, counting, and spatial relations when combined.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inability of current text-to-image models to handle logical composition and highlight the severe performance collapse on combined logical tasks.

Method: Analyzed training data, continuous attention architectures, and evaluation metrics to uncover issues; additionally, reviewed benchmarks and solutions to evaluate effectiveness.

Result: Identified critical issues: lack of explicit negation examples in training, unsuitability of continuous architectures for logic, and flawed evaluation metrics prioritizing visual plausibility over constraints.

Conclusion: Bridging compositional logic gaps necessitates fundamental advancements in representation and reasoning, not just tweaking existing architectures.

Abstract: The architectural blueprint of today's leading text-to-image models contains a fundamental flaw: an inability to handle logical composition. This survey investigates this breakdown across three core primitives-negation, counting, and spatial relations. Our analysis reveals a dramatic performance collapse: models that are accurate on single primitives fail precipitously when these are combined, exposing severe interference. We trace this failure to three key factors. First, training data show a near-total absence of explicit negations. Second, continuous attention architectures are fundamentally unsuitable for discrete logic. Third, evaluation metrics reward visual plausibility over constraint satisfaction. By analyzing recent benchmarks and methods, we show that current solutions and simple scaling cannot bridge this gap. Achieving genuine compositionality, we conclude, will require fundamental advances in representation and reasoning rather than incremental adjustments to existing architectures.

*Zhicheng Cai,Hao Zhu,Linsen Chen,Qiu Shen,Xun Cao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces split-layer in INR to enhance representational capacity by expanding feature space without excessive computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional MLP architectures in INR have limited feature space due to their low-dimensional design, restricting signal representation efficiency.

Method: The split-layer reformulates MLPs by dividing layers into parallel branches combined with Hadamard products, expanding feature space efficiently.

Result: Split-layer significantly improves INR performance in tasks like image fitting, CT reconstruction, 3D representation, and novel view synthesis.

Conclusion: The split-layer method enhances INR's capabilities while mitigating computational overhead, achieving superior results across diverse applications.

Abstract: Implicit neural representation (INR) models signals as continuous functions using neural networks, offering efficient and differentiable optimization for inverse problems across diverse disciplines. However, the representational capacity of INR defined by the range of functions the neural network can characterize, is inherently limited by the low-dimensional feature space in conventional multilayer perceptron (MLP) architectures. While widening the MLP can linearly increase feature space dimensionality, it also leads to a quadratic growth in computational and memory costs. To address this limitation, we propose the split-layer, a novel reformulation of MLP construction. The split-layer divides each layer into multiple parallel branches and integrates their outputs via Hadamard product, effectively constructing a high-degree polynomial space. This approach significantly enhances INR's representational capacity by expanding the feature space dimensionality without incurring prohibitive computational overhead. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the split-layer substantially improves INR performance, surpassing existing methods across multiple tasks, including 2D image fitting, 2D CT reconstruction, 3D shape representation, and 5D novel view synthesis.

*Feng Ding,Wenhui Yi,Yunpeng Zhou,Xinan He,Hong Rao,Shu Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study tackles fairness in deepfake detection models and proposes a dual-mechanism collaborative framework to enhance fairness without compromising detection accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address biases in deepfake detection models that disproportionately affect different demographic groups, leading to societal inequities.

Method: Proposing a dual-mechanism framework combining structural fairness decoupling at the architectural level with global distribution alignment at the feature level.

Result: Experimental results show improved fairness (both inter-group and intra-group) while maintaining detection accuracy across domains.

Conclusion: The dual-mechanism framework successfully integrates fairness and accuracy, making strides in mitigating biases in deepfake detection systems.

Abstract: Fairness is a core element in the trustworthy deployment of deepfake detection models, especially in the field of digital identity security. Biases in detection models toward different demographic groups, such as gender and race, may lead to systemic misjudgments, exacerbating the digital divide and social inequities. However, current fairness-enhanced detectors often improve fairness at the cost of detection accuracy. To address this challenge, we propose a dual-mechanism collaborative optimization framework. Our proposed method innovatively integrates structural fairness decoupling and global distribution alignment: decoupling channels sensitive to demographic groups at the model architectural level, and subsequently reducing the distance between the overall sample distribution and the distributions corresponding to each demographic group at the feature level. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared with other methods, our framework improves both inter-group and intra-group fairness while maintaining overall detection accuracy across domains.

*Hao Zou,Runqing Zhang,Xue Zhou,Jianxiao Zou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new method, Generation-Enhanced Alignment (GEA), to address challenges in Text-to-Image Person Retrieval (TIPR) using generative models for better modal alignment and retrieval performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current TIPR methods suffer from poor cross-modal alignment and overfitting due to the inherent modality gap between text and image descriptions, leading to challenges in accurately retrieving relevant images.

Method: The authors propose the GEA framework, which includes Text-Guided Token Enhancement (TGTE) using diffusion-generated images for semantic bridging and Generative Intermediate Fusion (GIF) for unified representation through cross-attention and triplet alignment loss.

Result: The GEA framework is evaluated on three public TIPR datasets (CUHK-PEDES, RSTPReid, and ICFG-PEDES), demonstrating superior performance and effectiveness.

Conclusion: This generative perspective of employing diffusion-generated images and unified representations significantly improves cross-modal alignment and TIPR performance.

Abstract: Text-to-Image Person Retrieval (TIPR) aims to retrieve person images based on natural language descriptions. Although many TIPR methods have achieved promising results, sometimes textual queries cannot accurately and comprehensively reflect the content of the image, leading to poor cross-modal alignment and overfitting to limited datasets. Moreover, the inherent modality gap between text and image further amplifies these issues, making accurate cross-modal retrieval even more challenging. To address these limitations, we propose the Generation-Enhanced Alignment (GEA) from a generative perspective. GEA contains two parallel modules: (1) Text-Guided Token Enhancement (TGTE), which introduces diffusion-generated images as intermediate semantic representations to bridge the gap between text and visual patterns. These generated images enrich the semantic representation of text and facilitate cross-modal alignment. (2) Generative Intermediate Fusion (GIF), which combines cross-attention between generated images, original images, and text features to generate a unified representation optimized by triplet alignment loss. We conduct extensive experiments on three public TIPR datasets, CUHK-PEDES, RSTPReid, and ICFG-PEDES, to evaluate the performance of GEA. The results justify the effectiveness of our method.

TL;DR: Current image restoration techniques often address a single degradation. "InterIR" offers an interpretable solution to handle multi-degradation scenarios efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods fail to address multiple simultaneous degradations like rain, noise, and haze. Improved interpretability in networks is critical.

Method: Proposed "InterIR," grounded in a deep unfolding network with a semi-smooth Newton algorithm for interpretability. Incorporated an explainable convolution module inspired by human brain processing to adapt to diverse inputs.

Result: InterIR achieved strong capabilities in multi-degradation restoration and performed competitively in single-degradation tasks.

Conclusion: InterIR showcases interpretability-driven design, capable of effective restoration in various degradation scenarios, positioning it as a versatile and robust approach.

Abstract: Although image restoration has advanced significantly, most existing methods target only a single type of degradation. In real-world scenarios, images often contain multiple degradations simultaneously, such as rain, noise, and haze, requiring models capable of handling diverse degradation types. Moreover, methods that improve performance through module stacking often suffer from limited interpretability. In this paper, we propose a novel interpretability-driven approach for multi-degradation image restoration, built upon a deep unfolding network that maps the iterative process of a mathematical optimization algorithm into a learnable network structure. Specifically, we employ an improved second-order semi-smooth Newton algorithm to ensure that each module maintains clear physical interpretability. To further enhance interpretability and adaptability, we design an explainable convolution module inspired by the human brain's flexible information processing and the intrinsic characteristics of images, allowing the network to flexibly leverage learned knowledge and autonomously adjust parameters for different input. The resulting tightly integrated architecture, named InterIR, demonstrates excellent performance in multi-degradation restoration while remaining highly competitive on single-degradation tasks.

Conclusion: CephRes-MHNet sets a new benchmark in cephalometric landmark detection, demonstrating both high accuracy and architectural efficiency suitable for practical applications.

Abstract: Accurate localization of cephalometric landmarks from 2D lateral skull X-rays is vital for orthodontic diagnosis and treatment. Manual annotation is time-consuming and error-prone, whereas automated approaches often struggle with low contrast and anatomical complexity. This paper introduces CephRes-MHNet, a multi-head residual convolutional network for robust and efficient cephalometric landmark detection. The architecture integrates residual encoding, dual-attention mechanisms, and multi-head decoders to enhance contextual reasoning and anatomical precision. Trained on the Aariz Cephalometric dataset of 1,000 radiographs, CephRes-MHNet achieved a mean radial error (MRE) of 1.23 mm and a success detection rate (SDR) @ 2.0 mm of 85.5%, outperforming all evaluated models. In particular, it exceeded the strongest baseline, the attention-driven AFPF-Net (MRE = 1.25 mm, SDR @ 2.0 mm = 84.1%), while using less than 25% of its parameters. These results demonstrate that CephRes-MHNet attains state-of-the-art accuracy through architectural efficiency, providing a practical solution for real-world orthodontic analysis.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces LiNeXt, a lightweight network for efficient and accurate 3D LiDAR scene completion, claiming improved speed, accuracy, and reduced parameters compared to diffusion models like LiDiff.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the inefficiency and high computational overhead of diffusion models in real-time 3D LiDAR scene completion for autonomous vehicles.

Method: LiNeXt employs a Noise-to-Coarse (N2C) module for single-pass denoising and a Refine Module for further structural completion. Additionally, it uses a Distance-aware Selected Repeat strategy to address spatial distribution imbalances in point clouds.

Result: LiNeXt achieves 199.8x faster inference, reduces Chamfer Distance by 50.7%, and uses only 6.1% of parameters compared to LiDiff on the SemanticKITTI dataset.

Conclusion: LiNeXt demonstrates superior efficiency and accuracy in real-time LiDAR point cloud completion, showcasing significant improvements over diffusion-based methods.

Abstract: 3D LiDAR scene completion from point clouds is a fundamental component of perception systems in autonomous vehicles. Previous methods have predominantly employed diffusion models for high-fidelity reconstruction. However, their multi-step iterative sampling incurs significant computational overhead, limiting its real-time applicability. To address this, we propose LiNeXt-a lightweight, non-diffusion network optimized for rapid and accurate point cloud completion. Specifically, LiNeXt first applies the Noise-to-Coarse (N2C) Module to denoise the input noisy point cloud in a single pass, thereby obviating the multi-step iterative sampling of diffusion-based methods. The Refine Module then takes the coarse point cloud and its intermediate features from the N2C Module to perform more precise refinement, further enhancing structural completeness. Furthermore, we observe that LiDAR point clouds exhibit a distance-dependent spatial distribution, being densely sampled at proximal ranges and sparsely sampled at distal ranges. Accordingly, we propose the Distance-aware Selected Repeat strategy to generate a more uniformly distributed noisy point cloud. On the SemanticKITTI dataset, LiNeXt achieves a 199.8x speedup in inference, reduces Chamfer Distance by 50.7%, and uses only 6.1% of the parameters compared with LiDiff. These results demonstrate the superior efficiency and effectiveness of LiNeXt for real-time scene completion.

*Yueran Zhao,Zhang Zhang,Chao Sun,Tianze Wang,Chao Yue,Nuoran Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces HeatV2X, a scalable V2X collaborative framework to address multi-modal, heterogeneous agents and scalability concerns. By leveraging fine-tuning strategies, it enhances perception performance with minimal training cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to overcome the challenges of heterogeneity among multi-modal agents and the need for scalable adaptation in collaborative vehicle perception systems.

Method: They propose the HeatV2X framework, which employs heterogeneous graph attention for collaborative learning and uses fine-tuning designs, including Hetero-Aware Adapters and Multi-Cognitive Adapters, for efficient alignment and collaboration.

Result: HeatV2X achieves superior performance in perception tasks with reduced training costs, as validated on OPV2V-H and DAIR-V2X datasets.

Conclusion: HeatV2X effectively addresses heterogeneity and scalability challenges, boosting collaborative perception and outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) collaborative perception extends sensing beyond single vehicle limits through transmission. However, as more agents participate, existing frameworks face two key challenges: (1) the participating agents are inherently multi-modal and heterogeneous, and (2) the collaborative framework must be scalable to accommodate new agents. The former requires effective cross-agent feature alignment to mitigate heterogeneity loss, while the latter renders full-parameter training impractical, highlighting the importance of scalable adaptation. To address these issues, we propose Heterogeneous Adaptation (HeatV2X), a scalable collaborative framework. We first train a high-performance agent based on heterogeneous graph attention as the foundation for collaborative learning. Then, we design Local Heterogeneous Fine-Tuning and Global Collaborative Fine-Tuning to achieve effective alignment and interaction among heterogeneous agents. The former efficiently extracts modality-specific differences using Hetero-Aware Adapters, while the latter employs the Multi-Cognitive Adapter to enhance cross-agent collaboration and fully exploit the fusion potential. These designs enable substantial performance improvement of the collaborative framework with minimal training cost. We evaluate our approach on the OPV2V-H and DAIR-V2X datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves superior perception performance with significantly reduced training overhead, outperforming existing state-of-the-art approaches. Our implementation will be released soon.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes an advanced deepfake detection method improving generalization and artifact detection using next-frame prediction and window-level attention mechanism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of existing multimodal deepfake detectors, which struggle with generalization across unseen manipulations and datasets and fail to detect artifacts that preserve audio-visual alignment.

Method: The method involves single-stage training with next-frame prediction for uni-modal and cross-modal features, and a window-level attention mechanism to detect discrepancies in predicted and actual frames.

Result: The proposed model achieves strong generalization capabilities and precise temporal localization when evaluated on multiple benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: The approach improves generalization and is effective in detecting both fully manipulated videos and partially altered samples, addressing weaknesses in existing methods.

Abstract: Recent multimodal deepfake detection methods designed for generalization conjecture that single-stage supervised training struggles to generalize across unseen manipulations and datasets. However, such approaches that target generalization require pretraining over real samples. Additionally, these methods primarily focus on detecting audio-visual inconsistencies and may overlook intra-modal artifacts causing them to fail against manipulations that preserve audio-visual alignment. To address these limitations, we propose a single-stage training framework that enhances generalization by incorporating next-frame prediction for both uni-modal and cross-modal features. Additionally, we introduce a window-level attention mechanism to capture discrepancies between predicted and actual frames, enabling the model to detect local artifacts around every frame, which is crucial for accurately classifying fully manipulated videos and effectively localizing deepfake segments in partially spoofed samples. Our model, evaluated on multiple benchmark datasets, demonstrates strong generalization and precise temporal localization.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TubeRMC framework improves spatio-temporal video grounding performance by introducing text-conditioned candidate tubes and refining them with spatio-temporal constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address failures in target identification and tracking in weakly-supervised spatio-temporal video grounding systems due to simple late fusion approaches.

Method: TubeRMC uses text-conditioned candidate generation and tube-conditioned reconstruction strategies with spatio-temporal constraints.

Result: TubeRMC achieves superior performance over existing methods on VidSTG and HCSTVG benchmarks and reduces errors in identification and tracking.

Conclusion: The TubeRMC framework enriches tube-text correspondences using mutual spatio-temporal constraints, enhancing weakly-supervised video grounding quality.

Abstract: Spatio-Temporal Video Grounding (STVG) aims to localize a spatio-temporal tube that corresponds to a given language query in an untrimmed video. This is a challenging task since it involves complex vision-language understanding and spatiotemporal reasoning. Recent works have explored weakly-supervised setting in STVG to eliminate reliance on fine-grained annotations like bounding boxes or temporal stamps. However, they typically follow a simple late-fusion manner, which generates tubes independent of the text description, often resulting in failed target identification and inconsistent target tracking. To address this limitation, we propose a Tube-conditioned Reconstruction with Mutual Constraints (\textbf{TubeRMC}) framework that generates text-conditioned candidate tubes with pre-trained visual grounding models and further refine them via tube-conditioned reconstruction with spatio-temporal constraints. Specifically, we design three reconstruction strategies from temporal, spatial, and spatio-temporal perspectives to comprehensively capture rich tube-text correspondences. Each strategy is equipped with a Tube-conditioned Reconstructor, utilizing spatio-temporal tubes as condition to reconstruct the key clues in the query. We further introduce mutual constraints between spatial and temporal proposals to enhance their quality for reconstruction. TubeRMC outperforms existing methods on two public benchmarks VidSTG and HCSTVG. Further visualization shows that TubeRMC effectively mitigates both target identification errors and inconsistent tracking.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces JudgeMind, a novel method for Action Quality Assessment (AQA) in aerial skiing, supported by a newly constructed dataset with fine-grained annotations. It simulates professional referees' scoring strategies for improved accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods rely on full-video features for scoring, lacking interpretability and reliability. Additionally, current AQA datasets are insufficiently annotated for deductions and sub-scores.

Method: JudgeMind segments action videos, utilizes stage-aware feature enhancement for robustness to viewpoint changes, and employs a grade-aware decoder to incorporate deduction knowledge.

Result: JudgeMind achieves state-of-the-art performance according to experimental results.

Conclusion: The method improves AQA accuracy and reliability, with a novel dataset serving as a benchmark for fine-grained scoring and deduction annotations in aerial skiing.

Abstract: Action Quality Assessment (AQA) aims to evaluate and score sports actions, which has attracted widespread interest in recent years. Existing AQA methods primarily predict scores based on features extracted from the entire video, resulting in limited interpretability and reliability. Meanwhile, existing AQA datasets also lack fine-grained annotations for action scores, especially for deduction items and sub-score annotations. In this paper, we construct the first AQA dataset containing fine-grained sub-score and deduction annotations for aerial skiing, which will be released as a new benchmark. For the technical challenges, we propose a novel AQA method, named JudgeMind, which significantly enhances performance and reliability by simulating the judgment and scoring mindset of professional referees. Our method segments the input action video into different stages and scores each stage to enhance accuracy. Then, we propose a stage-aware feature enhancement and fusion module to boost the perception of stage-specific key regions and enhance the robustness to visual changes caused by frequent camera viewpoints switching. In addition, we propose a knowledge-based grade-aware decoder to incorporate possible deduction items as prior knowledge to predict more accurate and reliable scores. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Facial-R1 proposes a framework combining instruction fine-tuning, reinforcement training, and data synthesis to enhance Facial Emotion Analysis (FEA) with superior reasoning, alignment, and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of hallucinated reasoning and misalignment in existing Vision-Language Model-based FEA approaches.

Method: Facial-R1 utilizes a three-stage framework with instruction fine-tuning, reinforcement training with emotion/AU-based rewards, and iterative data synthesis for scalable improvement.

Result: Facial-R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance in FEA across eight benchmarks, showcasing strong generalization and robust interpretability.

Conclusion: Facial-R1 effectively addresses critical challenges in FEA with minimal supervision, establishing itself as a reliable framework for fine-grained facial emotion analysis.

Abstract: Facial Emotion Analysis (FEA) extends traditional facial emotion recognition by incorporating explainable, fine-grained reasoning. The task integrates three subtasks: emotion recognition, facial Action Unit (AU) recognition, and AU-based emotion reasoning to model affective states jointly. While recent approaches leverage Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and achieve promising results, they face two critical limitations: (1) hallucinated reasoning, where VLMs generate plausible but inaccurate explanations due to insufficient emotion-specific knowledge; and (2) misalignment between emotion reasoning and recognition, caused by fragmented connections between observed facial features and final labels. We propose Facial-R1, a three-stage alignment framework that effectively addresses both challenges with minimal supervision. First, we employ instruction fine-tuning to establish basic emotional reasoning capability. Second, we introduce reinforcement training guided by emotion and AU labels as reward signals, which explicitly aligns the generated reasoning process with the predicted emotion. Third, we design a data synthesis pipeline that iteratively leverages the prior stages to expand the training dataset, enabling scalable self-improvement of the model. Built upon this framework, we introduce FEA-20K, a benchmark dataset comprising 17,737 training and 1,688 test samples with fine-grained emotion analysis annotations. Extensive experiments across eight standard benchmarks demonstrate that Facial-R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance in FEA, with strong generalization and robust interpretability.

### [200] [H3Former: Hypergraph-based Semantic-Aware Aggregation via Hyperbolic Hierarchical Contrastive Loss for Fine-Grained Visual Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10260)
*Yongji Zhang,Siqi Li,Kuiyang Huang,Yue Gao,Yu Jiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces H3Former, which uses high-order semantic relations and hyperbolic contrastive loss to improve fine-grained visual classification, achieving superior results on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fine-Grained Visual Classification (FGVC) is difficult due to subtle differences between classes and significant variations within a class. Current methods fail to comprehensively capture discriminative regions and often introduce redundant information.

Method: The paper proposes H3Former, a token-to-region framework. It features the Semantic-Aware Aggregation Module (SAAM) to create weighted hypergraphs and use hypergraph convolutions for compact representations, and the Hyperbolic Hierarchical Contrastive Loss (HHCL) for maintaining semantic hierarchy and improving classification.

Result: The H3Former framework showed superior performance on four standard FGVC benchmarks, proving its effectiveness.

Conclusion: H3Former successfully addresses FGVC's challenges by utilizing advanced semantic aggregation and hierarchical constraints in a structured framework, leading to enhanced classification accuracy.

Abstract: Fine-Grained Visual Classification (FGVC) remains a challenging task due to subtle inter-class differences and large intra-class variations. Existing approaches typically rely on feature-selection mechanisms or region-proposal strategies to localize discriminative regions for semantic analysis. However, these methods often fail to capture discriminative cues comprehensively while introducing substantial category-agnostic redundancy. To address these limitations, we propose H3Former, a novel token-to-region framework that leverages high-order semantic relations to aggregate local fine-grained representations with structured region-level modeling. Specifically, we propose the Semantic-Aware Aggregation Module (SAAM), which exploits multi-scale contextual cues to dynamically construct a weighted hypergraph among tokens. By applying hypergraph convolution, SAAM captures high-order semantic dependencies and progressively aggregates token features into compact region-level representations. Furthermore, we introduce the Hyperbolic Hierarchical Contrastive Loss (HHCL), which enforces hierarchical semantic constraints in a non-Euclidean embedding space. The HHCL enhances inter-class separability and intra-class consistency while preserving the intrinsic hierarchical relationships among fine-grained categories. Comprehensive experiments conducted on four standard FGVC benchmarks validate the superiority of our H3Former framework.

*Yanbei Jiang,Chao Lei,Yihao Ding,Krista Ehinger,Jey Han Lau*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) face challenges in complex reasoning due to error accumulation. PROPA introduces a novel method combining MCTS and GRPO to address these issues and improve performance without extensive human annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Vision-Language Models struggle with cascading errors in multi-step reasoning. Existing methods rely on either costly annotations or sparse feedback, making optimization difficult.

Method: PROPA combines Monte Carlo Tree Search with GRPO to provide dense step-level optimization rewards, interleaves supervised fine-tuning for initialization, and employs a Process Reward Model for better search alignment during inference.

Result: Across seven benchmarks and four VLMs, PROPA achieves up to 17% improvement on in-domain tasks and 21% on out-of-domain tasks, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: PROPA demonstrates enhanced reasoning and generalization for visual reasoning tasks, addressing VLM challenges with a novel approach.

Abstract: Despite significant progress, Vision-Language Models (VLMs) still struggle with complex visual reasoning, where multi-step dependencies cause early errors to cascade through the reasoning chain. Existing post-training paradigms are limited: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) relies on costly step-level annotations, while Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) methods like GRPO provide only sparse, outcome-level feedback, hindering stable optimization. We introduce PROPA (Process-level Reasoning Optimization with interleaved Policy Alignment), a novel framework that integrates Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with GRPO to generate dense, process-level rewards and optimize reasoning at each intermediate step without human annotations. To overcome the cold-start problem, PROPA interleaves GRPO updates with SFT, enabling the model to learn from both successful and failed reasoning trajectories. A Process Reward Model (PRM) is further trained to guide inference-time search, aligning the test-time search with the training signal. Across seven benchmarks and four VLM backbones, PROPA consistently outperforms both SFT- and RLVR-based baselines. It achieves up to 17.0% gains on in-domain tasks and 21.0% gains on out-of-domain tasks compared to existing state-of-the-art, establishing a strong reasoning and generalization capability for visual reasoning tasks.

*Zhengtao Zou,Ya Gao,Jiarui Guan,Bin Li,Pekka Marttinen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RUDDER is a method to address object hallucination in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), reducing visual-text inconsistencies efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing models struggle with object hallucination, impacting reliability and needing computationally expensive fixes, which limits usability in real-time applications.

Method: RUDDER uses CARD vectors (visual evidence from residual updates) during a standard forward pass and an adaptive gate conditioned on the visual context for visually grounded text generation.

Result: RUDDER matches state-of-the-art performance on hallucination benchmarks (like POPE and CHAIR) while maintaining minimal computational latency.

Conclusion: RUDDER is a low-cost, practical, and effective approach to enhance LVLM reliability by mitigating hallucination issues without compromising efficiency.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) often suffer from object hallucination, generating text inconsistent with visual inputs, which can critically undermine their reliability. Existing inference-time interventions to mitigate this issue present a challenging trade-off: while methods that steer internal states or adjust output logits can be effective, they often incur substantial computational overhead, typically requiring extra forward passes. This efficiency bottleneck can limit their practicality for real-world, latency-sensitive deployments. In this work, we aim to address this trade-off with Residual-Update Directed DEcoding Regulation (RUDDER), a low-overhead framework that steers LVLMs towards visually-grounded generation. RUDDER is built on two key innovations: (1) Contextual Activation Residual Direction (CARD) vector, a per-sample visual evidence vector extracted from the residual update of a self-attention layer during a single, standard forward pass. (2) A Bayesian-inspired adaptive gate that performs token-wise injection, applying a corrective signal whose strength is conditioned on the model's deviation from the visual context. Extensive experiments on key hallucination benchmarks, including POPE and CHAIR, indicate that RUDDER achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods while introducing negligible computational latency, validating RUDDER as a pragmatic and effective approach for improving LVLMs' reliability without a significant compromise on efficiency.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces GRAM, an adaptive framework leveraging satellite imagery for efficient slum segmentation across diverse regions without needing target region labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Urban poverty estimation using satellite imagery requires robust models, but current approaches struggle with regional variability in slum morphology.

Method: GRAM employs a Mixture-of-Experts architecture on a large satellite dataset to learn region-specific characteristics and universal features while filtering unreliable labels during adaptation.

Result: GRAM delivers higher accuracy in slum segmentation across diverse regions compared to existing methods, especially in low-resource areas.

Conclusion: The study offers a scalable, label-efficient solution for slum mapping, improving urban planning and global poverty analysis.

Abstract: Satellite-based slum segmentation holds significant promise in generating global estimates of urban poverty. However, the morphological heterogeneity of informal settlements presents a major challenge, hindering the ability of models trained on specific regions to generalize effectively to unseen locations. To address this, we introduce a large-scale high-resolution dataset and propose GRAM (Generalized Region-Aware Mixture-of-Experts), a two-phase test-time adaptation framework that enables robust slum segmentation without requiring labeled data from target regions. We compile a million-scale satellite imagery dataset from 12 cities across four continents for source training. Using this dataset, the model employs a Mixture-of-Experts architecture to capture region-specific slum characteristics while learning universal features through a shared backbone. During adaptation, prediction consistency across experts filters out unreliable pseudo-labels, allowing the model to generalize effectively to previously unseen regions. GRAM outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in low-resource settings such as African cities, offering a scalable and label-efficient solution for global slum mapping and data-driven urban planning.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of LLaVA when integrating visual features due to mismatch between text and vision modalities.

Method: Proposed modifications to LLaVA include (1) learning separate QKV projections for vision, (2) enabling bidirectional attention on visual tokens, and (3) incorporating global and local visual representations.

Result: LLaViT outperforms LLaVA and larger models significantly across multiple benchmarks.

Conclusion: LLaViT provides a more effective approach for vision-language modeling, leveraging large language models as powerful vision encoders.

Abstract: Despite the remarkable success of the LLaVA architecture for vision-language tasks, its design inherently struggles to effectively integrate visual features due to the inherent mismatch between text and vision modalities. We tackle this issue from a novel perspective in which the LLM not only serves as a language model but also a powerful vision encoder. To this end, we present LLaViT - Large Language Models as extended Vision Transformers - which enables the LLM to simultaneously function as a vision encoder through three key modifications: (1) learning separate QKV projections for vision modality, (2) enabling bidirectional attention on visual tokens, and (3) incorporating both global and local visual representations. Through extensive controlled experiments on a wide range of LLMs, we demonstrate that LLaViT significantly outperforms the baseline LLaVA method on a multitude of benchmarks, even surpassing models with double its parameter count, establishing a more effective approach to vision-language modeling.

Method: Evaluating smaller VLMs (500M and 2.2B parameters) against diverse datasets using newly introduced BLV-specific frameworks and analyzing performance on smartphones under different precision settings.

Result: Novel frameworks tested effectiveness for BLV users. Smaller SmolVLM2 models with precise prompts yielded good video descriptions and worked on resource-constrained devices.

Conclusion: Smaller VLMs can effectively support accessibility needs while being deployable on mobile devices, expanding practical applications for blind and low-vision users.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel at understanding and generating video descriptions but their high memory, computation, and deployment demands hinder practical use particularly for blind and low-vision (BLV) users who depend on detailed, context-aware descriptions. To study the effect of model size on accessibility-focused description quality, we evaluate SmolVLM2 variants with 500M and 2.2B parameters across two diverse datasets: AVCaps (outdoor), and Charades (indoor). In this work, we introduce two novel evaluation frameworks specifically designed for BLV accessibility assessment: the Multi-Context BLV Framework evaluating spatial orientation, social interaction, action events, and ambience contexts; and the Navigational Assistance Framework focusing on mobility-critical information. Additionally, we conduct a systematic evaluation of four different prompt design strategies and deploy both models on a smartphone, evaluating FP32 and INT8 precision variants to assess real-world performance constraints on resource-limited mobile devices.

Motivation: To provide a more realistic performance evaluation of DNNs for pedestrian detection and address the shortcomings of current benchmarks and metrics.

Method: Introduced eight error categories for pedestrian detection and proposed new metrics for performance evaluation. Compared various backbones using a simplified APD method.

Result: Established a more robust and fine-grained evaluation methodology for comparing model performance, achieving state-of-the-art results on CityPersons-reasonable dataset.

Conclusion: The proposed approach improves safety-critical performance evaluation and sets a reliable foundation for pedestrian detection system comparisons.

Abstract: Reliable pedestrian detection represents a crucial step towards automated driving systems. However, the current performance benchmarks exhibit weaknesses. The currently applied metrics for various subsets of a validation dataset prohibit a realistic performance evaluation of a DNN for pedestrian detection. As image segmentation supplies fine-grained information about a street scene, it can serve as a starting point to automatically distinguish between different types of errors during the evaluation of a pedestrian detector. In this work, eight different error categories for pedestrian detection are proposed and new metrics are proposed for performance comparison along these error categories. We use the new metrics to compare various backbones for a simplified version of the APD, and show a more fine-grained and robust way to compare models with each other especially in terms of safety-critical performance. We achieve SOTA on CityPersons-reasonable (without extra training data) by using a rather simple architecture.

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel CLIP-driven modality-shared representation learning network named CLIP4VI-ReID for VI-ReID task, which consists of Text Semantic Generation (TSG), Infrared Feature Embedding (IFE), and High-level Semantic Alignment (HSA). Specifically, considering the huge gap in the physical characteristics between natural images and infrared images, the TSG is designed to generate text semantics only for visible images, thereby enabling preliminary visible-text modality alignment. Then, the IFE is proposed to rectify the feature embeddings of infrared images using the generated text semantics. This process injects id-related semantics into the shared image encoder, enhancing its adaptability to the infrared modality. Besides, with text serving as a bridge, it enables indirect visible-infrared modality alignment. Finally, the HSA is established to refine the high-level semantic alignment. This process ensures that the fine-tuned text semantics only contain id-related information, thereby achieving more accurate cross-modal alignment and enhancing the discriminability of the learned modal-shared representations. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed CLIP4VI-ReID achieves superior performance than other state-of-the-art methods on some widely used VI-ReID datasets.

*Yu Deng,Baozhu Zhao,Junyan Su,Xiaohan Zhang,Qi Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a computational framework to address challenges in 3D reconstruction for scenes with extreme depth variations using depth-of-field supervision and multi-view consistency supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome inconsistent supervisory signals between near and far-field regions, leading to inaccuracies in depth estimation and structural degradation.

Method: The framework employs (1) Depth-of-field Supervision using depth priors and a novel loss function; (2) Multi-View Consistency Supervision utilizing geometric errors minimization and feature matching to enforce cross-view depth consistency.

Result: The proposed method achieves a 0.8 dB improvement in PSNR compared to the state-of-the-art on the Waymo Open Dataset, demonstrating superior depth fidelity.

Conclusion: The paper bridges physical imaging principles with learning-based depth regularization, presenting a scalable approach for better depth stratification in complex urban scenes.

Abstract: Three-dimensional reconstruction in scenes with extreme depth variations remains challenging due to inconsistent supervisory signals between near-field and far-field regions. Existing methods fail to simultaneously address inaccurate depth estimation in distant areas and structural degradation in close-range regions. This paper proposes a novel computational framework that integrates depth-of-field supervision and multi-view consistency supervision to advance 3D Gaussian Splatting. Our approach comprises two core components: (1) Depth-of-field Supervision employs a scale-recovered monocular depth estimator (e.g., Metric3D) to generate depth priors, leverages defocus convolution to synthesize physically accurate defocused images, and enforces geometric consistency through a novel depth-of-field loss, thereby enhancing depth fidelity in both far-field and near-field regions; (2) Multi-View Consistency Supervision employing LoFTR-based semi-dense feature matching to minimize cross-view geometric errors and enforce depth consistency via least squares optimization of reliable matched points. By unifying defocus physics with multi-view geometric constraints, our method achieves superior depth fidelity, demonstrating a 0.8 dB PSNR improvement over the state-of-the-art method on the Waymo Open Dataset. This framework bridges physical imaging principles and learning-based depth regularization, offering a scalable solution for complex depth stratification in urban environments.

*Wenti Yin,Huaxin Zhang,Xiang Wang,Yuqing Lu,Yicheng Zhang,Bingquan Gong,Jialong Zuo,Li Yu,Changxin Gao,Nong Sang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes DSANet, which enables better anomaly detection in videos by disentangling and modeling normal and abnormal features at both coarse-grained and fine-grained levels, significantly outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome limitations of existing weakly-supervised video anomaly detection models, which often focus excessively on the most salient anomalies but fail to mine diverse normal patterns and suffer from category confusion.

Method: The paper introduces DSANet, which uses a self-guided normality modeling branch for coarse-grained separation and a decoupled contrastive semantic alignment mechanism for fine-grained separation to enhance anomaly detection.

Result: DSANet achieves superior performance compared to previous methods, as validated by experiments on XD-Violence and UCF-Crime benchmarks.

Conclusion: DSANet effectively improves video anomaly detection by disentangling normal and abnormal video features, achieving state-of-the-art results and addressing prior limitations like category confusion and limited normal pattern modeling.

Abstract: Recent advancements in weakly-supervised video anomaly detection have achieved remarkable performance by applying the multiple instance learning paradigm based on multimodal foundation models such as CLIP to highlight anomalous instances and classify categories. However, their objectives may tend to detect the most salient response segments, while neglecting to mine diverse normal patterns separated from anomalies, and are prone to category confusion due to similar appearance, leading to unsatisfactory fine-grained classification results. Therefore, we propose a novel Disentangled Semantic Alignment Network (DSANet) to explicitly separate abnormal and normal features from coarse-grained and fine-grained aspects, enhancing the distinguishability. Specifically, at the coarse-grained level, we introduce a self-guided normality modeling branch that reconstructs input video features under the guidance of learned normal prototypes, encouraging the model to exploit normality cues inherent in the video, thereby improving the temporal separation of normal patterns and anomalous events. At the fine-grained level, we present a decoupled contrastive semantic alignment mechanism, which first temporally decomposes each video into event-centric and background-centric components using frame-level anomaly scores and then applies visual-language contrastive learning to enhance class-discriminative representations. Comprehensive experiments on two standard benchmarks, namely XD-Violence and UCF-Crime, demonstrate that DSANet outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.

*Mengzhu Wang,Changyuan Deng,Shanshan Wang,Nan Yin,Long Lan,Liang Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses single domain generalization (SDG) for object detection, combining vMF distributions and Fourier transformations within a CLIP-based pipeline to enhance robustness and performance on unseen domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to improve the generalization capability of object detection models trained on a single domain, addressing limitations in current methods that disregard feature distribution and frequency-domain aspects.

Method: It integrates von Mises-Fisher (vMF) distribution to model domain-invariant directional features and employs Fourier-based augmentation to simulate domain shifts via amplitude and phase perturbations within a CLIP-guided framework.

Result: The proposed methods outperformed state-of-the-art approaches on a diverse weather-driving benchmark, demonstrating improved robustness and generalization.

Conclusion: The paper highlights the effectiveness of incorporating vMF distributions and Fourier transformations in enhancing SDG object detection, achieving both semantic and structural consistency across domains.

Abstract: Single Domain Generalization (SDG) for object detection aims to train a model on a single source domain that can generalize effectively to unseen target domains. While recent methods like CLIP-based semantic augmentation have shown promise, they often overlook the underlying structure of feature distributions and frequency-domain characteristics that are critical for robustness. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that enhances SDG object detection by integrating the von Mises-Fisher (vMF) distribution and Fourier transformation into a CLIP-guided pipeline. Specifically, we model the directional features of object representations using vMF to better capture domain-invariant semantic structures in the embedding space. Additionally, we introduce a Fourier-based augmentation strategy that perturbs amplitude and phase components to simulate domain shifts in the frequency domain, further improving feature robustness. Our method not only preserves the semantic alignment benefits of CLIP but also enriches feature diversity and structural consistency across domains. Extensive experiments on the diverse weather-driving benchmark demonstrate that our approach outperforms the existing state-of-the-art method.

Method: The authors developed a smartphone app, DermAI, which includes features such as real-time capture, annotation, quality checks, and on-device model adaptation using diverse and locally-sourced data collections.

Result: Public dataset-trained models failed on their dataset, but incorporating local data fine-tuning significantly improved model performance.

Conclusion: Diverse and standardized data collection tailored to healthcare needs is critical for effective machine learning in dermatology.

Abstract: AI-based dermatology adoption remains limited by biased datasets, variable image quality, and limited validation. We introduce DermAI, a lightweight, smartphone-based application that enables real-time capture, annotation, and classification of skin lesions during routine consultations. Unlike prior dermoscopy-focused tools, DermAI performs on-device quality checks, and local model adaptation. The DermAI clinical dataset, encompasses a wide range of skin tones, ethinicity and source devices. In preliminary experiments, models trained on public datasets failed to generalize to our samples, while fine-tuning with local data improved performance. These results highlight the importance of standardized, diverse data collection aligned with healthcare needs and oriented to machine learning development.

TL;DR: The paper introduces SHRUG-FM, a reliability-aware framework for geospatial foundation models (GFMs) that integrates multiple uncertainty signals for improved real-world reliability in burn scar segmentation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issue of geospatial foundation models performing poorly in underrepresented environments during pretraining, particularly in climate-sensitive applications.

Method: SHRUG-FM combines out-of-distribution (OOD) detection in the input and embedding spaces with task-specific predictive uncertainty to identify and flag predictions in unreliable environmental conditions.

Result: Experimental results from burn scar segmentation reveal that OOD scores correlate with lower performance in specific environments, and reliability flags discard poor predictions by linking them to geographic land cover attributes.

Conclusion: SHRUG-FM enhances the interpretability and safety of GFMs for Earth observation, highlighting its potential to improve real-world reliability, particularly in underrepresented or sensitive geographic areas.

Abstract: Geospatial foundation models for Earth observation often fail to perform reliably in environments underrepresented during pretraining. We introduce SHRUG-FM, a framework for reliability-aware prediction that integrates three complementary signals: out-of-distribution (OOD) detection in the input space, OOD detection in the embedding space and task-specific predictive uncertainty. Applied to burn scar segmentation, SHRUG-FM shows that OOD scores correlate with lower performance in specific environmental conditions, while uncertainty-based flags help discard many poorly performing predictions. Linking these flags to land cover attributes from HydroATLAS shows that failures are not random but concentrated in certain geographies, such as low-elevation zones and large river areas, likely due to underrepresentation in pretraining data. SHRUG-FM provides a pathway toward safer and more interpretable deployment of GFMs in climate-sensitive applications, helping bridge the gap between benchmark performance and real-world reliability.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Existing defenses like Anti-DreamBooth aimed at preventing facial identity leakage when using personalized AI applications are fragile and easily bypassed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address privacy risks, particularly facial identity leakage, associated with personalized AI applications such as DreamBooth.

Method: Propose a novel evaluation framework, AntiDB_Purify, to assess existing defense methods against purification threats (traditional image filters and adversarial purification).

Result: Evaluation revealed that current methods fail to sustain protection under realistic purification techniques.

Conclusion: Current defense mechanisms are inadequate, necessitating the development of more imperceptible and robust techniques for identity protection in personalized AI systems.

Abstract: Personalized AI applications such as DreamBooth enable the generation of customized content from user images, but also raise significant privacy concerns, particularly the risk of facial identity leakage. Recent defense mechanisms like Anti-DreamBooth attempt to mitigate this risk by injecting adversarial perturbations into user photos to prevent successful personalization. However, we identify two critical yet overlooked limitations of these methods. First, the adversarial examples often exhibit perceptible artifacts such as conspicuous patterns or stripes, making them easily detectable as manipulated content. Second, the perturbations are highly fragile, as even a simple, non-learned filter can effectively remove them, thereby restoring the model's ability to memorize and reproduce user identity. To investigate this vulnerability, we propose a novel evaluation framework, AntiDB_Purify, to systematically evaluate existing defenses under realistic purification threats, including both traditional image filters and adversarial purification. Results reveal that none of the current methods maintains their protective effectiveness under such threats. These findings highlight that current defenses offer a false sense of security and underscore the urgent need for more imperceptible and robust protections to safeguard user identity in personalized generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenges of lane detection in real-world scenarios like illumination changes, clutter, and limited annotated data by effectively using contextual and global information.

Method: A plug-and-play approach called SAMIRO, which uses spatial attention and mutual information regularization with a pre-trained model to enhance lane detection capabilities.

Result: SAMIRO shows consistent performance improvements across various state-of-the-art lane detection methods on benchmarks like CULane, Tusimple, and LLAMAS.

Conclusion: SAMIRO is a versatile and effective framework for improving lane detection tasks, with benefits validated through extensive experimentation.

Abstract: Lane detection is an important topic in the future mobility solutions. Real-world environmental challenges such as background clutter, varying illumination, and occlusions pose significant obstacles to effective lane detection, particularly when relying on data-driven approaches that require substantial effort and cost for data collection and annotation. To address these issues, lane detection methods must leverage contextual and global information from surrounding lanes and objects. In this paper, we propose a Spatial Attention Mutual Information Regularization with a pre-trained model as an Oracle, called SAMIRO. SAMIRO enhances lane detection performance by transferring knowledge from a pretrained model while preserving domain-agnostic spatial information. Leveraging SAMIRO's plug-and-play characteristic, we integrate it into various state-of-the-art lane detection approaches and conduct extensive experiments on major benchmarks such as CULane, Tusimple, and LLAMAS. The results demonstrate that SAMIRO consistently improves performance across different models and datasets. The code will be made available upon publication.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the estimation of vegetation biophysical variables from satellite data for monitoring ecosystems and agriculture, while reducing reliance on in-situ labels or real imagery for training.

Method: A physics-informed Transformer-VAE architecture is used to invert the PROSAIL radiative transfer model. The model leverages simulated data and incorporates the PROSAIL model as a physical decoder for physically plausible parameter retrieval.

Result: The model estimates leaf area index (LAI) and canopy chlorophyll content (CCC) with accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art models trained on real data, as validated using field datasets (FRM4Veg and BelSAR).

Conclusion: Integrating physical models with deep learning techniques enables cost-effective, large-scale, self-supervised vegetation monitoring, eliminating the need for real imagery or in-situ calibration.

Abstract: Accurate retrieval of vegetation biophysical variables from satellite imagery is crucial for ecosystem monitoring and agricultural management. In this work, we propose a physics-informed Transformer-VAE architecture to invert the PROSAIL radiative transfer model for simultaneous estimation of key canopy parameters from Sentinel-2 data. Unlike previous hybrid approaches that require real satellite images for self-supevised training. Our model is trained exclusively on simulated data, yet achieves performance on par with state-of-the-art methods that utilize real imagery. The Transformer-VAE incorporates the PROSAIL model as a differentiable physical decoder, ensuring that inferred latent variables correspond to physically plausible leaf and canopy properties. We demonstrate retrieval of leaf area index (LAI) and canopy chlorophyll content (CCC) on real-world field datasets (FRM4Veg and BelSAR) with accuracy comparable to models trained with real Sentinel-2 data. Our method requires no in-situ labels or calibration on real images, offering a cost-effective and self-supervised solution for global vegetation monitoring. The proposed approach illustrates how integrating physical models with advanced deep networks can improve the inversion of RTMs, opening new prospects for large-scale, physically-constrained remote sensing of vegetation traits.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MonkeyOCR v1.5 improves document parsing by tackling complex layouts, combining a two-stage parsing pipeline with advanced table parsing techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current OCR systems struggle with real-world documents featuring intricate layouts, such as multi-level tables and embedded visuals, necessitating a more robust approach.

Method: The framework uses a two-stage parsing pipeline, integrating a multimodal model for layout and sequential content understanding, alongside localized text recognition. Added innovations include reinforcement learning for table parsing and specialized modules for tables with images or cross-page structures.

Result: MonkeyOCR v1.5 achieves state-of-the-art performance on OmniDocBench v1.5, surpassing existing systems like PPOCR-VL and MinerU 2.5 with improved accuracy and robustness.

Conclusion: MonkeyOCR v1.5 effectively addresses challenges in parsing visually complex documents, combining advanced techniques to enhance both structural and content recognition.

Abstract: Document parsing is a core task in document intelligence, supporting applications such as information extraction, retrieval-augmented generation, and automated document analysis. However, real-world documents often feature complex layouts with multi-level tables, embedded images or formulas, and cross-page structures, which remain challenging for existing OCR systems. We introduce MonkeyOCR v1.5, a unified vision-language framework that enhances both layout understanding and content recognition through a two-stage parsing pipeline. The first stage employs a large multimodal model to jointly predict document layout and reading order, leveraging visual information to ensure structural and sequential consistency. The second stage performs localized recognition of text, formulas, and tables within detected regions, maintaining high visual fidelity while reducing error propagation. To address complex table structures, we propose a visual consistency-based reinforcement learning scheme that evaluates recognition quality via render-and-compare alignment, improving structural accuracy without manual annotations. Additionally, two specialized modules, Image-Decoupled Table Parsing and Type-Guided Table Merging, are introduced to enable reliable parsing of tables containing embedded images and reconstruction of tables crossing pages or columns. Comprehensive experiments on OmniDocBench v1.5 demonstrate that MonkeyOCR v1.5 achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming PPOCR-VL and MinerU 2.5 while showing exceptional robustness in visually complex document scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel diffusion-based framework called GrounDiff for generating Digital Terrain Models (DTMs) from Digital Surface Models (DSMs), outperforming existing methods in accuracy and scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this paper is to address the limitations of traditional filtering and learning-based methods for generating DTMs, such as reliance on manual parameter tuning or complex architectures requiring post-processing.

Method: The proposed method, GrounDiff, formulates the DTM generation as a denoising task using a gated design with confidence-guided generation for selective filtering. The scalability is enhanced by Prior-Guided Stitching (PrioStitch), which uses a global prior to guide high-resolution predictions.

Result: GrounDiff significantly improves accuracy, reducing RMSE by up to 93% on ALS2DTM and up to 47% on USGS benchmarks. In road reconstruction tasks, its variant GrounDiff+ reduces distance error by up to 81% and achieves smooth surfaces competitively.

Conclusion: This framework establishes a new benchmark for DTM generation and road reconstruction. GrounDiff effectively outperforms state-of-the-art methods in precision, scalability, and versatility, proving its potential for diverse geospatial applications.

Abstract: Digital Terrain Models (DTMs) represent the bare-earth elevation and are important in numerous geospatial applications. Such data models cannot be directly measured by sensors and are typically generated from Digital Surface Models (DSMs) derived from LiDAR or photogrammetry. Traditional filtering approaches rely on manually tuned parameters, while learning-based methods require well-designed architectures, often combined with post-processing. To address these challenges, we introduce Ground Diffusion (GrounDiff), the first diffusion-based framework that iteratively removes non-ground structures by formulating the problem as a denoising task. We incorporate a gated design with confidence-guided generation that enables selective filtering. To increase scalability, we further propose Prior-Guided Stitching (PrioStitch), which employs a downsampled global prior automatically generated using GrounDiff to guide local high-resolution predictions. We evaluate our method on the DSM-to-DTM translation task across diverse datasets, showing that GrounDiff consistently outperforms deep learning-based state-of-the-art methods, reducing RMSE by up to 93% on ALS2DTM and up to 47% on USGS benchmarks. In the task of road reconstruction, which requires both high precision and smoothness, our method achieves up to 81% lower distance error compared to specialized techniques on the GeRoD benchmark, while maintaining competitive surface smoothness using only DSM inputs, without task-specific optimization. Our variant for road reconstruction, GrounDiff+, is specifically designed to produce even smoother surfaces, further surpassing state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: The study presents an advanced framework combining YOLOMS and a large language model (LLM) to enhance fault detection, interpretation, and maintenance decision-making in wind turbines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the limitations of existing fault detection methods, which rely heavily on visual recognition, lack semantic interpretability, and do not support effective maintenance decision-making.

Method: The framework integrates YOLOMS for fault detection using multi-scale analysis and sliding-window cropping, alongside a key-value mapping module for converting visual outputs into textual data. This is further analyzed by a domain-tuned LLM for semantic reasoning.

Result: The proposed framework achieved a 90.6% fault detection accuracy and 89% average accuracy in generating maintenance reports based on real-world dataset experiments.

Conclusion: The framework improves the interpretability of diagnostic results and offers practical decision-making support for wind turbine maintenance operations.

Abstract: The health condition of wind turbine (WT) components is crucial for ensuring stable and reliable operation. However, existing fault detection methods are largely limited to visual recognition, producing structured outputs that lack semantic interpretability and fail to support maintenance decision-making. To address these limitations, this study proposes an integrated framework that combines YOLOMS with a large language model (LLM) for intelligent fault analysis and diagnosis. Specifically, YOLOMS employs multi-scale detection and sliding-window cropping to enhance fault feature extraction, while a lightweight key-value (KV) mapping module bridges the gap between visual outputs and textual inputs. This module converts YOLOMS detection results into structured textual representations enriched with both qualitative and quantitative attributes. A domain-tuned LLM then performs semantic reasoning to generate interpretable fault analyses and maintenance recommendations. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves a fault detection accuracy of 90.6\% and generates maintenance reports with an average accuracy of 89\%, thereby improving the interpretability of diagnostic results and providing practical decision support for the operation and maintenance of wind turbines.

Conclusion: GT++ and 3DFETUS advance the automation and standardization of facial plane localization in fetal ultrasounds, reducing errors and enhancing clinical reliability.

Abstract: Acquiring standard facial planes during routine fetal ultrasound (US) examinations is often challenging due to fetal movement, variability in orientation, and operator-dependent expertise. These factors contribute to inconsistencies, increased examination time, and potential diagnostic bias.
  To address these challenges in the context of facial assessment, we present: 1) GT++, a robust algorithm that estimates standard facial planes from 3D US volumes using annotated anatomical landmarks; and 2) 3DFETUS, a deep learning model that automates and standardizes their localization in 3D fetal US volumes.
  We evaluated our methods both qualitatively, through expert clinical review, and quantitatively. The proposed approach achieved a mean translation error of 4.13 mm and a mean rotation error of 7.93 degrees per plane, outperforming other state-of-the-art methods on 3D US volumes. Clinical assessments further confirmed the effectiveness of both GT++ and 3DFETUS, demonstrating statistically significant improvements in plane estimation accuracy.

Motivation: To provide a reliable dataset and baseline for automatic detection of rodent seizure activity using video data to support epilepsy research.

Method: The study introduces a video dataset (RodEpil) with videos labeled as normal or seizure activity, applies preprocessing, and evaluates a transformer-based video classifier (TimeSformer) using five-fold subject-wise cross-validation.

Result: The TimeSformer classifier achieved an average F1-score of 97% for distinguishing between seizure and normal activity in rodents.

Conclusion: The dataset and baseline model offer a reproducible foundation for video-based, non-invasive monitoring in preclinical epilepsy research.

Abstract: We introduce a curated video dataset of laboratory rodents for automatic detection of convulsive events. The dataset contains short (10~s) top-down and side-view video clips of individual rodents, labeled at clip level as normal activity or seizure. It includes 10,101 negative samples and 2,952 positive samples collected from 19 subjects. We describe the data curation, annotation protocol and preprocessing pipeline, and report baseline experiments using a transformer-based video classifier (TimeSformer). Experiments employ five-fold cross-validation with strict subject-wise partitioning to prevent data leakage (no subject appears in more than one fold). Results show that the TimeSformer architecture enables discrimination between seizure and normal activity with an average F1-score of 97%.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method, histology-informed tiling (HIT), which improves cancer detection and interpretability by focusing on biologically meaningful structures in histological images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current digital pathology methods use grid-based tiling, which ignores tissue architecture, introduces irrelevant information, and reduces interpretability.

Method: HIT uses semantic segmentation to extract glands from whole slide images (WSIs) for multiple-instance learning (MIL) and phenotyping.

Result: HIT achieved a Dice score of 0.83 on gland segmentation and improved MIL models' accuracy by 10% for gene-related CNV detection. It also identified gland clusters linked to cancer relapse and mutations.

Conclusion: HIT enhances the accuracy and interpretability of cancer predictions while reducing computation by emphasizing biologically meaningful structures.

Abstract: Histopathologists establish cancer grade by assessing histological structures, such as glands in prostate cancer. Yet, digital pathology pipelines often rely on grid-based tiling that ignores tissue architecture. This introduces irrelevant information and limits interpretability. We introduce histology-informed tiling (HIT), which uses semantic segmentation to extract glands from whole slide images (WSIs) as biologically meaningful input patches for multiple-instance learning (MIL) and phenotyping. Trained on 137 samples from the ProMPT cohort, HIT achieved a gland-level Dice score of 0.83 +/- 0.17. By extracting 380,000 glands from 760 WSIs across ICGC-C and TCGA-PRAD cohorts, HIT improved MIL models AUCs by 10% for detecting copy number variation (CNVs) in genes related to epithelial-mesenchymal transitions (EMT) and MYC, and revealed 15 gland clusters, several of which were associated with cancer relapse, oncogenic mutations, and high Gleason. Therefore, HIT improved the accuracy and interpretability of MIL predictions, while streamlining computations by focussing on biologically meaningful structures during feature extraction.

Motivation: To reduce entry barriers for researchers and practitioners in experimenting, comparing, and deploying GAN-based super-resolution models in Earth Observation.

Method: Developing a modular software framework exposing configuration files for generators, discriminators, loss functions, and training setups to simplify configuration-driven workflows.

Result: The framework provides ready-to-use configurations, default adversarial training settings, validation hooks, and inference tools for Earth-observation data.

Conclusion: OpenSR-SRGAN facilitates simplified workflows for experimenting with and deploying GAN-based super-resolution for Earth-observations, enhancing reproducibility and accessibility.

Abstract: We present OpenSR-SRGAN, an open and modular framework for single-image super-resolution in Earth Observation. The software provides a unified implementation of SRGAN-style models that is easy to configure, extend, and apply to multispectral satellite data such as Sentinel-2. Instead of requiring users to modify model code, OpenSR-SRGAN exposes generators, discriminators, loss functions, and training schedules through concise configuration files, making it straightforward to switch between architectures, scale factors, and band setups. The framework is designed as a practical tool and benchmark implementation rather than a state-of-the-art model. It ships with ready-to-use configurations for common remote sensing scenarios, sensible default settings for adversarial training, and built-in hooks for logging, validation, and large-scene inference. By turning GAN-based super-resolution into a configuration-driven workflow, OpenSR-SRGAN lowers the entry barrier for researchers and practitioners who wish to experiment with SRGANs, compare models in a reproducible way, and deploy super-resolution pipelines across diverse Earth-observation datasets.

*Tejas Sudharshan Mathai,Anisa V. Prasad,Xinya Wang,Praveen T. S. Balamuralikrishna,Yan Zhuang,Abhinav Suri,Jianfei Liu,Perry J. Pickhardt,Ronald M. Summers*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces an automated deep learning approach to detect Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) by analyzing pancreas morphology and CT biomarkers, focusing on Pancreatic Surface Lobularity (PSL).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: T2DM affects pancreas morphology and ectopic fat deposition, leading to organ damage. Current understanding of pancreatic surface lobularity's role in T2DM is limited.

Method: The study used four deep learning models to segment pancreas CT images from 584 patients. PSL was calculated and correlated with T2DM status. A multivariate model predicted T2DM using CT biomarkers.

Result: PSL detection demonstrated higher values in diabetic patients (p=0.01). The PancAP model showed promising segmentation accuracy (Dice score 0.79). T2DM prediction achieved 0.9 AUC, 66.7% sensitivity, and 91.9% specificity.

Conclusion: PSL is a significant biomarker for T2DM screening and may assist in early detection, promoting timely medical interventions.

Abstract: Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) is a chronic metabolic disease that affects millions of people worldwide. Early detection is crucial as it can alter pancreas function through morphological changes and increased deposition of ectopic fat, eventually leading to organ damage. While studies have shown an association between T2DM and pancreas volume and fat content, the role of increased pancreatic surface lobularity (PSL) in patients with T2DM has not been fully investigated. In this pilot work, we propose a fully automated approach to delineate the pancreas and other abdominal structures, derive CT imaging biomarkers, and opportunistically screen for T2DM. Four deep learning-based models were used to segment the pancreas in an internal dataset of 584 patients (297 males, 437 non-diabetic, age: 45$\pm$15 years). PSL was automatically detected and it was higher for diabetic patients (p=0.01) at 4.26 $\pm$ 8.32 compared to 3.19 $\pm$ 3.62 for non-diabetic patients. The PancAP model achieved the highest Dice score of 0.79 $\pm$ 0.17 and lowest ASSD error of 1.94 $\pm$ 2.63 mm (p$<$0.05). For predicting T2DM, a multivariate model trained with CT biomarkers attained 0.90 AUC, 66.7\% sensitivity, and 91.9\% specificity. Our results suggest that PSL is useful for T2DM screening and could potentially help predict the early onset of T2DM.

*Oded Schlesinger,Amirhossein Farzam,J. Matias Di Martino,Guillermo Sapiro*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SPOT, a framework to identify and remove redundant tokens in Vision Transformers (ViTs) for improved efficiency without compromising accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To alleviate the computational demands of Vision Transformers by reducing less important tokens early in the processing pipeline, thereby optimizing resource utilization.

Method: SPOT uses token embeddings, interactions, and attention dynamics across layers for token importance assessment and employs computationally efficient predictors compatible with various ViT architectures.

Result: SPOT achieves up to 40% computational efficiency improvements while maintaining or enhancing accuracy.

Conclusion: SPOT provides an adaptable and efficient solution for token sparsification in Vision Transformers, enhancing their practicality for resource-constrained scenarios.

Abstract: While Vision Transformers (ViT) have demonstrated remarkable performance across diverse tasks, their computational demands are substantial, scaling quadratically with the number of processed tokens. Compact attention representations, reflecting token interaction distributions, can guide early detection and reduction of less salient tokens prior to attention computation. Motivated by this, we present SParsification with attentiOn dynamics via Token relevance (SPOT), a framework for early detection of redundant tokens within ViTs that leverages token embeddings, interactions, and attention dynamics across layers to infer token importance, resulting in a more context-aware and interpretable relevance detection process. SPOT informs token sparsification and facilitates the elimination of such tokens, improving computational efficiency without sacrificing performance. SPOT employs computationally lightweight predictors that can be plugged into various ViT architectures and learn to derive effective input-specific token prioritization across layers. Its versatile design supports a range of performance levels adaptable to varying resource constraints. Empirical evaluations demonstrate significant efficiency gains of up to 40% compared to standard ViTs, while maintaining or even improving accuracy.

### [225] [Learnable Total Variation with Lambda Mapping for Low-Dose CT Denoising](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10500)
*Yusuf Talha Basak,Mehmet Ozan Unal,Metin Ertas,Isa Yildirim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a Learnable Total Variation (LTV) framework incorporating deep learning to improve image reconstruction by spatially adaptive smoothing, overcoming traditional TV's limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional Total Variation (TV) methods excel at noise reduction and edge preservation in images but are limited by their dependency on the lambda parameter, making their application challenging and less efficient.

Method: The authors propose an LTV framework combining an unrolled TV solver with a data-driven Lambda Mapping Network (LambdaNet), which predicts a per-pixel regularization map. It is trained end-to-end for jointly optimizing reconstruction and regularization.

Result: On the DeepLesion dataset using a realistic noise model, LTV demonstrated significant performance gains over classical TV and FBP+U-Net with +2.9 dB PSNR and +6% SSIM on average.

Conclusion: LTV is an interpretable, effective reconstruction approach that leverages spatially adaptive smoothing and establishes a foundation for 3D and data-consistency-driven reconstruction.

Abstract: Although Total Variation (TV) performs well in noise reduction and edge preservation on images, its dependence on the lambda parameter limits its efficiency and makes it difficult to use effectively. In this study, we present a Learnable Total Variation (LTV) framework that couples an unrolled TV solver with a data-driven Lambda Mapping Network (LambdaNet) predicting a per-pixel regularization map. The pipeline is trained end-to-end so that reconstruction and regularization are optimized jointly, yielding spatially adaptive smoothing: strong in homogeneous regions, relaxed near anatomical boundaries. Experiments on the DeepLesion dataset, using a realistic noise model adapted from the LoDoPaB-CT methodology, show consistent gains over classical TV and FBP+U-Net: +2.9 dB PSNR and +6% SSIM on average. LTV provides an interpretable alternative to black-box CNNs and a basis for 3D and data-consistency-driven reconstruction. Our codes are available at: https://github.com/itu-biai/deep_tv_for_ldct

*Wenqing Wang,Haosen Yang,Josef Kittler,Xiatian Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method called Separate-then-Map (StM) to improve 4D neural rendering for humans interacting with environments from monocular videos. It avoids drawbacks of existing approaches by ensuring spatial coherence and visual quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods either neglect the different motion characteristics of separate scene components or fail to enable proper interaction between them, leading to spatial inconsistencies and artifacts.

Method: The authors present the Separate-then-Map (StM) strategy which uses a shared transformation function to link and unify separately modeled human and environmental components, optimizing computational efficiency while ensuring consistency.

Result: The StM approach demonstrates significant improvement in visual quality and rendering accuracy, particularly at challenging human-environment interaction regions, when tested on monocular video datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed StM method addresses the limitations of prior techniques and shows promise for more accurate and coherent 4D neural rendering of dynamic human-environment interactions.

Abstract: Reconstructing dynamic humans interacting with real-world environments from monocular videos is an important and challenging task. Despite considerable progress in 4D neural rendering, existing approaches either model dynamic scenes holistically or model scenes and backgrounds separately aim to introduce parametric human priors. However, these approaches either neglect distinct motion characteristics of various components in scene especially human, leading to incomplete reconstructions, or ignore the information exchange between the separately modeled components, resulting in spatial inconsistencies and visual artifacts at human-scene boundaries. To address this, we propose {\bf Separate-then-Map} (StM) strategy that introduces a dedicated information mapping mechanism to bridge separately defined and optimized models. Our method employs a shared transformation function for each Gaussian attribute to unify separately modeled components, enhancing computational efficiency by avoiding exhaustive pairwise interactions while ensuring spatial and visual coherence between humans and their surroundings. Extensive experiments on monocular video datasets demonstrate that StM significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in both visual quality and rendering accuracy, particularly at challenging human-scene interaction boundaries.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses the lack of diversity in text-to-image (T2I) models and proposes a framework for systematically evaluating and improving diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve diversity in T2I models, which are currently prone to generating homogeneous and repetitive outputs, and to develop a robust evaluation method.

Method: The authors introduce a framework that includes a human evaluation template, a curated diverse prompt set, and a statistical methodology using binomial tests to evaluate diversity in T2I models. Additionally, they analyze different image embeddings for diversity measurement.

Result: The framework allows for model ranking based on diversity and identifies specific areas where current T2I models struggle to generate diverse outputs.

Conclusion: The study provides a new methodology to evaluate and improve diversity in T2I models, offering actionable insights and paving the way for advancements in this area.

Abstract: Despite advances in generation quality, current text-to-image (T2I) models often lack diversity, generating homogeneous outputs. This work introduces a framework to address the need for robust diversity evaluation in T2I models. Our framework systematically assesses diversity by evaluating individual concepts and their relevant factors of variation. Key contributions include: (1) a novel human evaluation template for nuanced diversity assessment; (2) a curated prompt set covering diverse concepts with their identified factors of variation (e.g. prompt: An image of an apple, factor of variation: color); and (3) a methodology for comparing models in terms of human annotations via binomial tests.
  Furthermore, we rigorously compare various image embeddings for diversity measurement. Notably, our principled approach enables ranking of T2I models by diversity, identifying categories where they particularly struggle. This research offers a robust methodology and insights, paving the way for improvements in T2I model diversity and metric development.

### [228] [A Style is Worth One Code: Unlocking Code-to-Style Image Generation with Discrete Style Space](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10555)
*Huijie Liu,Shuhao Cui,Haoxiang Cao,Shuai Ma,Kai Wu,Guoliang Kang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces CoTyle, a novel method for code-to-style image generation using numerical style codes to create consistent and unique visual styles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenges of style consistency, limited creativity, and complex style representations in existing methods for artistic visual stylization.

Method: The authors present CoTyle, which involves training a discrete style codebook from image data to extract style embeddings. These embeddings are used with a text-to-image diffusion model (T2I-DM), and an autoregressive style generator is trained to create novel style embeddings for image generation.

Result: CoTyle can generate images in consistent styles controlled by numerical codes, offering simplicity and high diversity in style representation.

Conclusion: CoTyle demonstrates the feasibility of using numerical codes for stylistic control, providing a new direction for artistic image generation with improved simplicity and diversity.

Abstract: Innovative visual stylization is a cornerstone of artistic creation, yet generating novel and consistent visual styles remains a significant challenge. Existing generative approaches typically rely on lengthy textual prompts, reference images, or parameter-efficient fine-tuning to guide style-aware image generation, but often struggle with style consistency, limited creativity, and complex style representations. In this paper, we affirm that a style is worth one numerical code by introducing the novel task, code-to-style image generation, which produces images with novel, consistent visual styles conditioned solely on a numerical style code. To date, this field has only been primarily explored by the industry (e.g., Midjourney), with no open-source research from the academic community. To fill this gap, we propose CoTyle, the first open-source method for this task. Specifically, we first train a discrete style codebook from a collection of images to extract style embeddings. These embeddings serve as conditions for a text-to-image diffusion model (T2I-DM) to generate stylistic images. Subsequently, we train an autoregressive style generator on the discrete style embeddings to model their distribution, allowing the synthesis of novel style embeddings. During inference, a numerical style code is mapped to a unique style embedding by the style generator, and this embedding guides the T2I-DM to generate images in the corresponding style. Unlike existing methods, our method offers unparalleled simplicity and diversity, unlocking a vast space of reproducible styles from minimal input. Extensive experiments validate that CoTyle effectively turns a numerical code into a style controller, demonstrating a style is worth one code.

*Haosong Peng,Hao Li,Yalun Dai,Yushi Lan,Yihang Luo,Tianyu Qi,Zhengshen Zhang,Yufeng Zhan,Junfei Zhang,Wenchao Xu,Ziwei Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OmniVGGT is a 3D foundation model framework that incorporates auxiliary geometric cues (like depth and camera parameters) for better performance in diverse vision tasks, supporting both RGB-only and multi-modal input.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D foundation models focus primarily on RGB inputs and overlook auxiliary geometric information, limiting task performance and versatility.

Method: OmniVGGT introduces a GeoAdapter for integrating geometric cues into a spatial foundation model using zero-initialized convolutions and employs a stochastic multimodal fusion strategy to manage multiple input modalities dynamically.

Result: OmniVGGT surpasses previous approaches in depth estimation, multi-view stereo, and camera pose tasks; achieves state-of-the-art results even with RGB-only input; and improves robotic task performance within vision-language-action models.

Conclusion: OmniVGGT demonstrates the effectiveness of leveraging auxiliary geometric inputs flexibly in training and inference while maintaining high performance and robustness across tasks.

Abstract: General 3D foundation models have started to lead the trend of unifying diverse vision tasks, yet most assume RGB-only inputs and ignore readily available geometric cues (e.g., camera intrinsics, poses, and depth maps). To address this issue, we introduce OmniVGGT, a novel framework that can effectively benefit from an arbitrary number of auxiliary geometric modalities during both training and inference. In our framework, a GeoAdapter is proposed to encode depth and camera intrinsics/extrinsics into a spatial foundation model. It employs zero-initialized convolutions to progressively inject geometric information without disrupting the foundation model's representation space. This design ensures stable optimization with negligible overhead, maintaining inference speed comparable to VGGT even with multiple additional inputs. Additionally, a stochastic multimodal fusion regimen is proposed, which randomly samples modality subsets per instance during training. This enables an arbitrary number of modality inputs during testing and promotes learning robust spatial representations instead of overfitting to auxiliary cues. Comprehensive experiments on monocular/multi-view depth estimation, multi-view stereo, and camera pose estimation demonstrate that OmniVGGT outperforms prior methods with auxiliary inputs and achieves state-of-the-art results even with RGB-only input. To further highlight its practical utility, we integrated OmniVGGT into vision-language-action (VLA) models. The enhanced VLA model by OmniVGGT not only outperforms the vanilla point-cloud-based baseline on mainstream benchmarks, but also effectively leverages accessible auxiliary inputs to achieve consistent gains on robotic tasks.

*Yen Nhi Truong Vu,Dan Guo,Sripad Joshi,Harshit Kumar,Jason Su,Thomas Paul Matthews*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes M&M-3D, a deep learning model designed to utilize 3D reasoning for Digital Breast Tomosynthesis (DBT) without requiring additional parameters, achieving superior performance in both low-data and high-data settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Limited annotated data in DBT hinders the development of deep learning models for breast cancer detection. Existing approaches either discard volumetric information or require complex architectures that demand extensive training data.

Method: M&M-3D constructs malignancy-guided 3D features, learns 3D reasoning by mixing these features with slice-level information, and modifies operations from its predecessor M&M without increasing parameters, enabling direct model transfer from FFDM.

Result: M&M-3D significantly outperforms 2D projection, 3D slice-based methods, and complex 3D reasoning approaches in both localization and classification tasks, particularly excelling in low-data scenarios, and achieves a new state-of-the-art performance on the BCS-DBT benchmark.

Conclusion: M&M-3D effectively addresses drawbacks of existing methods by enabling parameter-free 3D reasoning while leveraging FFDM models, making it a robust solution for DBT analysis with limited training data.

Abstract: Digital Breast Tomosynthesis (DBT) enhances finding visibility for breast cancer detection by providing volumetric information that reduces the impact of overlapping tissues; however, limited annotated data has constrained the development of deep learning models for DBT. To address data scarcity, existing methods attempt to reuse 2D full-field digital mammography (FFDM) models by either flattening DBT volumes or processing slices individually, thus discarding volumetric information. Alternatively, 3D reasoning approaches introduce complex architectures that require more DBT training data. Tackling these drawbacks, we propose M&M-3D, an architecture that enables learnable 3D reasoning while remaining parameter-free relative to its FFDM counterpart, M&M. M&M-3D constructs malignancy-guided 3D features, and 3D reasoning is learned through repeatedly mixing these 3D features with slice-level information. This is achieved by modifying operations in M&M without adding parameters, thus enabling direct weight transfer from FFDM. Extensive experiments show that M&M-3D surpasses 2D projection and 3D slice-based methods by 11-54% for localization and 3-10% for classification. Additionally, M&M-3D outperforms complex 3D reasoning variants by 20-47% for localization and 2-10% for classification in the low-data regime, while matching their performance in high-data regime. On the popular BCS-DBT benchmark, M&M-3D outperforms previous top baseline by 4% for classification and 10% for localization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address challenges in Sentinel-2 LULC classification, such as spatial heterogeneity, contextual lack, and signature ambiguity, vital for environmental monitoring.

Method: The MSOM method combines OBIA-Mamba for efficient superpixel analysis, a GLocal dual-branch CNN for spatial and contextual modeling, and multitask optimization with dual loss functions.

Result: MSOM demonstrated higher classification accuracy and finer LULC details than other advanced methods when tested on Sentinel-2 imagery from Alberta, Canada.

Conclusion: The paper confirms that MSOM effectively improves Sentinel-2 classification abilities, maintaining detail and precision while overcoming critical challenges in LULC analysis.

Abstract: Although Sentinel-2 based land use and land cover (LULC) classification is critical for various environmental monitoring applications, it is a very difficult task due to some key data challenges (e.g., spatial heterogeneity, context information, signature ambiguity). This paper presents a novel Multitask Glocal OBIA-Mamba (MSOM) for enhanced Sentinel-2 classification with the following contributions. First, an object-based image analysis (OBIA) Mamba model (OBIA-Mamba) is designed to reduce redundant computation without compromising fine-grained details by using superpixels as Mamba tokens. Second, a global-local (GLocal) dual-branch convolutional neural network (CNN)-mamba architecture is designed to jointly model local spatial detail and global contextual information. Third, a multitask optimization framework is designed to employ dual loss functions to balance local precision with global consistency. The proposed approach is tested on Sentinel-2 imagery in Alberta, Canada, in comparison with several advanced classification approaches, and the results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves higher classification accuracy and finer details that the other state-of-the-art methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Latent Upscaler Adapter (LUA), a module that enhances high-resolution image generation in diffusion models directly in latent space, significantly reducing time and artifacts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scalable high-resolution image synthesis in diffusion models faces challenges due to either slow direct generation methods or artifact-prone post-hoc image super-resolution (ISR).

Method: The proposed Latent Upscaler Adapter (LUA) performs super-resolution on latent codes and integrates seamlessly into diffusion models using a Swin-style backbone with scale-specific pixel-shuffle heads.

Result: LUA achieves comparable perceptual quality to traditional pixel-space SR, but with nearly 3x faster decoding and upscaling time (e.g., adding only +0.42 seconds for a 1024 px image).

Conclusion: LUA offers a robust, efficient, and generalizable solution for scalable high-resolution image synthesis, aligning closely with native high-res diffusion model outputs while improving speed and usability.

Abstract: Diffusion models struggle to scale beyond their training resolutions, as direct high-resolution sampling is slow and costly, while post-hoc image super-resolution (ISR) introduces artifacts and additional latency by operating after decoding. We present the Latent Upscaler Adapter (LUA), a lightweight module that performs super-resolution directly on the generator's latent code before the final VAE decoding step. LUA integrates as a drop-in component, requiring no modifications to the base model or additional diffusion stages, and enables high-resolution synthesis through a single feed-forward pass in latent space. A shared Swin-style backbone with scale-specific pixel-shuffle heads supports 2x and 4x factors and remains compatible with image-space SR baselines, achieving comparable perceptual quality with nearly 3x lower decoding and upscaling time (adding only +0.42 s for 1024 px generation from 512 px, compared to 1.87 s for pixel-space SR using the same SwinIR architecture). Furthermore, LUA shows strong generalization across the latent spaces of different VAEs, making it easy to deploy without retraining from scratch for each new decoder. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LUA closely matches the fidelity of native high-resolution generation while offering a practical and efficient path to scalable, high-fidelity image synthesis in modern diffusion pipelines.

TL;DR: DA3 achieves state-of-the-art geometry predictions using minimal modeling with a plain transformer backbone and surpasses previous benchmarks in visual geometry accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a model that predicts consistent visual geometry from multiple inputs without requiring complex architectural designs or multi-task learning.

Method: DA3 uses a plain transformer as its backbone and a singular depth-ray prediction target, trained through a teacher-student paradigm only on public academic datasets.

Result: DA3 sets new benchmarks in visual geometry tasks, surpassing VGGT by 44.3% in camera pose accuracy and 25.1% in geometric accuracy. It performs better than DA2 in monocular depth estimation.

Conclusion: The model demonstrates that minimalistic architectural choices can achieve high levels of detail and generalization, advancing the state-of-the-art in visual geometry tasks.

Abstract: We present Depth Anything 3 (DA3), a model that predicts spatially consistent geometry from an arbitrary number of visual inputs, with or without known camera poses. In pursuit of minimal modeling, DA3 yields two key insights: a single plain transformer (e.g., vanilla DINO encoder) is sufficient as a backbone without architectural specialization, and a singular depth-ray prediction target obviates the need for complex multi-task learning. Through our teacher-student training paradigm, the model achieves a level of detail and generalization on par with Depth Anything 2 (DA2). We establish a new visual geometry benchmark covering camera pose estimation, any-view geometry and visual rendering. On this benchmark, DA3 sets a new state-of-the-art across all tasks, surpassing prior SOTA VGGT by an average of 44.3% in camera pose accuracy and 25.1% in geometric accuracy. Moreover, it outperforms DA2 in monocular depth estimation. All models are trained exclusively on public academic datasets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses unfaithful reasoning in outcome-reward reinforcement learning for multimodal large language models through Self-Consistency Sampling (SCS), which improves multimodal reasoning accuracy with negligible extra computation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from a significant issue in outcome-reward RL for MLLMs in multiple-choice settings: unfaithful reasoning trajectories that guess correct answers without proper reasoning are rewarded similarly, hindering model improvement.

Method: The authors propose Self-Consistency Sampling (SCS), which introduces visual perturbations and iterative trajectory truncation and resampling to derive a consistency score. This score down-weights unfaithful reasoning traces during policy updates.

Result: Integrating SCS with RLOO, GRPO, and REINFORCE++ series demonstrated up to a 7.7 percentage point accuracy improvement across six multimodal benchmarks. The method also showed gains in Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct and InternVL3-8B models.

Conclusion: SCS offers an effective and computationally efficient solution to mitigate unfaithful reasoning in outcome-reward reinforcement learning for MLLMs, enhancing their reasoning accuracy and robustness.

Abstract: Outcome-reward reinforcement learning (RL) is a common and increasingly significant way to refine the step-by-step reasoning of multimodal large language models (MLLMs). In the multiple-choice setting - a dominant format for multimodal reasoning benchmarks - the paradigm faces a significant yet often overlooked obstacle: unfaithful trajectories that guess the correct option after a faulty chain of thought receive the same reward as genuine reasoning, which is a flaw that cannot be ignored. We propose Self-Consistency Sampling (SCS) to correct this issue. For each question, SCS (i) introduces small visual perturbations and (ii) performs repeated truncation and resampling of an initial trajectory; agreement among the resulting trajectories yields a differentiable consistency score that down-weights unreliable traces during policy updates. Based on Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct, plugging SCS into RLOO, GRPO, and REINFORCE++ series improves accuracy by up to 7.7 percentage points on six multimodal benchmarks with negligible extra computation. SCS also yields notable gains on both Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct and InternVL3-8B, offering a simple, general remedy for outcome-reward RL in MLLMs.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges with container orchestration accuracy in variable cloud environments.

Method: Evaluates Ksurf for resource orchestration utilizing contextual multi-armed bandit model with Drone in Kubernetes.

Result: Ksurf reduces latency variance by 41-47%, lowers CPU and memory usage, and achieves cost savings in worker pod counts.

Conclusion: Ksurf is effective for cloud scenarios, optimizing performance and reducing infrastructure costs.

Abstract: Resource orchestration and configuration parameter search are key concerns for container-based infrastructure in cloud data centers. Large configuration search space and cloud uncertainties are often mitigated using contextual bandit techniques for resource orchestration including the state-of-the-art Drone orchestrator. Complexity in the cloud provider environment due to varying numbers of virtual machines introduces variability in workloads and resource metrics, making orchestration decisions less accurate due to increased nonlinearity and noise. Ksurf, a state-of-the-art variance-minimizing estimator method ideal for highly variable cloud data, enables optimal resource estimation under conditions of high cloud variability.
  This work evaluates the performance of Ksurf on estimation-based resource orchestration tasks involving highly variable workloads when employed as a contextual multi-armed bandit objective function model for cloud scenarios using Drone. Ksurf enables significantly lower latency variance of $41\%$ at p95 and $47\%$ at p99, demonstrates a $4\%$ reduction in CPU usage and 7 MB reduction in master node memory usage on Kubernetes, resulting in a $7\%$ cost savings in average worker pod count on VarBench Kubernetes benchmark.

TL;DR: This paper proposes efficient scheduling algorithms for transactions in fog-cloud networks using a novel approach to minimize the total cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to address the challenge of efficiently scheduling transactions and resource allocation in distributed fog-cloud computing systems, where transactions and shared objects are mobile.

Method: The authors developed scheduling algorithms for single-object and multiple-object transactions, offering approximations for the optimal schedule in constant doubling dimension networks.

Result: Efficient scheduling algorithms were designed with proven approximation factors for both single and multiple shared object transactions, including a distributed version without the need for global knowledge.

Conclusion: The proposed approaches effectively optimize transaction scheduling in fog-cloud systems, providing practical and scalable distributed solutions.

Abstract: Transaction scheduling is crucial to efficiently allocate shared resources in a conflict-free manner in distributed systems. We investigate the efficient scheduling of transactions in a network of fog-cloud computing model, where transactions and their associated shared objects can move within the network. The schedule may require objects to move to transaction nodes, or the transactions to move to the object nodes. Moreover, the schedule may determine intermediate nodes where both objects and transactions meet. Our goal is to minimize the total combined cost of the schedule. We focus on networks of constant doubling dimension, which appear frequently in practice. We consider a batch problem where an arbitrary set of nodes has transactions that need to be scheduled. First, we consider a single shared object required by all the transactions and present a scheduling algorithm that gives an $O(\log n \cdot \log D)$ approximation of the optimal schedule, where $n$ is the number of nodes and $D$ is the diameter of the network. Later, we consider transactions accessing multiple shared objects (at most $k$ objects per transaction) and provide a scheduling algorithm that gives an $O(k \cdot \log n \cdot \log D)$ approximation. We also provide a fully distributed version of the scheduling algorithms where the nodes do not need global knowledge of transactions.

### [237] [Lit Silicon: A Case Where Thermal Imbalance Couples Concurrent Execution in Multiple GPUs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09861)
*Marco Kurzynski,Shaizeen Aga,Di Wu*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: This paper investigates performance variation in multi-GPU systems during LLM training, identifies thermal imbalance as a key factor, and proposes solutions to mitigate its impact, improving datacenter efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address performance variations in multi-GPU systems that significantly impact high-performance computing and AI workloads, specifically caused by thermal imbalances and computation communication overlap.

Method: The study introduces performance and power models to analyze the impact of thermal-induced straggling (Lit Silicon), designs detection and mitigation techniques, and evaluates these through experiments using power management solutions on advanced GPU systems.

Result: The solutions resulted in up to 6% performance improvements and 4% power savings in LLM training, showcasing significant potential cost savings for datacenters.

Conclusion: The proposed techniques effectively mitigate the Lit Silicon problem, offering a cost-effective strategy for improving power and performance in datacenters, and can be easily implemented as a new power management layer.

Abstract: GPU systems are increasingly powering modern datacenters at scale. Despite being highly performant, GPU systems suffer from performance variation at the node and cluster levels. Such performance variation significantly impacts both high-performance computing and artificial intelligence workloads, such as cutting-edge large language models (LLMs). We analyze the performance of a single-node multi-GPU system running LLM training, and observe that the kernel-level performance variation is highly correlated with concurrent computation communication (C3), a technique to overlap computation and communication across GPUs for performance gains. We then take a further step to reason that thermally induced straggling coupling with C3 impacts performance variation, coined as the Lit Silicon effect. Lit Silicon describes that in a multi-GPU node, thermal imbalance across GPUs introduces node-level straggler GPUs, which in turn slow down the leader GPUs. Lit Silicon leads to node-level performance variation and inefficiency, impacting the entire datacenter from the bottom up. We propose analytical performance and power models for Lit Silicon, to understand the potential system-level gains. We further design simple detection and mitigation techniques to effectively address the Lit Silicon problem, and evaluate three different power management solutions, including power optimization under GPU thermal design power, performance optimization under node-level GPU power capping, and performance optimization under node-level CPU power sloshing. We conduct experiments on two workloads on two AMD InstinctTM MI300X GPU systems under two LLM training frameworks, and observe up to 6% performance and 4% power improvements, potentially saving hundreds of millions of dollars in datacenters. Our solution is almost free lunch and can be effortlessly adopted in datacenters as a new node-level power management layer.

*Mani Tofigh,Edward Guo,Weiwei Jia,Xiaoning Ding,Jianchen Shan*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: Cache-based optimizations are inefficient in cloud VMs due to limited cache visibility and control, but CacheX offers a solution using eviction sets for better cache utilization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the ineffectiveness of cache-based optimizations in public cloud VMs caused by restricted cache provisioning visibility and influence.

Method: CacheX uses eviction sets to provide fine-grained cache abstraction, enabling awareness and management within VMs without hardware or hypervisor modification.

Result: CacheX implementation in x86 Linux kernel improves cache utilization for various workloads in public cloud VMs.

Conclusion: CacheX enables VMs to overcome cache abstraction limitations in public clouds, enhancing cache-based optimizations and workload performance.

Abstract: This paper shows that cache-based optimizations are often ineffective in cloud virtual machines (VMs) due to limited visibility into and control over provisioned caches. In public clouds, CPU caches can be partitioned or shared among VMs, but a VM is unaware of cache provisioning details. Moreover, a VM cannot influence cache usage via page placement policies, as memory-to-cache mappings are hidden. The paper proposes a novel solution, CacheX, which probes accurate and fine-grained cache abstraction within VMs using eviction sets without requiring hardware or hypervisor support, and showcases the utility of the probed information with two new techniques: LLC contention-aware task scheduling and virtual color-aware page cache management. Our evaluation of CacheX's implementation in x86 Linux kernel demonstrates that it can effectively improve cache utilization for various workloads in public cloud VMs.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: This paper introduces MoFa, a novel performance modeling framework for optimizing large-scale pretraining of LLMs by integrating multidimensional features and fault tolerance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to solve the challenges of optimizing distributed pretraining for large language models (LLMs), which has grown increasingly complex due to hybrid parallelization and fault tolerance requirements.

Method: The authors developed MoFa, a performance modeling framework that combines a cost model capturing optimization impacts and a fault tolerance model based on historical cluster reliability data.

Result: MoFa demonstrates high prediction accuracy in modeling and provides valuable insights into performance bottlenecks and optimization factors for LLM pretraining.

Conclusion: The framework offers a systematic tool for improving LLM pretraining system design and deployment while addressing optimization and fault tolerance challenges effectively.

Abstract: The exponential growth in LLM scales, with parameters soaring from billions to trillions, has necessitated distributed pretraining across large clusters comprising thousands to tens of thousands of devices. While hybrid parallelization strategies enable such pretraining, the vast combinatorial strategy space introduces significant optimization challenges. Traditional manual tuning methods incur prohibitive trial-and-error costs, and existing performance modeling approaches exhibit critical limitations: they fail to comprehensively account for prevalent optimization features and ignore the substantial overhead imposed by essential fault tolerance mechanisms like checkpoint recovery in long-duration pretraining. To address these gaps, we propose MoFa, a novel pretraining performance modeling framework that unifies multi-dimensional optimization features and fault tolerance. MoFa incorporates an enhanced cost model to accurately capture the effects of key optimizations and integrates a fault tolerance model based on historical cluster reliability data. Besides, a MoFa-based tuning system is developed to explore optimal pretraining performance and potential bottlenecks in various scenarios. Extensive modeling evaluations demonstrate that MoFa can achieve high prediction accuracy across various scenarios. In addition, through comprehensive tuning experiments, our framework systematically reveals the key factors influencing pretraining performance under different configurations, which provides solid a priori guidance for LLM pretraining system design and deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Latency-sensitive embedded applications require effective edge server selection amidst dynamic network congestion to maintain performance.

Method: MO-HAN uses passive measurements and a rational delay model to compute balanced server selection scores, incorporating adaptive reliability and hysteresis-based handover mechanisms.

Result: MO-HAN reduces mean and tail latencies while decreasing handovers by nearly 50% compared to opportunistic selection, outperforming static baselines.

Conclusion: MO-HAN is a practical and efficient solution for resource-constrained devices, enabling consistent performance improvements without heavy infrastructure or intrusive changes.

Abstract: Latency-sensitive embedded applications increasingly rely on edge computing, yet dynamic network congestion in multi-server architectures challenges proper edge server selection. This paper proposes a lightweight server-selection method for edge applications that fuses latency prediction with adaptive reliability and hysteresis-based handover. Using passive measurements (arrival rate, utilization, payload size) and an exponentially modulated rational delay model, the proposed Moderate Handover (MO-HAN) method computes a score that balances predicted latency and reliability to ensure handovers occur only when the expected gain is meaningful and maintain reduced end-to-end latency. Results show that MO-HAN consistently outperforms static and fair-distribution baselines by lowering mean and tail latencies, while reducing handovers by nearly 50% compared to pure opportunistic selection. These gains arise without intrusive instrumentation or heavy learning infrastructure, making MO-HAN practical for resource-constrained embedded devices.

Conclusion: The supervised learning model improves sparse matrix solving efficiency, demonstrating its potential as a tool for intelligent algorithm selection in matrix reordering.

Abstract: Sparse matrix ordering is a vital optimization technique often employed for solving large-scale sparse matrices. Its goal is to minimize the matrix bandwidth by reorganizing its rows and columns, thus enhancing efficiency. Conventional methods for algorithm selection usually depend on brute-force search or empirical knowledge, lacking the ability to adjust to diverse sparse matrix structures.As a result, we have introduced a supervised learning-based model for choosing sparse matrix reordering algorithms. This model grasps the correlation between matrix characteristics and commonly utilized reordering algorithms, facilitating the automated and intelligent selection of the suitable sparse matrix reordering algorithm. Experiments conducted on the Florida sparse matrix dataset reveal that our model can accurately predict the optimal reordering algorithm for various matrices, leading to a 55.37% reduction in solution time compared to solely using the AMD reordering algorithm, with an average speedup ratio of 1.45.

Abstract: Optimizing the performance of large language models (LLMs) on large-scale AI training and inference systems requires a scalable and expressive mechanism to model distributed workload execution. Such modeling is essential for pre-deployment system-level optimizations (e.g., parallelization strategies) and design-space explorations. While recent efforts have proposed collecting execution traces from real systems, access to large-scale infrastructure remains limited to major cloud providers. Moreover, traces obtained from existing platforms cannot be easily adapted to study future larger-scale system configurations. We introduce Symbolic Tensor grAph GEnerator(STAGE), a framework that synthesizes high-fidelity execution traces to accurately model LLM workloads. STAGE supports a comprehensive set of parallelization strategies, allowing users to systematically explore a wide spectrum of LLM architectures and system configurations. STAGE demonstrates its scalability by synthesizing high-fidelity LLM traces spanning over 32K GPUs, while preserving tensor-level accuracy in compute, memory, and communication.

*Tianlei Chen,Yuxiao Chen,Yang Li,Feifei Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to improve automated ICD coding by modeling code co-occurrences using a Directed Bipartite Graph Encoder and enriched embeddings via LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automated ICD coding faces challenges due to large label spaces and the long-tail distribution of disease codes, which impedes accurate classification of rare codes.

Method: A Directed Bipartite Graph Encoder is proposed, incorporating probability-based bias to model co-occurrence relationships, alongside LLM-powered enriched embeddings for better contextual representation.

Result: Their method achieves state-of-the-art performance on three ICD coding benchmarks, especially with significant improvements in Macro-F1 for rare code classification.

Conclusion: The proposed approach mitigates the challenges of large-scale and long-tail distributions in ICD coding, advancing rare code prediction through co-occurrence modeling and enriched contextual embeddings.

Abstract: Automated International Classification of Diseases (ICD) coding aims to assign multiple disease codes to clinical documents, constituting a crucial multi-label text classification task in healthcare informatics. However, the task is challenging due to its large label space (10,000 to 20,000 codes) and long-tail distribution, where a few codes dominate while many rare codes lack sufficient training data. To address this, we propose a learning method that models fine-grained co-occurrence relationships among codes. Specifically, we construct a Directed Bipartite Graph Encoder with disjoint sets of common and rare code nodes. To facilitate a one-way information flow, edges are directed exclusively from common to rare codes. The nature of these connections is defined by a probability-based bias, which is derived from the conditional probability of a common code co-occurring given the presence of a rare code. This bias is then injected into the encoder's attention module, a process we term Co-occurrence Encoding. This structure empowers the graph encoder to enrich rare code representations by aggregating latent comorbidity information reflected in the statistical co-occurrence of their common counterparts. To ensure high-quality input to the graph, we utilize a large language model (LLM) to generate comprehensive descriptions for codes, enriching initial embeddings with clinical context and comorbidity information, serving as external knowledge for the statistical co-occurrence relationships in the code system. Experiments on three automated ICD coding benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance with particularly notable improvements in Macro-F1, which is the key metric for long-tail classification.

### [246] [Steering Pretrained Drafters during Speculative Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09844)
*Frédéric Berdoz,Peer Rheinboldt,Roger Wattenhofer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses the misalignment issue in speculative decoding by introducing a steering vector mechanism, improving the alignment and acceptance rates of pretrained drafters while minimizing computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The primary motivation is to tackle the misalignment problem between drafters and verifiers in speculative decoding, which hampers efficiency and effectiveness, especially in cases dominated by verification latency or out-of-distribution inputs.

Method: The authors propose a dynamic alignment mechanism involving a lightweight steering vector derived from the verifier's hidden states, which is then injected into a pretrained drafter to improve alignment practices.

Result: The dynamic alignment mechanism increases token acceptance rates by up to 35% under standard sampling and 22% under greedy sampling, without introducing significant computational overhead.

Conclusion: The proposed approach significantly enhances pretrained drafters' performance in speculative decoding while enabling fast and broad adoption, as it is compatible with existing architectures and language models.

Abstract: Speculative decoding accelerates language model inference by separating generation into fast drafting and parallel verification. Its main limitation is drafter-verifier misalignment, which limits token acceptance and reduces overall effectiveness. While small drafting heads trained from scratch compensate with speed, they struggle when verification dominates latency or when inputs are out of distribution. In contrast, pretrained drafters, though slower, achieve higher acceptance rates thanks to stronger standalone generation capabilities, making them competitive when drafting latency is negligible relative to verification or communication overhead. In this work, we aim to improve the acceptance rates of pretrained drafters by introducing a lightweight dynamic alignment mechanism: a steering vector computed from the verifier's hidden states and injected into the pretrained drafter. Compared to existing offline alignment methods such as distillation, our approach boosts the number of accepted tokens by up to 35\% under standard sampling and 22\% under greedy sampling, all while incurring negligible computational overhead. Importantly, our approach can be retrofitted to existing architectures and pretrained models, enabling rapid adoption.

TL;DR: The paper introduces discrete-time deep mixture-of-experts (MoE) models for survival analysis that balance patient clustering, calibration, and predictive accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the challenges in survival analysis where traditional MoE models cluster similar patients but struggle with calibration error and predictive accuracy due to their restrictive inductive bias.

Method: The authors propose several deep MoE architectures for survival analysis, focusing on enhancing the expressiveness of experts within the models to address both individual and group predictions.

Result: The study finds that models with more expressive experts delivering patient-specific predictions outperform those using fixed group-based prototypes.

Conclusion: Using expressive MoEs can achieve the goals of clustering patient groups while maintaining high levels of predictive accuracy and calibration.

Abstract: Deep mixture-of-experts models have attracted a lot of attention for survival analysis problems, particularly for their ability to cluster similar patients together. In practice, grouping often comes at the expense of key metrics such calibration error and predictive accuracy. This is due to the restrictive inductive bias that mixture-of-experts imposes, that predictions for individual patients must look like predictions for the group they're assigned to. Might we be able to discover patient group structure, where it exists, while improving calibration and predictive accuracy? In this work, we introduce several discrete-time deep mixture-of-experts (MoE) based architectures for survival analysis problems, one of which achieves all desiderata: clustering, calibration, and predictive accuracy. We show that a key differentiator between this array of MoEs is how expressive their experts are. We find that more expressive experts that tailor predictions per patient outperform experts that rely on fixed group prototypes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of real-time state estimation in jump Markov systems, particularly under uncertain noise and mode dynamics where traditional methods struggle.

Method: The architecture comprises two RNNs: one predicts modes, and another performs filtering augmented with KalmanNet principles. They are trained jointly using alternating least squares without supervision of latent modes.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate JMFNet's superior performance over classical filters and deep learning baselines in both linear and nonlinear systems, especially in challenging scenarios.

Conclusion: JMFNet proves to be a reliable and consistent framework, robust to initial conditions, hyperparameter settings, and model inaccuracies, offering a marked improvement in complex systems or long sequences.

Abstract: This paper presents the Jump Markov Filtering Network (JMFNet), a novel model-based deep learning framework for real-time state-state estimation in jump Markov systems with unknown noise statistics and mode transition dynamics. A hybrid architecture comprising two Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) is proposed: one for mode prediction and another for filtering that is based on a mode-augmented version of the recently presented KalmanNet architecture. The proposed RNNs are trained jointly using an alternating least squares strategy that enables mutual adaptation without supervision of the latent modes. Extensive numerical experiments on linear and nonlinear systems, including target tracking, pendulum angle tracking, Lorenz attractor dynamics, and a real-life dataset demonstrate that the proposed JMFNet framework outperforms classical model-based filters (e.g., interacting multiple models and particle filters) as well as model-free deep learning baselines, particularly in non-stationary and high-noise regimes. It is also showcased that JMFNet achieves a small yet meaningful improvement over the KalmanNet framework, which becomes much more pronounced in complicated systems or long trajectories. Finally, the method's performance is empirically validated to be consistent and reliable, exhibiting low sensitivity to initial conditions, hyperparameter selection, as well as to incorrect model knowledge

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training large language models is resource-intensive, with current distributed training methods facing substantial communication overhead and inefficiencies from static gradient compression. Overcoming these limitations while maintaining model performance is essential.

Method: The paper introduces the EDGC framework with three components: (1) using down-sampling to efficiently estimate gradient entropy, (2) a theoretical model linking compression rate to gradient entropy for better decision-making, and (3) a window-based adjustment mechanism to dynamically adapt the compression rate during training.

Result: EDGC was tested on clusters of 32 NVIDIA-V100 and 64 NVIDIA-H100 GPUs, training GPT2-2.5B and GPT2-12.1B, respectively. It achieved reductions in communication latency by up to 46.45% and training time by 16.13% without compromising accuracy.

Conclusion: EDGC successfully addresses the communication and efficiency challenges in large language model training by dynamically adjusting compression rates, improving both training speed and maintaining model accuracy.

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) poses significant challenges regarding computational resources and memory capacity. Although distributed training techniques help mitigate these issues, they still suffer from considerable communication overhead. Existing approaches primarily rely on static gradient compression to enhance communication efficiency; however, these methods neglect the dynamic nature of evolving gradients during training, leading to performance degradation. Accelerating LLM training via compression without sacrificing performance remains a challenge. In this paper, we propose an entropy-driven dynamic gradient compression framework called EDGC. The core concept is to adjust the compression rate during LLM training based on the evolving trends of gradient entropy, taking into account both compression efficiency and error. EDGC consists of three key components.First, it employs a down-sampling method to efficiently estimate gradient entropy, reducing computation overhead. Second, it establishes a theoretical model linking compression rate with gradient entropy, enabling more informed compression decisions. Lastly, a window-based adjustment mechanism dynamically adapts the compression rate across pipeline stages, improving communication efficiency and maintaining model performance. We implemented EDGC on a 32-NVIDIA-V100 cluster and a 64-NVIDIA-H100 cluster to train GPT2-2.5B and GPT2-12.1B, respectively. The results show that EDGC significantly reduces communication latency and training time by up to 46.45% and 16.13% while preserving LLM accuracy.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores the use of group averaging as a technique to enforce exact symmetry in machine learning models, leading to improved prediction accuracy without altering model structure or training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of enforcing exact symmetry in machine learning models for natural sciences and improve prediction accuracy.

Method: Group averaging is employed at test time to make trained models precisely equivariant by averaging predictions over a symmetry group.

Result: Group averaging consistently reduces evaluation loss, improving accuracy by up to 37% in VRMSE, and produces visually better predictions for continuous dynamics.

Conclusion: Group averaging is a simple, cost-effective method to enforce exact symmetries and improve model accuracy, recommended for the ML4PS community.

Abstract: Many machine learning tasks in the natural sciences are precisely equivariant to particular symmetries. Nonetheless, equivariant methods are often not employed, perhaps because training is perceived to be challenging, or the symmetry is expected to be learned, or equivariant implementations are seen as hard to build. Group averaging is an available technique for these situations. It happens at test time; it can make any trained model precisely equivariant at a (often small) cost proportional to the size of the group; it places no requirements on model structure or training. It is known that, under mild conditions, the group-averaged model will have a provably better prediction accuracy than the original model. Here we show that an inexpensive group averaging can improve accuracy in practice. We take well-established benchmark machine learning models of differential equations in which certain symmetries ought to be obeyed. At evaluation time, we average the models over a small group of symmetries. Our experiments show that this procedure always decreases the average evaluation loss, with improvements of up to 37\% in terms of the VRMSE. The averaging produces visually better predictions for continuous dynamics. This short paper shows that, under certain common circumstances, there are no disadvantages to imposing exact symmetries; the ML4PS community should consider group averaging as a cheap and simple way to improve model accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of creating heat sink designs that optimize cooling performance by minimizing pressure drops and maintaining surface temperature parameters, offering scalability and computational efficiency compared to traditional methods.

Method: The framework employs denoising diffusion probabilistic models, surrogate neural networks for performance prediction, and gradient-based guidance during inference, leveraging multi-fidelity training data and boundary representations of fins.

Result: The proposed method generated heat sinks with pressure drops up to 10% lower than those achieved by traditional black-box optimization methods, demonstrating improved performance under constraints.

Conclusion: The work presents a scalable, efficient generative framework for electronics cooling design that reduces computational demands during inference and outperforms existing optimization methods. It establishes potential for foundational models in the field.

Abstract: This study presents a generative optimization framework based on a guided denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) that leverages surrogate gradients to generate heat sink designs minimizing pressure drop while maintaining surface temperatures below a specified threshold. Geometries are represented using boundary representations of multiple fins, and a multi-fidelity approach is employed to generate training data. Using this dataset, along with vectors representing the boundary representation geometries, we train a denoising diffusion probabilistic model to generate heat sinks with characteristics consistent with those observed in the data. We train two different residual neural networks to predict the pressure drop and surface temperature for each geometry. We use the gradients of these surrogate models with respect to the design variables to guide the geometry generation process toward satisfying the low-pressure and surface temperature constraints. This inference-time guidance directs the generative process toward heat sink designs that not only prevent overheating but also achieve lower pressure drops compared to traditional optimization methods such as CMA-ES. In contrast to traditional black-box optimization approaches, our method is scalable, provided sufficient training data is available. Unlike traditional topology optimization methods, once the model is trained and the heat sink world model is saved, inference under new constraints (e.g., temperature) is computationally inexpensive and does not require retraining. Samples generated using the guided diffusion model achieve pressure drops up to 10 percent lower than the limits obtained by traditional black-box optimization methods. This work represents a step toward building a foundational generative model for electronics cooling.

Motivation: To address limitations of static datasets, this paper highlights the need for environments that enable interactive task execution and learning, promoting scalable, agent-specific intelligence.

Method: The paper formalizes the Generative-Execution-Feedback (GEF) loop process, reviewing methodologies for scalable and realistic environment design across task generation, execution, and feedback.

Result: The authors systematically categorize existing methods aligned with the GEF loop, offering insights into benchmarks and applications for complex, interactive learning environments.

Conclusion: A pioneering environment-centric approach is essential for advancing agent capabilities, with future research emphasizing environment complexity, realism, and interactivity.

Abstract: LLM-based agents can autonomously accomplish complex tasks across various domains. However, to further cultivate capabilities such as adaptive behavior and long-term decision-making, training on static datasets built from human-level knowledge is insufficient. These datasets are costly to construct and lack both dynamism and realism. A growing consensus is that agents should instead interact directly with environments and learn from experience through reinforcement learning. We formalize this iterative process as the Generation-Execution-Feedback (GEF) loop, where environments generate tasks to challenge agents, return observations in response to agents' actions during task execution, and provide evaluative feedback on rollouts for subsequent learning. Under this paradigm, environments function as indispensable producers of experiential data, highlighting the need to scale them toward greater complexity, realism, and interactivity. In this survey, we systematically review representative methods for environment scaling from a pioneering environment-centric perspective and organize them along the stages of the GEF loop, namely task generation, task execution, and feedback. We further analyze benchmarks, implementation strategies, and applications, consolidating fragmented advances and outlining future research directions for agent intelligence.

TL;DR: Introduces DR-GNN, a novel Graph Neural Network approach for capturing both static structures and runtime behaviors in RTL circuits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GNN-based models primarily focus on static characteristics of circuits, omitting runtime behaviors crucial for tasks like verification and optimization.

Method: Introduces DR-GNN, which leverages operator-level Control Data Flow Graphs (CDFGs) to represent RTL circuits, enabling learning from both static and multi-cycle dynamic characteristics.

Result: DR-GNN outperforms existing models in branch hit and toggle rate predictions. Its representations also generalize well to related tasks like power estimation and assertion prediction.

Conclusion: DR-GNN effectively captures both static and dynamic circuit behaviors, offering a significant improvement in tasks related to RTL circuit analysis.

Abstract: There is a growing body of work on using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to learn representations of circuits, focusing primarily on their static characteristics. However, these models fail to capture circuit runtime behavior, which is crucial for tasks like circuit verification and optimization. To address this limitation, we introduce DR-GNN (DynamicRTL-GNN), a novel approach that learns RTL circuit representations by incorporating both static structures and multi-cycle execution behaviors. DR-GNN leverages an operator-level Control Data Flow Graph (CDFG) to represent Register Transfer Level (RTL) circuits, enabling the model to capture dynamic dependencies and runtime execution. To train and evaluate DR-GNN, we build the first comprehensive dynamic circuit dataset, comprising over 6,300 Verilog designs and 63,000 simulation traces. Our results demonstrate that DR-GNN outperforms existing models in branch hit prediction and toggle rate prediction. Furthermore, its learned representations transfer effectively to related dynamic circuit tasks, achieving strong performance in power estimation and assertion prediction.

*Pedro Dall'Antonia,Tiago da Silva,Daniel Augusto de Souza,César Lincoln C. Mattos,Diego Mesquita*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes Boosted GFlowNets to improve exploration and sample diversity in areas of the reward landscape that standard GFlowNets fail to effectively cover.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard GFlowNets struggle to explore reward landscapes evenly, resulting in poor coverage of high-reward areas due to gradient vanishing in harder-to-reach regions.

Method: Boosted GFlowNets train an ensemble of models sequentially, optimizing a residual reward to address underexplored reward regions while ensuring a monotone non-degradation property.

Result: Boosted GFlowNets significantly improve exploration and diversity in both synthetic multimodal benchmarks and peptide design tasks.

Conclusion: Using Boosted GFlowNets enhances the diversity and exploration capabilities of GFlowNets without compromising training stability or simplicity.

Abstract: Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) are powerful samplers for compositional objects that, by design, sample proportionally to a given non-negative reward. Nonetheless, in practice, they often struggle to explore the reward landscape evenly: trajectories toward easy-to-reach regions dominate training, while hard-to-reach modes receive vanishing or uninformative gradients, leading to poor coverage of high-reward areas. We address this imbalance with Boosted GFlowNets, a method that sequentially trains an ensemble of GFlowNets, each optimizing a residual reward that compensates for the mass already captured by previous models. This residual principle reactivates learning signals in underexplored regions and, under mild assumptions, ensures a monotone non-degradation property: adding boosters cannot worsen the learned distribution and typically improves it. Empirically, Boosted GFlowNets achieve substantially better exploration and sample diversity on multimodal synthetic benchmarks and peptide design tasks, while preserving the stability and simplicity of standard trajectory-balance training.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SPAttention introduces a novel attention mechanism for Large Language Models (LLMs) using Principled Structural Sparsity to reduce computational complexity while maintaining or improving performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiency and redundancy in the standard implementation of multi-head attention in LLMs, which has quadratic complexity, and to avoid performance trade-offs in existing sparse attention methods.

Method: The proposed SPAttention introduces Principled Structural Sparsity, where attention workload is partitioned into non-overlapping segments assigned to different heads, transforming multi-head attention into a collaborative process with reduced computational complexity.

Result: SPAttention achieves approximately double the training throughput compared to dense attention while matching or surpassing its performance on key metrics and consistently outperforming sparse methods like Longformer, Reformer, and BigBird.

Conclusion: SPAttention significantly enhances efficiency and functionality in LLMs, balancing computational efficiency with robust performance, making it a superior alternative to existing attention mechanisms.

Abstract: The design of Large Language Models (LLMs) has long been hampered by a fundamental conflict within their core attention mechanism: its remarkable expressivity is built upon a computational complexity of $O(H \cdot N^2)$ that grows quadratically with the context size ($N$) and linearly with the number of heads ($H$). This standard implementation harbors significant computational redundancy, as all heads independently compute attention over the same sequence space. Existing sparse methods, meanwhile, often trade information integrity for computational efficiency. To resolve this efficiency-performance trade-off, we propose SPAttention, whose core contribution is the introduction of a new paradigm we term Principled Structural Sparsity. SPAttention does not merely drop connections but instead reorganizes the computational task by partitioning the total attention workload into balanced, non-overlapping distance bands, assigning each head a unique segment. This approach transforms the multi-head attention mechanism from $H$ independent $O(N^2)$ computations into a single, collaborative $O(N^2)$ computation, fundamentally reducing complexity by a factor of $H$. The structured inductive bias compels functional specialization among heads, enabling a more efficient allocation of computational resources from redundant modeling to distinct dependencies across the entire sequence span. Extensive empirical validation on the OLMoE-1B-7B and 0.25B-1.75B model series demonstrates that while delivering an approximately two-fold increase in training throughput, its performance is on par with standard dense attention, even surpassing it on select key metrics, while consistently outperforming representative sparse attention methods including Longformer, Reformer, and BigBird across all evaluation metrics.

### [256] [Parametric Expensive Multi-Objective Optimization via Generative Solution Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09598)
*Tingyang Wei,Jiao Liu,Abhishek Gupta,Chin Chun Ooi,Puay Siew Tan,Yew-Soon Ong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new parametric Bayesian optimization framework for solving expensive multi-objective optimization problems under varying conditions, enabling efficient task-specific solution prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of solving infinite optimization instances in parametric expensive multi-objective scenarios, where traditional methods are limited by costly evaluations for each task.

Method: The proposed approach alternates between acquisition-driven search using inter-task synergies and generative solution sampling via conditional generative models, supported by task-aware Gaussian processes.

Result: The framework demonstrated faster convergence and effective direct solution prediction for synthetic and real-world expensive multi-objective optimization problems.

Conclusion: This method advances parametric optimization by leveraging synergies across tasks, enabling efficient solutions without requiring repeated costly evaluations for unseen scenarios.

Abstract: Many real-world applications require solving families of expensive multi-objective optimization problems~(EMOPs) under varying operational conditions. This gives rise to parametric expensive multi-objective optimization problems (P-EMOPs) where each task parameter defines a distinct optimization instance. Current multi-objective Bayesian optimization methods have been widely used for finding finite sets of Pareto optimal solutions for individual tasks. However, P-EMOPs present a fundamental challenge: the continuous task parameter space can contain infinite distinct problems, each requiring separate expensive evaluations. This demands learning an inverse model that can directly predict optimized solutions for any task-preference query without expensive re-evaluation. This paper introduces the first parametric multi-objective Bayesian optimizer that learns this inverse model by alternating between (1) acquisition-driven search leveraging inter-task synergies and (2) generative solution sampling via conditional generative models. This approach enables efficient optimization across related tasks and finally achieves direct solution prediction for unseen parameterized EMOPs without additional expensive evaluations. We theoretically justify the faster convergence by leveraging inter-task synergies through task-aware Gaussian processes. Meanwhile, empirical studies in synthetic and real-world benchmarks further verify the effectiveness of our alternating framework.

*Mohammad Alipour-Vaezi,Huaiyang Zhong,Kwok-Leung Tsui,Sajad Khodadadian*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces UCB-QRL, an algorithm for quantile-based risk-sensitive reinforcement learning, providing theoretical high-probability regret guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the lack of risk sensitivity in classical RL frameworks, which is critical for applications in domains like healthcare and finance.

Method: The authors propose UCB-QRL, an iterative algorithm that estimates transition probabilities and optimizes the quantile value function within a confidence ball for finite-horizon Markov decision processes.

Result: The algorithm achieves a high-probability regret bound of $\mathcal O\left((2/κ)^{H+1}H\sqrt{SATH\log(2SATH/δ)}\right)$ in episodic settings, with $S$, $A$, $T$, and $H$ denoting states, actions, episodes, and horizons, respectively.

Conclusion: UCB-QRL effectively incorporates risk sensitivity into RL with theoretical guarantees, making it a promising approach for risk-aware decision-making.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has achieved tremendous success in recent years. However, the classical foundations of RL do not account for the risk sensitivity of the objective function, which is critical in various fields, including healthcare and finance. A popular approach to incorporate risk sensitivity is to optimize a specific quantile of the cumulative reward distribution. In this paper, we develop UCB-QRL, an optimistic learning algorithm for the $τ$-quantile objective in finite-horizon Markov decision processes (MDPs). UCB-QRL is an iterative algorithm in which, at each iteration, we first estimate the underlying transition probability and then optimize the quantile value function over a confidence ball around this estimate. We show that UCB-QRL yields a high-probability regret bound $\mathcal O\left((2/κ)^{H+1}H\sqrt{SATH\log(2SATH/δ)}\right)$ in the episodic setting with $S$ states, $A$ actions, $T$ episodes, and $H$ horizons. Here, $κ>0$ is a problem-dependent constant that captures the sensitivity of the underlying MDP's quantile value.

*Junwei Ma,Nour Shaheen,Alex Labach,Amine Mhedhbi,Frank Hutter,Anthony L. Caterini,Valentin Thomas*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores how a small amount of data, even a single real table, with self-supervised pre-training improves generalization across diverse benchmarks in deep tabular modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To challenge the notion that large synthetic or real data corpora are essential for generalization in in-context learning for tabular models.

Method: The authors employed a self-supervised pre-training approach using a single real table and systematically tested its transferability across diverse datasets and domains.

Result: Findings reveal that the quality and number of tasks extracted from a dataset are critical to achieving effective transfer and generalization.

Conclusion: Pre-training on a small amount of high-quality data can rival or outperform methods relying on large synthetic or massive datasets in tabular modeling.

Abstract: Deep tabular modelling increasingly relies on in-context learning where, during inference, a model receives a set of $(x,y)$ pairs as context and predicts labels for new inputs without weight updates. We challenge the prevailing view that broad generalization here requires pre-training on large synthetic corpora (e.g., TabPFN priors) or a large collection of real data (e.g., TabDPT training datasets), discovering that a relatively small amount of data suffices for generalization. We find that simple self-supervised pre-training on just a \emph{single} real table can produce surprisingly strong transfer across heterogeneous benchmarks. By systematically pre-training and evaluating on many diverse datasets, we analyze what aspects of the data are most important for building a Tabular Foundation Model (TFM) generalizing across domains. We then connect this to the pre-training procedure shared by most TFMs and show that the number and quality of \emph{tasks} one can construct from a dataset is key to downstream performance.

*Houming Wu,Ling Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TawPipe improves the efficiency and scalability of large language model training by optimizing weight transmission across devices using topology-aware strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address constraints in training large language models, such as memory limits and high communication costs, especially for long-context scenarios.

Method: TawPipe utilizes topology-aware weight pipeline parallelism, optimizing intra-node and inter-node communication, assigning fixed weight shards to devices, and overlapping communication with computation.

Result: Experiments show that TawPipe achieves better throughput and scalability compared to existing methods like FSDP and weight-passing techniques.

Conclusion: TawPipe reduces communication overhead, particularly across nodes, and offers an efficient solution for distributed training of large language models.

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) is fundamentally constrained by limited device memory and costly inter-device communication. Although pipeline parallelism alleviates memory pressure by partitioning models across devices, it incurs activation communication overhead that scales linearly with sequence length, limiting efficiency in long-context training. Recent weight-passing approaches (e.g., WeiPipe) mitigate this by transmitting model weights instead of activations, but suffer from redundant peer-to-peer (P2P) transfers and underutilized intra-node bandwidth. We propose TawPipe--topology-aware weight pipeline parallelism, which exploits hierarchical bandwidth in distributed clusters for improved communication efficiency. TawPipe: (i) groups devices based on topology to optimize intra-node collective and inter-node P2P communication; (ii) assigns each device a fixed shard of model weights and gradients, avoiding redundant transfers; and (iii) overlaps communication with computation to hide latency. Unlike global collective operations used in fully sharded data parallelism (FSDP), TawPipe confines most communication within node boundaries, significantly reducing cross-node traffic. Extensive experiments on up to 24 GPUs with LLaMA-style models show that TawPipe achieves superior throughput and scalability compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

*Hossein Rouhvarzi,Anastasis Kratsios*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper establishes that incremental flow-based models are essential for universal generation compatible with denoising pipelines, providing theoretical results on their approximation abilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a rigorous approximation-theoretic foundation for incremental flow-based generative models and their advantages in universal flow-based generation.

Method: The study uses topological-dynamical arguments to show limitations of single-step autonomous flows and highlights their universal approximation capability when composed. Algebraic and smoothness properties are also used for improved approximation rates.

Result: Proves single-step autonomous flows are not universally capable alone but demonstrates their universal approximation power when composed under certain conditions. Rates of $	\mathcal{O}(n^{-1/d})$ are achievable, and extensions to higher dimensional domains yield vanishing $1$-Wasserstein error.

Conclusion: Incremental flow-based models, when appropriately structured, can serve as powerful tools for universal generation tasks. Their theoretical foundation is solidified with guarantees for approximation and error behavior.

Abstract: Incremental flow-based denoising models have reshaped generative modelling, but their empirical advantage still lacks a rigorous approximation-theoretic foundation. We show that incremental generation is necessary and sufficient for universal flow-based generation on the largest natural class of self-maps of $[0,1]^d$ compatible with denoising pipelines, namely the orientation-preserving homeomorphisms of $[0,1]^d$. All our guarantees are uniform on the underlying maps and hence imply approximation both samplewise and in distribution.
  Using a new topological-dynamical argument, we first prove an impossibility theorem: the class of all single-step autonomous flows, independently of the architecture, width, depth, or Lipschitz activation of the underlying neural network, is meagre and therefore not universal in the space of orientation-preserving homeomorphisms of $[0,1]^d$. By exploiting algebraic properties of autonomous flows, we conversely show that every orientation-preserving Lipschitz homeomorphism on $[0,1]^d$ can be approximated at rate $\mathcal{O}(n^{-1/d})$ by a composition of at most $K_d$ such flows, where $K_d$ depends only on the dimension. Under additional smoothness assumptions, the approximation rate can be made dimension-free, and $K_d$ can be chosen uniformly over the class being approximated. Finally, by linearly lifting the domain into one higher dimension, we obtain structured universal approximation results for continuous functions and for probability measures on $[0,1]^d$, the latter realized as pushforwards of empirical measures with vanishing $1$-Wasserstein error.

TL;DR: The paper introduces GEM+, a method for generating differentially private synthetic tabular data by combining AIM's adaptive measurement and GEM's scalable neural networks, excelling in utility and scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the inefficiencies of graphical models in handling high-dimensional data due to their high memory requirements and computational overhead, and to improve upon previous methods by integrating scalable solutions.

Method: The authors propose GEM+, which combines AIM's adaptive measurement framework with GEM's generator neural network, enabling efficient handling of datasets with many columns.

Result: GEM+ demonstrates better utility and scalability compared to AIM, successfully processing datasets with over a hundred columns where AIM struggles.

Conclusion: GEM+ advances the state-of-the-art in differentially private synthetic tabular data generation by efficiently managing large, high-dimensional datasets, while maintaining high data utility.

Abstract: State-of-the-art differentially private synthetic tabular data has been defined by adaptive 'select-measure-generate' frameworks, exemplified by methods like AIM. These approaches iteratively measure low-order noisy marginals and fit graphical models to produce synthetic data, enabling systematic optimisation of data quality under privacy constraints. Graphical models, however, are inefficient for high-dimensional data because they require substantial memory and must be retrained from scratch whenever the graph structure changes, leading to significant computational overhead. Recent methods, like GEM, overcome these limitations by using generator neural networks for improved scalability. However, empirical comparisons have mostly focused on small datasets, limiting real-world applicability. In this work, we introduce GEM+, which integrates AIM's adaptive measurement framework with GEM's scalable generator network. Our experiments show that GEM+ outperforms AIM in both utility and scalability, delivering state-of-the-art results while efficiently handling datasets with over a hundred columns, where AIM fails due to memory and computational overheads.

TL;DR: Split Federated Learning improves by introducing SMoFi, which addresses gradient divergence from data heterogeneity for better accuracy and speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the negative impact of data heterogeneity on Split Federated Learning's global model convergence speed and accuracy.

Method: A lightweight framework called SMoFi with staleness-aware alignment that synchronizes momentum buffers across server-side optimizers.

Result: SMoFi boosts model accuracy by up to 7.1% and convergence speed up to 10.25x in real-world datasets, with greater impact as the number of clients or model depth increases.

Conclusion: SMoFi is an effective tool for enhancing Split Federated Learning in resource-constrained scenarios, addressing key challenges caused by data heterogeneity.

Abstract: Split Federated Learning is a system-efficient federated learning paradigm that leverages the rich computing resources at a central server to train model partitions. Data heterogeneity across silos, however, presents a major challenge undermining the convergence speed and accuracy of the global model. This paper introduces Step-wise Momentum Fusion (SMoFi), an effective and lightweight framework that counteracts gradient divergence arising from data heterogeneity by synchronizing the momentum buffers across server-side optimizers. To control gradient divergence over the training process, we design a staleness-aware alignment mechanism that imposes constraints on gradient updates of the server-side submodel at each optimization step. Extensive validations on multiple real-world datasets show that SMoFi consistently improves global model accuracy (up to 7.1%) and convergence speed (up to 10.25$\times$). Furthermore, SMoFi has a greater impact with more clients involved and deeper learning models, making it particularly suitable for model training in resource-constrained contexts.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new learning paradigm for handling large model sets without relying on prior assumptions and shows its advantages under various learning conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of traditional structural risk minimization (SRM) approaches that rely heavily on prior assumptions when dealing with large candidate model sets.

Method: The proposed paradigm incorporates empirical data strongly and minimizes reliance on prior assumptions, enabling it to utilize several learning assumptions without knowing their true parameters in advance.

Result: The new approach demonstrates effectiveness under assumptions such as smoothness, clustering of labels, Lipschitzness, and constraints derived from contrastive learning.

Conclusion: The paradigm provides a promising alternative to SRM, facilitating better generalization by incorporating empirical data and requiring fewer prior assumptions.

Abstract: We address the general task of learning with a set of candidate models that is too large to have a uniform convergence of empirical estimates to true losses. While the common approach to such challenges is SRM (or regularization) based learning algorithms, we propose a novel learning paradigm that relies on stronger incorporation of empirical data and requires less algorithmic decisions to be based on prior assumptions. We analyze the generalization capabilities of our approach and demonstrate its merits in several common learning assumptions, including similarity of close points, clustering of the domain into highly label-homogeneous regions, Lipschitzness assumptions of the labeling rule, and contrastive learning assumptions. Our approach allows utilizing such assumptions without the need to know their true parameters a priori.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces SEBA, a method to effectively perform adversarial attacks on visual reinforcement learning agents in a sample-efficient manner.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Adversarial robustness in visual reinforcement learning, particularly in image-based continuous control, remains underexplored due to challenges such as large action spaces and excessive query requirements.

Method: SEBA utilizes a shadow Q model, a generative adversarial network, and a world model in a two-stage iterative training pipeline to generate effective perturbations while minimizing real-world queries.

Result: SEBA outperforms existing black-box and white-box attack methods in terms of reducing RL agent rewards, maintaining visual imperceptibility, and reducing interaction with the environment.

Conclusion: SEBA efficiently performs adversarial attacks, addressing key limitations in current black-box methods, and demonstrates strong potential as a robust tool for assessing visual RL systems.

Abstract: Visual reinforcement learning has achieved remarkable progress in visual control and robotics, but its vulnerability to adversarial perturbations remains underexplored. Most existing black-box attacks focus on vector-based or discrete-action RL, and their effectiveness on image-based continuous control is limited by the large action space and excessive environment queries. We propose SEBA, a sample-efficient framework for black-box adversarial attacks on visual RL agents. SEBA integrates a shadow Q model that estimates cumulative rewards under adversarial conditions, a generative adversarial network that produces visually imperceptible perturbations, and a world model that simulates environment dynamics to reduce real-world queries. Through a two-stage iterative training procedure that alternates between learning the shadow model and refining the generator, SEBA achieves strong attack performance while maintaining efficiency. Experiments on MuJoCo and Atari benchmarks show that SEBA significantly reduces cumulative rewards, preserves visual fidelity, and greatly decreases environment interactions compared to prior black-box and white-box methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address sensitivity in performance due to reward function design issues, specifically avoiding reward hacking in RL methods applied to Text2SQL.

Method: The paper introduces a constrained RL framework for Text2SQL that uses interpretable reward and constraint signals, along with dynamic trade-off balancing during training.

Result: Experiments on established Text2SQL datasets show improvement of the proposed framework over state-of-the-art RL-trained systems with theoretical guarantees.

Conclusion: The constrained RL approach enhances Text2SQL reasoning and avoids pitfalls like reward hacking, offering improved performance and theoretical soundness.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated significant promise in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Text2SQL LLMs, especially with advanced algorithms such as GRPO and DAPO. However, the performance of these methods is highly sensitive to the design of reward functions. Inappropriate rewards can lead to reward hacking, where models exploit loopholes in the reward structure to achieve high scores without genuinely solving the task. This work considers a constrained RL framework for Text2SQL that incorporates natural and interpretable reward and constraint signals, while dynamically balancing trade-offs among them during the training. We establish the theoretical guarantees of our constrained RL framework and our numerical experiments on the well-known Text2SQL datasets substantiate the improvement of our approach over the state-of-the-art RL-trained LLMs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study proposes an advanced modular composite representation (MCR) model for high-dimensional information processing. It improves accuracy, efficiency, and memory use compared to existing binary and integer-based approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Limited attention has been given to MCR since its conception, overshadowed by concerns about its complexity compared to perceived benefits. The paper aims to revisit and evaluate MCR's potential comprehensively.

Method: The authors conduct extensive experiments to measure MCR's capacity, accuracy, and hardware efficiency. They compare MCR with binary spatter codes and other models on several datasets and analyze its hardware implementation using a dedicated accelerator.

Result: MCR outperforms binary and integer models in capacity and accuracy while requiring less memory. Hardware evaluations show MCR provides significant speedup and energy efficiency, achieving fast execution and lower energy consumption compared to binary spatter codes.

Conclusion: MCR proves to be a high-precision, energy-efficient, and faster alternative when implemented with dedicated hardware, offering advantages in dimensionality reduction and overall computational efficiency.

Abstract: The modular composite representation (MCR) is a computing model that represents information with high-dimensional integer vectors using modular arithmetic. Originally proposed as a generalization of the binary spatter code model, it aims to provide higher representational power while remaining a lighter alternative to models requiring high-precision components. Despite this potential, MCR has received limited attention. Systematic analyses of its trade-offs and comparisons with other models are lacking, sustaining the perception that its added complexity outweighs the improved expressivity. In this work, we revisit MCR by presenting its first extensive evaluation, demonstrating that it achieves a unique balance of capacity, accuracy, and hardware efficiency. Experiments measuring capacity demonstrate that MCR outperforms binary and integer vectors while approaching complex-valued representations at a fraction of their memory footprint. Evaluation on 123 datasets confirms consistent accuracy gains and shows that MCR can match the performance of binary spatter codes using up to 4x less memory. We investigate the hardware realization of MCR by showing that it maps naturally to digital logic and by designing the first dedicated accelerator. Evaluations on basic operations and 7 selected datasets demonstrate a speedup of up to 3 orders of magnitude and significant energy reductions compared to software implementation. When matched for accuracy against binary spatter codes, MCR achieves on average 3.08x faster execution and 2.68x lower energy consumption. These findings demonstrate that, although MCR requires more sophisticated operations than binary spatter codes, its modular arithmetic and higher per-component precision enable lower dimensionality. When realized with dedicated hardware, this results in a faster, more energy-efficient, and high-precision alternative to existing models.

TL;DR: This paper proposes parameterized families of algorithms for improving multi-armed bandit problems, achieving better worst-case guarantees and data-dependent learning efficiencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the allocation of effort under uncertainty in various practical domains, such as research investments, clinical trials, and machine learning hyperparameter optimization.

Method: The paper introduces two families of parameterized algorithms and assesses their efficacy by analyzing the sample complexity of learning near-optimal algorithms using offline data.

Result: The proposed algorithms exhibit stronger guarantees under specific conditions, optimal scalability in terms of number of arms, and adaptiveness across well-behaved and poorly-behaved instances.

Conclusion: The findings provide a novel approach to balancing theoretical worst-case guarantees and practical, data-dependent efficiency in bandit optimization problems.

Abstract: The improving multi-armed bandits problem is a formal model for allocating effort under uncertainty, motivated by scenarios such as investing research effort into new technologies, performing clinical trials, and hyperparameter selection from learning curves. Each pull of an arm provides reward that increases monotonically with diminishing returns. A growing line of work has designed algorithms for improving bandits, albeit with somewhat pessimistic worst-case guarantees. Indeed, strong lower bounds of $Ω(k)$ and $Ω(\sqrt{k})$ multiplicative approximation factors are known for both deterministic and randomized algorithms (respectively) relative to the optimal arm, where $k$ is the number of bandit arms. In this work, we propose two new parameterized families of bandit algorithms and bound the sample complexity of learning the near-optimal algorithm from each family using offline data. The first family we define includes the optimal randomized algorithm from prior work. We show that an appropriately chosen algorithm from this family can achieve stronger guarantees, with optimal dependence on $k$, when the arm reward curves satisfy additional properties related to the strength of concavity. Our second family contains algorithms that both guarantee best-arm identification on well-behaved instances and revert to worst case guarantees on poorly-behaved instances. Taking a statistical learning perspective on the bandit rewards optimization problem, we achieve stronger data-dependent guarantees without the need for actually verifying whether the assumptions are satisfied.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional numerical methods for solving PDEs are computationally expensive, and existing deep learning surrogate models only specialize in single, fixed-parameter PDEs.

Method: The authors conditioned neural models on vector encodings of PDE terms and trained four baseline models on a family of 1D PDEs from the APEBench suite.

Result: The approach demonstrated strong performance on unseen parameter sets, robustness during rollout beyond the training window, and generalization to entirely new PDEs.

Conclusion: The proposed solution is effective for generalizing PDE solving via deep learning and can automate the creation of expert-level scientific software.

Abstract: Solving partial differential equations (PDEs) can be prohibitively expensive using traditional numerical methods. Deep learning-based surrogate models typically specialize in a single PDE with fixed parameters. We present a framework for equation-aware emulation that generalizes to unseen PDEs, conditioning a neural model on a vector encoding representing the terms in a PDE and their coefficients. We present a baseline of four distinct modeling technqiues, trained on a family of 1D PDEs from the APEBench suite. Our approach achieves strong performance on parameter sets held out from the training distribution, with strong stability for rollout beyond the training window, and generalization to an entirely unseen PDE. This work was developed as part of a broader effort exploring AI systems that automate the creation of expert-level empirical software for scorable scientific tasks.

### [269] [Unlocking Dynamic Inter-Client Spatial Dependencies: A Federated Spatio-Temporal Graph Learning Method for Traffic Flow Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10434)
*Feng Wang,Tianxiang Chen,Shuyue Wei,Qian Chu,Yi Zhang,Yifan Sun,Zhiming Zheng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces FedSTGD, a federated learning framework for modeling dynamic inter-client spatial dependencies in traffic time series, overcoming limitations in static dependency modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in accurately modeling and reconstructing dynamic inter-client spatial dependencies in distributed traffic data while maintaining data locality constraints.

Method: FedSTGD utilizes federated nonlinear computation decomposition and graph node embedding augmentation, coordinated via a client-server learning protocol, to model dynamic dependencies and perform parallelized tasks efficiently.

Result: Experimental results across four datasets show FedSTGD outperforms state-of-the-art methods in metrics like RMSE, MAE, and MAPE, nearing centralized performance. Ablation studies confirm module effectiveness, while sensitivity analysis demonstrates robustness.

Conclusion: FedSTGD effectively addresses dynamic inter-client spatial dependency modeling in federated learning, providing superior performance and maintaining robustness under varying conditions.

Abstract: Spatio-temporal graphs are powerful tools for modeling complex dependencies in traffic time series. However, the distributed nature of real-world traffic data across multiple stakeholders poses significant challenges in modeling and reconstructing inter-client spatial dependencies while adhering to data locality constraints. Existing methods primarily address static dependencies, overlooking their dynamic nature and resulting in suboptimal performance. In response, we propose Federated Spatio-Temporal Graph with Dynamic Inter-Client Dependencies (FedSTGD), a framework designed to model and reconstruct dynamic inter-client spatial dependencies in federated learning. FedSTGD incorporates a federated nonlinear computation decomposition module to approximate complex graph operations. This is complemented by a graph node embedding augmentation module, which alleviates performance degradation arising from the decomposition. These modules are coordinated through a client-server collective learning protocol, which decomposes dynamic inter-client spatial dependency learning tasks into lightweight, parallelizable subtasks. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate that FedSTGD achieves superior performance over state-of-the-art baselines in terms of RMSE, MAE, and MAPE, approaching that of centralized baselines. Ablation studies confirm the contribution of each module in addressing dynamic inter-client spatial dependencies, while sensitivity analysis highlights the robustness of FedSTGD to variations in hyperparameters.

*Bernardo Perrone Ribeiro,Jana Faganeli Pucer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces FlowCast, a model that enhances radar-based precipitation nowcasting by using Conditional Flow Matching (CFM), yielding faster and more accurate predictions compared to diffusion models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in radar-based precipitation nowcasting, such as uncertainty in atmospheric dynamics and the computational inefficiency of high-dimensional data modeling for time-critical applications.

Method: The study leverages Conditional Flow Matching (CFM) to train a model for direct noise-to-data mapping, drastically reducing the number of function evaluations compared to diffusion frameworks.

Result: FlowCast achieves state-of-the-art predictive accuracy, outperforms diffusion models in both efficiency and accuracy, and maintains high-quality predictions with fewer sampling steps.

Conclusion: FlowCast and its CFM approach provide a practical, efficient, and high-performing solution for spatiotemporal forecasting, establishing it as a promising alternative to diffusion models.

Abstract: Radar-based precipitation nowcasting, the task of forecasting short-term precipitation fields from previous radar images, is a critical problem for flood risk management and decision-making. While deep learning has substantially advanced this field, two challenges remain fundamental: the uncertainty of atmospheric dynamics and the efficient modeling of high-dimensional data. Diffusion models have shown strong promise by producing sharp, reliable forecasts, but their iterative sampling process is computationally prohibitive for time-critical applications. We introduce FlowCast, the first model to apply Conditional Flow Matching (CFM) to precipitation nowcasting. Unlike diffusion, CFM learns a direct noise-to-data mapping, enabling rapid, high-fidelity sample generation with drastically fewer function evaluations. Our experiments demonstrate that FlowCast establishes a new state-of-the-art in predictive accuracy. A direct comparison further reveals the CFM objective is both more accurate and significantly more efficient than a diffusion objective on the same architecture, maintaining high performance with significantly fewer sampling steps. This work positions CFM as a powerful and practical alternative for high-dimensional spatiotemporal forecasting.

*Joana Tirana,Dimitra Tsigkari,David Solans Noguero,Nicolas Kourtellis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper investigates catastrophic forgetting (CF) in Split Federated Learning (SFL) due to data heterogeneity and proposes a mitigation method called Hydra.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address catastrophic forgetting in SFL caused by local updates deviating from global optima and server sensitivity to data processing order.

Method: The authors study the effect of processing order and cut layer on CF in SFL and propose Hydra, inspired by multi-head neural networks, to mitigate CF in such settings.

Result: Extensive evaluations demonstrate that Hydra surpasses existing baselines and methods in reducing CF in SFL.

Conclusion: Hydra is an effective and superior approach to mitigate CF in SFL settings, providing better performance in heterogeneous data scenarios.

Abstract: In Split Federated Learning (SFL), the clients collaboratively train a model with the help of a server by splitting the model into two parts. Part-1 is trained locally at each client and aggregated by the aggregator at the end of each round. Part-2 is trained at a server that sequentially processes the intermediate activations received from each client. We study the phenomenon of catastrophic forgetting (CF) in SFL in the presence of data heterogeneity. In detail, due to the nature of SFL, local updates of part-1 may drift away from global optima, while part-2 is sensitive to the processing sequence, similar to forgetting in continual learning (CL). Specifically, we observe that the trained model performs better in classes (labels) seen at the end of the sequence. We investigate this phenomenon with emphasis on key aspects of SFL, such as the processing order at the server and the cut layer. Based on our findings, we propose Hydra, a novel mitigation method inspired by multi-head neural networks and adapted for the SFL's setting. Extensive numerical evaluations show that Hydra outperforms baselines and methods from the literature.

*Bram Grooten,Patrick MacAlpine,Kaushik Subramanian,Peter Stone,Peter R. Wurman*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper tackles unseen environment challenges in robotics, introducing SPARC—a simplified one-phase method for improving OOD generalization. Tested in simulators, it performs robustly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to achieve better OOD generalization in robotics controllers in varying environments without requiring explicit context data for testing, addressing challenges faced in practical applications.

Method: The authors propose SPARC, a single-phase adaptation method, which simplifies the previous cumbersome two-stage processes involving context encoders and history modules while maintaining effective OOD generalization.

Result: SPARC is validated in diverse contexts using Gran Turismo 7 racing simulator and wind-altered environments in MuJoCo, demonstrating reliability and robust performance for OOD generalization.

Conclusion: The study simplifies adaptation processes and achieves effective OOD generalization in unseen environments, paving the way for practical robustness in robotics control.

Abstract: Generalization to unseen environments is a significant challenge in the field of robotics and control. In this work, we focus on contextual reinforcement learning, where agents act within environments with varying contexts, such as self-driving cars or quadrupedal robots that need to operate in different terrains or weather conditions than they were trained for. We tackle the critical task of generalizing to out-of-distribution (OOD) settings, without access to explicit context information at test time. Recent work has addressed this problem by training a context encoder and a history adaptation module in separate stages. While promising, this two-phase approach is cumbersome to implement and train. We simplify the methodology and introduce SPARC: single-phase adaptation for robust control. We test SPARC on varying contexts within the high-fidelity racing simulator Gran Turismo 7 and wind-perturbed MuJoCo environments, and find that it achieves reliable and robust OOD generalization.

*Ethan Hirschowitz,Fabio Ramos*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes Triangular-Distribution Evolution Strategies (TD-ES) to improve robot policy refinement, combining bounded triangular noise with centered-rank estimators in a pipeline with PPO. This approach enhances success rates and reduces variance in robotic tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenges of improving robot policies using on-policy RL, which often suffers from noisy and low-signal gradients, by revisiting Evolution Strategies as a more effective alternative.

Method: The method involves introducing TD-ES with bounded triangular noise and a centered-rank finite-difference estimator. This is used in a two-stage training pipeline: pretraining with PPO followed by refinement with TD-ES.

Result: TD-ES improves success rates by 26.5% over PPO across robotic manipulation tasks and significantly reduces variance, demonstrating robust late-stage gains.

Conclusion: The proposed TD-ES provides a stable, efficient, and computationally light approach for refining robot policies, improving task success rates and robustness while complementing existing PPO pretraining.

Abstract: Improving competent robot policies with on-policy RL is often hampered by noisy, low-signal gradients. We revisit Evolution Strategies (ES) as a policy-gradient proxy and localize exploration with bounded, antithetic triangular perturbations, suitable for policy refinement. We propose Triangular-Distribution ES (TD-ES) which pairs bounded triangular noise with a centered-rank finite-difference estimator to deliver stable, parallelizable, gradient-free updates. In a two-stage pipeline -- PPO pretraining followed by TD-ES refinement -- this preserves early sample efficiency while enabling robust late-stage gains. Across a suite of robotic manipulation tasks, TD-ES raises success rates by 26.5% relative to PPO and greatly reduces variance, offering a simple, compute-light path to reliable refinement.

### [274] [History Rhymes: Macro-Contextual Retrieval for Robust Financial Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09754)
*Sarthak Khanna,Armin Berger,Muskaan Chopra,Rafet Sifa*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel forecasting framework using macro-contextual retrieval to improve financial market predictions amidst macroeconomic shifts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many forecasting models fail to adapt to non-stationary financial markets due to structural breaks and macroeconomic regime shifts. Existing multimodal approaches fail to address this effectively.

Method: The study proposes a retrieval-augmented forecasting approach where macro indicators and financial news sentiment are jointly embedded in a similarity space for causal inference during predictions.

Result: Macro-conditioned retrieval showed robust OOD performance, achieving positive out-of-sample trading results on AAPL and XOM datasets, outperforming baselines.

Conclusion: Grounding financial forecasts in historically analogous macroeconomic contexts yields resilient and interpretable predictions during distributional changes.

Abstract: Financial markets are inherently non-stationary: structural breaks and macroeconomic regime shifts often cause forecasting models to fail when deployed out of distribution (OOD). Conventional multimodal approaches that simply fuse numerical indicators and textual sentiment rarely adapt to such shifts. We introduce macro-contextual retrieval, a retrieval-augmented forecasting framework that grounds each prediction in historically analogous macroeconomic regimes. The method jointly embeds macro indicators (e.g., CPI, unemployment, yield spread, GDP growth) and financial news sentiment in a shared similarity space, enabling causal retrieval of precedent periods during inference without retraining.
  Trained on seventeen years of S&P 500 data (2007-2023) and evaluated OOD on AAPL (2024) and XOM (2024), the framework consistently narrows the CV to OOD performance gap. Macro-conditioned retrieval achieves the only positive out-of-sample trading outcomes (AAPL: PF=1.18, Sharpe=0.95; XOM: PF=1.16, Sharpe=0.61), while static numeric, text-only, and naive multimodal baselines collapse under regime shifts. Beyond metric gains, retrieved neighbors form interpretable evidence chains that correspond to recognizable macro contexts, such as inflationary or yield-curve inversion phases, supporting causal interpretability and transparency. By operationalizing the principle that "financial history may not repeat, but it often rhymes," this work demonstrates that macro-aware retrieval yields robust, explainable forecasts under distributional change.

### [275] [Is nasty noise actually harder than malicious noise?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09763)
*Guy Blanc,Yizhi Huang,Tal Malkin,Rocco A. Servedio*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper explores how computationally efficient algorithms learn in the presence of adversarial noise under two models: malicious noise and nasty noise. A strong equivalence in the distribution-independent setting contrasts with an arbitrarily large separation in the fixed-distribution setting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding differences between malicious noise and nasty noise, and addressing the challenges of developing efficient learning algorithms in adversarial noisy environments.

Method: Analyzing Boolean function learnability under both noise models in distribution-independent and fixed-distribution scenarios. Introducing the ICE (Ignore Contradictory Examples) algorithm framework for mitigating negative outcomes.

Result: Proved equivalence of malicious and nasty noise in distribution-independent learning; highlighted significant disparity between their tolerances in the fixed-distribution setting; established ICE algorithms to reduce the impact of nasty noise with limitations.

Conclusion: Noise models behave equivalently or differ greatly depending on the learning setting, and ICE-based methods offer resilience with bounded limitations against adversarial noise.

Abstract: We consider the relative abilities and limitations of computationally efficient algorithms for learning in the presence of noise, under two well-studied and challenging adversarial noise models for learning Boolean functions: malicious noise, in which an adversary can arbitrarily corrupt a random subset of examples given to the learner; and nasty noise, in which an adversary can arbitrarily corrupt an adversarially chosen subset of examples given to the learner.
  We consider both the distribution-independent and fixed-distribution settings. Our main results highlight a dramatic difference between these two settings: For distribution-independent learning, we prove a strong equivalence between the two noise models: If a class ${\cal C}$ of functions is efficiently learnable in the presence of $η$-rate malicious noise, then it is also efficiently learnable in the presence of $η$-rate nasty noise. In sharp contrast, for the fixed-distribution setting we show an arbitrarily large separation: Under a standard cryptographic assumption, for any arbitrarily large value $r$ there exists a concept class for which there is a ratio of $r$ between the rate $η_{malicious}$ of malicious noise that polynomial-time learning algorithms can tolerate, versus the rate $η_{nasty}$ of nasty noise that such learning algorithms can tolerate.
  To offset the negative result for the fixed-distribution setting, we define a broad and natural class of algorithms, namely those that ignore contradictory examples (ICE). We show that for these algorithms, malicious noise and nasty noise are equivalent up to a factor of two in the noise rate: Any efficient ICE learner that succeeds with $η$-rate malicious noise can be converted to an efficient learner that succeeds with $η/2$-rate nasty noise. We further show that the above factor of two is necessary, again under a standard cryptographic assumption.

TL;DR: NeuroLingua advances automated sleep staging using CNN-Transformer architecture and Graph Convolutional Networks for multimodal fusion, achieving state-of-the-art performance on leading datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in automated sleep stage classification, including lack of temporal hierarchies, multimodal data fusion, and interpretability challenges.

Method: Sleep is conceptualized as a structured physiological language. CNN is used for tokenizing subwindows of epochs, followed by hierarchical modeling with dual Transformer layers and multimodal fusion via Graph Convolutional Networks.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art performance on Sleep-EDF dataset (85.3% accuracy) and competitive results on ISRUC dataset (81.9% accuracy), with improved per-class metrics and clinical event detection.

Conclusion: NeuroLingua introduces a novel framework that enhances sequence modeling and multimodal fusion, offering more interpretable and clinically relevant applications in sleep research.

Abstract: Automated sleep stage classification from polysomnography remains limited by the lack of expressive temporal hierarchies, challenges in multimodal EEG and EOG fusion, and the limited interpretability of deep learning models. We propose NeuroLingua, a language-inspired framework that conceptualizes sleep as a structured physiological language. Each 30-second epoch is decomposed into overlapping 3-second subwindows ("tokens") using a CNN-based tokenizer, enabling hierarchical temporal modeling through dual-level Transformers: intra-segment encoding of local dependencies and inter-segment integration across seven consecutive epochs (3.5 minutes) for extended context. Modality-specific embeddings from EEG and EOG channels are fused via a Graph Convolutional Network, facilitating robust multimodal integration. NeuroLingua is evaluated on the Sleep-EDF Expanded and ISRUC-Sleep datasets, achieving state-of-the-art results on Sleep-EDF (85.3% accuracy, 0.800 macro F1, and 0.796 Cohen's kappa) and competitive performance on ISRUC (81.9% accuracy, 0.802 macro F1, and 0.755 kappa), matching or exceeding published baselines in overall and per-class metrics. The architecture's attention mechanisms enhance the detection of clinically relevant sleep microevents, providing a principled foundation for future interpretability, explainability, and causal inference in sleep research. By framing sleep as a compositional language, NeuroLingua unifies hierarchical sequence modeling and multimodal fusion, advancing automated sleep staging toward more transparent and clinically meaningful applications.

*Nikolay Blagoev,Oğuzhan Ersoy,Lydia Yiyu Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces adversarial attacks targeting decentralised Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) systems and describes defense methods to prevent such attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As GRPO becomes widely used for post-training Large Language Models in decentralised environments, securing against adversarial attacks is essential.

Method: The authors simulate adversarial poisoning attacks on decentralised GRPO systems in math and coding tasks, followed by proposing two defense mechanisms tailored to training scenarios of same or different models across users.

Result: Empirical results showcase up to 100% success rates of poisoning attacks in 50 iterations, with defenses successfully stopping attacks at similar efficacy levels.

Conclusion: While decentralised GRPO is adaptable, it is vulnerable to malicious attacks. The study emphasizes the importance of deploying robust defenses to ensure secure post-training environments.

Abstract: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has demonstrated great utilization in post-training of Large Language Models (LLMs). In GRPO, prompts are answered by the model and, through reinforcement learning, preferred completions are learnt. Owing to the small communication volume, GRPO is inherently suitable for decentralised training as the prompts can be concurrently answered by multiple nodes and then exchanged in the forms of strings. In this work, we present the first adversarial attack in decentralised GRPO. We demonstrate that malicious parties can poison such systems by injecting arbitrary malicious tokens in benign models in both out-of-context and in-context attacks. Using empirical examples of math and coding tasks, we show that adversarial attacks can easily poison the benign nodes, polluting their local LLM post-training, achieving attack success rates up to 100% in as few as 50 iterations. We propose two ways to defend against these attacks, depending on whether all users train the same model or different models. We show that these defenses can achieve stop rates of up to 100%, making the attack impossible.

*Pablo Ruiz-Morales,Dries Vanoost,Davy Pissoort,Mathias Verbeke*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This research provides a theoretical rationale for why Joint-Embedding Predictive Architectures (JEPAs) can cluster time-series data by dynamic regimes, tying it to the Koopman operator's invariant subspace.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study seeks to understand why JEPAs cluster time-series data by their dynamical regimes in an unexplained way, connecting this behavior to dynamical systems theory.

Method: An idealized theoretical framework was proposed and tested on synthetic data, demonstrating that constraining the linear predictor of JEPAs enforces the encoder to learn invariant Koopman eigenfunctions.

Result: The findings confirm that JEPA's loss is minimized when the encoder represents Koopman eigenfunctions, and applying constraints selects interpretable solutions amidst mathematical equivalents.

Conclusion: This study offers insight into JEPA's unexplained behavior, connects self-supervised learning to dynamical systems, and suggests methods to improve time-series model robustness and interpretability.

Abstract: Joint-Embedding Predictive Architectures (JEPAs), a powerful class of self-supervised models, exhibit an unexplained ability to cluster time-series data by their underlying dynamical regimes. We propose a novel theoretical explanation for this phenomenon, hypothesizing that JEPA's predictive objective implicitly drives it to learn the invariant subspace of the system's Koopman operator. We prove that an idealized JEPA loss is minimized when the encoder represents the system's regime indicator functions, which are Koopman eigenfunctions. This theory was validated on synthetic data with known dynamics, demonstrating that constraining the JEPA's linear predictor to be a near-identity operator is the key inductive bias that forces the encoder to learn these invariants. We further discuss that this constraint is critical for selecting this interpretable solution from a class of mathematically equivalent but entangled optima, revealing the predictor's role in representation disentanglement. This work demystifies a key behavior of JEPAs, provides a principled connection between modern self-supervised learning and dynamical systems theory, and informs the design of more robust and interpretable time-series models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces CaReTS, a framework that enhances time series forecasting by integrating classification and regression tasks, providing interpretable and accurate predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing forecasting models excel in accuracy but lack interpretability in understanding temporal dynamics.

Method: The proposed CaReTS adopts a dual-stream architecture with classification and regression branches and utilizes uncertainty-aware multi-task loss for adaptability. Variants include CNN, LSTM, and Transformer-based implementations.

Result: CaReTS demonstrates superior forecasting accuracy and better trend classification than state-of-the-art methods on real-world data.

Conclusion: The dual-stream approach of CaReTS is effective at achieving both high accuracy and better trend interpretability, marking significant progress in time series forecasting.

Abstract: Recent advances in deep forecasting models have achieved remarkable performance, yet most approaches still struggle to provide both accurate predictions and interpretable insights into temporal dynamics. This paper proposes CaReTS, a novel multi-task learning framework that combines classification and regression tasks for multi-step time series forecasting problems. The framework adopts a dual-stream architecture, where a classification branch learns the stepwise trend into the future, while a regression branch estimates the corresponding deviations from the latest observation of the target variable. The dual-stream design provides more interpretable predictions by disentangling macro-level trends from micro-level deviations in the target variable. To enable effective learning in output prediction, deviation estimation, and trend classification, we design a multi-task loss with uncertainty-aware weighting to adaptively balance the contribution of each task. Furthermore, four variants (CaReTS1--4) are instantiated under this framework to incorporate mainstream temporal modelling encoders, including convolutional neural networks (CNNs), long short-term memory networks (LSTMs), and Transformers. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that CaReTS outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) algorithms in forecasting accuracy, while achieving higher trend classification performance.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents a dynamic systems approach to non-monotonic value decomposition in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), showing that IGM-consistent solutions are stable and outperforming monotonic baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of monotonicity constraints and algorithmic complexity in existing methods for achieving individual-global-max (IGM) consistency in MARL.

Method: The authors analyze learning dynamics using continuous-time gradient flow, proving that IGM-inconsistent equilibria are unstable and IGM-consistent solutions are stable attractors. They validate their method using experiments on synthetic games and MARL benchmarks.

Result: Unconstrained, non-monotonic factorization reliably recovers IGM-optimal solutions, consistently outperforming monotonic baselines in experiments.

Conclusion: Non-monotonic value decomposition is effective for achieving IGM consistency, and its performance can be enhanced by better temporal-difference targets and exploration strategies.

Abstract: Value decomposition is a central approach in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), enabling centralized training with decentralized execution by factorizing the global value function into local values. To ensure individual-global-max (IGM) consistency, existing methods either enforce monotonicity constraints, which limit expressive power, or adopt softer surrogates at the cost of algorithmic complexity. In this work, we present a dynamical systems analysis of non-monotonic value decomposition, modeling learning dynamics as continuous-time gradient flow. We prove that, under approximately greedy exploration, all zero-loss equilibria violating IGM consistency are unstable saddle points, while only IGM-consistent solutions are stable attractors of the learning dynamics. Extensive experiments on both synthetic matrix games and challenging MARL benchmarks demonstrate that unconstrained, non-monotonic factorization reliably recovers IGM-optimal solutions and consistently outperforms monotonic baselines. Additionally, we investigate the influence of temporal-difference targets and exploration strategies, providing actionable insights for the design of future value-based MARL algorithms.

### [281] [Constrained Best Arm Identification with Tests for Feasibility](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09808)
*Ting Cai,Kirthevasan Kandasamy*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses Best Arm Identification (BAI) under feasibility constraints, proposing an efficient, adaptive algorithm to identify the arm with the highest performance while satisfying constraints and proves its theoretical optimality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address real-world BAI scenarios where additional feasibility constraints are present, and performance and feasibility tests are conducted separately, reflecting practical applications like drug discovery.

Method: The method involves developing an algorithm that allows a decision-maker to test arm performance or feasibility independently and adaptively eliminates arms based on either infeasibility or poor performance.

Result: The proposed algorithm's sample complexity is analyzed and upper-bounded, showing it adapts to problem difficulties. It is proved to be asymptotically optimal, with empirical validation showing superior performance over existing BAI algorithms.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that the proposed algorithm is efficient, adaptive, and practically effective for feasible BAI in synthetic and real-world scenarios, especially under the fixed confidence setting.

Abstract: Best arm identification (BAI) aims to identify the highest-performance arm among a set of $K$ arms by collecting stochastic samples from each arm. In real-world problems, the best arm needs to satisfy additional feasibility constraints. While there is limited prior work on BAI with feasibility constraints, they typically assume the performance and constraints are observed simultaneously on each pull of an arm. However, this assumption does not reflect most practical use cases, e.g., in drug discovery, we wish to find the most potent drug whose toxicity and solubility are below certain safety thresholds. These safety experiments can be conducted separately from the potency measurement. Thus, this requires designing BAI algorithms that not only decide which arm to pull but also decide whether to test for the arm's performance or feasibility. In this work, we study feasible BAI which allows a decision-maker to choose a tuple $(i,\ell)$, where $i\in [K]$ denotes an arm and $\ell$ denotes whether she wishes to test for its performance ($\ell=0$) or any of its $N$ feasibility constraints ($\ell\in[N]$). We focus on the fixed confidence setting, which is to identify the \textit{feasible} arm with the \textit{highest performance}, with a probability of at least $1-δ$. We propose an efficient algorithm and upper-bound its sample complexity, showing our algorithm can naturally adapt to the problem's difficulty and eliminate arms by worse performance or infeasibility, whichever is easier. We complement this upper bound with a lower bound showing that our algorithm is \textit{asymptotically ($δ\rightarrow 0$) optimal}. Finally, we empirically show that our algorithm outperforms other state-of-the-art BAI algorithms in both synthetic and real-world datasets.

*Arthur Castello Branco de Oliveira,Dhruv Jatkar,Eduardo Sontag*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This study explores how the structure of neural networks impacts optimization landscapes, showing convergence properties for overparameterized models and focusing on saddle points' universality. It hints at generalization beyond linear activations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the relationship between neural network structure and optimization processes, especially for overparameterized models, as it can guide efficient training and convergence analysis.

Method: Analyzing gradient flow for overparameterized problems with linear activations, deriving universal structural features and introducing an imbalance metric for acceleration. Extending insights to sigmoidal activations through examples.

Result: Global convergence properties are derived for proper, real analytic cost functions. Key structural universality in overparameterized problems is demonstrated, and an imbalance metric is introduced for accelerated convergence.

Conclusion: The study reveals universal optimization features inherent to overparameterized neural networks and suggests applicability to non-linear cases for understanding training dynamics.

Abstract: This paper investigates how the compositional structure of neural networks shapes their optimization landscape and training dynamics. We analyze the gradient flow associated with overparameterized optimization problems, which can be interpreted as training a neural network with linear activations. Remarkably, we show that the global convergence properties can be derived for any cost function that is proper and real analytic. We then specialize the analysis to scalar-valued cost functions, where the geometry of the landscape can be fully characterized. In this setting, we demonstrate that key structural features -- such as the location and stability of saddle points -- are universal across all admissible costs, depending solely on the overparameterized representation rather than on problem-specific details. Moreover, we show that convergence can be arbitrarily accelerated depending on the initialization, as measured by an imbalance metric introduced in this work. Finally, we discuss how these insights may generalize to neural networks with sigmoidal activations, showing through a simple example which geometric and dynamical properties persist beyond the linear case.

### [283] [Learning Intersections of Halfspaces under Factorizable Distribution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09832)
*Ilias Diakonikolas,Mingchen Ma,Lisheng Ren,Christos Tzamos*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new algorithm for learning intersections of halfspaces that is polynomial in complexity and surpasses previous quasi-polynomial efforts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the central problem in computational learning theory of whether learning intersections of two or more halfspaces is possible in polynomial time relative to margin γ and dimensionality d.

Method: The method combines a novel duality framework analyzing moment tensor structures, Jennrich's Algorithm refinement, PCA on random tensor projections, and non-convex gradient descent optimization.

Result: The algorithm achieves polynomial runtime (poly(d, 1/γ)) for a class of factorizable distributions, overcoming previous challenges of correlational statistical query (CSQ) hardness and establishing a separation between CSQ and general SQ paradigms.

Conclusion: The new algorithm successfully broadens the scope of tractable cases while achieving efficient learning, making significant progress in computational learning theory regarding intersections of halfspaces.

Abstract: Learning intersections of halfspaces is a central problem in Computational Learning Theory. Even for just two halfspaces, it remains a major open question whether learning is possible in polynomial time with respect to the margin $γ$ of the data points and their dimensionality $d$. The best-known algorithms run in quasi-polynomial time $d^{O(\log(1/γ))}$, and it has been shown that this complexity is unavoidable for any algorithm relying solely on correlational statistical queries (CSQ).
  In this work, we introduce a novel algorithm that provably circumvents the CSQ hardness barrier. Our approach applies to a broad class of distributions satisfying a natural, previously studied, factorizability assumption. Factorizable distributions lie between distribution-specific and distribution-free settings, and significantly extend previously known tractable cases. Under these distributions, we show that CSQ-based methods still require quasipolynomial time even for weakly learning, whereas our algorithm achieves $poly(d,1/γ)$ time by leveraging more general statistical queries (SQ), establishing a strong separation between CSQ and SQ for this simple realizable PAC learning problem.
  Our result is grounded in a rigorous analysis utilizing a novel duality framework that characterizes the moment tensor structure induced by the marginal distributions. Building on these structural insights, we propose new, efficient learning algorithms. These algorithms combine a refined variant of Jennrich's Algorithm with PCA over random projections of the moment tensor, along with a gradient-descent-based non-convex optimization framework.

*Lequan Lin,Dai Shi,Andi Han,Feng Chen,Qiuzheng Chen,Jiawen Li,Zhaoyang Li,Jiyuan Li,Zhenbang Sun,Junbin Gao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces the ACT data pipeline, which combines LLMs as annotators and judges to enhance annotation quality efficiently while reducing human effort.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-quality labeled data is essential for supervised learning, but human annotation is costly and time-intensive; using LLMs for annotation hasn't reached human-level quality.

Method: The ACT data pipeline uses LLMs for annotation and error detection, focusing human review on suspicious cases while extending its applicability to NLP, CV, and multimodal domains with MLLMs.

Result: ACT improves annotation efficiency and quality, reducing the performance gap to less than 2% compared to fully human-annotated data, while cutting up to 90% of human costs.

Conclusion: ACT effectively reduces human annotation efforts while maintaining data quality and model performance across various domains, offering practical guidelines for implementation.

Abstract: Supervised learning relies on high-quality labeled data, but obtaining such data through human annotation is both expensive and time-consuming. Recent work explores using large language models (LLMs) for annotation, but LLM-generated labels still fall short of human-level quality. To address this problem, we propose the Annotation with Critical Thinking (ACT) data pipeline, where LLMs serve not only as annotators but also as judges to critically identify potential errors. Human effort is then directed towards reviewing only the most "suspicious" cases, significantly improving the human annotation efficiency. Our major contributions are as follows: (1) ACT is applicable to a wide range of domains, including natural language processing (NLP), computer vision (CV), and multimodal understanding, by leveraging multimodal-LLMs (MLLMs). (2) Through empirical studies, we derive 7 insights on how to enhance annotation quality while efficiently reducing the human cost, and then translate these findings into user-friendly guidelines. (3) We theoretically analyze how to modify the loss function so that models trained on ACT data achieve similar performance to those trained on fully human-annotated data. Our experiments show that the performance gap can be reduced to less than 2% on most benchmark datasets while saving up to 90% of human costs.

### [285] [ConSurv: Multimodal Continual Learning for Survival Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09853)
*Dianzhi Yu,Conghao Xiong,Yankai Chen,Wenqian Cui,Xinni Zhang,Yifei Zhang,Hao Chen,Joseph J. Y. Sung,Irwin King*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents ConSurv, a multimodal continual learning (MMCL) approach designed to enhance cancer survival prediction, focusing on mitigating catastrophic forgetting and handling interaction complexities within multimodal data inputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in cancer survival prediction, as static models are limited in adaptive learning from dynamic multimodal clinical data, and existing continual learning methods inadequately handle inter-modal interactions or catastrophic forgetting.

Method: The authors propose ConSurv which combines Multi-staged Mixture of Experts (MS-MoE) and Feature Constrained Replay (FCR) to preserve task knowledge and prevent forgetting within multimodal contexts. It also utilizes a new benchmark dataset, MSAIL.

Result: ConSurv outperforms existing methods by effectively addressing catastrophic forgetting and inter-modal challenges, as demonstrated through comprehensive evaluations on multimodal survival analysis.

Conclusion: ConSurv significantly advances continual learning in survival prediction by introducing a multimodal approach that leverages both modality-specific knowledge and shared insights across evolving datasets.

Abstract: Survival prediction of cancers is crucial for clinical practice, as it informs mortality risks and influences treatment plans. However, a static model trained on a single dataset fails to adapt to the dynamically evolving clinical environment and continuous data streams, limiting its practical utility. While continual learning (CL) offers a solution to learn dynamically from new datasets, existing CL methods primarily focus on unimodal inputs and suffer from severe catastrophic forgetting in survival prediction. In real-world scenarios, multimodal inputs often provide comprehensive and complementary information, such as whole slide images and genomics; and neglecting inter-modal correlations negatively impacts the performance. To address the two challenges of catastrophic forgetting and complex inter-modal interactions between gigapixel whole slide images and genomics, we propose ConSurv, the first multimodal continual learning (MMCL) method for survival analysis. ConSurv incorporates two key components: Multi-staged Mixture of Experts (MS-MoE) and Feature Constrained Replay (FCR). MS-MoE captures both task-shared and task-specific knowledge at different learning stages of the network, including two modality encoders and the modality fusion component, learning inter-modal relationships. FCR further enhances learned knowledge and mitigates forgetting by restricting feature deviation of previous data at different levels, including encoder-level features of two modalities and the fusion-level representations. Additionally, we introduce a new benchmark integrating four datasets, Multimodal Survival Analysis Incremental Learning (MSAIL), for comprehensive evaluation in the CL setting. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ConSurv outperforms competing methods across multiple metrics.

*James Jin Kang,Dang Bui,Thanh Pham,Huo-Chong Ling*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper surveys methods for machine unlearning in large language models, emphasizing the challenges in ensuring privacy and permanently forgetting sensitive information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The introduction of large language models into sensitive domains emphasizes the importance of ensuring privacy and the ability to permanently remove sensitive data, which current systems struggle to achieve effectively.

Method: The study reviews recent research on machine unlearning, focusing on techniques like differential privacy, homomorphic encryption, federated learning, ephemeral memory, and institutional safeguards such as audits and regulatory frameworks.

Result: The review highlights progress in the field while identifying challenges: fragmented methods, difficulty in verification, vulnerability to recovery, and the need for efficient retraining alternatives.

Conclusion: Efficient, robust, and verifiable unlearning techniques are essential to ensure privacy and establish trust in large language models, particularly for sensitive applications.

Abstract: The growing use of large language models in sensitive domains has exposed a critical weakness: the inability to ensure that private information can be permanently forgotten. Yet these systems still lack reliable mechanisms to guarantee that sensitive information can be permanently removed once it has been used. Retraining from the beginning is prohibitively costly, and existing unlearning methods remain fragmented, difficult to verify, and often vulnerable to recovery. This paper surveys recent research on machine unlearning for LLMs and considers how far current approaches can address these challenges. We review methods for evaluating whether forgetting has occurred, the resilience of unlearned models against adversarial attacks, and mechanisms that can support user trust when model complexity or proprietary limits restrict transparency. Technical solutions such as differential privacy, homomorphic encryption, federated learning, and ephemeral memory are examined alongside institutional safeguards including auditing practices and regulatory frameworks. The review finds steady progress, but robust and verifiable unlearning is still unresolved. Efficient techniques that avoid costly retraining, stronger defenses against adversarial recovery, and governance structures that reinforce accountability are needed if LLMs are to be deployed safely in sensitive applications. By integrating technical and organizational perspectives, this study outlines a pathway toward AI systems that can be required to forget, while maintaining both privacy and public trust.

### [287] [Uncertainty-Guided Checkpoint Selection for Reinforcement Finetuning of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09864)
*Manh Nguyen,Dung Nguyen,Dai Do,Svetha Venkatesh,Hung Le*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents an uncertainty-guided approach for selecting the best checkpoint during reinforcement learning fine-tuning of large language models to ensure better generalization and stability across checkpoints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the instability and high variance in reinforcement learning fine-tuning of large language models, as well as the challenges in selecting the best model during training without computational overheads or requiring an ideal validation set.

Method: The proposed method, Uncertainty-Guided Checkpoint Selection (UGCS), identifies hard question-answer pairs with high uncertainty and evaluates checkpoints based on their performance on these cases. It averages the top-uncertain sample rewards over a training window to produce a stable and discriminative signal, reducing computational costs.

Result: UGCS consistently selects checkpoints with stronger generalization across three datasets and LLMs, outperforming traditional selection methods based on training or validation performance.

Conclusion: The study concludes that low-uncertainty solutions for difficult tasks indicate a model's overall reliability and UGCS is a practical approach for reliable checkpoint selection in RL fine-tuning.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) finetuning is crucial to aligning large language models (LLMs), but the process is notoriously unstable and exhibits high variance across model checkpoints. In practice, selecting the best checkpoint is challenging: evaluating checkpoints on the validation set during training is computationally expensive and requires a good validation set, while relying on the final checkpoint provides no guarantee of good performance. We introduce an uncertainty-guided approach for checkpoint selection (UGCS) that avoids these pitfalls. Our method identifies hard question-answer pairs using per-sample uncertainty and ranks checkpoints by how well they handle these challenging cases. By averaging the rewards of the top-uncertain samples over a short training window, our method produces a stable and discriminative signal without additional forward passes or significant computation overhead. Experiments across three datasets and three LLMs demonstrate that it consistently identifies checkpoints with stronger generalization, outperforming traditional strategies such as relying on training or validation performance. These results highlight that models solving their hardest tasks with low uncertainty are the most reliable overall.

*Hyung-Jun Moon,Sung-Bae Cho*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel exemplar-free method for continual learning employing two complementary memories to improve task performance and feature integration while reducing interference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Continual learning struggles with leveraging inter-task relationships and avoiding redundant learning or overly differentiating features, necessitating a method that efficiently integrates knowledge and avoids interference.

Method: The approach combines two fully differentiable memories for shared and task-specific features, includes adaptive memory adjustments for new concepts, and uses orthogonal regularization to reduce task interference.

Result: Experiments show superiority over 14 state-of-the-art methods in class-incremental learning on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet with final accuracies of 55.13%, 37.24%, and 30.11% respectively.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively improves continual learning by leveraging knowledge integration and feature extraction, setting a new benchmark in the field.

Abstract: Continual learning methods used to force neural networks to process sequential tasks in isolation, preventing them from leveraging useful inter-task relationships and causing them to repeatedly relearn similar features or overly differentiate them. To address this problem, we propose a fully differentiable, exemplar-free expandable method composed of two complementary memories: One learns common features that can be used across all tasks, and the other combines the shared features to learn discriminative characteristics unique to each sample. Both memories are differentiable so that the network can autonomously learn latent representations for each sample. For each task, the memory adjustment module adaptively prunes critical slots and minimally expands capacity to accommodate new concepts, and orthogonal regularization enforces geometric separation between preserved and newly learned memory components to prevent interference. Experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet show that the proposed method outperforms 14 state-of-the-art methods for class-incremental learning, achieving final accuracies of 55.13\%, 37.24\%, and 30.11\%, respectively. Additional analysis confirms that, through effective integration and utilization of knowledge, the proposed method can increase average performance across sequential tasks, and it produces feature extraction results closest to the upper bound, thus establishing a new milestone in continual learning.

*Shengfei Wei,Suyuan Liu,Jun Wang,Ke Liang,Miaomiao Li,Lei Luo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces AFCF, a scalable framework for fair clustering with linear computational complexity for large datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the inefficiency of current fair clustering algorithms, which have quadratic or super-quadratic complexity, making them impractical for large datasets.

Method: Develop the Anchor-based Fair Clustering Framework (AFCF) utilizing anchor selection, an anchor graph with fairness constraints, and efficient optimization techniques.

Result: AFCF significantly improves the computational speed of fair clustering methods while maintaining fairness and clustering performance, as demonstrated on large-scale datasets.

Conclusion: AFCF bridges the gap between fairness and scalability in clustering by enabling efficient, fair clustering on large datasets with theoretical fairness guarantees.

Abstract: Fair clustering is crucial for mitigating bias in unsupervised learning, yet existing algorithms often suffer from quadratic or super-quadratic computational complexity, rendering them impractical for large-scale datasets. To bridge this gap, we introduce the Anchor-based Fair Clustering Framework (AFCF), a novel, general, and plug-and-play framework that empowers arbitrary fair clustering algorithms with linear-time scalability. Our approach first selects a small but representative set of anchors using a novel fair sampling strategy. Then, any off-the-shelf fair clustering algorithm can be applied to this small anchor set. The core of our framework lies in a novel anchor graph construction module, where we formulate an optimization problem to propagate labels while preserving fairness. This is achieved through a carefully designed group-label joint constraint, which we prove theoretically ensures that the fairness of the final clustering on the entire dataset matches that of the anchor clustering. We solve this optimization efficiently using an ADMM-based algorithm. Extensive experiments on multiple large-scale benchmarks demonstrate that AFCF drastically accelerates state-of-the-art methods, which reduces computational time by orders of magnitude while maintaining strong clustering performance and fairness guarantees.

*Xiaoda Wang,Kaiqiao Han,Yuhao Xu,Xiao Luo,Yizhou Sun,Wei Wang,Carl Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces SE-Diff, a model combining physiological simulations and clinical knowledge for realistic text-to-ECG generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of well-annotated ECG datasets and challenges in generating physiologically realistic and clinically relevant ECG signals.

Method: SE-Diff integrates an ODE-based ECG simulator into a diffusion model for physiological plausibility and uses an LLM-powered strategy for clinical knowledge enrichment.

Result: SE-Diff outperforms baselines in generating ECGs with higher fidelity and better text alignment, while also aiding downstream ECG classification tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed SE-Diff model enhances text-to-ECG generation by leveraging both physiological simulators and clinical experience, proving its efficacy in real-world applications.

Abstract: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a leading cause of mortality worldwide. Electrocardiograms (ECGs) are the most widely used non-invasive tool for cardiac assessment, yet large, well-annotated ECG corpora are scarce due to cost, privacy, and workflow constraints. Generating ECGs can be beneficial for the mechanistic understanding of cardiac electrical activity, enable the construction of large, heterogeneous, and unbiased datasets, and facilitate privacy-preserving data sharing. Generating realistic ECG signals from clinical context is important yet underexplored. Recent work has leveraged diffusion models for text-to-ECG generation, but two challenges remain: (i) existing methods often overlook the physiological simulator knowledge of cardiac activity; and (ii) they ignore broader, experience-based clinical knowledge grounded in real-world practice. To address these gaps, we propose SE-Diff, a novel physiological simulator and experience enhanced diffusion model for comprehensive ECG generation. SE-Diff integrates a lightweight ordinary differential equation (ODE)-based ECG simulator into the diffusion process via a beat decoder and simulator-consistent constraints, injecting mechanistic priors that promote physiologically plausible waveforms. In parallel, we design an LLM-powered experience retrieval-augmented strategy to inject clinical knowledge, providing more guidance for ECG generation. Extensive experiments on real-world ECG datasets demonstrate that SE-Diff improves both signal fidelity and text-ECG semantic alignment over baselines, proving its superiority for text-to-ECG generation. We further show that the simulator-based and experience-based knowledge also benefit downstream ECG classification.

*Weilin Wan,Fan Yi,Weizhong Zhang,Quan Zhou,Cheng Jin*

TL;DR: This paper introduces the SWaST mechanism to jointly apply weight pruning and coreset selection in deep neural networks to improve computational efficiency, overcoming challenges like critical double-loss for stable optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep neural networks demand high computational resources for training due to large model sizes and sample datasets. Existing methods like weight pruning and coreset selection are underutilized together, leaving room for improvement in training efficiency.

Method: The authors propose a SWaST (Simultaneous Weight and Sample Tailoring) mechanism that alternates between weight pruning and coreset selection while incorporating a state preservation mechanism to avoid critical double-loss and maintain model stability.

Result: SWaST shows a significant synergy between weight pruning and coreset selection, achieving accuracy gains up to 17.83% while reducing computational costs (FLOPs) by 10% to 90%.

Conclusion: Integrating weight pruning and coreset selection with SWaST enables computationally efficient training for neural networks while preserving performance, addressing key issues encountered in independent optimization approaches.

Abstract: Modern deep neural networks rely heavily on massive model weights and training samples, incurring substantial computational costs. Weight pruning and coreset selection are two emerging paradigms proposed to improve computational efficiency. In this paper, we first explore the interplay between redundant weights and training samples through a transparent analysis: redundant samples, particularly noisy ones, cause model weights to become unnecessarily overtuned to fit them, complicating the identification of irrelevant weights during pruning; conversely, irrelevant weights tend to overfit noisy data, undermining coreset selection effectiveness. To further investigate and harness this interplay in deep learning, we develop a Simultaneous Weight and Sample Tailoring mechanism (SWaST) that alternately performs weight pruning and coreset selection to establish a synergistic effect in training. During this investigation, we observe that when simultaneously removing a large number of weights and samples, a phenomenon we term critical double-loss can occur, where important weights and their supportive samples are mistakenly eliminated at the same time, leading to model instability and nearly irreversible degradation that cannot be recovered in subsequent training. Unlike classic machine learning models, this issue can arise in deep learning due to the lack of theoretical guarantees on the correctness of weight pruning and coreset selection, which explains why these paradigms are often developed independently. We mitigate this by integrating a state preservation mechanism into SWaST, enabling stable joint optimization. Extensive experiments reveal a strong synergy between pruning and coreset selection across varying prune rates and coreset sizes, delivering accuracy boosts of up to 17.83% alongside 10% to 90% FLOPs reductions.

TL;DR: PRISM is a dataset distillation method that uses diverse teacher models to solve biases from single-model approaches and enhances intra-class diversity in synthetic data, outperforming previous methods on ImageNet-1K.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dataset distillation methods often inherit biases from using a single teacher model, leading to homogeneous samples and limited generalization.

Method: PRISM uses diverse teacher architectures to supervise both logit-matching and batch-normalization alignment, separating their objectives to enhance diversity and scalability.

Result: PRISM outperforms single-teacher and multi-teacher distillation methods, like SRe2L and G-VBSM, under low- and mid-IPC regimes, producing more diverse synthetic data.

Conclusion: PRISM improves dataset distillation with richer intra-class diversity and better generalization, using a novel multi-teacher framework that decouples objectives.

Abstract: Dataset distillation (DD) promises compact yet faithful synthetic data, but existing approaches often inherit the inductive bias of a single teacher model. As dataset size increases, this bias drives generation toward overly smooth, homogeneous samples, reducing intra-class diversity and limiting generalization. We present PRISM (PRIors from diverse Source Models), a framework that disentangles architectural priors during synthesis. PRISM decouples the logit-matching and regularization objectives, supervising them with different teacher architectures: a primary model for logits and a stochastic subset for batch-normalization (BN) alignment. On ImageNet-1K, PRISM consistently and reproducibly outperforms single-teacher methods (e.g., SRe2L) and recent multi-teacher variants (e.g., G-VBSM) at low- and mid-IPC regimes. The generated data also show significantly richer intra-class diversity, as reflected by a notable drop in cosine similarity between features. We further analyze teacher selection strategies (pre- vs. intra-distillation) and introduce a scalable cross-class batch formation scheme for fast parallel synthesis. Code will be released after the review period.

*Jiazhen Chen,Xiuqin Liang,Sichao Fu,Zheng Ma,Weihua Ou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces M$^2$V-UGAD, a framework for detecting anomalies in graph data with missing attributes and structure, addressing key issues like cross-view interference and imputation bias.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current unsupervised GAD methods struggle with incomplete graph data, causing poor detection performance due to imputation bias and cross-view contamination. The goal is to develop a robust method for graph anomaly detection under incomplete data scenarios.

Method: The authors propose a dual-pathway encoder to reconstruct missing information independently for node attributes and graph structure, fuse the pathways in a joint latent space for anomaly separation, and introduce hard negative sampling to refine the decision boundary.

Result: M$^2$V-UGAD achieves superior anomaly detection performance compared to existing methods across varying missing data rates on seven benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: M$^2$V-UGAD proves effective in mitigating challenges of incomplete graph data, showcasing robustness and improved detection accuracy without relying on complete node information.

Abstract: Unsupervised graph anomaly detection (GAD) has received increasing attention in recent years, which aims to identify data anomalous patterns utilizing only unlabeled node information from graph-structured data. However, prevailing unsupervised GAD methods typically presuppose complete node attributes and structure information, a condition hardly satisfied in real-world scenarios owing to privacy, collection errors or dynamic node arrivals. Existing standard imputation schemes risk "repairing" rare anomalous nodes so that they appear normal, thereby introducing imputation bias into the detection process. In addition, when both node attributes and edges are missing simultaneously, estimation errors in one view can contaminate the other, causing cross-view interference that further undermines the detection performance. To overcome these challenges, we propose M$^2$V-UGAD, a multiple missing values-resistant unsupervised GAD framework on incomplete graphs. Specifically, a dual-pathway encoder is first proposed to independently reconstruct missing node attributes and graph structure, thereby preventing errors in one view from propagating to the other. The two pathways are then fused and regularized in a joint latent space so that normals occupy a compact inner manifold while anomalies reside on an outer shell. Lastly, to mitigate imputation bias, we sample latent codes just outside the normal region and decode them into realistic node features and subgraphs, providing hard negative examples that sharpen the decision boundary. Experiments on seven public benchmarks demonstrate that M$^2$V-UGAD consistently outperforms existing unsupervised GAD methods across varying missing rates.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address critical limitations in MLP-based time series forecasting related to weak seasonal signal loss, weight-sharing MLP constraints, and inadequate channel fusion.

Method: Utilizes adaptive fused dual-domain seasonal MLP, energy invariant attention mechanism, and dynamic capacity adjustment for improved model robustness and performance.

Result: MDMLP-EIA shows state-of-the-art prediction accuracy and computational efficiency across nine benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed MDMLP-EIA effectively overcomes existing challenges in time series forecasting, achieving superior scalability, robustness, and prediction results.

Abstract: Time series forecasting is essential across diverse domains. While MLP-based methods have gained attention for achieving Transformer-comparable performance with fewer parameters and better robustness, they face critical limitations including loss of weak seasonal signals, capacity constraints in weight-sharing MLPs, and insufficient channel fusion in channel-independent strategies. To address these challenges, we propose MDMLP-EIA (Multi-domain Dynamic MLPs with Energy Invariant Attention) with three key innovations. First, we develop an adaptive fused dual-domain seasonal MLP that categorizes seasonal signals into strong and weak components. It employs an adaptive zero-initialized channel fusion strategy to minimize noise interference while effectively integrating predictions. Second, we introduce an energy invariant attention mechanism that adaptively focuses on different feature channels within trend and seasonal predictions across time steps. This mechanism maintains constant total signal energy to align with the decomposition-prediction-reconstruction framework and enhance robustness against disturbances. Third, we propose a dynamic capacity adjustment mechanism for channel-independent MLPs. This mechanism scales neuron count with the square root of channel count, ensuring sufficient capacity as channels increase. Extensive experiments across nine benchmark datasets demonstrate that MDMLP-EIA achieves state-of-the-art performance in both prediction accuracy and computational efficiency.

Motivation: To address the limitations of existing EEG models that are task-specific and lack generalizability for multi-task and continuous EEG analysis.

Method: EEGAgent employs large language models to coordinate a set of tools designed for preprocessing, feature extraction, event detection, spatiotemporal exploration, and other EEG-related functions.

Result: EEGAgent demonstrated flexible and interpretable EEG analysis across various tasks, validated on public datasets.

Conclusion: EEGAgent shows strong potential in clinical and real-world EEG applications, advancing general-purpose and scalable brain activity analysis.

Abstract: Scalable and generalizable analysis of brain activity is essential for advancing both clinical diagnostics and cognitive research. Electroencephalography (EEG), a non-invasive modality with high temporal resolution, has been widely used for brain states analysis. However, most existing EEG models are usually tailored for individual specific tasks, limiting their utility in realistic scenarios where EEG analysis often involves multi-task and continuous reasoning. In this work, we introduce EEGAgent, a general-purpose framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to schedule and plan multiple tools to automatically complete EEG-related tasks. EEGAgent is capable of performing the key functions: EEG basic information perception, spatiotemporal EEG exploration, EEG event detection, interaction with users, and EEG report generation. To realize these capabilities, we design a toolbox composed of different tools for EEG preprocessing, feature extraction, event detection, etc. These capabilities were evaluated on public datasets, and our EEGAgent can support flexible and interpretable EEG analysis, highlighting its potential for real-world clinical applications.

*Pengqian Lu,Jie Lu,Anjin Liu,En Yu,Guangquan Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a dynamic threshold for drift detection, aiming to improve model performance compared to using fixed thresholds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current drift detection methods are limited by their reliance on a fixed threshold, which impacts model performance due to its sensitivity over time.

Method: The authors proved theoretically that a dynamic threshold outperforms fixed ones, and introduced a Dynamic Threshold Determination algorithm to adjust thresholds based on data segments.

Result: Experimental validation showed the dynamic threshold improves performance across various synthetic and real-world datasets for drift detection.

Conclusion: Dynamic thresholding enhances drift detection and can outperform traditional fixed-threshold approaches.

Abstract: Existing drift detection methods focus on designing sensitive test statistics. They treat the detection threshold as a fixed hyperparameter, set once to balance false alarms and late detections, and applied uniformly across all datasets and over time. However, maintaining model performance is the key objective from the perspective of machine learning, and we observe that model performance is highly sensitive to this threshold. This observation inspires us to investigate whether a dynamic threshold could be provably better. In this paper, we prove that a threshold that adapts over time can outperform any single fixed threshold. The main idea of the proof is that a dynamic strategy, constructed by combining the best threshold from each individual data segment, is guaranteed to outperform any single threshold that apply to all segments. Based on the theorem, we propose a Dynamic Threshold Determination algorithm. It enhances existing drift detection frameworks with a novel comparison phase to inform how the threshold should be adjusted. Extensive experiments on a wide range of synthetic and real-world datasets, including both image and tabular data, validate that our approach substantially enhances the performance of state-of-the-art drift detectors.

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of AI-generated content (AIGC) has reshaped the dynamics of digital marketing and online consumer behavior. However, predicting the diffusion trajectory and market impact of such content remains challenging due to data heterogeneity, non linear propagation mechanisms, and evolving consumer interactions. This study proposes an AI driven Decision Support System (DSS) that integrates multi source data including social media streams, marketing expenditure records, consumer engagement logs, and sentiment dynamics using a hybrid Graph Neural Network (GNN) and Temporal Transformer framework. The model jointly learns the content diffusion structure and temporal influence evolution through a dual channel architecture, while causal inference modules disentangle the effects of marketing stimuli on return on investment (ROI) and market visibility. Experiments on large scale real-world datasets collected from multiple online platforms such as Twitter, TikTok, and YouTube advertising show that our system outperforms existing baselines in all six metrics. The proposed DSS enhances marketing decisions by providing interpretable real-time insights into AIGC driven content dissemination and market growth patterns.

*Dimitrios Sinodinos,Jack Yi Wei,Narges Armanfard*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces MultiTab-Net, a multitask transformer architecture for large tabular datasets, displaying superior performance compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the limitations of existing multitask learning (MTL) approaches in efficiently handling tabular data, especially with disparate targets, and leveraging transformers' scalability and ability in capturing complex feature interactions.

Method: The paper proposes MultiTab-Net, incorporating a multitask masked-attention mechanism to dynamically model feature dependencies while mitigating task competition.

Result: Through experiments across various domains, MultiTab-Net demonstrates enhanced multitask generalization and gains over traditional MTL architectures and single-task models. Additionally, MultiTab-Bench facilitates systematic evaluation of multitask dynamics.

Conclusion: MultiTab-Net succeeds in broadening the scope of multitask transformer architectures for tabular data, proving its effectiveness across diverse datasets. The work advances MTL and provides new tools for evaluation.

Abstract: Tabular data is the most abundant data type in the world, powering systems in finance, healthcare, e-commerce, and beyond. As tabular datasets grow and span multiple related targets, there is an increasing need to exploit shared task information for improved multitask generalization. Multitask learning (MTL) has emerged as a powerful way to improve generalization and efficiency, yet most existing work focuses narrowly on large-scale recommendation systems, leaving its potential in broader tabular domains largely underexplored. Also, existing MTL approaches for tabular data predominantly rely on multi-layer perceptron-based backbones, which struggle to capture complex feature interactions and often fail to scale when data is abundant, a limitation that transformer architectures have overcome in other domains. Motivated by this, we introduce MultiTab-Net, the first multitask transformer architecture specifically designed for large tabular data. MultiTab-Net employs a novel multitask masked-attention mechanism that dynamically models feature-feature dependencies while mitigating task competition. Through extensive experiments, we show that MultiTab-Net consistently achieves higher multitask gain than existing MTL architectures and single-task transformers across diverse domains including large-scale recommendation data, census-like socioeconomic data, and physics datasets, spanning a wide range of task counts, task types, and feature modalities. In addition, we contribute MultiTab-Bench, a generalized multitask synthetic dataset generator that enables systematic evaluation of multitask dynamics by tuning task count, task correlations, and relative task complexity.

TL;DR: The paper investigates using AI Feynman symbolic regression to recover the Equation of the Centre in astronomy, showcasing successes and limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To discover and validate physical laws from data using AI systems, aiming to automate and optimize processes in physics and astronomy.

Method: AI Feynman symbolic regression was supported by observational biases and data preprocessing to reflect a system's physical nature. Extension proposes automating preprocessing to optimize coordinate system selection.

Result: The algorithm successfully recovered the Equation of the Centre, but emphasized challenges in embedding domain knowledge and achieving automation.

Conclusion: Embedding domain-specific knowledge enhances symbolic regression's ability to derive physical laws, but limitations remain regarding reliance on expert input and targeted biases.

Abstract: This work explores using the physics-inspired AI Feynman symbolic regression algorithm to automatically rediscover a fundamental equation in astronomy -- the Equation of the Centre. Through the introduction of observational and inductive biases corresponding to the physical nature of the system through data preprocessing and search space restriction, AI Feynman was successful in recovering the first-order analytical form of this equation from lunar ephemerides data. However, this manual approach highlights a key limitation in its reliance on expert-driven coordinate system selection. We therefore propose an automated preprocessing extension to find the canonical coordinate system. Results demonstrate that targeted domain knowledge embedding enables symbolic regression to rediscover physical laws, but also highlight further challenges in constraining symbolic regression to derive physics equations when leveraging domain knowledge through tailored biases.

### [300] [Towards Robust Multimodal Learning in the Open World](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09989)
*Fushuo Huo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores the challenge of enhancing multimodal learning robustness in open-world settings with unpredictable dynamics and incomplete data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of current neural network models in handling multimodal signals robustly within unpredictable, real-world environments.

Method: It investigates and focuses on methods to bridge the robustness gap between controlled environments and open-world deployment of multimodal learning systems.

Result: A better understanding or framework for improving the reliability of multimodal learning models in open-world scenarios.

Conclusion: Bridging this robustness gap is essential for the practical application of multimodal learning in real-world, dynamic, and ambiguous conditions.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of machine learning has propelled neural networks to unprecedented success across diverse domains. In particular, multimodal learning has emerged as a transformative paradigm, leveraging complementary information from heterogeneous data streams (e.g., text, vision, audio) to advance contextual reasoning and intelligent decision-making. Despite these advancements, current neural network-based models often fall short in open-world environments characterized by inherent unpredictability, where unpredictable environmental composition dynamics, incomplete modality inputs, and spurious distributions relations critically undermine system reliability. While humans naturally adapt to such dynamic, ambiguous scenarios, artificial intelligence systems exhibit stark limitations in robustness, particularly when processing multimodal signals under real-world complexity. This study investigates the fundamental challenge of multimodal learning robustness in open-world settings, aiming to bridge the gap between controlled experimental performance and practical deployment requirements.

*Hui Dou,Lei Jin,Yuxuan Zhou,Jiang He,Yiwen Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces DemoTuner, a novel framework leveraging reinforcement learning and large language models (LLMs) for optimizing DBMS knob tuning, significantly improving tuning performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DBMS performance depends on tuning performance-critical knobs, a manual and inefficient task due to its high complexity; existing RL-based methods face issues with slow offline training.

Method: DemoTuner utilizes LLMs for extracting tuning hints from textual documents and integrates these hints with a new reinforcement learning algorithm, HA-DDPGfD, to optimize RL training efficiency.

Result: Experiments on MySQL and PostgreSQL demonstrate DemoTuner's improved performance, reduced tuning costs, and adaptability to unknown workloads compared to existing methods (DB-BERT, GPTuner, CDBTune).

Conclusion: DemoTuner is the first system to integrate demonstration reinforcement learning for DBMS tuning, showcasing its effectiveness in improving tuning outcomes and lowering costs.

Abstract: The performance of modern DBMSs such as MySQL and PostgreSQL heavily depends on the configuration of performance-critical knobs. Manual tuning these knobs is laborious and inefficient due to the complex and high-dimensional nature of the configuration space. Among the automated tuning methods, reinforcement learning (RL)-based methods have recently sought to improve the DBMS knobs tuning process from several different perspectives. However, they still encounter challenges with slow convergence speed during offline training. In this paper, we mainly focus on how to leverage the valuable tuning hints contained in various textual documents such as DBMS manuals and web forums to improve the offline training of RL-based methods. To this end, we propose an efficient DBMS knobs tuning framework named DemoTuner via a novel LLM-assisted demonstration reinforcement learning method. Specifically, to comprehensively and accurately mine tuning hints from documents, we design a structured chain of thought prompt to employ LLMs to conduct a condition-aware tuning hints extraction task. To effectively integrate the mined tuning hints into RL agent training, we propose a hint-aware demonstration reinforcement learning algorithm HA-DDPGfD in DemoTuner. As far as we know, DemoTuner is the first work to introduce the demonstration reinforcement learning algorithm for DBMS knobs tuning. Experimental evaluations conducted on MySQL and PostgreSQL across various workloads demonstrate the significant advantages of DemoTuner in both performance improvement and online tuning cost reduction over three representative baselines including DB-BERT, GPTuner and CDBTune. Additionally, DemoTuner also exhibits superior adaptability to application scenarios with unknown workloads.

### [302] [Interaction as Interference: A Quantum-Inspired Aggregation Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10018)
*Pilsung Kang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a quantum-inspired method for understanding and controlling interactions in models using coherent aggregation and interference kernel classifier (IKC).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches have limited control over how interactions such as synergy or antagonism occur. This work introduces a quantum-inspired perspective to offer mechanism-level control.

Method: The paper adopts quantum-inspired coherent aggregation where complex amplitudes are summed before squaring, creating interference cross-terms. It proposes the IKC model and diagnostics like Coherent Gain and Interference Information.

Result: In synthetic and real data tasks, IKC performs competitively, showcasing improvements in metrics like negative log-likelihood, Brier score, and expected calibration error especially under coherent aggregation.

Conclusion: The quantum-inspired approach provides unique insights into interaction control mechanisms, demonstrating advantages in specific applications despite being competitive rather than superior on real tabular datasets.

Abstract: Classical approaches often treat interaction as engineered product terms or as emergent patterns in flexible models, offering little control over how synergy or antagonism arises. We take a quantum-inspired view: following the Born rule (probability as squared amplitude), \emph{coherent} aggregation sums complex amplitudes before squaring, creating an interference cross-term, whereas an \emph{incoherent} proxy sums squared magnitudes and removes it. In a minimal linear-amplitude model, this cross-term equals the standard potential-outcome interaction contrast \(Δ_{\mathrm{INT}}\) in a \(2\times 2\) factorial design, giving relative phase a direct, mechanism-level control over synergy versus antagonism.
  We instantiate this idea in a lightweight \emph{Interference Kernel Classifier} (IKC) and introduce two diagnostics: \emph{Coherent Gain} (log-likelihood gain of coherent over the incoherent proxy) and \emph{Interference Information} (the induced Kullback-Leibler gap). A controlled phase sweep recovers the identity. On a high-interaction synthetic task (XOR), IKC outperforms strong baselines under paired, budget-matched comparisons; on real tabular data (\emph{Adult} and \emph{Bank Marketing}) it is competitive overall but typically trails the most capacity-rich baseline in paired differences. Holding learned parameters fixed, toggling aggregation from incoherent to coherent consistently improves negative log-likelihood, Brier score, and expected calibration error, with positive Coherent Gain on both datasets.

### [303] [GraphSB: Boosting Imbalanced Node Classification on Graphs through Structural Balance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10022)
*Chaofan Zhu,Xiaobing Rui,Zhixiao Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses imbalanced node classification in graph learning and proposes a framework called Graph Structural Balance (GraphSB) to handle this issue through structure optimization before node synthesis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to combat the challenge of imbalanced node classification in graph learning, particularly focusing on addressing the inherent imbalance in graph structure, which was not adequately tackled by previous methods.

Method: The proposed method, GraphSB, includes a two-stage structure optimization: (1) Structure Enhancement to build similarity-based edges for better minority-class node connectivity, and (2) Relation Diffusion to capture higher-order dependencies and emphasize signals from minority classes.

Result: GraphSB outperforms state-of-the-art methods in experiments. Additionally, its Structural Balance module can increase the accuracy of existing methods by an average of 3.67%.

Conclusion: GraphSB effectively addresses structural imbalances in graph learning, improving GNN performance and providing a simple, adaptable module for integration into other methods.

Abstract: Imbalanced node classification is a critical challenge in graph learning, where most existing methods typically utilize Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to learn node representations. These methods can be broadly categorized into the data-level and the algorithm-level. The former aims to synthesize minority-class nodes to mitigate quantity imbalance, while the latter tries to optimize the learning process to highlight minority classes. However, neither category addresses the inherently imbalanced graph structure, which is a fundamental factor that incurs majority-class dominance and minority-class assimilation in GNNs. Our theoretical analysis further supports this critical insight. Therefore, we propose GraphSB (Graph Structural Balance), a novel framework that incorporates Structural Balance as a key strategy to address the underlying imbalanced graph structure before node synthesis. Structural Balance performs a two-stage structure optimization: Structure Enhancement that adaptively builds similarity-based edges to strengthen connectivity of minority-class nodes, and Relation Diffusion that captures higher-order dependencies while amplifying signals from minority classes. Thus, GraphSB balances structural distribution before node synthesis, enabling more effective learning in GNNs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GraphSB significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. More importantly, the proposed Structural Balance can be seamlessly integrated into state-of-the-art methods as a simple plug-and-play module, increasing their accuracy by an average of 3.67\%.

*Noam Koren,Ralf J. J. Mackenbach,Ruud J. G. van Sloun,Kira Radinsky,Daniel Freedman*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces SVD-NO, a neural operator leveraging singular-value decomposition for solving partial differential equations (PDEs), achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current neural operators for PDEs make strong assumptions limiting expressivity, creating a need for more flexible methods.

Method: SVD-NO explicitly parameterizes the integral operators' kernel using its singular-value decomposition, with lightweight networks learning singular functions and a diagonal matrix for singular values.

Result: SVD-NO consistently achieves state-of-the-art results across five diverse benchmark equations, particularly excelling with highly spatially variable PDE solutions.

Conclusion: SVD-NO is a highly expressive and computationally efficient neural operator for solving PDEs, offering practical advantages and significant performance improvements. Its publicly available code promotes accessibility for further usage.

Abstract: Neural operators have emerged as a promising paradigm for learning solution operators of partial differential equa- tions (PDEs) directly from data. Existing methods, such as those based on Fourier or graph techniques, make strong as- sumptions about the structure of the kernel integral opera- tor, assumptions which may limit expressivity. We present SVD-NO, a neural operator that explicitly parameterizes the kernel by its singular-value decomposition (SVD) and then carries out the integral directly in the low-rank basis. Two lightweight networks learn the left and right singular func- tions, a diagonal parameter matrix learns the singular values, and a Gram-matrix regularizer enforces orthonormality. As SVD-NO approximates the full kernel, it obtains a high de- gree of expressivity. Furthermore, due to its low-rank struc- ture the computational complexity of applying the operator remains reasonable, leading to a practical system. In exten- sive evaluations on five diverse benchmark equations, SVD- NO achieves a new state of the art. In particular, SVD-NO provides greater performance gains on PDEs whose solutions are highly spatially variable. The code of this work is publicly available at https://github.com/2noamk/SVDNO.git.

### [305] [Temporal Latent Variable Structural Causal Model for Causal Discovery under External Interferences](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10031)
*Ruichu Cai,Xiaokai Huang,Wei Chen,Zijian Li,Zhifeng Hao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a temporal latent variable causal model to infer causal relationships from data with external interferences, while utilizing variational inference and optional expert knowledge for parameter learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inferring causal relationships is essential but challenging due to external interferences that are unknown and affect observed variables. This motivates the need for a method that accounts for these interferences using latent variables.

Method: A temporal latent variable structural causal model is proposed, which incorporates causal strength and adjacency coefficients. It uses variational inference and allows for integration of expert knowledge to guide parameter learning.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate the proposed method provides stable and accurate causal inference.

Conclusion: The method effectively handles external interferences in causal inference by leveraging latent variables, variational inference, and expert knowledge, achieving reliable performance.

Abstract: Inferring causal relationships from observed data is an important task, yet it becomes challenging when the data is subject to various external interferences. Most of these interferences are the additional effects of external factors on observed variables. Since these external factors are often unknown, we introduce latent variables to represent these unobserved factors that affect the observed data. Specifically, to capture the causal strength and adjacency information, we propose a new temporal latent variable structural causal model, incorporating causal strength and adjacency coefficients that represent the causal relationships between variables. Considering that expert knowledge can provide information about unknown interferences in certain scenarios, we develop a method that facilitates the incorporation of prior knowledge into parameter learning based on Variational Inference, to guide the model estimation. Experimental results demonstrate the stability and accuracy of our proposed method.

### [306] [BuddyMoE: Exploiting Expert Redundancy to Accelerate Memory-Constrained Mixture-of-Experts Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10054)
*Yun Wang,Lingyun Yang,Senhao Yu,Yixiao Wang,Ruixing Li,Zhixiang Wei,James Yen,Zhengwei Qi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models scale language models by activating subsets of networks for tokens but face GPU memory issues. Current methods offload experts to CPUs but suffer latency due to PCIe interconnect issues. Solutions involve prefetching heuristics, but failure causes performance or accuracy risks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the scaling of language models using MoE while overcoming challenges of GPU memory capacity and inference latency.

Method: Prefetching heuristics to predict expert activation, improving latency management during model inference.

Result: Offloading inactive experts to CPU memory incurs latency of approximately 10ms and prefetch failures have a significant impact on overall performance.

Conclusion: Balancing inference speed and model accuracy is crucial, especially when prefetching fails, requiring innovative approaches to solve computational memory constraints.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures scale language models by activating only a subset of specialized expert networks for each input token, thereby reducing the number of floating-point operations. However, the growing size of modern MoE models causes their full parameter sets to exceed GPU memory capacity; for example, Mixtral-8x7B has 45 billion parameters and requires 87 GB of memory even though only 14 billion parameters are used per token. Existing systems alleviate this limitation by offloading inactive experts to CPU memory, but transferring experts across the PCIe interconnect incurs significant latency (about 10 ms). Prefetching heuristics aim to hide this latency by predicting which experts are needed, but prefetch failures introduce significant stalls and amplify inference latency. In the event of a prefetch failure, prior work offers two primary solutions: either fetch the expert on demand, which incurs a long stall due to the PCIe bottleneck, or drop the expert from the computation, which significantly degrades model accuracy. The critical challenge, therefore, is to maintain both high inference speed and model accuracy when prefetching fails.

*Zijing Liu,Bin Feng,He Cao,Yu Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores using structural tokens in protein structure modeling, identifies semantic redundancy in representations, and introduces a method to model protein flexibility using synonym swaps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and improve discrete representations of protein structures and address the semantic redundancy while achieving efficient protein dynamics modeling.

Method: The authors analyzed structural tokens with a language model, leveraged rich sequence embeddings, and developed a computational strategy called 'synonym swap' to perturb predicted structures using structural synonyms.

Result: The method demonstrated the generation of diverse conformational ensembles and showed competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art models in recapitulating protein flexibility.

Conclusion: The paper advances understanding of protein structure tokenization and presents a novel lightweight approach to model protein dynamics effectively.

Abstract: Protein structure tokenization converts 3D structures into discrete or vectorized representations, enabling the integration of structural and sequence data. Despite many recent works on structure tokenization, the properties of the underlying discrete representations are not well understood. In this work, we first demonstrate that the successful utilization of structural tokens in a language model for structure prediction depends on using rich, pre-trained sequence embeddings to bridge the semantic gap between the sequence and structural "language". The analysis of the structural vocabulary itself then reveals significant semantic redundancy, where multiple distinct tokens correspond to nearly identical local geometries, acting as "structural synonyms". This redundancy, rather than being a flaw, can be exploited with a simple "synonym swap" strategy to generate diverse conformational ensembles by perturbing a predicted structure with its structural synonyms. This computationally lightweight method accurately recapitulates protein flexibility, performing competitively with state-of-the-art models. Our study provides fundamental insights into the nature of discrete protein structure representations and introduces a powerful, near-instantaneous method for modeling protein dynamics.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces FAQNAS, a framework for optimizing Hybrid Quantum Neural Networks by balancing accuracy and computational cost, using FLOPs as a metric.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of training Hybrid Quantum Neural Networks efficiently in the NISQ era, especially when classical simulators are limited by runtime and scalability.

Method: FAQNAS formulates neural architecture search as a multi-objective optimization problem that incorporates accuracy and FLOPs, focusing on reducing computational costs while maintaining performance.

Result: Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that FAQNAS achieves competitive accuracy with significantly reduced computational cost compared to baseline methods.

Conclusion: FAQNAS establishes FLOPs-awareness as a practical and scalable principle for efficiently designing HQNNs in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum era.

Abstract: Hybrid Quantum Neural Networks (HQNNs), which combine parameterized quantum circuits with classical neural layers, are emerging as promising models in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era. While quantum circuits are not naturally measured in floating point operations (FLOPs), most HQNNs (in NISQ era) are still trained on classical simulators where FLOPs directly dictate runtime and scalability. Hence, FLOPs represent a practical and viable metric to measure the computational complexity of HQNNs. In this work, we introduce FAQNAS, a FLOPs-aware neural architecture search (NAS) framework that formulates HQNN design as a multi-objective optimization problem balancing accuracy and FLOPs. Unlike traditional approaches, FAQNAS explicitly incorporates FLOPs into the optimization objective, enabling the discovery of architectures that achieve strong performance while minimizing computational cost. Experiments on five benchmark datasets (MNIST, Digits, Wine, Breast Cancer, and Iris) show that quantum FLOPs dominate accuracy improvements, while classical FLOPs remain largely fixed. Pareto-optimal solutions reveal that competitive accuracy can often be achieved with significantly reduced computational cost compared to FLOPs-agnostic baselines. Our results establish FLOPs-awareness as a practical criterion for HQNN design in the NISQ era and as a scalable principle for future HQNN systems.

*Shuxin Zhuang,Linjian Meng,Shuxin Li,Minming Li,Youzhi Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Tree-based Stochastic Optimization (TSO) for solving Urban Network Security Games (UNSGs) by efficiently dealing with large action spaces and improving solution quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing Urban Network Security Games (UNSGs) is critical for urban safety, but existing methods face challenges in handling large and combinatorial action spaces effectively.

Method: The approach utilizes a tree-based action representation for the entire action space, incorporates it into the loss function, and employs a sample-and-prune mechanism to avoid suboptimal solutions.

Result: TSO outperforms baseline algorithms in solving UNSGs, as shown by extensive experimental results.

Conclusion: TSO effectively addresses the challenges posed by large-scale UNSGs, providing a promising solution with better performance compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Urban Network Security Games (UNSGs), which model the strategic allocation of limited security resources on city road networks, are critical for urban safety. However, finding a Nash Equilibrium (NE) in large-scale UNSGs is challenging due to their massive and combinatorial action spaces. One common approach to addressing these games is the Policy-Space Response Oracle (PSRO) framework, which requires computing best responses (BR) at each iteration. However, precisely computing exact BRs is impractical in large-scale games, and employing reinforcement learning to approximate BRs inevitably introduces errors, which limits the overall effectiveness of the PSRO methods. Recent advancements in leveraging non-convex stochastic optimization to approximate an NE offer a promising alternative to the burdensome BR computation. However, utilizing existing stochastic optimization techniques with an unbiased loss function for UNSGs remains challenging because the action spaces are too vast to be effectively represented by neural networks. To address these issues, we introduce Tree-based Stochastic Optimization (TSO), a framework that bridges the gap between the stochastic optimization paradigm for NE-finding and the demands of UNSGs. Specifically, we employ the tree-based action representation that maps the whole action space onto a tree structure, addressing the challenge faced by neural networks in representing actions when the action space cannot be enumerated. We then incorporate this representation into the loss function and theoretically demonstrate its equivalence to the unbiased loss function. To further enhance the quality of the converged solution, we introduce a sample-and-prune mechanism that reduces the risk of being trapped in suboptimal local optima. Extensive experimental results indicate the superiority of TSO over other baseline algorithms in addressing the UNSGs.

*Leonardo Pesce,Jiawen Wei,Gianmarco Mengaldo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel adversarial attack against post-hoc explainability methods in machine learning for the image domain, targeting their robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper investigates the reliability of post-hoc explainability methods in safety-critical applications due to their vulnerability to adversarial attacks.

Method: The authors propose a black-box, model-agnostic adversarial attack that modifies explanations significantly in one step, targeting saliency maps, integrated gradients, and DeepLIFT SHAP methods without altering model predictions.

Result: Experiments using ResNet-18 and ViT-B16 on ImageNet showed that the attack leads to vastly altered explanations while maintaining the original class probabilities. Metrics like SSIM validate minimal visual differences in the modified images.

Conclusion: The findings highlight a critical vulnerability in existing post-hoc XAI methods, emphasizing the need for enhanced robustness, especially in applications where reliability is paramount.

Abstract: Post-hoc explainability methods are a subset of Machine Learning (ML) that aim to provide a reason for why a model behaves in a certain way. In this paper, we show a new black-box model-agnostic adversarial attack for post-hoc explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), particularly in the image domain. The goal of the attack is to modify the original explanations while being undetected by the human eye and maintain the same predicted class. In contrast to previous methods, we do not require any access to the model or its weights, but only to the model's computed predictions and explanations. Additionally, the attack is accomplished in a single step while significantly changing the provided explanations, as demonstrated by empirical evaluation. The low requirements of our method expose a critical vulnerability in current explainability methods, raising concerns about their reliability in safety-critical applications. We systematically generate attacks based on the explanations generated by post-hoc explainability methods (saliency maps, integrated gradients, and DeepLIFT SHAP) for pretrained ResNet-18 and ViT-B16 on ImageNet. The results show that our attacks could lead to dramatically different explanations without changing the predictive probabilities. We validate the effectiveness of our attack, compute the induced change based on the explanation with mean absolute difference, and verify the closeness of the original image and the corrupted one with the Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM).

TL;DR: The paper evaluates biases in popular text-to-image generative models, identifying tendencies to amplify stereotypes, and proposes strategies for responsible AI use.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address concerns about societal biases in T2I generative models which can reproduce and amplify stereotypes, potentially conflicting with ethical AI principles.

Method: Analyzed 5 popular open-source T2I models using neutral prompts related to professions, generating a dataset of 5,000 images evaluated by diverse human assessors from different races and genders.

Result: Found systematic biases; certain professions were skewed by gender and race stereotypes, with varying patterns across different models.

Conclusion: Highlights the risks in T2I model biases, providing insights and strategies to mitigate societal stereotypes for equitable AI deployment.

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) generative models are largely used in AI-powered real-world applications and value creation. However, their strategic deployment raises critical concerns for responsible AI management, particularly regarding the reproduction and amplification of race- and gender-related stereotypes that can undermine organizational ethics. In this work, we investigate whether such societal biases are systematically encoded within the pretrained latent spaces of state-of-the-art T2I models. We conduct an empirical study across the five most popular open-source models, using ten neutral, profession-related prompts to generate 100 images per profession, resulting in a dataset of 5,000 images evaluated by diverse human assessors representing different races and genders. We demonstrate that all five models encode and amplify pronounced societal skew: caregiving and nursing roles are consistently feminized, while high-status professions such as corporate CEO, politician, doctor, and lawyer are overwhelmingly represented by males and mostly White individuals. We further identify model-specific patterns, such as QWEN-Image's near-exclusive focus on East Asian outputs, Kandinsky's dominance of White individuals, and SDXL's comparatively broader but still biased distributions. These results provide critical insights for AI project managers and practitioners, enabling them to select equitable AI models and customized prompts that generate images in alignment with the principles of responsible AI. We conclude by discussing the risks of these biases and proposing actionable strategies for bias mitigation in building responsible GenAI systems.

*Yiming Tang,Abhijeet Sinha,Dianbo Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Matryoshka Transcoders, a framework for detecting physical plausibility errors in generative models using hierarchical sparse feature learning and multimodal interpretation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generative models often fail in physical plausibility tasks, and existing evaluation methods can't efficiently detect or interpret these errors.

Method: Matryoshka Transcoders use hierarchical sparse feature learning based on intermediate representations and multimodal interpretation to identify physics-related failure modes.

Result: The framework effectively identifies diverse physical plausibility issues and establishes a benchmark for evaluating generative models, outperforming current methods in feature relevance and accuracy.

Conclusion: The proposed Matryoshka Transcoders framework addresses physical plausibility errors in generative models, offering insights for targeted improvements and establishing reliable evaluation benchmarks.

Abstract: Although recent generative models are remarkably capable of producing instruction-following and realistic outputs, they remain prone to notable physical plausibility failures. Though critical in applications, these physical plausibility errors often escape detection by existing evaluation methods. Furthermore, no framework exists for automatically identifying and interpreting specific physical error patterns in natural language, preventing targeted model improvements. We introduce Matryoshka Transcoders, a novel framework for the automatic discovery and interpretation of physical plausibility features in generative models. Our approach extends the Matryoshka representation learning paradigm to transcoder architectures, enabling hierarchical sparse feature learning at multiple granularity levels. By training on intermediate representations from a physical plausibility classifier and leveraging large multimodal models for interpretation, our method identifies diverse physics-related failure modes without manual feature engineering, achieving superior feature relevance and feature accuracy compared to existing approaches. We utilize the discovered visual patterns to establish a benchmark for evaluating physical plausibility in generative models. Our analysis of eight state-of-the-art generative models provides valuable insights into how these models fail to follow physical constraints, paving the way for further model improvements.

### [313] [RI-Loss: A Learnable Residual-Informed Loss for Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10130)
*Jieting Wang,Xiaolei Shang,Feijiang Li,Furong Peng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces RI-Loss, a novel loss function for time series forecasting that addresses limitations of common MSE-based optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to address weaknesses in forecasting models using MSE, specifically its inability to capture temporal relationships and account for noise.

Method: RI-Loss is proposed, leveraging HSIC to enforce dependence between residuals and noise, supported by rigorous theoretical derivations and empirical validation.

Result: Empirical tests across multiple benchmarks and models show improved predictive performance using RI-Loss compared to traditional methods.

Conclusion: RI-Loss enhances noise-aware forecasting by providing a more theoretically robust and empirically validated approach, with reproducible results.

Abstract: Time series forecasting relies on predicting future values from historical data, yet most state-of-the-art approaches-including transformer and multilayer perceptron-based models-optimize using Mean Squared Error (MSE), which has two fundamental weaknesses: its point-wise error computation fails to capture temporal relationships, and it does not account for inherent noise in the data. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the Residual-Informed Loss (RI-Loss), a novel objective function based on the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC). RI-Loss explicitly models noise structure by enforcing dependence between the residual sequence and a random time series, enabling more robust, noise-aware representations. Theoretically, we derive the first non-asymptotic HSIC bound with explicit double-sample complexity terms, achieving optimal convergence rates through Bernstein-type concentration inequalities and Rademacher complexity analysis. This provides rigorous guarantees for RI-Loss optimization while precisely quantifying kernel space interactions. Empirically, experiments across eight real-world benchmarks and five leading forecasting models demonstrate improvements in predictive performance, validating the effectiveness of our approach. Code will be made publicly available to ensure reproducibility.

*Yuancheng Sun,Yuxuan Ren,Zhaoming Chen,Xu Han,Kang Liu,Qiwei Ye*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces Energy Preference Optimization (EPO), an algorithm improving protein conformational sampling by integrating energy-awareness into pretrained models without costly MD trajectories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Exploring protein conformational ensembles is crucial for understanding function but hindered by high computational costs and difficulties in overcoming energy barriers during molecular-dynamics simulations.

Method: EPO refines pretrained protein ensemble generators using stochastic differential equation sampling and energy-ranking based on list-wise preference optimization, introducing an efficient upper bound for continuous-time generative models.

Result: EPO achieves state-of-the-art performance on Tetrapeptides, ATLAS, and Fast-Folding benchmarks across nine metrics, generating realistic and diverse protein ensembles.

Conclusion: EPO provides a computationally efficient alternative to MD simulations, facilitating thermodynamically consistent protein ensemble generation and enhancing applications in structural biology and drug discovery.

Abstract: Accurate exploration of protein conformational ensembles is essential for uncovering function but remains hard because molecular-dynamics (MD) simulations suffer from high computational costs and energy-barrier trapping. This paper presents Energy Preference Optimization (EPO), an online refinement algorithm that turns a pretrained protein ensemble generator into an energy-aware sampler without extra MD trajectories. Specifically, EPO leverages stochastic differential equation sampling to explore the conformational landscape and incorporates a novel energy-ranking mechanism based on list-wise preference optimization. Crucially, EPO introduces a practical upper bound to efficiently approximate the intractable probability of long sampling trajectories in continuous-time generative models, making it easily adaptable to existing pretrained generators. On Tetrapeptides, ATLAS, and Fast-Folding benchmarks, EPO successfully generates diverse and physically realistic ensembles, establishing a new state-of-the-art in nine evaluation metrics. These results demonstrate that energy-only preference signals can efficiently steer generative models toward thermodynamically consistent conformational ensembles, providing an alternative to long MD simulations and widening the applicability of learned potentials in structural biology and drug discovery.

### [315] [Improved Offline Reinforcement Learning via Quantum Metric Encoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10187)
*Outongyi Lv,Yewei Yuan,Nana Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Quantum Metric Encoder (QME), a quantum-inspired approach to improve offline RL performance with limited samples, achieving significant improvements in RL outcomes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the suboptimal performance of offline reinforcement learning under limited sample constraints.

Method: The method involves embedding the states into a compact, meaningful representation using QME, inspired by quantum circuits. This embedding facilitates better RL performance.

Result: QME significantly improves RL performance with average reward increases of 116.2% (SAC) and 117.6% (IQL) over three datasets with only 100 samples each.

Conclusion: Low $Δ$-hyperbolicity induced by QME suggests that its embedding geometry plays a crucial role in improving RL performance, aiding in the development of efficient RL methods for limited samples.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) with limited samples is common in real-world applications. However, offline RL performance under this constraint is often suboptimal. We consider an alternative approach to dealing with limited samples by introducing the Quantum Metric Encoder (QME). In this methodology, instead of applying the RL framework directly on the original states and rewards, we embed the states into a more compact and meaningful representation, where the structure of the encoding is inspired by quantum circuits. For classical data, QME is a classically simulable, trainable unitary embedding and thus serves as a quantum-inspired module, on a classical device. For quantum data in the form of quantum states, QME can be implemented directly on quantum hardware, allowing for training without measurement or re-encoding.
  We evaluated QME on three datasets, each limited to 100 samples. We use Soft-Actor-Critic (SAC) and Implicit-Q-Learning (IQL), two well-known RL algorithms, to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. From the experimental results, we find that training offline RL agents on QME-embedded states with decoded rewards yields significantly better performance than training on the original states and rewards. On average across the three datasets, for maximum reward performance, we achieve a 116.2% improvement for SAC and 117.6% for IQL.
  We further investigate the $Δ$-hyperbolicity of our framework, a geometric property of the state space known to be important for the RL training efficacy. The QME-embedded states exhibit low $Δ$-hyperbolicity, suggesting that the improvement after embedding arises from the modified geometry of the state space induced by QME. Thus, the low $Δ$-hyperbolicity and the corresponding effectiveness of QME could provide valuable information for developing efficient offline RL methods under limited-sample conditions.

*Eklavya Sarkar,Mathew Magimai. -Doss*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study explores using vector quantized token sequences derived from self-supervised speech models to encode temporal information in animal vocalizations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most bioacoustics studies discard the sequential structure of animal vocalizations by averaging features over time, losing important communicative information.

Method: The authors use vector quantization methods, including Gumbel-Softmax on self-supervised speech model representations, to generate token sequences and evaluate their effectiveness in representing temporal information.

Result: Analysis shows these token sequences effectively discriminate call-types and callers across datasets, and $k$-NN classification using Levenshtein distance delivers reasonable classification performance.

Conclusion: Vector-quantized token sequences show promise as alternative representations for capturing temporal structure in animal vocalizations, enabling better analysis of communicative information.

Abstract: Animal vocalizations contain sequential structures that carry important communicative information, yet most computational bioacoustics studies average the extracted frame-level features across the temporal axis, discarding the order of the sub-units within a vocalization. This paper investigates whether discrete acoustic token sequences, derived through vector quantization and gumbel-softmax vector quantization of extracted self-supervised speech model representations can effectively capture and leverage temporal information. To that end, pairwise distance analysis of token sequences generated from HuBERT embeddings shows that they can discriminate call-types and callers across four bioacoustics datasets. Sequence classification experiments using $k$-Nearest Neighbour with Levenshtein distance show that the vector-quantized token sequences yield reasonable call-type and caller classification performances, and hold promise as alternative feature representations towards leveraging sequential information in animal vocalizations.

*Jieting Wang,Huimei Shi,Feijiang Li,Xiaolei Shang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces OCE-TS, a novel ordinal classification method for time series forecasting that uses Ordinal Cross-Entropy loss to improve uncertainty estimation and robustness compared to Mean Squared Error-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current models using Mean Squared Error loss for time series forecasting lack uncertainty estimation and are sensitive to outliers.

Method: The paper proposes discretizing observed values into ordered intervals, using a parametric distribution to define supervision signals, and employing Ordinal Cross-Entropy loss to preserve ordinal relationships and quantify uncertainty in predictions.

Result: The proposed OCE-TS method consistently outperforms existing benchmark models on seven public datasets, showing better performance using metrics like MSE and MAE.

Conclusion: OCE-TS offers a superior approach to value prediction by quantifying uncertainty and demonstrating robust performance, improving upon traditional regression modeling techniques.

Abstract: Time series forecasting is an important task that involves analyzing temporal dependencies and underlying patterns (such as trends, cyclicality, and seasonality) in historical data to predict future values or trends. Current deep learning-based forecasting models primarily employ Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss functions for regression modeling. Despite enabling direct value prediction, this method offers no uncertainty estimation and exhibits poor outlier robustness. To address these limitations, we propose OCE-TS, a novel ordinal classification approach for time series forecasting that replaces MSE with Ordinal Cross-Entropy (OCE) loss, preserving prediction order while quantifying uncertainty through probability output. Specifically, OCE-TS begins by discretizing observed values into ordered intervals and deriving their probabilities via a parametric distribution as supervision signals. Using a simple linear model, we then predict probability distributions for each timestep. The OCE loss is computed between the cumulative distributions of predicted and ground-truth probabilities, explicitly preserving ordinal relationships among forecasted values. Through theoretical analysis using influence functions, we establish that cross-entropy (CE) loss exhibits superior stability and outlier robustness compared to MSE loss. Empirically, we compared OCE-TS with five baseline models-Autoformer, DLinear, iTransformer, TimeXer, and TimeBridge-on seven public time series datasets. Using MSE and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) as evaluation metrics, the results demonstrate that OCE-TS consistently outperforms benchmark models. The code will be published.

*Yuping Yan,Yuhan Xie,Yuanshuai Li,Yingchao Yu,Lingjuan Lyu,Yaochu Jin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: OutSafe-Bench is a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate multimodal large language model safety across four modalities, introducing novel metrics and automated frameworks to enhance reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the growing concerns with unsafe outputs from MLLMs, such as biased or harmful content, due to the lack of comprehensive safety benchmarks.

Method: OutSafe-Bench includes a dataset spanning texts, images, audio, and videos, systematic annotations, a multidimensional risk scoring metric (MCRS), and FairScore framework for fair evaluations.

Result: Evaluation of nine state-of-the-art MLLMs revealed substantial safety vulnerabilities requiring stronger safeguards.

Conclusion: OutSafe-Bench is essential for reliable and thorough safety assessments of MLLMs to support development of safer AI systems.

Abstract: Since Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are increasingly being integrated into everyday tools and intelligent agents, growing concerns have arisen regarding their possible output of unsafe contents, ranging from toxic language and biased imagery to privacy violations and harmful misinformation. Current safety benchmarks remain highly limited in both modality coverage and performance evaluations, often neglecting the extensive landscape of content safety. In this work, we introduce OutSafe-Bench, the first most comprehensive content safety evaluation test suite designed for the multimodal era. OutSafe-Bench includes a large-scale dataset that spans four modalities, featuring over 18,000 bilingual (Chinese and English) text prompts, 4,500 images, 450 audio clips and 450 videos, all systematically annotated across nine critical content risk categories. In addition to the dataset, we introduce a Multidimensional Cross Risk Score (MCRS), a novel metric designed to model and assess overlapping and correlated content risks across different categories. To ensure fair and robust evaluation, we propose FairScore, an explainable automated multi-reviewer weighted aggregation framework. FairScore selects top-performing models as adaptive juries, thereby mitigating biases from single-model judgments and enhancing overall evaluation reliability. Our evaluation of nine state-of-the-art MLLMs reveals persistent and substantial safety vulnerabilities, underscoring the pressing need for robust safeguards in MLLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the computational foundations and efficiency of Transformer models by drawing inspiration from biological attention systems and dynamical systems theory.

Method: FNA employs Lévy diffusion governed by fractional Laplacian to realize multiscale token interactions, accompanied by dimensionality reduction via the diffusion map algorithm.

Result: FNA achieves competitive results in text classification, image processing, and neural machine translation, with improved computational characteristics such as larger spectral gaps and shorter path lengths.

Conclusion: FNA establishes itself as a biologically grounded, interpretable mechanism that enhances self-attention and multiscale information processing in AI systems.

Abstract: Attention mechanisms underpin the computational power of Transformer models, which have achieved remarkable success across diverse domains. Yet understanding and extending the principles underlying self-attention remains a key challenge for advancing artificial intelligence. Drawing inspiration from the multiscale dynamics of biological attention and from dynamical systems theory, we introduce Fractional Neural Attention (FNA), a principled, neuroscience-inspired framework for multiscale information processing. FNA models token interactions through Lévy diffusion governed by the fractional Laplacian, intrinsically realizing simultaneous short- and long-range dependencies across multiple scales. This mechanism yields greater expressivity and faster information mixing, advancing the foundational capacity of Transformers. Theoretically, we show that FNA's dynamics are governed by the fractional diffusion equation, and that the resulting attention networks exhibit larger spectral gaps and shorter path lengths -- mechanistic signatures of enhanced computational efficiency. Empirically, FNA achieves competitive text-classification performance even with a single layer and a single head; it also improves performance in image processing and neural machine translation. Finally, the diffusion map algorithm from geometric harmonics enables dimensionality reduction of FNA weights while preserving the intrinsic structure of embeddings and hidden states. Together, these results establish FNA as a principled mechanism connecting self-attention, stochastic dynamics, and geometry, providing an interpretable, biologically grounded foundation for powerful, neuroscience-inspired AI.

*Xi Yang,Han Zhang,Zhijian Lin,Yibiao Hu,Hong Han*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a method called VDT for enhancing domain adaptation in detecting out-of-context misinformation by learning domain-invariant features and applying test-time training mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Detecting out-of-context misinformation in news is challenging as current methods fail when applied to novel news domains beyond their training distribution.

Method: The paper introduces VDT, employing a Domain-Invariant Variational Align module and domain consistency constraints to encode domain-invariant features and dynamically adapt during testing through test-time training and confidence-variance filtering.

Result: VDT significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the benchmark NewsCLIPpings dataset under various domain adaptation settings.

Conclusion: VDT improves model performance in detecting out-of-context misinformation across different domains, providing better adaptability and robustness.

Abstract: Out-of-context misinformation (OOC) is a low-cost form of misinformation in news reports, which refers to place authentic images into out-of-context or fabricated image-text pairings. This problem has attracted significant attention from researchers in recent years. Current methods focus on assessing image-text consistency or generating explanations. However, these approaches assume that the training and test data are drawn from the same distribution. When encountering novel news domains, models tend to perform poorly due to the lack of prior knowledge. To address this challenge, we propose \textbf{VDT} to enhance the domain adaptation capability for OOC misinformation detection by learning domain-invariant features and test-time training mechanisms. Domain-Invariant Variational Align module is employed to jointly encodes source and target domain data to learn a separable distributional space domain-invariant features. For preserving semantic integrity, we utilize domain consistency constraint module to reconstruct the source and target domain latent distribution. During testing phase, we adopt the test-time training strategy and confidence-variance filtering module to dynamically updating the VAE encoder and classifier, facilitating the model's adaptation to the target domain distribution. Extensive experiments conducted on the benchmark dataset NewsCLIPpings demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines under most domain adaptation settings.

*Yue Chen,Jianfeng Lu,Shuqing Cao,Wei Wang,Gang Li,Guanghui Wen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces FedCure, a federated learning framework addressing challenges in semi-asynchronous federated learning, especially non-IID data induced participation bias.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the participation bias and efficiency issues in semi-asynchronous federated learning, especially in hierarchical architectures exacerbated by non-IID data distributions.

Method: FedCure incorporates three key rules: coalition-based preference to optimize grouping, scheduling with Bayesian-estimated coalition dynamics using virtual queues, and resource allocation optimized for computational efficiency.

Result: FedCure demonstrated up to 5.1x higher accuracy than baseline models, reduced per-round latency with a variation coefficient of 0.0223, and maintained balance across varying scenarios.

Conclusion: FedCure effectively mitigates participation bias, improves training efficiency, and balances performance in federated learning with non-IID data, outperforming existing solutions.

Abstract: While semi-asynchronous federated learning (SAFL) combines the efficiency of synchronous training with the flexibility of asynchronous updates, it inherently suffers from participation bias, which is further exacerbated by non-IID data distributions. More importantly, hierarchical architecture shifts participation from individual clients to client groups, thereby further intensifying this issue. Despite notable advancements in SAFL research, most existing works still focus on conventional cloud-end architectures while largely overlooking the critical impact of non-IID data on scheduling across the cloud-edge-client hierarchy. To tackle these challenges, we propose FedCure, an innovative semi-asynchronous Federated learning framework that leverages coalition construction and participation-aware scheduling to mitigate participation bias with non-IID data. Specifically, FedCure operates through three key rules: (1) a preference rule that optimizes coalition formation by maximizing collective benefits and establishing theoretically stable partitions to reduce non-IID-induced performance degradation; (2) a scheduling rule that integrates the virtual queue technique with Bayesian-estimated coalition dynamics, mitigating efficiency loss while ensuring mean rate stability; and (3) a resource allocation rule that enhances computational efficiency by optimizing client CPU frequencies based on estimated coalition dynamics while satisfying delay requirements. Comprehensive experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate that FedCure improves accuracy by up to 5.1x compared with four state-of-the-art baselines, while significantly enhancing efficiency with the lowest coefficient of variation 0.0223 for per-round latency and maintaining long-term balance across diverse scenarios.

TL;DR: AgentEvolver introduces mechanisms for autonomous agents, leveraging large language models (LLMs) to improve exploration efficiency and reduce data construction costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the inefficiencies and high costs associated with traditional approaches to developing autonomous agents, such as reliance on manually constructed task datasets and extensive random exploration in reinforcement learning (RL).

Method: AgentEvolver utilizes three mechanisms: self-questioning for autonomous task generation, self-navigating for efficient exploration through hybrid policy guidance, and self-attributing for precise reward assignment based on trajectory impact.

Result: AgentEvolver demonstrated more efficient exploration, improved sample utilization, and faster adaptation compared to traditional RL-based methods in preliminary tests.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that AgentEvolver can significantly enhance the learning and evolution of autonomous agents while minimizing costs, showcasing its potential for scalable and continual improvement.

Abstract: Autonomous agents powered by large language models (LLMs) have the potential to significantly enhance human productivity by reasoning, using tools, and executing complex tasks in diverse environments. However, current approaches to developing such agents remain costly and inefficient, as they typically require manually constructed task datasets and reinforcement learning (RL) pipelines with extensive random exploration. These limitations lead to prohibitively high data-construction costs, low exploration efficiency, and poor sample utilization. To address these challenges, we present AgentEvolver, a self-evolving agent system that leverages the semantic understanding and reasoning capabilities of LLMs to drive autonomous agent learning. AgentEvolver introduces three synergistic mechanisms: (i) self-questioning, which enables curiosity-driven task generation in novel environments, reducing dependence on handcrafted datasets; (ii) self-navigating, which improves exploration efficiency through experience reuse and hybrid policy guidance; and (iii) self-attributing, which enhances sample efficiency by assigning differentiated rewards to trajectory states and actions based on their contribution. By integrating these mechanisms into a unified framework, AgentEvolver enables scalable, cost-effective, and continual improvement of agent capabilities. Preliminary experiments indicate that AgentEvolver achieves more efficient exploration, better sample utilization, and faster adaptation compared to traditional RL-based baselines.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates robustness issues in graph reasoners using large language models (LLMs), especially regarding sensitivity to graph representation changes, while introducing a new framework to decompose graph serializations and evaluate robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Language Model (LLM)-based graph reasoners are not inherently robust to graph representation changes, which leads to varied outputs under simple reindexing or formatting alterations. This raises questions about their reliability and invariance.

Method: The study evaluates LLM behavior by decomposing graph serializations into node labeling, edge encoding, and syntax factors. It assesses robustness through a benchmarking suite, including novel spectral tasks, and analyzes the impact of fine-tuning on encoding sensitivity and task generalization.

Result: The results show larger pre-trained LLMs are generally more robust to graph representation changes than fine-tuned counterparts. Fine-tuning enhances robustness to node relabeling but may increase sensitivity to structural and formatting changes, with inconsistent improvements on unseen tasks.

Conclusion: LLM-based graph reasoners face robustness challenges due to graph representation variations. While fine-tuning offers incremental robustness benefits for specific factors, it does not universally improve performance or generalization, highlighting the need for new approaches.

Abstract: While promising, graph reasoners based on Large Language Models (LLMs) lack built-in invariance to symmetries in graph representations. Operating on sequential graph serializations, LLMs can produce different outputs under node reindexing, edge reordering, or formatting changes, raising robustness concerns. We systematically analyze these effects, studying how fine-tuning impacts encoding sensitivity as well generalization on unseen tasks. We propose a principled decomposition of graph serializations into node labeling, edge encoding, and syntax, and evaluate LLM robustness to variations of each of these factors on a comprehensive benchmarking suite. We also contribute a novel set of spectral tasks to further assess generalization abilities of fine-tuned reasoners. Results show that larger (non-fine-tuned) models are more robust. Fine-tuning reduces sensitivity to node relabeling but may increase it to variations in structure and format, while it does not consistently improve performance on unseen tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to improve decision-making in sequential reinforcement learning tasks by leveraging transformers and belief-based augmentations.

Method: They use a variational auto-encoder (VAE) to learn a posterior distribution over rewards, incorporating it alongside in-context datasets and query states as prompts to the transformer policy.

Result: HT demonstrates superior effectiveness and generalization across Darkroom, Miniworld, and MuJoCo environments compared to existing baselines.

Conclusion: Heuristic Transformer offers a promising approach to integrate belief-based rewards into transformer-based reinforcement learning, improving adaptability and decision-making.

Abstract: Transformers have demonstrated exceptional in-context learning (ICL) capabilities, enabling applications across natural language processing, computer vision, and sequential decision-making. In reinforcement learning, ICL reframes learning as a supervised problem, facilitating task adaptation without parameter updates. Building on prior work leveraging transformers for sequential decision-making, we propose Heuristic Transformer (HT), an in-context reinforcement learning (ICRL) approach that augments the in-context dataset with a belief distribution over rewards to achieve better decision-making. Using a variational auto-encoder (VAE), a low-dimensional stochastic variable is learned to represent the posterior distribution over rewards, which is incorporated alongside an in-context dataset and query states as prompt to the transformer policy. We assess the performance of HT across the Darkroom, Miniworld, and MuJoCo environments, showing that it consistently surpasses comparable baselines in terms of both effectiveness and generalization. Our method presents a promising direction to bridge the gap between belief-based augmentations and transformer-based decision-making.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The researchers aim to clarify the unclear impact of LayerNorm on learning and memorization in Pre-LayerNorm and Post-LayerNorm transformers, which are fundamental in modern AI architectures.

Method: The analysis involves studying 13 models and examining their behaviors across 6 vision and language datasets to understand how the usage and placement of LayerNorm influence learning and memorization in transformers.

Result: The study finds that LayerNorm is essential for stable learning in Pre-LayerNorm transformers and helps mitigate memorization in Post-LayerNorm models. It identifies early layer LayerNorm to be the most impactful across these architectures.

Conclusion: LayerNorm plays a key role in shaping both learning and memorization in transformers, and its placement in early layers has a critical impact. These findings enhance our understanding of transformer architectures.

Abstract: Layer Normalization (LayerNorm) is one of the fundamental components in transformers that stabilizes training and improves optimization. In recent times, Pre-LayerNorm transformers have become the preferred choice over Post-LayerNorm transformers due to their stable gradient flow. However, the impact of LayerNorm on learning and memorization across these architectures remains unclear. In this work, we investigate how LayerNorm influences memorization and learning for Pre- and Post-LayerNorm transformers. We identify that LayerNorm serves as a key factor for stable learning in Pre-LayerNorm transformers, while in Post-LayerNorm transformers, it impacts memorization. Our analysis reveals that eliminating LayerNorm parameters in Pre-LayerNorm models exacerbates memorization and destabilizes learning, while in Post-LayerNorm models, it effectively mitigates memorization by restoring genuine labels. We further precisely identify that early layers LayerNorm are the most critical over middle/later layers and their influence varies across Pre and Post LayerNorm models. We have validated it through 13 models across 6 Vision and Language datasets. These insights shed new light on the role of LayerNorm in shaping memorization and learning in transformers.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a Responsible Reinforcement Learning (RRL) framework for ethical, emotionally-aware decision-making in healthcare and behavioral support systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current healthcare and behavioral support systems overly rely on static or engagement-maximizing methods, lacking emotional and ethical consideration, potentially leading to insensitive or harmful decisions, especially in mental health contexts.

Method: The paper formulates personalization as a Constrained Markov Decision Process (CMDP) with a multi-objective reward function, combining short-term engagement with long-term well-being, using emotion-informed states and integrating safety constraints into RL algorithms.

Result: The proposed framework introduces empathy and responsibility into policy optimization, showcasing a scalable solution compatible with different RL methods such as DQN and PPO.

Conclusion: This research connects safe RL, affective computing, and responsible AI, aiming to drive an ethical and emotionally aligned approach to personalized systems in domains like health and education, while proposing simulation-based future validations.

Abstract: Personalized decision systems in healthcare and behavioral support often rely on static rule-based or engagement-maximizing heuristics that overlook users' emotional context and ethical constraints. Such approaches risk recommending insensitive or unsafe interventions, especially in domains involving serious mental illness, substance use disorders, or depression. To address this limitation, we propose a Responsible Reinforcement Learning (RRL) framework that integrates emotional and contextual understanding with ethical considerations into the sequential decision-making process. RRL formulates personalization as a Constrained Markov Decision Process (CMDP), where the agent optimizes engagement and adherence while ensuring emotional alignment and ethical safety. We introduce a multi-objective reward function that explicitly balances short-term behavioral engagement with long-term user well-being, and define an emotion-informed state representation that captures fluctuations in emotional readiness, affect, and risk. The proposed architecture can be instantiated with any RL algorithm (e.g., DQN, PPO) augmented with safety constraints or Lagrangian regularization. Conceptually, this framework operationalizes empathy and responsibility within machine learning policy optimization, bridging safe RL, affective computing and responsible AI. We discuss the implications of this approach for human-centric domains such as behavioral health, education, and digital therapeutics, and outline simulation-based validation paths for future empirical work. This paper aims to initiate a methodological conversation about ethically aligned reinforcement learning for emotionally aware and trustworthy personalization systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DNNs' inability to accurately quantify uncertainty limits their full adoption in critical applications. A unified framework for evaluating UQ methods is missing.

Conclusion: Torch-Uncertainty provides a unified and streamlined approach to address UQ in deep learning, supporting broader adoption of reliable DNNs in critical applications.

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across various domains, including computer vision and natural language processing. However, they often struggle to accurately quantify the uncertainty of their predictions, limiting their broader adoption in critical real-world applications. Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) for Deep Learning seeks to address this challenge by providing methods to improve the reliability of uncertainty estimates. Although numerous techniques have been proposed, a unified tool offering a seamless workflow to evaluate and integrate these methods remains lacking. To bridge this gap, we introduce Torch-Uncertainty, a PyTorch and Lightning-based framework designed to streamline DNN training and evaluation with UQ techniques and metrics. In this paper, we outline the foundational principles of our library and present comprehensive experimental results that benchmark a diverse set of UQ methods across classification, segmentation, and regression tasks.

### [329] [PITE: Multi-Prototype Alignment for Individual Treatment Effect Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10320)
*Fuyuan Cao,Jiaxuan Zhang,Xiaoli Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a new method, PITE, for better estimation of Individual Treatment Effects (ITE) by addressing local structural issues in datasets with confounding bias, achieving improved performance over current methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve ITE estimation from observational data by addressing challenges caused by global distribution balancing approaches that overlook individual heterogeneity and local clustering structure.

Method: The proposed method, PITE, uses cluster centroids (prototypes) to represent local structures in data and aligns them across treatment groups via instance-to-prototype matching and prototype-level alignment.

Result: PITE significantly outperforms 13 state-of-the-art ITE estimation methods in accuracy and robustness through experiments on benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: By focusing on prototype-based alignment and preserving local structures, PITE offers a more reliable solution for estimating ITE compared to existing approaches, addressing both global and individual-level challenges in the data.

Abstract: Estimating Individual Treatment Effects (ITE) from observational data is challenging due to confounding bias. Most studies tackle this bias by balancing distributions globally, but ignore individual heterogeneity and fail to capture the local structure that represents the natural clustering among individuals, which ultimately compromises ITE estimation. While instance-level alignment methods consider heterogeneity, they similarly overlook the local structure information. To address these issues, we propose an end-to-end Multi-\textbf{P}rototype alignment method for \textbf{ITE} estimation (\textbf{PITE}). PITE effectively captures local structure within groups and enforces cross-group alignment, thereby achieving robust ITE estimation. Specifically, we first define prototypes as cluster centroids based on similar individuals under the same treatment. To identify local similarity and the distribution consistency, we perform instance-to-prototype matching to assign individuals to the nearest prototype within groups, and design a multi-prototype alignment strategy to encourage the matched prototypes to be close across treatment arms in the latent space. PITE not only reduces distribution shift through fine-grained, prototype-level alignment, but also preserves the local structures of treated and control groups, which provides meaningful constraints for ITE estimation. Extensive evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate that PITE outperforms 13 state-of-the-art methods, achieving more accurate and robust ITE estimation.

*Zicheng Hu,Yuchen Wang,Cheng Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses decentralized multi-agent settings with adversarial attacks and proposes the DeMABAR algorithm, which offers robustness against these attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the vulnerability of existing decentralized multi-agent multi-armed bandit methods to adversarial attacks.

Method: Designed a robust algorithm, DeMABAR, to minimize regret under adversarial conditions and analyzed its performance theoretically and through experiments.

Result: DeMABAR achieves additive regret proportional to corruption budget and nearly eliminates adversarial influence, even in Byzantine settings.

Conclusion: DeMABAR proves to be an effective and robust solution for decentralized multi-agent problems facing adversarial corruption.

Abstract: Decentralized cooperative multi-agent multi-armed bandits (DeCMA2B) considers how multiple agents collaborate in a decentralized multi-armed bandit setting. Though this problem has been extensively studied in previous work, most existing methods remain susceptible to various adversarial attacks. In this paper, we first study DeCMA2B with adversarial corruption, where an adversary can corrupt reward observations of all agents with a limited corruption budget. We propose a robust algorithm, called DeMABAR, which ensures that each agent's individual regret suffers only an additive term proportional to the corruption budget. Then we consider a more realistic scenario where the adversary can only attack a small number of agents. Our theoretical analysis shows that the DeMABAR algorithm can also almost completely eliminate the influence of adversarial attacks and is inherently robust in the Byzantine setting, where an unknown fraction of the agents can be Byzantine, i.e., may arbitrarily select arms and communicate wrong information. We also conduct numerical experiments to illustrate the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed method.

### [331] [Gradient Flow Equations for Deep Linear Neural Networks: A Survey from a Network Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10362)
*Joel Wendin,Claudio Altafini*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper examines gradient flow dynamics and loss landscape in deep linear neural networks, highlighting the unique characteristics of its optimization process, such as the lack of local minima or maxima.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to understand the mathematical dynamics and structure of gradient flow equations in deep linear neural networks and their implications on optimization and loss landscapes.

Method: The paper formulates the gradient flow equations using an adjacency matrix representation, detailing their nilpotent, polynomial, isospectral, and conservation law properties. It explores the loss landscape extensively.

Result: The study reveals that the loss landscape has infinitely many global minima and saddle points without any local minima or maxima, and critical points correspond to learned singular values of input-output data.

Conclusion: An adjacency matrix representation facilitates understanding of stable/unstable submanifolds and provides structural insights into gradient flow dynamics and the loss function's geometry in deep linear neural networks.

Abstract: The paper surveys recent progresses in understanding the dynamics and loss landscape of the gradient flow equations associated to deep linear neural networks, i.e., the gradient descent training dynamics (in the limit when the step size goes to 0) of deep neural networks missing the activation functions and subject to quadratic loss functions. When formulated in terms of the adjacency matrix of the neural network, as we do in the paper, these gradient flow equations form a class of converging matrix ODEs which is nilpotent, polynomial, isospectral, and with conservation laws. The loss landscape is described in detail. It is characterized by infinitely many global minima and saddle points, both strict and nonstrict, but lacks local minima and maxima. The loss function itself is a positive semidefinite Lyapunov function for the gradient flow, and its level sets are unbounded invariant sets of critical points, with critical values that correspond to the amount of singular values of the input-output data learnt by the gradient along a certain trajectory. The adjacency matrix representation we use in the paper allows to highlight the existence of a quotient space structure in which each critical value of the loss function is represented only once, while all other critical points with the same critical value belong to the fiber associated to the quotient space. It also allows to easily determine stable and unstable submanifolds at the saddle points, even when the Hessian fails to obtain them.

*Arnab Bhattacharyya,Davin Choo,Philips George John,Themis Gouleakis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper provides an efficient method for learning unknown product distributions on the Boolean hypercube with improved sample complexity by leveraging an advised distribution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation lies in reducing the sample complexity for learning product distributions on the Boolean hypercube by utilizing additional advisory information about an approximate distribution.

Method: The approach involves designing an algorithm that achieves efficient learning when given a parameterized advisory distribution close to the target distribution, leveraging the L1 norm similarity between their mean vectors.

Result: The algorithm can learn the distribution within TV distance ε using a sample complexity of approximately Õ(d^(1-η)/ε^2), under a condition on the L1 norm of mean vectors.

Conclusion: Including advisory parameters about the distribution can significantly reduce sample complexity for learning product distributions, enhancing efficiency in practical applications.

Abstract: Given i.i.d.~samples from an unknown distribution $P$, the goal of distribution learning is to recover the parameters of a distribution that is close to $P$. When $P$ belongs to the class of product distributions on the Boolean hypercube $\{0,1\}^d$, it is known that $Ω(d/\varepsilon^2)$ samples are necessary to learn $P$ within total variation (TV) distance $\varepsilon$. We revisit this problem when the learner is also given as advice the parameters of a product distribution $Q$. We show that there is an efficient algorithm to learn $P$ within TV distance $\varepsilon$ that has sample complexity $\tilde{O}(d^{1-η}/\varepsilon^2)$, if $\|\mathbf{p} - \mathbf{q}\|_1 < \varepsilon d^{0.5 - Ω(η)}$. Here, $\mathbf{p}$ and $\mathbf{q}$ are the mean vectors of $P$ and $Q$ respectively, and no bound on $\|\mathbf{p} - \mathbf{q}\|_1$ is known to the algorithm a priori.

### [333] [Enhancing Kernel Power K-means: Scalable and Robust Clustering with Random Fourier Features and Possibilistic Method](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10392)
*Yixi Chen,Weixuan Liang,Tianrui Liu,Jun-Jie Huang,Ao Li,Xueling Zhu,Xinwang Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces RFF-KPKM and IP-RFF-MKPKM methods to address computational challenges and noise robustness issues in kernel power k-means. Random Fourier features are leveraged to approximate kernels, ensuring scalability and preserving accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of kernel power k-means, particularly its computational inefficiency and reduced noise robustness due to reliance on full kernel matrices and a lack of effective centroid-sample assignment learning.

Method: The authors propose RFF-KPKM, utilizing random Fourier features (RFF) for efficient, low-dimensional approximations of kernels, along with strong theoretical guarantees like excess risk bounds. Additionally, they develop IP-RFF-MKPKM, incorporating probabilistic and fuzzy membership to enhance robustness and scalability for multiple-kernel clustering.

Result: The proposed RFF-KPKM and IP-RFF-MKPKM methods achieve superior clustering efficiency and accuracy. Experiments validate their improved performance over existing state-of-the-art methods on large-scale datasets.

Conclusion: RFF-KPKM and IP-RFF-MKPKM successfully overcome traditional kernel power k-means' limitations, bringing advancements in scalability, robustness, and theoretical guarantees for clustering.

Abstract: Kernel power $k$-means (KPKM) leverages a family of means to mitigate local minima issues in kernel $k$-means. However, KPKM faces two key limitations: (1) the computational burden of the full kernel matrix restricts its use on extensive data, and (2) the lack of authentic centroid-sample assignment learning reduces its noise robustness. To overcome these challenges, we propose RFF-KPKM, introducing the first approximation theory for applying random Fourier features (RFF) to KPKM. RFF-KPKM employs RFF to generate efficient, low-dimensional feature maps, bypassing the need for the whole kernel matrix. Crucially, we are the first to establish strong theoretical guarantees for this combination: (1) an excess risk bound of $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{k^3/n})$, (2) strong consistency with membership values, and (3) a $(1+\varepsilon)$ relative error bound achievable using the RFF of dimension $\mathrm{poly}(\varepsilon^{-1}\log k)$. Furthermore, to improve robustness and the ability to learn multiple kernels, we propose IP-RFF-MKPKM, an improved possibilistic RFF-based multiple kernel power $k$-means. IP-RFF-MKPKM ensures the scalability of MKPKM via RFF and refines cluster assignments by combining the merits of the possibilistic membership and fuzzy membership. Experiments on large-scale datasets demonstrate the superior efficiency and clustering accuracy of the proposed methods compared to the state-of-the-art alternatives.

*Darsh Pareek,Umesh Kumar,Ruthu Rao,Ravi Janjam*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores how learning rates affect weight and bias fluctuations, influencing model accuracy and optimization in deep neural networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the fundamental relationship between learning rate and internal parameter fluctuations, which are critical for optimization and generalization.

Method: Systematic investigation through training a neural network with different learning rates, analyzing fluctuations and the resulting performance.

Result: Identifies patterns linking learning rates to specific parameter fluctuation behaviors and their impact on final model accuracy.

Conclusion: The study enhances understanding of how learning rates affect optimization, offering insights into the trade-off between exploration and exploitation in deep learning.

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) rely on inherent fluctuations in their internal parameters (weights and biases) to effectively navigate the complex optimization landscape and achieve robust performance. While these fluctuations are recognized as crucial for escaping local minima and improving generalization, their precise relationship with fundamental hyperparameters remains underexplored. A significant knowledge gap exists concerning how the learning rate, a critical parameter governing the training process, directly influences the dynamics of these neural fluctuations. This study systematically investigates the impact of varying learning rates on the magnitude and character of weight and bias fluctuations within a neural network. We trained a model using distinct learning rates and analyzed the corresponding parameter fluctuations in conjunction with the network's final accuracy. Our findings aim to establish a clear link between the learning rate's value, the resulting fluctuation patterns, and overall model performance. By doing so, we provide deeper insights into the optimization process, shedding light on how the learning rate mediates the crucial exploration-exploitation trade-off during training. This work contributes to a more nuanced understanding of hyperparameter tuning and the underlying mechanics of deep learning.

TL;DR: The paper identifies reliability issues in perturbation-based explanations due to miscalibrated model confidence and proposes a recalibration method, ReCalX, to improve explanation quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While perturbation-based explanations are widely used in machine learning, their reliability is questioned due to the potential misalignment between model predictions and actual outcomes when using specific perturbations.

Method: The authors analyze the effects of uncertainty calibration on explanations, theoretically demonstrating the negative impact of miscalibrated confidence under perturbations. They propose ReCalX, a recalibration method aimed at addressing these issues while maintaining original model predictions.

Result: ReCalX significantly reduces perturbation-specific miscalibration, strengthens explanation robustness, and improves the identification of important input features across various models and datasets.

Conclusion: ReCalX enhances the reliability of perturbation-based explanations by improving model calibration without altering predictive performance.

Abstract: Perturbation-based explanations are widely utilized to enhance the transparency of machine-learning models in practice. However, their reliability is often compromised by the unknown model behavior under the specific perturbations used. This paper investigates the relationship between uncertainty calibration - the alignment of model confidence with actual accuracy - and perturbation-based explanations. We show that models systematically produce unreliable probability estimates when subjected to explainability-specific perturbations and theoretically prove that this directly undermines global and local explanation quality. To address this, we introduce ReCalX, a novel approach to recalibrate models for improved explanations while preserving their original predictions. Empirical evaluations across diverse models and datasets demonstrate that ReCalX consistently reduces perturbation-specific miscalibration most effectively while enhancing explanation robustness and the identification of globally important input features.

### [336] [Intrinsic Dimensionality as a Model-Free Measure of Class Imbalance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10475)
*Çağrı Eser,Zeynep Sonat Baltacı,Emre Akbaş,Sinan Kalkan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel method using Intrinsic Dimensionality (ID) to measure and address data imbalance in classification tasks, outperforming traditional cardinality-based techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current imbalance measures like cardinalities overlook redundant examples and learning variances among classes, while model-dependent measures like training loss have limitations. There is a need for a simple, effective, and model-free measure.

Method: The authors propose using data Intrinsic Dimensionality (ID), a model-free measure, to quantify class imbalance and incorporate it into imbalance mitigation methods.

Result: ID demonstrates superior performance over cardinality-based re-weighting and re-sampling methods across five datasets with varying imbalance ratios. Additionally, combining ID with cardinality improves outcomes.

Conclusion: Intrinsic Dimensionality is an effective, simple, and adaptable method for handling class imbalance, offering improvements when used alone or alongside cardinality-based approaches.

Abstract: Imbalance in classification tasks is commonly quantified by the cardinalities of examples across classes. This, however, disregards the presence of redundant examples and inherent differences in the learning difficulties of classes. Alternatively, one can use complex measures such as training loss and uncertainty, which, however, depend on training a machine learning model. Our paper proposes using data Intrinsic Dimensionality (ID) as an easy-to-compute, model-free measure of imbalance that can be seamlessly incorporated into various imbalance mitigation methods. Our results across five different datasets with a diverse range of imbalance ratios show that ID consistently outperforms cardinality-based re-weighting and re-sampling techniques used in the literature. Moreover, we show that combining ID with cardinality can further improve performance. Code: https://github.com/cagries/IDIM.

### [337] [Panda: Test-Time Adaptation with Negative Data Augmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10481)
*Ruxi Deng,Wenxuan Bao,Tianxin Wei,Jingrui He*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Panda, a test-time adaptation method using negative data augmentation to address prediction bias and reduce computational overhead in pretrained visual-language models, showing superior robustness under common image corruptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pretrained visual-language models face performance degradation under image corruptions, and traditional test-time adaptation methods struggle with computational inefficiency and prediction biases.

Method: Panda employs negative data augmentation, disrupting semantic content and using patch-based assembly to suppress corruption-related components while preserving class-relevant information. It allows efficient augmentation sharing across batches.

Result: Panda demonstrates superior performance over positive data augmentation methods and significantly improves robustness across a variety of test-time adaptation frameworks.

Conclusion: Panda effectively reduces prediction bias and computational overhead, enhancing the robustness of pretrained visual-language models under distribution shifts. It is easily integrable and beneficial across test-time adaptation frameworks.

Abstract: Pretrained VLMs exhibit strong zero-shot classification capabilities, but their predictions degrade significantly under common image corruptions. To improve robustness, many test-time adaptation (TTA) methods adopt positive data augmentation (PDA), which generates multiple views of each test sample to reduce prediction variance. However, these methods suffer from two key limitations. First, it introduces considerable computational overhead due to the large number of augmentations required per image. Second, it fails to mitigate prediction bias, where the model tends to predict certain classes disproportionately under corruption, as PDA operates on corrupted inputs and typically does not remove the corruption itself. To address these challenges, we propose Panda, a novel TTA method based on negative data augmentation (NDA). Unlike positive augmentations that preserve object semantics, Panda generates negative augmentations by disrupting semantic content. It divides images into patches and randomly assembles them from a shared patch pool. These negatively augmented images retain corruption-specific features while discarding object-relevant signals. We then subtract the mean feature of these negative samples from the original image feature, effectively suppressing corruption-related components while preserving class-relevant information. This mitigates prediction bias under distribution shifts. Panda allows augmentation to be shared across samples within a batch, resulting in minimal computational overhead. Panda can be seamlessly integrated into existing test-time adaptation frameworks and substantially improve their robustness. Our experiments indicate that Panda delivers superior performance compared to PDA methods, and a wide range of TTA methods exhibit significantly enhanced performance when integrated with Panda.

*Stanislav Selitskiy*

TL;DR: This paper presents a method using a novel loss function in Kinematic-Informed Artificial Neural Networks (KINN) to improve long-term stock predictions by enforcing velocity relations between data points.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this research is to address issues of series volatility, out-of-distribution (OOD) data, and outliers in stock prediction models, which often lead to unrealistic predictions.

Method: The paper introduces a custom loss function that penalizes errors between the predicted next point and the velocity-based prediction from the previous point, aiming to maintain realistic data relations.

Result: The proposed loss function was tested on various Auto-Regressive Artificial Neural Network architectures and showed statistically significant improvements over 15 years of Dow Jones data, especially in OOD scenarios and normalization-sensitive models.

Conclusion: The proposed approach successfully weakens the normalization-induced issues in auto-regressive models by preserving data proximity and enhancing realistic stock prediction outcomes.

Abstract: We propose loss function week enforcement of the velocity relations between time-series points in the Kinematic-Informed artificial Neural Networks (KINN) for long-term stock prediction. Problems of the series volatility, Out-of-Distribution (OOD) test data, and outliers in training data are addressed by (Artificial Neural Networks) ANN's learning not only future points prediction but also by learning velocity relations between the points, such a way as avoiding unrealistic spurious predictions. The presented loss function penalizes not only errors between predictions and supervised label data, but also errors between the next point prediction and the previous point plus velocity prediction. The loss function is tested on the multiple popular and exotic AR ANN architectures, and around fifteen years of Dow Jones function demonstrated statistically meaningful improvement across the normalization-sensitive activation functions prone to spurious behaviour in the OOD data conditions. Results show that such architecture addresses the issue of the normalization in the auto-regressive models that break the data topology by weakly enforcing the data neighbourhood proximity (relation) preservation during the ANN transformation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes Holonorm as an alternative normalization method in transformers, addressing issues in Dynamic Tanh and offering improved stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance normalization in transformer models, overcoming the limitations in Tanh-based techniques such as orthogonality and distortion issues.

Method: Developing Holonorm, which has residual connections and nonlinearity, ensuring orthogonality, direction preservation, and stability for tensor-based models.

Result: Holonorm maps vectors to the open unit ball, prevents exploding activations, and improves stability in deep Transformer models.

Conclusion: Holonorm serves as a viable normalization tool for transformers, overcoming issues found in Tanh and improving model evaluation interpretability.

Abstract: Normalization is a key point in transformer training . In Dynamic Tanh (DyT), the author demonstrated that Tanh can be used as an alternative layer normalization (LN) and confirmed the effectiveness of the idea. But Tanh itself faces orthogonality, linearity and distortion problems. Due to that, his proposition cannot be reliable. So we propose a Holonorm (hn) which has residual connections and nonlinearity. Holonorm is suitable for replacing Tanh in the context of normalization. Although the HoloNorm expression could be similar to the softsign function in dimension one, softsign is a componentwise function which is not good for tensors and vectors of great dimension. Holonorm preserves the orthogonality, the direction, the invertibility of the signal. Holonorm is also a suitable metric, maps all vectors into the open unit ball. This prevents exploding activations and improves stability in deep Transformer models. In this work, we have meticulously examined the normalization in transformers and say that Holonorm, a generalized form of softsign function suited as a normalization function first.Second, defined between 0 and 1 hn serves as a percentage, and $1 - \text{Holonorm}$ is its complement, making it better understandable in evaluating a model.

*Benjamin Yu,Vincenzo Lordi,Daniel Schwalbe-Koda*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces an efficient algorithm for compressing atomistic datasets while preserving structure diversity crucial for training machine learning interatomic potentials.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the limitations of creating large computational datasets for MLIPs, which are expensive, versus smaller, less diverse datasets that risk losing rare but essential atomic environment information.

Method: The paper frames dataset compression as the minimum set cover (MSC) problem, developing an algorithm to retain maximum information while removing redundancy, demonstrated with various datasets.

Result: Compressed datasets using the MSC algorithm outperform other methods by preserving outliers, dataset diversity, and improving MLIP accuracy in out-of-distribution atomic environments.

Conclusion: The proposed algorithm effectively reduces computational costs while improving the quality of MLIPs, and is made publicly available in the QUESTS package for broader applications.

Abstract: Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) balance high accuracy and lower costs compared to density functional theory calculations, but their performance often depends on the size and diversity of training datasets. Large datasets improve model accuracy and generalization but are computationally expensive to produce and train on, while smaller datasets risk discarding rare but important atomic environments and compromising MLIP accuracy/reliability. Here, we develop an information-theoretical framework to quantify the efficiency of dataset compression methods and propose an algorithm that maximizes this efficiency. By framing atomistic dataset compression as an instance of the minimum set cover (MSC) problem over atom-centered environments, our method identifies the smallest subset of structures that contains as much information as possible from the original dataset while pruning redundant information. The approach is extensively demonstrated on the GAP-20 and TM23 datasets, and validated on 64 varied datasets from the ColabFit repository. Across all cases, MSC consistently retains outliers, preserves dataset diversity, and reproduces the long-tail distributions of forces even at high compression rates, outperforming other subsampling methods. Furthermore, MLIPs trained on MSC-compressed datasets exhibit reduced error for out-of-distribution data even in low-data regimes. We explain these results using an outlier analysis and show that such quantitative conclusions could not be achieved with conventional dimensionality reduction methods. The algorithm is implemented in the open-source QUESTS package and can be used for several tasks in atomistic modeling, from data subsampling, outlier detection, and training improved MLIPs at a lower cost.

Motivation: The study addresses the challenge of limited ground-based observation networks and forecasting skills in the Global South, highlighting the weaknesses of current satellite-based precipitation products at sub-daily timescales.

Method: It introduces Oya, a two-stage deep learning model using U-Nets for precipitation detection and quantitative precipitation estimation, trained on GPM-CORRA data and pre-trained on IMERG-Final retrievals.

Result: Oya demonstrates superior performance compared to competitive regional and global baselines and offers quasi-global coverage.

Conclusion: Oya provides an advanced solution for accurate precipitation monitoring and forecasting, especially benefiting areas with limited ground-based observation networks.

Abstract: Accurate precipitation estimation is critical for hydrological applications, especially in the Global South where ground-based observation networks are sparse and forecasting skill is limited. Existing satellite-based precipitation products often rely on the longwave infrared channel alone or are calibrated with data that can introduce significant errors, particularly at sub-daily timescales. This study introduces Oya, a novel real-time precipitation retrieval algorithm utilizing the full spectrum of visible and infrared (VIS-IR) observations from geostationary (GEO) satellites. Oya employs a two-stage deep learning approach, combining two U-Net models: one for precipitation detection and another for quantitative precipitation estimation (QPE), to address the inherent data imbalance between rain and no-rain events. The models are trained using high-resolution GPM Combined Radar-Radiometer Algorithm (CORRA) v07 data as ground truth and pre-trained on IMERG-Final retrievals to enhance robustness and mitigate overfitting due to the limited temporal sampling of CORRA. By leveraging multiple GEO satellites, Oya achieves quasi-global coverage and demonstrates superior performance compared to existing competitive regional and global precipitation baselines, offering a promising pathway to improved precipitation monitoring and forecasting.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Belief Net, a neural network-influenced framework for learning HMM parameters, overcoming issues in existing methods like Baum-Welch and spectral algorithms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of learning Hidden Markov Model (HMM) parameters effectively, overcoming computational inefficiencies and issues of validity in classical and spectral methods.

Method: Belief Net uses a gradient-based optimization method, where the HMM forward filter is reimagined as a structured neural network with interpretable weights, trained autoregressively.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that Belief Net outperforms Baum-Welch in convergence speed, retrieves parameters in complex settings, and compares favorably against Transformers on real-world tasks.

Conclusion: Belief Net offers a novel and interpretable solution to HMM parameter learning, combining efficiency, accuracy, and interpretability beyond existing methods.

Abstract: Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) are fundamental for modeling sequential data, yet learning their parameters from observations remains challenging. Classical methods like the Baum-Welch (EM) algorithm are computationally intensive and prone to local optima, while modern spectral algorithms offer provable guarantees but may produce probability outputs outside valid ranges. This work introduces Belief Net, a novel framework that learns HMM parameters through gradient-based optimization by formulating the HMM's forward filter as a structured neural network. Unlike black-box Transformer models, Belief Net's learnable weights are explicitly the logits of the initial distribution, transition matrix, and emission matrix, ensuring full interpretability. The model processes observation sequences using a decoder-only architecture and is trained end-to-end with standard autoregressive next-observation prediction loss. On synthetic HMM data, Belief Net achieves superior convergence speed compared to Baum-Welch, successfully recovering parameters in both undercomplete and overcomplete settings where spectral methods fail. Comparisons with Transformer-based models are also presented on real-world language data.

Specifically, the method integrates strict Top-$K$ LISTA and its convex FISTA-based variant (LISTAConv) into the discriminative LC-KSVD2 model, enabling co-evolution between the sparse encoder and the dictionary under supervised or unsupervised regimes. This unified design retains the interpretability of traditional sparse coding while benefiting from efficient, differentiable training.
  We further establish a PALM-style convergence analysis for the convex variant, ensuring theoretical stability under block alternation. Experimentally, our method achieves 95.6\% on CIFAR-10, 86.3\% on CIFAR-100, and 88.5\% on TinyImageNet with faster convergence and lower memory cost ($<$4GB GPU). The results confirm that the proposed LC-KSVD2 + LISTA/LISTAConv pipeline offers an interpretable and computationally efficient alternative for modern deep architectures.

### [344] [Tight Robustness Certification through the Convex Hull of $\ell_0$ Attacks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10576)
*Yuval Shapira,Dana Drachsler-Cohen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to enhance robustness verification for deep learning classifiers against few-pixel attacks, improving computational efficiency and tightness in convex hull approximations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of verifying robustness against few-pixel attacks, as conventional methods struggle with efficiency and tight bounds due to the non-convex nature of the $ll_0$-ball.

Method: The authors derive the convex hull of an $ll_0$-ball and propose a linear bound propagation technique that computes precise bounds over it, far exceeding previous approximations using the bounding box or $ll_1$-like polytope.

Result: The proposed method achieves significant scalability improvements in $ll_0$ robustness verifiers on challenging benchmarks, with a speed-up ranging from 1.24x to 7.07x and a geometric mean of 3.16.

Conclusion: This research advances the field of robustness verification by effectively tackling the limitations of traditional methods in handling $ll_0$ perturbation spaces, offering a practical and efficient approach.

Abstract: Few-pixel attacks mislead a classifier by modifying a few pixels of an image. Their perturbation space is an $\ell_0$-ball, which is not convex, unlike $\ell_p$-balls for $p\geq1$. However, existing local robustness verifiers typically scale by relying on linear bound propagation, which captures convex perturbation spaces. We show that the convex hull of an $\ell_0$-ball is the intersection of its bounding box and an asymmetrically scaled $\ell_1$-like polytope. The volumes of the convex hull and this polytope are nearly equal as the input dimension increases. We then show a linear bound propagation that precisely computes bounds over the convex hull and is significantly tighter than bound propagations over the bounding box or our $\ell_1$-like polytope. This bound propagation scales the state-of-the-art $\ell_0$ verifier on its most challenging robustness benchmarks by 1.24x-7.07x, with a geometric mean of 3.16.

*Miles Wang-Henderson,Ben Kaufman,Edward Williams,Ryan Pederson,Matteo Rossi,Owen Howell,Carl Underkoffler,Narbe Mardirossian,John Parkhill*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a scalable approach to improve drug design using probabilistic surrogates for binding affinity, enabling efficient Batch Bayesian Optimization (Batch BO).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The bottleneck in drug development lies in slow molecular synthesis and testing. Leveraging biomolecular foundation models as surrogates offers potential to accelerate this process.

Method: The authors employ Epistemic Neural Networks (ENNs) to create scalable joint predictive distributions of binding affinity, leveraging pre-trained structure-informed models and prior networks refined using synthetic data.

Result: The method rediscovered potent EGFR inhibitors using semi-synthetic benchmarks in up to 5x fewer iterations, and identified inhibitors in real-world datasets in up to 10x fewer iterations.

Conclusion: This scalable Batch BO approach improves efficiency in drug discovery, highlighting the utility of ENNs and prior networks for large-scale applications in molecular design.

Abstract: Batched synthesis and testing of molecular designs is the key bottleneck of drug development. There has been great interest in leveraging biomolecular foundation models as surrogates to accelerate this process. In this work, we show how to obtain scalable probabilistic surrogates of binding affinity for use in Batch Bayesian Optimization (Batch BO). This demands parallel acquisition functions that hedge between designs and the ability to rapidly sample from a joint predictive density to approximate them. Through the framework of Epistemic Neural Networks (ENNs), we obtain scalable joint predictive distributions of binding affinity on top of representations taken from large structure-informed models. Key to this work is an investigation into the importance of prior networks in ENNs and how to pretrain them on synthetic data to improve downstream performance in Batch BO. Their utility is demonstrated by rediscovering known potent EGFR inhibitors on a semi-synthetic benchmark in up to 5x fewer iterations, as well as potent inhibitors from a real-world small-molecule library in up to 10x fewer iterations, offering a promising solution for large-scale drug discovery applications.

*Zhanhong Fang,Debing Wang,Jinbiao Chen,Jiahai Wang,Zizhen Zhang*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: UCPO is a new framework enhancing neural solvers for combinatorial optimization with complex constraints using preference learning and a novel loss function.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural solvers often fail to handle complex constraints in combinatorial optimization problems despite outperforming traditional heuristics in various metrics.

Method: The UCPO framework uses preference learning integrated into neural solvers with a custom loss function and lightweight warm-start fine-tuning for pre-trained models.

Result: UCPO improves constraint satisfaction and optimization performance even on tasks with challenging constraints with minimal additional training.

Conclusion: UCPO provides an efficient, scalable, and generalizable solution to enhance neural solvers for constraint-heavy optimization tasks.

Abstract: Neural solvers have demonstrated remarkable success in combinatorial optimization, often surpassing traditional heuristics in speed, solution quality, and generalization. However, their efficacy deteriorates significantly when confronted with complex constraints that cannot be effectively managed through simple masking mechanisms. To address this limitation, we introduce Universal Constrained Preference Optimization (UCPO), a novel plug-and-play framework that seamlessly integrates preference learning into existing neural solvers via a specially designed loss function, without requiring architectural modifications. UCPO embeds constraint satisfaction directly into a preference-based objective, eliminating the need for meticulous hyperparameter tuning. Leveraging a lightweight warm-start fine-tuning protocol, UCPO enables pre-trained models to consistently produce near-optimal, feasible solutions on challenging constraint-laden tasks, achieving exceptional performance with as little as 1\% of the original training budget.

Main category: cs.PF

TL;DR: The paper identifies a performance drop, called the configuration wall, caused by growing CPU synchronization overhead in systems with complex accelerators. It proposes a new roofline model and compiler optimizations to address this issue, achieving significant performance boosts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the overlooked performance degradation in compute systems caused by increased configuration overhead when CPUs interact with faster and more complex hardware accelerators.

Method: The authors introduce a variant of the roofline model to measure configuration-bound performance and develop compiler abstractions and optimization passes in MLIR to mitigate performance losses.

Result: Experiments showed a 2x average performance improvement in the OpenGeMM system by reducing configuration cycles and hiding redundant ones.

Conclusion: This research provides insights into accelerator bottlenecks and introduces automated compiler solutions to overcome configuration-related performance losses, improving system efficiency.

Abstract: Contemporary compute platforms increasingly offload compute kernels from CPU to integrated hardware accelerators to reach maximum performance per Watt. Unfortunately, the time the CPU spends on setup control and synchronization has increased with growing accelerator complexity. For systems with complex accelerators, this means that performance can be configuration-bound. Faster accelerators are more severely impacted by this overlooked performance drop, which we call the configuration wall. Prior work evidences this wall and proposes ad-hoc solutions to reduce configuration overhead. However, these solutions are not universally applicable, nor do they offer comprehensive insights into the underlying causes of performance degradation. In this work, we first introduce a widely-applicable variant of the well-known roofline model to quantify when system performance is configuration-bound. To move systems out of the performance-bound region, we subsequently propose a domain-specific compiler abstraction and associated optimization passes. We implement the abstraction and passes in the MLIR compiler framework to run optimized binaries on open-source architectures to prove its effectiveness and generality. Experiments demonstrate a geomean performance boost of 2x on the open-source OpenGeMM system, by eliminating redundant configuration cycles and by automatically hiding the remaining configuration cycles. Our work provides key insights in how accelerator performance is affected by setup mechanisms, thereby facilitating automatic code generation for circumventing the configuration wall.

*Shiv Sundram,Akhilesh Balasingam,Nathan Zhang,Kunle Olukotun,Fredrik Kjolstad*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: Cyclotron is a framework and compiler for distributed dataflow algorithms, optimizing memory usage and enabling efficient execution across distributed processors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create an efficient and portable system for programming streaming dataflow algorithms using recurrence equations.

Method: The framework translates recurrence equations into distributed processor programs, optimizing memory interactions and offering scheduling control for streaming data.

Result: Cyclotron demonstrates its versatility by compiling IR to systolic arrays, distributed hardware simulations, and CPU clusters, achieving competitive performance in implementations.

Conclusion: Cyclotron enhances programming efficiency for distributed systems, supporting hardware exploration and delivering optimized implementations for various algorithms.

Abstract: We present Cyclotron, a framework and compiler for using recurrence equations to express streaming dataflow algorithms, which then get portably compiled to distributed topologies of interlinked processors. Our framework provides an input language of recurrences over logical tensors, which then gets lowered into an intermediate language of recurrences over logical iteration spaces, and finally into programs of send, receive, and computation operations specific to each individual processor. In Cyclotron's IR, programs are optimized such that external memory interactions are confined to the boundaries of the iteration space. Within inner iteration spaces, all data accesses become local: data accesses target values residing in local fast memory or on neighboring processing units, avoiding costly memory movement. We provide a scheduling language allowing users to define how data gets streamed and broadcasted between processors, enabling pipelined execution of computation kernels over distributed topologies of processing elements. We demonstrate the portability of our approach by compiling our IR to a reconfigurable simulator of systolic arrays and chiplet style distributed hardware, as well as to distributed-memory CPU clusters. In the simulated reconfigurable setting, we use our compiler for hardware design space exploration in which link costs and latencies can be specified. In the distributed CPU setting, we show how to use recurrences and our scheduling language to express various matrix multiplication routines (Cannon, SUMMA, PUMMA, weight stationary) and solvers (Triangular solve and Cholesky). For matrix multiplication and the triangular solve, we generate distributed implementations competitive with ScaLAPACK.

### [349] [Omnidirectional type inference for ML: principality any way](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10343)
*Alistair O'Brien,Didier Rémy,Gabriel Scherer*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: This paper introduces omnidirectional type inference as a solution to restore principality in type systems, resolving issues caused by extensions to ML.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing type systems, like ML, lose principality due to fragile constructs (e.g., GADTs, higher-rank polymorphism) from extensions, which makes type inference less predictable and often rigid.

Method: The introduction of omnidirectional type inference is proposed. This includes a method where typing constraints are solved in any order dynamically, using suspended match constraints. Incremental instantiation is also implemented to address let-generalization challenges.

Result: Omnidirectional type inference is applied to OCaml features like static overloading and semi-explicit first-class polymorphism, resulting in a principal type inference algorithm more expressive than OCaml's current type system.

Conclusion: This omnidirectional framework generalizes type inference, addresses fragile constructs, and enhances expressiveness for type systems like OCaml.

Abstract: The Damas-Hindley-Milner (ML) type system owes its success to principality, the property that every well-typed expression has a unique most general type. This makes inference predictable and efficient. Unfortunately, many extensions of ML (GADTs, higher-rank polymorphism, and static overloading) endanger princpality by introducing _fragile_ constructs that resist principal inference. Existing approaches recover principality through directional inference algorithms, which propagate _known_ type information in a fixed (or static) order (e.g. as in bidirectional typing) to disambiguate such constructs. However, the rigidity of a static inference order often causes otherwise well-typed programs to be rejected.
  We propose _omnidirectional_ type inference, where type information flows in a dynamic order. Typing constraints may be solved in any order, suspending when progress requires known type information and resuming once it becomes available, using _suspended match constraints_. This approach is straightforward for simply typed systems, but extending it to ML is challenging due to let-generalization. Existing ML inference algorithms type let-bindings (let x = e1 in e2) in a fixed order: type e1, generalize its type, and then type e2. To overcome this, we introduce _incremental instantiation_, allowing partially solved type schemes containing suspended constraints to be instantiated, with a mechanism to incrementally update instances as the scheme is refined.
  Omnidirectionality provides a general framework for restoring principality in the presence of fragile features. We demonstrate its versatility on two fundamentally different features of OCaml: static overloading of record labels and datatype constructors and semi-explicit first-class polymorphism. In both cases, we obtain a principal type inference algorithm that is more expressive than OCaml's current typechecker.

### [350] [Lazy Linearity for a Core Functional Language](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10361)
*Rodrigo Mesquita,Bernardo Toninho*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: This paper addresses the semantic interpretation of linear resources under non-strict evaluation, introducing Linear Core for linearly typed lazy languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current linear type systems equate syntactic occurrence with resource consumption, which fails under non-strict evaluation, necessitating a system that semantically captures linearity.

Method: The authors developed 'Linear Core,' an intermediate representation system for lazy languages and proved its soundness while implementing it as a compiler plugin.

Result: Linear Core preserves linearity across optimising transformations, unlike traditional Core systems, validating its application on linearity-critical modules.

Conclusion: Linear Core system improves handling of semantics in linearly typed lazy languages, preserving correctness during optimisation and showing promise for practical use in compilers.

Abstract: Traditionally, in linearly typed languages, consuming a linear resource is synonymous with its syntactic occurrence in the program. However, under the lens of non-strict evaluation, linearity can be further understood semantically, where a syntactic occurrence of a resource does not necessarily entail using that resource when the program is executed. While this distinction has been largely unexplored, it turns out to be inescapable in Haskell's optimising compiler, which heavily rewrites the source program in ways that break syntactic linearity but preserve the program's semantics. We introduce Linear Core, a novel system which accepts the lazy semantics of linearity statically and is suitable for lazy languages such as the Core intermediate language of the Glasgow Haskell Compiler. We prove that Linear Core is sound, guaranteeing linear resource usage, and that multiple optimising transformations preserve linearity in Linear Core while failing to do so in Core. We have implemented Linear Core as a compiler plugin to validate the system against linearity-heavy libraries, including linear-base.

TL;DR: This paper presents a unified approach to mathematically model and analyze CuTe and Triton layout systems using the Integer Set Library (ISL), enabling formal verification and cross-system optimizations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning compilers lack a unified system to formally analyze and optimize CuTe and Triton layouts, as these operate independently with distinct bases.

Method: The paper employs the Integer Set Library (ISL) to create integer set relations that mathematically model CuTe and Triton layouts, enabling robust algorithms for layout manipulation and verification.

Result: The mathematical modeling approach is validated through experimental evaluation, which successfully demonstrates the system's capability to handle complex tensor arrangements and transformations.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively bridges the gap between layout systems, providing a foundation for formal correctness and future cross-system optimization possibilities.

Abstract: Modern deep learning compilers rely on layout abstractions to manage the complex mapping between logical tensor structures and physical memory arrangements. CuTe layouts and Triton linear layouts are widely adopted industry standards. However, these layout systems operate independently with distinct mathematical underpinnings, preventing unified formal analysis and cross-system reasoning. We bridge this gap by introducing a novel approach that leverages the Integer Set Library (ISL) to create a unified mathematical representation for both layout systems through integer set relations, thereby enabling rigorous formal analysis, correctness verification, and the foundation for future cross-system optimization strategies. Our approach models CuTe layouts through integer set relations that encode the transformation from multi-dimensional coordinates to linear indices using stride-based calculations, including sophisticated swizzle operations that perform bit-level manipulations for enhanced memory access patterns. For Triton linear layouts, we construct integer set relations that model the binary vector space transformations where arithmetic operations follow finite field F_2 rules. We implement a complete suite of layout manipulation algorithms for composition, inversion, complement using built-in operations in ISL to ensure mathematical correctness and preserve layout semantics. Experimental evaluation shows that the system handles the full spectrum of layout complexity, from elementary identity transformations to sophisticated multi-dimensional tensor arrangements with complex stride configurations and swizzle patterns, validating the mathematical modeling approach across different layout paradigms.

*Rahul Krishnan,Ashley Samuelson,Emily Yao,Ethan Cecchetti*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: The paper presents zkStruDul, a language to unify input transformations and predicate definitions in NIZK proofs, eliminating code duplication and mismatches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches require separate implementations for predicate definitions and input transformations, leading to duplicated code and potential security issues.

Method: zkStruDul introduces a unified abstraction combining input transformations and predicate definitions into one framework, ensuring consistency and efficiency.

Result: The language provides high-level semantics, supports recursive proofs, and integrates seamlessly with existing NIZK proofs.

Conclusion: zkStruDul streamlines the process for NIZK proof generation, bolsters security, and simplifies reasoning.

Abstract: Non-Interactive Zero Knowledge (NIZK) proofs, such as zkSNARKS, let one prove knowledge of private data without revealing it or interacting with a verifier. While existing tooling focuses on specifying the predicate to be proven, real-world applications optimize predicate definitions to minimize proof generation overhead, but must correspondingly transform predicate inputs. Implementing these two steps separately duplicates logic that must precisely match to avoid catastrophic security flaws. We address this shortcoming with zkStruDul, a language that unifies input transformations and predicate definitions into a single combined abstraction from which a compiler can project both procedures, eliminating duplicate code and problematic mismatches. zkStruDul provides a high-level abstraction to layer on top of existing NIZK technology and supports important features like recursive proofs. We provide a source-level semantics and prove its behavior is identical to the projected semantics, allowing straightforward standard reasoning.

TL;DR: This paper introduces ScaleADFG, a framework combining a fully automated dataset construction pipeline and a grasp generation network to improve robotic tool-use manipulation. It focuses on addressing human-robot hand size mismatches and real-world object scale diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of this paper is to address challenges in robotic tool-use manipulation, particularly the lack of large-scale datasets and generalizability caused by differences in robotic and human hand sizes alongside real-world object scale variations.

Method: The proposed ScaleADFG framework consists of an automated dataset pipeline that generates diverse tool-use grasp configurations using an affordance-based algorithm without human demonstrations. It employs pre-trained models for 3D asset generation and lightweight grasp generation networks for efficient training.

Result: The authors constructed a dataset containing over 60,000 grasps and trained a network capable of effective and adaptable grasp generation. Experimental results in both simulation and real-world settings demonstrate enhanced stability, diversity, and zero-shot transfer capabilities.

Conclusion: ScaleADFG effectively overcomes hand-object scale mismatches and improves the generalizability of robotic grasping through a comprehensive dataset and efficient grasp generation network, making strides toward robust robotic manipulation of everyday tools.

Abstract: Dexterous functional tool-use grasping is essential for effective robotic manipulation of tools. However, existing approaches face significant challenges in efficiently constructing large-scale datasets and ensuring generalizability to everyday object scales. These issues primarily arise from size mismatches between robotic and human hands, and the diversity in real-world object scales. To address these limitations, we propose the ScaleADFG framework, which consists of a fully automated dataset construction pipeline and a lightweight grasp generation network. Our dataset introduce an affordance-based algorithm to synthesize diverse tool-use grasp configurations without expert demonstrations, allowing flexible object-hand size ratios and enabling large robotic hands (compared to human hands) to grasp everyday objects effectively. Additionally, we leverage pre-trained models to generate extensive 3D assets and facilitate efficient retrieval of object affordances. Our dataset comprising five object categories, each containing over 1,000 unique shapes with 15 scale variations. After filtering, the dataset includes over 60,000 grasps for each 2 dexterous robotic hands. On top of this dataset, we train a lightweight, single-stage grasp generation network with a notably simple loss design, eliminating the need for post-refinement. This demonstrates the critical importance of large-scale datasets and multi-scale object variant for effective training. Extensive experiments in simulation and on real robot confirm that the ScaleADFG framework exhibits strong adaptability to objects of varying scales, enhancing functional grasp stability, diversity, and generalizability. Moreover, our network exhibits effective zero-shot transfer to real-world objects. Project page is available at https://sizhe-wang.github.io/ScaleADFG_webpage

The hardware platform comprises a mobile base with a two-stage lift, on which a bimanual torso is mounted with a custom-designed drilling end effector and RGB-D cameras. To support teleoperation in dynamic environments with limited visibility, we use Gaussian splatting for online 3D reconstruction and introduce motion parameters to model moving objects. For safe operation around dynamic obstacles, we developed a neural configuration-space barrier approach for planning and control. Initial feasibility studies demonstrate the capability of the hardware in drilling, bolting, and anchoring, and the software in safe teleoperation in a dynamic environment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how autonomous robotic agents can learn self-exploration behaviors, drawing inspiration from infant development and curiosity-driven learning mechanisms.

Method: The approach involves using an RL framework where the agent receives intrinsic rewards for self-touch and hand regard. Techniques like high-dimensional tactile data transformation, motor babbling, intrinsic rewards, and curriculum learning are employed.

Result: The agent achieves broad body coverage, balance, and generalized tactile learning, as well as visual-motor coordination, purely driven by curiosity-based rewards without external supervision.

Conclusion: Curiosity-driven RL successfully enables an agent to transition from random actions to meaningful, coordinated behaviors, mimicking infant developmental patterns.

Abstract: Inspired by infant development, we propose a Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework for autonomous self-exploration in a robotic agent, Baby Sophia, using the BabyBench simulation environment. The agent learns self-touch and hand regard behaviors through intrinsic rewards that mimic an infant's curiosity-driven exploration of its own body. For self-touch, high-dimensional tactile inputs are transformed into compact, meaningful representations, enabling efficient learning. The agent then discovers new tactile contacts through intrinsic rewards and curriculum learning that encourage broad body coverage, balance, and generalization. For hand regard, visual features of the hands, such as skin-color and shape, are learned through motor babbling. Then, intrinsic rewards encourage the agent to perform novel hand motions, and follow its hands with its gaze. A curriculum learning setup from single-hand to dual-hand training allows the agent to reach complex visual-motor coordination. The results of this work demonstrate that purely curiosity-based signals, with no external supervision, can drive coordinated multimodal learning, imitating an infant's progression from random motor babbling to purposeful behaviors.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robotic systems often face a task-execution mismatch due to factors like unmodeled dynamics and system latency, which impede the ability to perfectly track desired motion plans generated by dynamical system-based learning from demonstration (DS-based LfD).

Method: The proposed approach, L1-DS, combines any DS-based LfD model with a nominal stabilizing controller, an L1 adaptive controller, and a windowed Dynamic Time Warping (DTW)-based target selector to handle temporal misalignment.

Result: The framework was tested on LASA and IROS handwriting datasets, demonstrating its ability to improve phase-consistent trajectory tracking in task-space operations.

Conclusion: The L1-DS architecture effectively mitigates task-execution mismatches, offering robust task-space control for DS-based LfD robotic systems.

Abstract: Dynamical system (DS)-based learning from demonstration (LfD) is a powerful tool for generating motion plans in the operation (`task') space of robotic systems. However, the realization of the generated motion plans is often compromised by a ''task-execution mismatch'', where unmodeled dynamics, persistent disturbances, and system latency cause the robot's actual task-space state to diverge from the desired motion trajectory. We propose a novel task-level robust control architecture, L1-augmented Dynamical Systems (L1-DS), that explicitly handles the task-execution mismatch in tracking a nominal motion plan generated by any DS-based LfD scheme. Our framework augments any DS-based LfD model with a nominal stabilizing controller and an L1 adaptive controller. Furthermore, we introduce a windowed Dynamic Time Warping (DTW)-based target selector, which enables the nominal stabilizing controller to handle temporal misalignment for improved phase-consistent tracking. We demonstrate the efficacy of our architecture on the LASA and IROS handwriting datasets.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a planning framework for autonomous robots to gather information safely in varying environments by modeling spatially varying information decay and enforcing safety through trajectory optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous robots face challenges in information gathering due to dynamic environments where information value decays over time and space, especially if regions are not revisited, and safety considerations are often treated inadequately.

Method: The paper utilizes a framework called Stein Variational Clarity-Aware Informative Planning, integrating clarity dynamics—representing information uncertainty—with trajectory optimization using Bayesian inference and a safety filtering mechanism.

Result: The planner demonstrates consistent safety and reduced information deficits in experiments and simulations conducted in environments with varying decay rates and obstacles.

Conclusion: Incorporating clarity-aware dynamics and safety verification enables autonomous robots to safely perform efficient and informed trajectory planning in dynamic settings with spatially varying information decay.

Abstract: Autonomous robots are increasingly deployed for information-gathering tasks in environments that vary across space and time. Planning informative and safe trajectories in such settings is challenging because information decays when regions are not revisited. Most existing planners model information as static or uniformly decaying, ignoring environments where the decay rate varies spatially; those that model non-uniform decay often overlook how it evolves along the robot's motion, and almost all treat safety as a soft penalty. In this paper, we address these challenges. We model uncertainty in the environment using clarity, a normalized representation of differential entropy from our earlier work that captures how information improves through new measurements and decays over time when regions are not revisited. Building on this, we present Stein Variational Clarity-Aware Informative Planning, a framework that embeds clarity dynamics within trajectory optimization and enforces safety through a low-level filtering mechanism based on our earlier gatekeeper framework for safety verification. The planner performs Bayesian inference-based learning via Stein variational inference, refining a distribution over informative trajectories while filtering each nominal Stein informative trajectory to ensure safety. Hardware experiments and simulations across environments with varying decay rates and obstacles demonstrate consistent safety and reduced information deficits.

Motivation: Amphibians exhibit adaptive morphologies for terrestrial and aquatic motion, inspiring the creation of a versatile robot capable of multi-environment mobility.

Method: PuffyBot uses a scissor-lift mechanism driven by a linear actuator for volume-based shape morphing, integrated with bell-crank linkages for limb adjustments, ensuring crawling and swimming capabilities.

Result: Experimental results show PuffyBot's effective locomotion across land, underwater floors, swimming on water surfaces, and buoyancy adjustments for submersion and resurfacing.

Conclusion: Shape morphing technology, as demonstrated in PuffyBot, offers promising potential for energy-efficient and versatile robotic applications across varied environments.

Abstract: Amphibians adapt their morphologies and motions to accommodate movement in both terrestrial and aquatic environments. Inspired by these biological features, we present PuffyBot, an untethered shape morphing robot capable of changing its body morphology to navigate multiple environments. Our robot design leverages a scissor-lift mechanism driven by a linear actuator as its primary structure to achieve shape morphing. The transformation enables a volume change from 255.00 cm3 to 423.75 cm3, modulating the buoyant force to counteract a downward force of 3.237 N due to 330 g mass of the robot. A bell-crank linkage is integrated with the scissor-lift mechanism, which adjusts the servo-actuated limbs by 90 degrees, allowing a seamless transition between crawling and swimming modes. The robot is fully waterproof, using thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) fabric to ensure functionality in aquatic environments. The robot can operate untethered for two hours with an onboard battery of 1000 mA h. Our experimental results demonstrate multi-environment locomotion, including crawling on the land, crawling on the underwater floor, swimming on the water surface, and bimodal buoyancy adjustment to submerge underwater or resurface. These findings show the potential of shape morphing to create versatile and energy efficient robotic platforms suitable for diverse environments.

### [359] [A Study on Enhancing the Generalization Ability of Visuomotor Policies via Data Augmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09932)
*Hanwen Wang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper addresses enhancing visuomotor policy generalization using automated and diverse data generation, incorporating various randomization factors to improve sim-to-real transfer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Visuomotor policies need better generalization capabilities to operate efficiently across diverse scenarios, as current data generation methods often lack sufficient diversity to achieve this.

Method: The authors propose an automated approach for generating more diverse training datasets that include a wide variety of scene layout factors, using minimal human demonstrations.

Result: The study demonstrates that randomizing factors like camera pose, lighting, textures, and more significantly improves policy generalization for manipulation tasks, especially in zero-shot sim-to-real transfer.

Conclusion: Incorporating extensive randomization in training data improves visuomotor policy’s generalization ability, making it more effective for deployment in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: The generalization ability of visuomotor policy is crucial, as a good policy should be deployable across diverse scenarios. Some methods can collect large amounts of trajectory augmentation data to train more generalizable imitation learning policies, aimed at handling the random placement of objects on the scene's horizontal plane. However, the data generated by these methods still lack diversity, which limits the generalization ability of the trained policy. To address this, we investigate the performance of policies trained by existing methods across different scene layout factors via automate the data generation for those factors that significantly impact generalization. We have created a more extensively randomized dataset that can be efficiently and automatically generated with only a small amount of human demonstration. The dataset covers five types of manipulators and two types of grippers, incorporating extensive randomization factors such as camera pose, lighting conditions, tabletop texture, and table height across six manipulation tasks. We found that all of these factors influence the generalization ability of the policy. Applying any form of randomization enhances policy generalization, with diverse trajectories particularly effective in bridging visual gap. Notably, we investigated on low-cost manipulator the effect of the scene randomization proposed in this work on enhancing the generalization capability of visuomotor policies for zero-shot sim-to-real transfer.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces Audio-VLA, a multimodal robotic policy incorporating contact audio to improve dynamic manipulation processes perception and results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitation of vision-only Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models in perceiving interactive and dynamic processes during robotic manipulation.

Method: Audio-VLA integrates audio using AudioCLIP encoder, visual data through DINOv2 and SigLIP, and applies Llama2 for language tasks, with fine-tuning via LoRA to align cross-modal content. Enhanced simulation environments offer realistic audio feedback.

Result: Audio-VLA outperforms vision-only models in robotic manipulation tasks. The Task Completion Rate (TCR) metric effectively assesses dynamic process perception.

Conclusion: By incorporating audio feedback and introducing the TCR metric, Audio-VLA improves robotic manipulation evaluation and dynamic process interaction, enhancing multimodal capabilities.

Abstract: The Vision-Language-Action models (VLA) have achieved significant advances in robotic manipulation recently. However, vision-only VLA models create fundamental limitations, particularly in perceiving interactive and manipulation dynamic processes. This paper proposes Audio-VLA, a multimodal manipulation policy that leverages contact audio to perceive contact events and dynamic process feedback. Audio-VLA overcomes the vision-only constraints of VLA models. Additionally, this paper introduces the Task Completion Rate (TCR) metric to systematically evaluate dynamic operational processes. Audio-VLA employs pre-trained DINOv2 and SigLIP as visual encoders, AudioCLIP as the audio encoder, and Llama2 as the large language model backbone. We apply LoRA fine-tuning to these pre-trained modules to achieve robust cross-modal understanding of both visual and acoustic inputs. A multimodal projection layer aligns features from different modalities into the same feature space. Moreover RLBench and LIBERO simulation environments are enhanced by adding collision-based audio generation to provide realistic sound feedback during object interactions. Since current robotic manipulation evaluations focus on final outcomes rather than providing systematic assessment of dynamic operational processes, the proposed TCR metric measures how well robots perceive dynamic processes during manipulation, creating a more comprehensive evaluation metric. Extensive experiments on LIBERO, RLBench, and two real-world tasks demonstrate Audio-VLA's superior performance over vision-only comparative methods, while the TCR metric effectively quantifies dynamic process perception capabilities.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a systematic study of physical sensor attacks on Vision-Language-Action (VLA) systems and proposes methods to enhance their robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLA models rely heavily on sensory inputs to function effectively, yet the potential vulnerabilities and security risks posed by physical-world sensor attacks have not been adequately studied.

Method: The paper presents a 'Real-Sim-Real' framework that simulates and validates physics-based sensor attack vectors, including six camera-targeted and two microphone-targeted attacks, with evaluations across VLA architectures and tasks.

Result: The study reveals significant vulnerabilities in VLA systems to sensor attacks, depending on task types and model designs, and demonstrates an effective adversarial-training-based defense to improve robustness.

Conclusion: There is a critical need for standardized robustness benchmarks and strategies to mitigate vulnerabilities in VLA models for safe deployment in real-world, safety-critical applications.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models revolutionize robotic systems by enabling end-to-end perception-to-action pipelines that integrate multiple sensory modalities, such as visual signals processed by cameras and auditory signals captured by microphones. This multi-modality integration allows VLA models to interpret complex, real-world environments using diverse sensor data streams. Given the fact that VLA-based systems heavily rely on the sensory input, the security of VLA models against physical-world sensor attacks remains critically underexplored.
  To address this gap, we present the first systematic study of physical sensor attacks against VLAs, quantifying the influence of sensor attacks and investigating the defenses for VLA models. We introduce a novel ``Real-Sim-Real'' framework that automatically simulates physics-based sensor attack vectors, including six attacks targeting cameras and two targeting microphones, and validates them on real robotic systems. Through large-scale evaluations across various VLA architectures and tasks under varying attack parameters, we demonstrate significant vulnerabilities, with susceptibility patterns that reveal critical dependencies on task types and model designs. We further develop an adversarial-training-based defense that enhances VLA robustness against out-of-distribution physical perturbations caused by sensor attacks while preserving model performance. Our findings expose an urgent need for standardized robustness benchmarks and mitigation strategies to secure VLA deployments in safety-critical environments.

To analyze the agile locomotion capabilities of the design numerically, we propose a new descriptive metric, called the `Fastest Achievable Swing Time` (FAST), and perform a quantitative evaluation of the proposed design and compare it with other designs. Then we evaluate the performance of the DecARt Leg-based robot via extensive simulation and preliminary hardware experiments.

*Yizheng Wang,Timon Rabczuk,Yinghua Liu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces a physics-inspired machine learning method using Kolmogorov Arnold Network (KAN) for robotic friction modeling, ensuring interpretability and high prediction accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional static friction models like the Stribeck model rely on predefined assumptions, which struggle with unknown functional structures, limiting their precision in robotic motion control.

Method: The proposed approach applies KAN with spline activation functions and symbolic regression to simplify models and extract physical expressions, handling challenges from noisy data and unknown structures.

Result: Experiments on synthetic and real data from a robotic manipulator achieve over 0.95 determination coefficients and concise, interpretable friction expressions.

Conclusion: The method offers a robust, interpretable, and generalizable technique for friction modeling, enhancing its engineering applicability.

Abstract: Friction modeling plays a crucial role in achieving high-precision motion control in robotic operating systems. Traditional static friction models (such as the Stribeck model) are widely used due to their simple forms; however, they typically require predefined functional assumptions, which poses significant challenges when dealing with unknown functional structures. To address this issue, this paper proposes a physics-inspired machine learning approach based on the Kolmogorov Arnold Network (KAN) for static friction modeling of robotic joints. The method integrates spline activation functions with a symbolic regression mechanism, enabling model simplification and physical expression extraction through pruning and attribute scoring, while maintaining both high prediction accuracy and interpretability. We first validate the method's capability to accurately identify key parameters under known functional models, and further demonstrate its robustness and generalization ability under conditions with unknown functional structures and noisy data. Experiments conducted on both synthetic data and real friction data collected from a six-degree-of-freedom industrial manipulator show that the proposed method achieves a coefficient of determination greater than 0.95 across various tasks and successfully extracts concise and physically meaningful friction expressions. This study provides a new perspective for interpretable and data-driven robotic friction modeling with promising engineering applicability.

Motivation: Offline-to-online reinforcement learning is important for safe and efficient robotic applications but faces challenges like limited multimodal behavior coverage and online distributional shifts.

Method: The authors propose UEPO, which includes a multi-seed dynamics-aware diffusion policy, dynamic divergence regularization for policy diversity, and a diffusion-based data augmentation module to improve generalization.

Result: UEPO demonstrated significant performance improvement on the D4RL benchmark, achieving +5.9% better results in locomotion tasks and +12.4% in dexterous manipulation compared to Uni-O4.

Conclusion: UEPO effectively addresses the challenges in O2O-RL and improves policy generalization and scalability in robotic tasks, proving its value as a practical and robust RL framework.

Abstract: Offline-to-online reinforcement learning (O2O-RL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for safe and efficient robotic policy deployment but suffers from two fundamental challenges: limited coverage of multimodal behaviors and distributional shifts during online adaptation. We propose UEPO, a unified generative framework inspired by large language model pretraining and fine-tuning strategies. Our contributions are threefold: (1) a multi-seed dynamics-aware diffusion policy that efficiently captures diverse modalities without training multiple models; (2) a dynamic divergence regularization mechanism that enforces physically meaningful policy diversity; and (3) a diffusion-based data augmentation module that enhances dynamics model generalization. On the D4RL benchmark, UEPO achieves +5.9\% absolute improvement over Uni-O4 on locomotion tasks and +12.4\% on dexterous manipulation, demonstrating strong generalization and scalability.

*Kamil Dreczkowski,Pietro Vitiello,Vitalis Vosylius,Edward Johns*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The study introduces a method called Multi-Task Trajectory Transfer (MT3) focused on improving learning efficiency for robot manipulation tasks through decomposition and retrieval-based generalisation, enabling learning with minimal demonstrations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robots currently require extensive demonstrations to learn manipulation tasks, which is inefficient. The paper aims to improve this process by introducing more efficient learning methods.

Method: The approach decomposes manipulation trajectories into alignment and interaction phases and utilizes retrieval-based generalisation. The effectiveness of this method is systematically studied and compared against behavioral cloning.

Result: The MT3 method demonstrates significant data efficiency improvements, generalizable learning from single demonstrations, and the ability to teach a robot 1,000 diverse everyday tasks in under 24 human hours.

Conclusion: MT3 showcases impressive capabilities in data efficiency and task generalisation, highlighting a promising approach to robot learning with minimal human effort, though limitations across tasks were noted.

Abstract: Humans are remarkably efficient at learning tasks from demonstrations, but today's imitation learning methods for robot manipulation often require hundreds or thousands of demonstrations per task. We investigate two fundamental priors for improving learning efficiency: decomposing manipulation trajectories into sequential alignment and interaction phases, and retrieval-based generalisation. Through 3,450 real-world rollouts, we systematically study this decomposition. We compare different design choices for the alignment and interaction phases, and examine generalisation and scaling trends relative to today's dominant paradigm of behavioural cloning with a single-phase monolithic policy. In the few-demonstrations-per-task regime (<10 demonstrations), decomposition achieves an order of magnitude improvement in data efficiency over single-phase learning, with retrieval consistently outperforming behavioural cloning for both alignment and interaction. Building on these insights, we develop Multi-Task Trajectory Transfer (MT3), an imitation learning method based on decomposition and retrieval. MT3 learns everyday manipulation tasks from as little as a single demonstration each, whilst also generalising to novel object instances. This efficiency enables us to teach a robot 1,000 distinct everyday tasks in under 24 hours of human demonstrator time. Through 2,200 additional real-world rollouts, we reveal MT3's capabilities and limitations across different task families.

Motivation: Existing robotic manipulation benchmarks are limited to simplified tabletop scenarios, ignoring realistic environments like retail spaces with automation potential.

Method: RoboBenchMart includes tools such as a procedural store layout generator, trajectory generation pipeline, evaluation tools, and fine-tuned baseline models.

Result: State-of-the-art generalist models struggle with complex manipulation tasks in the retail-like benchmark environment.

Conclusion: RoboBenchMart addresses the gap in robotic benchmarks for realistic retail environments and supports further research with released tools and models.

Abstract: Most existing robotic manipulation benchmarks focus on simplified tabletop scenarios, typically involving a stationary robotic arm interacting with various objects on a flat surface. To address this limitation, we introduce RoboBenchMart, a more challenging and realistic benchmark designed for dark store environments, where robots must perform complex manipulation tasks with diverse grocery items. This setting presents significant challenges, including dense object clutter and varied spatial configurations -- with items positioned at different heights, depths, and in close proximity. By targeting the retail domain, our benchmark addresses a setting with strong potential for near-term automation impact. We demonstrate that current state-of-the-art generalist models struggle to solve even common retail tasks. To support further research, we release the RoboBenchMart suite, which includes a procedural store layout generator, a trajectory generation pipeline, evaluation tools and fine-tuned baseline models.

*Mingxing Peng,Ruoyu Yao,Xusen Guo,Jun Ma*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces nuPlan-R, a closed-loop planning benchmark for autonomous vehicles that utilizes realistic, diverse, and interaction-aware reactive multi-agent simulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks for autonomous vehicle evaluation rely on rule-based reactive agents like IDM, which fail to capture realistic human interactions and lead to overly simplistic traffic modeling.

Method: The study develops the nuPlan-R benchmark by replacing rule-based agents with diffusion-based reactive agents, introducing an interaction-aware agent selection mechanism, and incorporating additional metrics for deeper planning evaluation.

Result: Tests show that the new reactive agent model creates more realistic and human-like traffic behaviors, improving the evaluation environment for autonomous vehicle planners.

Conclusion: nuPlan-R sets a new standard in closed-loop planning evaluation by allowing realistic and diverse human-like interactions, emphasizing the strengths of learning-based planners in dynamic environments.

Abstract: Recent advances in closed-loop planning benchmarks have significantly improved the evaluation of autonomous vehicles. However, existing benchmarks still rely on rule-based reactive agents such as the Intelligent Driver Model (IDM), which lack behavioral diversity and fail to capture realistic human interactions, leading to oversimplified traffic dynamics. To address these limitations, we present nuPlan-R, a new reactive closed-loop planning benchmark that integrates learning-based reactive multi-agent simulation into the nuPlan framework. Our benchmark replaces the rule-based IDM agents with noise-decoupled diffusion-based reactive agents and introduces an interaction-aware agent selection mechanism to ensure both realism and computational efficiency. Furthermore, we extend the benchmark with two additional metrics to enable a more comprehensive assessment of planning performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our reactive agent model produces more realistic, diverse, and human-like traffic behaviors, leading to a benchmark environment that better reflects real-world interactive driving. We further reimplement a collection of rule-based, learning-based, and hybrid planning approaches within our nuPlan-R benchmark, providing a clearer reflection of planner performance in complex interactive scenarios and better highlighting the advantages of learning-based planners in handling complex and dynamic scenarios. These results establish nuPlan-R as a new standard for fair, reactive, and realistic closed-loop planning evaluation. We will open-source the code for the new benchmark.

TL;DR: The paper introduces methods to improve trajectory prediction in safety-critical, rare scenarios by creating challenging evaluation settings and proposing enhancements to prediction models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current trajectory prediction in autonomous driving struggles with rare, critical scenarios, making real-world testing insufficient for robustness.

Method: The researchers propose new long-tail evaluation settings using a novel safety-informed scenario factorization framework and organzine datasets into closed-world and open-world test cases. Additionally, they enhance modular gating networks and add difficulty-prediction mechanisms to prediction models.

Result: The study found significant improvement, reducing out-of-distribution (OOD) performance gaps by 45% in closed-world settings and 21.8% in open-world scenarios relative to baselines.

Conclusion: The proposed approaches offer improved robustness to rare, safety-critical scenarios in autonomous driving, enhancing both OOD and in-distribution prediction performance.

Abstract: Methods for trajectory prediction in Autonomous Driving must contend with rare, safety-critical scenarios that make reliance on real-world data collection alone infeasible. To assess robustness under such conditions, we propose new long-tail evaluation settings that repartition datasets to create challenging out-of-distribution (OOD) test sets. We first introduce a safety-informed scenario factorization framework, which disentangles scenarios into discrete ego and social contexts. Building on analogies to compositional zero-shot image-labeling in Computer Vision, we then hold out novel context combinations to construct challenging closed-world and open-world settings. This process induces OOD performance gaps in future motion prediction of 5.0% and 14.7% in closed-world and open-world settings, respectively, relative to in-distribution performance for a state-of-the-art baseline. To improve generalization, we extend task-modular gating networks to operate within trajectory prediction models, and develop an auxiliary, difficulty-prediction head to refine internal representations. Our strategies jointly reduce the OOD performance gaps to 2.8% and 11.5% in the two settings, respectively, while still improving in-distribution performance.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper proposes a robotized bolting control framework to improve precision, fault tolerance, and situational awareness in operations, validated in pipe flange joining tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of reliable autonomy and fault management in robotic bolting systems, which are crucial for industrial and scientific applications.

Method: Introduced a robotic system featuring precise torque control, active compliance, and a multimodal human-robot interface for real-time visualization and transitions between manual and automatic modes. Used a high-level supervisor to coordinate execution.

Result: The system demonstrated improved fault detection, enhanced operator situational awareness, and compliant bolting execution under fault conditions, though its camera setup revealed limitations in full situational awareness.

Conclusion: The system advances reliable self-governed bolting operations but highlights the need for improved sensing mechanisms for complete situational awareness.

Abstract: Bolting operations are critical in industrial assembly and in the maintenance of scientific facilities, requiring high precision and robustness to faults. Although robotic solutions have the potential to improve operational safety and effectiveness, current systems still lack reliable autonomy and fault management capabilities. To address this gap, we propose a control framework for dependable robotized bolting tasks and instantiate it on a specific robotic system. The system features a control architecture ensuring accurate driving torque control and active compliance throughout the entire operation, enabling safe interaction even under fault conditions. By designing a multimodal human-robot interface (HRI) providing real-time visualization of relevant system information and supporting seamless transitions between automatic and manual control, we improve operator situation awareness and fault detection capabilities. A high-level supervisor (SV) coordinates the execution and manages transitions between control modes, ensuring consistency with the supervisory control (SVC) paradigm, while preserving the human operator's authority. The system is validated in a representative bolting operation involving pipe flange joining, under several fault conditions. The results demonstrate improved fault detection capabilities, enhanced operator situational awareness, and accurate and compliant execution of the bolting operation. However, they also reveal the limitations of relying on a single camera to achieve full situational awareness.

Motivation: The motivation behind this paper is to overcome the challenges of accurately simulating the folding behavior and environmental interactions of origami-inspired mechanisms, which are increasingly valuable in robotics and deployable systems due to their lightweight and compact properties.

Method: The authors developed a design framework that uses MuJoCo's deformable-body capabilities to simulate origami mechanisms. Origami sheets are represented as interconnected deformable elements, and user-defined constraints like creases and actuation are specified via an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI). Simulation-based design optimization is performed using CMA-ES.

Conclusion: The developed framework enables rapid and accurate simulation, optimization, and analysis of origami-inspired mechanisms, showcasing its potential for advancing origami-based applications in robotics and deployable systems.

Abstract: Origami-inspired mechanisms can transform flat sheets into functional three-dimensional dynamic structures that are lightweight, compact, and capable of complex motion. These properties make origami increasingly valuable in robotic and deployable systems. However, accurately simulating their folding behavior and interactions with the environment remains challenging. To address this, we present a design framework for origami mechanism simulation that utilizes MuJoCo's deformable-body capabilities. In our approach, origami sheets are represented as graphs of interconnected deformable elements with user-specified constraints such as creases and actuation, defined through an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI). This framework allows users to generate physically consistent simulations that capture both the geometric structure of origami mechanisms and their interactions with external objects and surfaces. We demonstrate our method's utility through a case study on an origami catapult, where design parameters are optimized in simulation using the Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES) and validated experimentally on physical prototypes. The optimized structure achieves improved throwing performance, illustrating how our system enables rapid, simulation-driven origami design, optimization, and analysis.

Motivation: Navigation in post-disaster settings is difficult due to unstructured environments, requiring innovative solutions for rescue operations.

Conclusion: Optimized path planning for UAVs improves data collection and navigation in unstructured post-disaster environments, aiding rescue efforts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bipedal robots are at risk of falling in real-world situations, and preventing physical damage during such incidents is critical to enhance robot reliability and functionality.

Method: A robot-agnostic reward function is introduced for reinforcement learning, combining impact minimization, protection of critical parts, and achievement of desired end poses. A simulation-based sampling strategy is used to handle diverse initial and end pose conditions.

Result: Demonstrated that bipedal robots could perform controlled and soft falls through simulated and real-world experiments.

Conclusion: The methods proposed enable bipedal robots to achieve safe and user-controllable falls, improving their resilience in real-world operations.

Abstract: Despite recent advances in robust locomotion, bipedal robots operating in the real world remain at risk of falling. While most research focuses on preventing such events, we instead concentrate on the phenomenon of falling itself. Specifically, we aim to reduce physical damage to the robot while providing users with control over a robot's end pose. To this end, we propose a robot agnostic reward function that balances the achievement of a desired end pose with impact minimization and the protection of critical robot parts during reinforcement learning. To make the policy robust to a broad range of initial falling conditions and to enable the specification of an arbitrary and unseen end pose at inference time, we introduce a simulation-based sampling strategy of initial and end poses. Through simulated and real-world experiments, our work demonstrates that even bipedal robots can perform controlled, soft falls.

*Wasique Islam Shafin,Md Nakhla Rafi,Zhenhao Li,Tse-Hsun Chen*

TL;DR: This paper investigates how structured multi-agent workflows impact LLMs' performance in class-level code generation, using 100 Python tasks and a simulated Waterfall-style process.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study explores whether structured software development workflows, such as Waterfall-style, improve the effectiveness and quality of multi-agent LLM-generated code at the class-level.

Method: The authors simulate a Waterfall-style development process, including Requirement, Design, Implementation, and Testing phases, across three LLMs (GPT-4o-mini, DeepSeek-Chat, Claude-3.5-Haiku) using tasks from the ClassEval benchmark.

Result: Findings reveal that workflows reshape model behavior rather than consistently improving it. Waterfall-style collaboration produces cleaner, maintainable code but may reduce functional correctness for two LLMs (-37.8% and -39.8%), while one LLM showed improved correctness (+9.5%).

Conclusion: Structured processes like Waterfall fundamentally change how LLMs reason and collaborate, presenting trade-offs between disciplined workflows and flexible problem-solving, especially regarding error types and code correctness.

Abstract: Modern software systems require code that is not only functional but also maintainable and well-structured. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used to automate software development, most studies focus on isolated, single-agent function-level generation. This work examines how process structure and role specialization shape multi-agent LLM workflows for class-level code generation. We simulate a Waterfall-style development cycle covering Requirement, Design, Implementation, and Testing using three LLMs (GPT-4o-mini, DeepSeek-Chat, and Claude-3.5-Haiku) on 100 Python tasks from the ClassEval benchmark. Our findings show that multi-agent workflows reorganize, rather than consistently enhance, model performance. Waterfall-style collaboration produces cleaner and more maintainable code but often reduces functional correctness (-37.8\% for GPT-4o-mini and -39.8\% for DeepSeek-Chat), with Claude-3.5-Haiku as a notable exception (+9.5\%). Importantly, process constraints shift failure characteristics: structural issues such as missing code decrease, while semantic and validation errors become more frequent. Among all stages, Testing exerts the strongest influence by improving verification coverage but also introducing new reasoning failures, whereas Requirement and Design have comparatively modest effects. Overall, this study provides empirical evidence that software process structure fundamentally alters how LLMs reason, collaborate, and fail, revealing inherent trade-offs between rigid workflow discipline and flexible problem-solving in multi-agent code generation.

*Noah van der Vleuten,Anthony Flores,Shray Mathur,Max Rakitin,Thomas Hopkins,Kevin G. Yager,Esther H. R. Tsai*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces EnvTrace, a simulation method evaluating large language models (LLMs) in complex instrument control tasks using execution traces and digital twins.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluation methods for LLMs fail to capture nuanced behaviors required for physical system control. The paper aims to address this gap to improve LLMs' performance and safety in complex tasks.

Method: EnvTrace uses a simulation-based approach with a beamline control digital twin to assess LLM performance via trace alignment, providing detailed scoring on functional correctness across behavioral dimensions.

Result: Over 30 LLMs were tested, showing some top models capable of achieving human-level performance in control-code generation and validating functional correctness in simulated tasks.

Conclusion: EnvTrace demonstrates the potential for LLMs to work symbiotically with digital twins for intuitive control and autonomous AI applications, marking an advancement in safe and precise embodied AI systems.

Abstract: Evaluating large language models (LLMs) for instrument control requires methods that go beyond standard, stateless algorithmic benchmarks, since the behavior of physical systems cannot be fully captured by unit tests alone. Here we introduce EnvTrace, a simulation-based method that evaluates execution traces to assess semantic code equivalence. EnvTrace is demonstrated with a beamline control-logic digital twin to facilitate the evaluation of instrument control code, with the digital twin itself also enabling the pre-execution validation of live experiments. Over 30 LLMs were evaluated using trace alignment to generate a multi-faceted score for functional correctness across key behavioral dimensions, showing that many top-tier models can approach human-level performance in rapid control-code generation. This is a first step toward a broader vision where LLMs and digital twins work symbiotically: LLMs providing intuitive control and agentic orchestration, and digital twins offering safe and high-fidelity environments, paving the way towards autonomous embodied AI.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces a benchmark generation process for evaluating evolving AI agents, focusing on enterprise-scale challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the shortcomings of fixed benchmarks in evaluating enterprise-scale AI agents by providing a dynamic evaluation framework as services and requirements evolve.

Method: A benchmark generation process that uses semi-structured developer documents and modern LLMs to dynamically create new benchmarks for evolving AI agents.

Result: The process was applied to a case study on service migration at a large enterprise, showing it can provide maintainable evaluation and enable rapid feedback on agent performance.

Conclusion: The method offers a robust and adaptive framework for evaluating AI agents, particularly in dynamic enterprise settings, ensuring better agent reliability and utility.

Abstract: The rapid adoption of AI agents across domains has made systematic evaluation crucial for ensuring their usefulness and successful production deployment. Evaluation of AI agents typically involves using a fixed set of benchmarks and computing multiple evaluation metrics for the agent. While sufficient for simple coding tasks, these benchmarks fall short for enterprise-scale agents, where services and requirements evolve continuously and ground-truth examples are sparse. We propose a process of benchmark generation that helps evolve the benchmarks as the requirements change and perform robust evaluation of evolving AI agents. We instantiate this approach for a case study of service migration from one deployment platform to another at a large public enterprise. Our approach relies on semi-structured documents where developers express the high-level intent, and uses state-of-the-art LLMs to generate benchmarks from just a small number of such documents. Overall, this process results in a maintainable evaluation framework, enabling rapid feedback on agent performance and facilitating targeted improvements.

*Xin Sun,Daniel Ståhl,Kristian Sandahl,Christoph Kessler*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper evaluates the non-functional qualities of LLM-generated code, focusing on aspects like security, maintainability, and performance efficiency, identifying gaps between academic priorities, industry concerns, and model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of systematic understanding and evaluation of the non-functional qualities of LLM-generated code in software engineering workflows.

Method: Three complementary approaches: 1) systematic review of 108 academic papers, 2) two industry workshops with practitioners, and 3) empirical analysis of generated code patches from three LLMs focused on quality dimensions.

Result: Findings show a disparity between academic focus on security and performance efficiency, industry priorities on maintainability and readability, and the trade-offs in quality dimensions of generated patches.

Conclusion: The study highlights the need to incorporate quality assurance mechanisms into LLM code generation workflows to better align academic research, industry needs, and model outputs.

Abstract: In recent years, LLMs have been widely integrated into software engineering workflows, supporting tasks like code generation. However, while these models often generate functionally correct outputs, we still lack a systematic understanding and evaluation of their non-functional qualities. Existing studies focus mainly on whether generated code passes the tests rather than whether it passes with quality. Guided by the ISO/IEC 25010 quality model, this study conducted three complementary investigations: a systematic review of 108 papers, two industry workshops with practitioners from multiple organizations, and an empirical analysis of patching real-world software issues using three LLMs. Motivated by insights from both the literature and practitioners, the empirical study examined the quality of generated patches on security, maintainability, and performance efficiency. Across the literature, we found that security and performance efficiency dominate academic attention, while maintainability and other qualities are understudied. In contrast, industry experts prioritize maintainability and readability, warning that generated code may accelerate the accumulation of technical debt. In our evaluation of functionally correct patches generated by three LLMs, improvements in one quality dimension often come at the cost of others. Runtime and memory results further show high variance across models and optimization strategies. Overall, our findings reveal a mismatch between academic focus, industry priorities, and model performance, highlighting the urgent need to integrate quality assurance mechanisms into LLM code generation pipelines to ensure that future generated code not only passes tests but truly passes with quality.

### [377] [A Large-Scale Collection Of (Non-)Actionable Static Code Analysis Reports](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10323)
*Dávid Kószó,Tamás Aladics,Rudolf Ferenc,Péter Hegedűs*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper addresses the problem of excessive non-actionable warnings in Static Code Analysis (SCA) tools by introducing a methodology and dataset, NASCAR, for identifying actionable warnings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Developers experience "alert fatigue" due to the overload of non-actionable warnings from SCA tools, hindering productivity and code quality.

Method: The researchers propose a novel methodology for collecting, categorizing, and distinguishing actionable vs. non-actionable SCA warnings, generating a dataset of over 1 million Java warnings (NASCAR).

Result: The study produced NASCAR, a large-scale dataset consisting of categorized SCA warnings, and made it publicly available for further research.

Conclusion: This work contributes to improving SCA tools and reducing alert fatigue, enabling better code quality and development productivity through future applications of the dataset and methodology.

Abstract: Static Code Analysis (SCA) tools, while invaluable for identifying potential coding problems, functional bugs, or vulnerabilities, often generate an overwhelming number of warnings, many of which are non-actionable. This overload of alerts leads to ``alert fatigue'', a phenomenon where developers become desensitized to warnings, potentially overlooking critical issues and ultimately hindering productivity and code quality. Analyzing these warnings and training machine learning models to identify and filter them requires substantial datasets, which are currently scarce, particularly for Java. This scarcity impedes efforts to improve the accuracy and usability of SCA tools and mitigate the effects of alert fatigue. In this paper, we address this gap by introducing a novel methodology for collecting and categorizing SCA warnings, effectively distinguishing actionable from non-actionable ones. We further leverage this methodology to generate a large-scale dataset of over 1 million entries of Java source code warnings, named NASCAR: (Non-)Actionable Static Code Analysis Reports. To facilitate follow-up research in this domain, we make both the dataset and the tools used to generate it publicly available.

*Shuangyu Lyu,Chuan Luo,Ruizhi Shi,Wei Wu,Chanjuan Liu,Chunming Hu*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper introduces PanSampler, an advanced SMT sampler that generates diverse solutions with high coverage using fewer samples for improved software and hardware testing efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for diverse and high-coverage SMT solutions in software and hardware testing, while minimizing the number of solutions to reduce testing cost and time.

Method: Developing PanSampler, which utilizes a diversity-aware SMT algorithm, an AST-guided scoring function, and a post-sampling optimization technique to achieve efficient sampling.

Result: PanSampler demonstrates superior capability in achieving high coverage with fewer solutions in experiments, reducing the required test cases by up to 76.4%, and improving fault detection effectiveness.

Conclusion: PanSampler advances SMT sampling by improving test efficiency, reducing fault detection costs, and offering high-coverage solutions with fewer samples.

Abstract: This work focuses on effectively generating diverse solutions for satisfiability modulo theories (SMT) formulas, targeting the theories of bit-vectors, arrays, and uninterpreted functions, which is a critical task in software and hardware testing. Generating diverse SMT solutions helps uncover faults and detect safety violations during the verification and testing process, resulting in the SMT sampling problem, i.e., constructing a small number of solutions while achieving comprehensive coverage of the constraint space. While high coverage is crucial for exploring system behaviors, reducing the number of solutions is of great importance, as excessive solutions increase testing time and resource usage, undermining efficiency. In this work, we introduce PanSampler, a novel SMT sampler that achieves high coverage with a small number of solutions. It incorporates three novel techniques, i.e., diversity-aware SMT algorithm, abstract syntax tree (AST)-guided scoring function and post-sampling optimization technology, enhancing its practical performance. It iteratively samples solutions, evaluates candidates, and employs local search to refine solutions, ensuring high coverage with a small number of samples. Extensive experiments on practical benchmarks demonstrate that PanSampler exhibits a significantly stronger capability to reach high target coverage, while requiring fewer solutions than current samplers to achieve the same coverage level. Furthermore, our empirical evaluation on practical subjects, which are collected from real-world software systems, shows that PanSampler achieves higher fault detection capability and reduces the number of required test cases from 32.6\% to 76.4\% to reach the same fault detection effectiveness, leading to a substantial improvement in testing efficiency. PanSampler advances SMT sampling, reducing the cost of software testing and hardware verification.

*Zag ElSayed,Grace Westerkamp,Jack Yanchen Liu,Ernest Pedapati*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: The study introduces an adaptive machine learning-based brain-computer interface (BCI) system aimed at modulating neural oscillations to enhance cognitive readiness in individuals with Fragile X Syndrome (FXS).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Individuals with neurodevelopmental disorders like FXS and ASD experience disrupted cortical oscillations, leading to challenges in attention and cognition. This research aims to leverage adaptive technologies to address these deficits.

Method: EEG data were obtained from 38 participants using a 128-channel system during auditory entrainment at different frequencies. Biomarkers were identified and used in a machine learning framework to adapt stimulation parameters in real-time.

Result: Key biomarkers such as Peak Alpha Power and Peak Gamma Power were identified. The 13Hz auditory stimulation increased Alpha activity and suppressed Gamma activity, demonstrating improved neuromodulation efficiency.

Conclusion: This study proposes an EEG-driven optimization framework for cognitive neuromodulation with an adaptive BCI system. It lays the groundwork for AI-integrated, personalized neurorehabilitation systems for FXS and related conditions.

Abstract: Neurodevelopmental disorders such as Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) and Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) are characterized by disrupted cortical oscillatory activity, particularly in the alpha and gamma frequency bands. These abnormalities are linked to deficits in attention, sensory processing, and cognitive function. In this work, we present an adaptive machine learning-based brain-computer interface (BCI) system designed to modulate neural oscillations through frequency-specific auditory stimulation to enhance cognitive readiness in individuals with FXS. EEG data were recorded from 38 participants using a 128-channel system under a stimulation paradigm consisting of a 30-second baseline (no stimulus) followed by 60-second auditory entrainment episodes at 7Hz, 9Hz, 11Hz, and 13Hz. A comprehensive analysis of power spectral features (Alpha, Gamma, Delta, Theta, Beta) and cross-frequency coupling metrics (Alpha-Gamma, Alpha-Beta, etc.) was conducted. The results identified Peak Alpha Power, Peak Gamma Power, and Alpha Power per second per channel as the most discriminative biomarkers. The 13Hz stimulation condition consistently elicited a significant increase in Alpha activity and suppression of Gamma activity, aligning with our optimization objective. A supervised machine learning framework was developed to predict EEG responses and dynamically adjust stimulation parameters, enabling real-time, subject-specific adaptation. This work establishes a novel EEG-driven optimization framework for cognitive neuromodulation, providing a foundational model for next-generation AI-integrated BCI systems aimed at personalized neurorehabilitation in FXS and related disorders.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in representing dynamic functional brain connectivity on non-Euclidean data, and improving early Alzheimer's diagnosis accuracy using limited data.

Method: The method involves encoding dynamic connectivity as topological images, using persistent graph homology for stable embeddings, and applying convolutional architectures with transfer learning.

Result: The approach achieved clinically meaningful accuracy in early Alzheimer's detection.

Conclusion: The framework provides a foundational approach for imaging and analyzing dynamic brain network topology, showcasing its applicability in medical diagnosis.

Abstract: Functional brain connectivity changes dynamically over time, making its representation challenging for learning on non-Euclidean data. We present a framework that encodes dynamic functional connectivity as an image representation of evolving network topology. Persistent graph homology summarizes global organization across scales, yielding Wasserstein distance-preserving embeddings stable under resolution changes. Stacking these embeddings forms a topological image that captures temporal reconfiguration of brain networks. This design enables convolutional architectures and transfer learning from pretrained foundational models to operate effectively under limited and imbalanced data. Applied to early Alzheimer's detection, the approach achieves clinically meaningful accuracy, establishing a principled foundation for imaging dynamic brain topology.

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: The paper discusses the importance of plasticity in expansion layers (like the cerebellum and mushroom body) for associative learning and its role in sensory input re-coding for behavior adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To uncover the emerging role of plasticity within expansion layers for representation learning and behavioral adaptation, contrasting this with classical models that focus only on output synaptic plasticity.

Method: Review of experimental data comparing two circuits: cerebellum granule layer and mushroom body calyx, analyzing neuron circuits, dendritic morphology, and plasticity mechanisms.

Result: Findings reveal strong similarities between the expansion coding mechanisms in vertebrates and invertebrates, highlighting general principles for representation learning.

Conclusion: Expansion layer plasticity is crucial for representation learning, but its complex interaction of associative and non-associative mechanisms requires further study to fully understand behavioral adaptation.

Abstract: Animals use past experiences to adapt future behavior. To enable this rapid learning, vertebrates and invertebrates have evolved analogous neural structures like the vertebrate cerebellum or insect mushroom body. A defining feature of these circuits is a large expansion layer, which re-codes sensory inputs to improve pattern separation, a prerequisite to learn non-overlapping associations between relevant sensorimotor inputs and adaptive changes in behavior. However, classical models of associative learning treat expansion layers as static, assuming that associations are learned through plasticity at the output synapses. Here, we review emerging evidence that also highlights the importance of plasticity within the expansion layer for associative learning. Because the underlying plasticity mechanisms and principles of this representation learning are only emerging, we systematically compare experimental data from two well-studied circuits for expansion coding -- the cerebellum granule layer and the mushroom body calyx. The data indicate remarkably similar interneuron circuits, dendritic morphology and plasticity mechanisms between both systems that hint at more general principles for representation learning. Moreover, the data show strong overlap with recent theoretical advances that consider interneuron circuits and dendritic computations for representation learning. However, they also hint at an interesting interaction of stimulus-induced, non-associative and reinforced, associative mechanisms of plasticity that is not well understood in current theories of representation learning. Therefore, studying expansion layer plasticity will be important to elucidate the mechanisms and full potential of representation learning for behavioral adaptation.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With Riemannian symmetric spaces (RSS) like hyperbolic spaces and SPD manifolds gaining traction in representation learning, Siegel spaces remain largely unexplored despite their potential.

Method: The authors develop multiclass logistic regression (MLR) and fully-connected (FC) layers for Siegel neural networks by leveraging the quotient structure of these spaces and vector-valued distances on RSS.

Result: They apply their method to radar clutter classification and node classification tasks, successfully achieving state-of-the-art performance on various datasets.

Conclusion: This study pioneers the use of Siegel spaces in neural networks, proving their effectiveness in certain classification applications and opening new avenues in machine learning research.

Abstract: Riemannian symmetric spaces (RSS) such as hyperbolic spaces and symmetric positive definite (SPD) manifolds have become popular spaces for representation learning. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for building discriminative neural networks on Siegel spaces, a family of RSS that is largely unexplored in machine learning tasks. For classification applications, one focus of recent works is the construction of multiclass logistic regression (MLR) and fully-connected (FC) layers for hyperbolic and SPD neural networks. Here we show how to build such layers for Siegel neural networks. Our approach relies on the quotient structure of those spaces and the notation of vector-valued distance on RSS. We demonstrate the relevance of our approach on two applications, i.e., radar clutter classification and node classification. Our results successfully demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across all datasets.

TL;DR: This paper proposes a generative modeling method for predicting underground mineral locations by infilling geospatial maps, achieving improved accuracy using auxiliary data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the high cost and difficulty of locating underground mineral deposits, which are critical for decarbonization technologies.

Method: The method involves a generative model that predicts mineral locations by masking and infilling geospatial data, incorporating auxiliary data sources such as geophysical data and soil surveys for better predictions.

Result: The model achieved Dice coefficients of 0.31±0.01 and recalls of 0.22±0.02 at high spatial resolution. Incorporating additional data sources improved performance and allowed predictions in data-scarce regions.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates potential for cost-effective and accurate mineral location prediction, particularly with the inclusion of auxiliary data sources.

Abstract: Minerals play a critical role in the advanced energy technologies necessary for decarbonization, but characterizing mineral deposits hidden underground remains costly and challenging. Inspired by recent progress in generative modeling, we develop a learning method which infers the locations of minerals by masking and infilling geospatial maps of resource availability. We demonstrate this technique using mineral data for the conterminous United States, and train performant models, with the best achieving Dice coefficients of $0.31 \pm 0.01$ and recalls of $0.22 \pm 0.02$ on test data at 1$\times$1 mi$^2$ spatial resolution. One major advantage of our approach is that it can easily incorporate auxiliary data sources for prediction which may be more abundant than mineral data. We highlight the capabilities of our model by adding input layers derived from geophysical sources, along with a nation-wide ground survey of soils originally intended for agronomic purposes. We find that employing such auxiliary features can improve inference performance, while also enabling model evaluation in regions with no recorded minerals.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of structural components in the Alpha-Procrustes framework, enabling it to incorporate generalized forms of metrics like GBW and Log-Euclidean for robust high-dimensional comparisons.

Method: The authors use unitized Hilbert-Schmidt operators and an extended Mahalanobis norm to generalize existing distances, including a learnable regularization parameter for improved stability in high-dimensional contexts.

Result: The generalized metrics demonstrated improved performance, especially in comparing datasets of varying dimensionality and scale, validated through reproducing benchmarks.

Conclusion: This work provides a theoretical and computational base for expanding the application of geometric methods in machine learning, statistical inference, and functional data analysis.

Abstract: This work extends the recently introduced Alpha-Procrustes family of Riemannian metrics for symmetric positive definite (SPD) matrices by incorporating generalized versions of the Bures-Wasserstein (GBW), Log-Euclidean, and Wasserstein distances. While the Alpha-Procrustes framework has unified many classical metrics in both finite- and infinite- dimensional settings, it previously lacked the structural components necessary to realize these generalized forms. We introduce a formalism based on unitized Hilbert-Schmidt operators and an extended Mahalanobis norm that allows the construction of robust, infinite-dimensional generalizations of GBW and Log-Hilbert-Schmidt distances. Our approach also incorporates a learnable regularization parameter that enhances geometric stability in high-dimensional comparisons. Preliminary experiments reproducing benchmarks from the literature demonstrate the improved performance of our generalized metrics, particularly in scenarios involving comparisons between datasets of varying dimension and scale. This work lays a theoretical and computational foundation for advancing robust geometric methods in machine learning, statistical inference, and functional data analysis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in mean-field variational inference by introducing and analyzing star-structured variational inference, which assumes interdependent posterior structures.

Method: Proved theoretical properties like existence, uniqueness, self-consistency, and error bounds for the star-structured variational approximation. Developed a gradient-based algorithm leveraging optimal transport theory.

Result: The paper extends prior results for structured variational inference, providing error bounds for star-structured settings and establishing new stability results for star-separable transport maps.

Conclusion: Star-structured variational inference is a robust framework for practical statistical applications and offers provable guarantees, especially for hierarchical Bayesian models and Gaussian measures.

Abstract: Structured variational inference constitutes a core methodology in modern statistical applications. Unlike mean-field variational inference, the approximate posterior is assumed to have interdependent structure. We consider the natural setting of star-structured variational inference, where a root variable impacts all the other ones. We prove the first results for existence, uniqueness, and self-consistency of the variational approximation. In turn, we derive quantitative approximation error bounds for the variational approximation to the posterior, extending prior work from the mean-field setting to the star-structured setting. We also develop a gradient-based algorithm with provable guarantees for computing the variational approximation using ideas from optimal transport theory. We explore the implications of our results for Gaussian measures and hierarchical Bayesian models, including generalized linear models with location family priors and spike-and-slab priors with one-dimensional debiasing. As a by-product of our analysis, we develop new stability results for star-separable transport maps which might be of independent interest.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Facilitate offline reinforcement learning in scenarios where direct environmental interaction is unsafe or impractical.

Method: Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman-based dynamic programming with infinitesimal generator representations in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces.

Result: Global convergence of the value function with finite-sample guarantees tied to system properties (e.g., smoothness, stability).

Conclusion: Operator-based methods show promise for solving offline reinforcement learning problems in continuous-time optimal control systems.

Abstract: Continuous-time stochastic processes underlie many natural and engineered systems. In healthcare, autonomous driving, and industrial control, direct interaction with the environment is often unsafe or impractical, motivating offline reinforcement learning from historical data. However, there is limited statistical understanding of the approximation errors inherent in learning policies from offline datasets. We address this by linking reinforcement learning to the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation and proposing an operator-theoretic algorithm based on a simple dynamic programming recursion. Specifically, we represent our world model in terms of the infinitesimal generator of controlled diffusion processes learned in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. By integrating statistical learning methods and operator theory, we establish global convergence of the value function and derive finite-sample guarantees with bounds tied to system properties such as smoothness and stability. Our theoretical and numerical results indicate that operator-based approaches may hold promise in solving offline reinforcement learning using continuous-time optimal control.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Continuum Dropout, a new regularization technique for Neural Differential Equations (NDEs), that enhances their generalization and uncertainty modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of overfitting in Neural Differential Equations (NDEs) due to the lack of dropout regularization techniques.

Method: The authors propose Continuum Dropout, a regularization method based on alternating renewal processes, which alternates between active and inactive states in continuous time to emulate dropout.

Result: Continuum Dropout achieves superior performance compared to existing methods in time series and image classification tasks and improves predictive uncertainty calibration.

Conclusion: Continuum Dropout effectively prevents overfitting in NDEs, enhances predictive performance, and provides well-calibrated uncertainty estimates.

Abstract: Neural Differential Equations (NDEs) excel at modeling continuous-time dynamics, effectively handling challenges such as irregular observations, missing values, and noise. Despite their advantages, NDEs face a fundamental challenge in adopting dropout, a cornerstone of deep learning regularization, making them susceptible to overfitting. To address this research gap, we introduce Continuum Dropout, a universally applicable regularization technique for NDEs built upon the theory of alternating renewal processes. Continuum Dropout formulates the on-off mechanism of dropout as a stochastic process that alternates between active (evolution) and inactive (paused) states in continuous time. This provides a principled approach to prevent overfitting and enhance the generalization capabilities of NDEs. Moreover, Continuum Dropout offers a structured framework to quantify predictive uncertainty via Monte Carlo sampling at test time. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that Continuum Dropout outperforms existing regularization methods for NDEs, achieving superior performance on various time series and image classification tasks. It also yields better-calibrated and more trustworthy probability estimates, highlighting its effectiveness for uncertainty-aware modeling.

*Borna Bateni,Yubai Yuan,Qi Xu,Annie Qu*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: The study introduces a novel framework to generate synthetic counterfactual treatment data at a target site using control data from the target site and full data from a source site, employing Optimal Transport for distribution alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address challenges in estimating treatment effects under cross-site heterogeneity by taking a distributional approach rather than focusing on average treatment effects.

Method: The method models treatment and control as probability measures and formalizes cross-site heterogeneity through a push-forward transformation using Optimal Transport, aligning control group distributions across sites and generating synthetic treatment data.

Result: Simulation studies and real-world applications show that the framework accurately recovers the full distributional treatment effects.

Conclusion: The framework provides a robust and theoretically sound approach to infer treatment effects across heterogeneous sites, offering potential improvements over conventional methods.

Abstract: We propose a novel framework for synthesizing counterfactual treatment group data in a target site by integrating full treatment and control group data from a source site with control group data from the target. Departing from conventional average treatment effect estimation, our approach adopts a distributional causal inference perspective by modeling treatment and control as distinct probability measures on the source and target sites. We formalize the cross-site heterogeneity (effect modification) as a push-forward transformation that maps the joint feature-outcome distribution from the source to the target site. This transformation is learned by aligning the control group distributions between sites using an Optimal Transport-based procedure, and subsequently applied to the source treatment group to generate the synthetic target treatment distribution. Under general regularity conditions, we establish theoretical guarantees for the consistency and asymptotic convergence of the synthetic treatment group data to the true target distribution. Simulation studies across multiple data-generating scenarios and a real-world application to patient-derived xenograft data demonstrate that our framework robustly recovers the full distributional properties of treatment effects.

### [389] [Masking criteria for selecting an imputation model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10048)
*Yanjiao Yang,Daniel Suen,Yen-Chi Chen*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: The paper critiques the widely-used masking-one-out (MOO) procedure for evaluating imputation models and introduces three modified criteria based on rank transformation, energy distance, and likelihood principle. It presents theoretical foundations, statistical properties, and a novel diagram for comparing imputation models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the limitations of the MOO procedure, which focuses on prediction accuracy and does not adequately evaluate the stochastic nature of imputation models.

Method: The study proposes three modified MOO criteria—rank transformation, energy distance, and likelihood principle—and builds theoretical frameworks to analyze their statistical and computational properties. Additionally, it establishes the consistency of Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) for model selection.

Result: The new criteria allow for the selection of imputation models that better account for the stochastic properties of the data. The likelihood approach creates a framework for learning imputation models and demonstrates statistical consistency. The prediction-imputation diagram provides a novel visualization tool for comparing models.

Conclusion: The authors establish that traditional MOO falls short in evaluating imputation models and propose alternative criteria and visualization tools that improve evaluation by incorporating both predictive and imputative properties.

Abstract: The masking-one-out (MOO) procedure, masking an observed entry and comparing it versus its imputed values, is a very common procedure for comparing imputation models. We study the optimum of this procedure and generalize it to a missing data assumption and establish the corresponding semi-parametric efficiency theory. However, MOO is a measure of prediction accuracy, which is not ideal for evaluating an imputation model. To address this issue, we introduce three modified MOO criteria, based on rank transformation, energy distance, and likelihood principle, that allow us to select an imputation model that properly account for the stochastic nature of data. The likelihood approach further enables an elegant framework of learning an imputation model from the data and we derive its statistical and computational learning theories as well as consistency of BIC model selection. We also show how MOO is related to the missing-at-random assumption. Finally, we introduce the prediction-imputation diagram, a two-dimensional diagram visually comparing both the prediction and imputation utilities for various imputation models.

### [390] [Multiple Treatments Causal Effects Estimation with Task Embeddings and Balanced Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09814)
*Yuki Murakami,Takumi Hattori,Kohsuke Kubota*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: The paper developed a novel deep learning framework to estimate single and interaction treatment effects more accurately by addressing shortcomings in existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve the accuracy of estimating single and interaction treatment effects in scenarios with multiple treatments, such as in healthcare and marketing. Existing methods face issues like lack of parameter sharing and reduced accuracy due to unnecessary latent variables.

Method: The authors propose a new framework combining a task embedding network for parameter sharing across treatment patterns and a representation learning network with a balancing penalty to reduce bias and enhance data representations.

Result: Simulation studies showed that this method outperforms existing approaches, and real-world marketing datasets confirmed its usefulness.

Conclusion: The framework improves the estimation of treatment effects by addressing selection bias and parameter-sharing challenges, with both theoretical and practical benefits.

Abstract: The simultaneous application of multiple treatments is increasingly common in many fields, such as healthcare and marketing. In such scenarios, it is important to estimate the single treatment effects and the interaction treatment effects that arise from treatment combinations. Previous studies have proposed using independent outcome networks with subnetworks for interactions, or combining task embedding networks that capture treatment similarity with variational autoencoders. However, these methods suffer from the lack of parameter sharing among related treatments, or the estimation of unnecessary latent variables reduces the accuracy of causal effect estimation. To address these issues, we propose a novel deep learning framework that incorporates a task embedding network and a representation learning network with the balancing penalty. The task embedding network enables parameter sharing across related treatment patterns because it encodes elements common to single effects and contributions specific to interaction effects. The representation learning network with the balancing penalty learns representations nonparametrically from observed covariates while reducing distances in representation distributions across different treatment patterns. This process mitigates selection bias and avoids model misspecification. Simulation studies demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing baselines, and application to real-world marketing datasets confirms the practical implications and utility of our framework.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to integrate and analyze large, complex, heterogeneous datasets from diagnostics, control systems, and simulations in fusion energy research.

Method: Development of the Data Fusion Labeler (dFL), a workflow tool for uncertainty-aware harmonization, schema-compliant fusion, and provenance-rich data labeling at scale.

Result: dFL reduced the analysis time by over 50X, improved label quality, and enabled cross-device comparability with case studies in automated ELM detection and regime classification.

Conclusion: dFL is a vital tool for improving data-driven discovery, model validation, and real-time control, making it applicable to future plasma devices.

Abstract: Fusion energy research increasingly depends on the ability to integrate heterogeneous, multimodal datasets from high-resolution diagnostics, control systems, and multiscale simulations. The sheer volume and complexity of these datasets demand the development of new tools capable of systematically harmonizing and extracting knowledge across diverse modalities. The Data Fusion Labeler (dFL) is introduced as a unified workflow instrument that performs uncertainty-aware data harmonization, schema-compliant data fusion, and provenance-rich manual and automated labeling at scale. By embedding alignment, normalization, and labeling within a reproducible, operator-order-aware framework, dFL reduces time-to-analysis by greater than 50X (e.g., enabling >200 shots/hour to be consistently labeled rather than a handful per day), enhances label (and subsequently training) quality, and enables cross-device comparability. Case studies from DIII-D demonstrate its application to automated ELM detection and confinement regime classification, illustrating its potential as a core component of data-driven discovery, model validation, and real-time control in future burning plasma devices.

TL;DR: The paper presents the General Intelligence-based Fragmentation (GIF) framework to guide large language models (LLMs) in simulating spectra for mass spectrometry analysis using structured reasoning and prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the low annotation rates in metabolomics and explore the potential of LLMs in advancing mass spectra annotation and simulation.

Method: The authors developed GIF, a framework leveraging structured prompts, tagging, iterative refinement, and reasoning to enhance LLMs' predictive accuracy in spectra simulation, fine-tuning, and benchmarking on a novel dataset.

Result: GIF-based models (GPT-4o and GPT-4o-mini) achieved better cosine similarity between simulated and true spectra, surpassing recent LLMs like GPT-5, ChemDFM, and deep learning baselines.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that GIF effectively uses LLMs for spectra simulation, enhances domain-specific scientific workflows, and enables human-in-the-loop and explainable reasoning processes.

Abstract: Despite growing reference libraries and advanced computational tools, progress in the field of metabolomics remains constrained by low rates of annotating measured spectra. The recent developments of large language models (LLMs) have led to strong performance across a wide range of generation and reasoning tasks, spurring increased interest in LLMs' application to domain-specific scientific challenges, such as mass spectra annotation. Here, we present a novel framework, General Intelligence-based Fragmentation (GIF), that guides pretrained LLMs through spectra simulation using structured prompting and reasoning. GIF utilizes tagging, structured inputs/outputs, system prompts, instruction-based prompts, and iterative refinement. Indeed, GIF offers a structured alternative to ad hoc prompting, underscoring the need for systematic guidance of LLMs on complex scientific tasks. Using GIF, we evaluate current generalist LLMs' ability to use reasoning towards fragmentation and to perform intensity prediction after fine-tuning. We benchmark performance on a novel QA dataset, the MassSpecGym QA-sim dataset, that we derive from the MassSpecGym dataset. Through these implementations of GIF, we find that GPT-4o and GPT-4o-mini achieve a cosine similarity of 0.36 and 0.35 between the simulated and true spectra, respectively, outperforming other pretrained models including GPT-5, Llama-3.1, and ChemDFM, despite GPT-5's recency and ChemDFM's domain specialization. GIF outperforms several deep learning baselines. Our evaluation of GIF highlights the value of using LLMs not only for spectra simulation but for enabling human-in-the-loop workflows and structured, explainable reasoning in molecular fragmentation.

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: The paper introduces Prostate-VarBench, a resource to improve variant classification for prostate cancer genomics. It offers better accuracy, consistency, and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Variants of Uncertain Significance (VUS) slow down diagnosis and treatment in prostate cancer due to incomplete evidence and inconsistent annotations. The paper aims to address this limitation.

Method: Prostate-VarBench integrates data from COSMIC, ClinVar, and TCGA-PRAD into a standardized dataset of 193,278 variants. It corrects annotation issues, standardizes features, incorporates AlphaMissense scores, and trains a TabNet model for interpretable pathogenicity classification.

Result: The TabNet model achieved 89.9% accuracy with balanced metrics, while VEP correction reduced VUS by 6.5%.

Conclusion: Prostate-VarBench provides a prostate-specific benchmark that facilitates better variant classification, reduces VUS uncertainty, and supports clinical decision-making.

Abstract: Variants of Uncertain Significance (VUS) limit the clinical utility of prostate cancer genomics by delaying diagnosis and therapy when evidence for pathogenicity or benignity is incomplete. Progress is further limited by inconsistent annotations across sources and the absence of a prostate-specific benchmark for fair comparison. We introduce Prostate-VarBench, a curated pipeline for creating prostate-specific benchmarks that integrates COSMIC (somatic cancer mutations), ClinVar (expert-curated clinical variants), and TCGA-PRAD (prostate tumor genomics from The Cancer Genome Atlas) into a harmonized dataset of 193,278 variants supporting patient- or gene-aware splits to prevent data leakage. To ensure data integrity, we corrected a Variant Effect Predictor (VEP) issue that merged multiple transcript records, introducing ambiguity in clinical significance fields. We then standardized 56 interpretable features across eight clinically relevant tiers, including population frequency, variant type, and clinical context. AlphaMissense pathogenicity scores were incorporated to enhance missense variant classification and reduce VUS uncertainty. Building on this resource, we trained an interpretable TabNet model to classify variant pathogenicity, whose step-wise sparse masks provide per-case rationales consistent with molecular tumor board review practices. On the held-out test set, the model achieved 89.9% accuracy with balanced class metrics, and the VEP correction yields an 6.5% absolute reduction in VUS.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Graph-based RAG systems enhance contextual reasoning and extraction from biomedical literature, but their computational inefficiency for large datasets limits usage.

Method: fastbmRAG organizes graph construction into two stages. First, it drafts graphs using abstracts, and then refines them using main texts with vector-based entity linking, reducing redundancy and computation.

Result: fastbmRAG is over 10 times faster than current graph-based RAG tools while delivering better coverage and accuracy in knowledge extraction.

Conclusion: FastbmRAG efficiently handles large-scale biomedical literature analysis, optimizing graph construction for speed and accuracy. It is publicly available for use.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are rapidly transforming various domains, including biomedicine and healthcare, and demonstrate remarkable potential from scientific research to new drug discovery. Graph-based retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems, as a useful application of LLMs, can improve contextual reasoning through structured entity and relationship identification from long-context knowledge, e.g. biomedical literature. Even though many advantages over naive RAGs, most of graph-based RAGs are computationally intensive, which limits their application to large-scale dataset. To address this issue, we introduce fastbmRAG, an fast graph-based RAG optimized for biomedical literature. Utilizing well organized structure of biomedical papers, fastbmRAG divides the construction of knowledge graph into two stages, first drafting graphs using abstracts; and second, refining them using main texts guided by vector-based entity linking, which minimizes redundancy and computational load. Our evaluations demonstrate that fastbmRAG is over 10x faster than existing graph-RAG tools and achieve superior coverage and accuracy to input knowledge. FastbmRAG provides a fast solution for quickly understanding, summarizing, and answering questions about biomedical literature on a large scale.

*Igor Rivin*

Main category: math.HO

TL;DR: The study conducted automated analysis of 37,000 mathematical papers from ArXiv, identifying errors spanning centuries and providing journal recommendations. Error rates varied by category, with Category Theory showing no errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to develop a system for automated detection of mathematical errors and assess the feasibility of automated peer review for large-scale analysis.

Method: A computational analysis system was applied to 37,000 papers across mathematical categories to detect errors and evaluate journal suitability.

Result: Numerical Analysis showed a 9.6% error rate; Geometric Topology showed 6.5%; and Category Theory showed 0%, with journal tier recommendations provided for papers.

Conclusion: The study highlights the prevalence of mathematical errors across eras, validates automated peer review at scale, and suggests application beyond mathematics into other scientific domains.

Abstract: We present the results of a large-scale computational analysis of mathematical papers from the ArXiv repository, demonstrating a comprehensive system that not only detects mathematical errors but provides complete referee reports with journal tier recommendations. Our automated analysis system processed over 37,000 papers across multiple mathematical categories, revealing significant error rates and quality distributions. Remarkably, the system identified errors in papers spanning three centuries of mathematics, including works by Leonhard Euler (1707-1783) and Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet (1805-1859), as well as contemporary Fields medalists.
  In Numerical Analysis (math.NA), we observed an error rate of 9.6\% (2,271 errors in 23,761 papers), while Geometric Topology (math.GT) showed 6.5\% (862 errors in 13,209 papers). Strikingly, Category Theory (math.CT) showed 0\% errors in 93 papers analyzed, with evidence suggesting these results are ``easier'' for automated analysis. Beyond error detection, the system evaluated papers for journal suitability, recommending 0.4\% for top generalist journals, 15.5\% for top field-specific journals, and categorizing the remainder across specialist venues. These findings demonstrate both the universality of mathematical error across all eras and the feasibility of automated comprehensive mathematical peer review at scale.
  This work demonstrates that the methodology, while applied here to mathematics, is discipline-agnostic and could be readily extended to physics, computer science, and other fields represented in the ArXiv repository.

TL;DR: This paper studies diffusion annealed Langevin dynamics, focusing on its rigorous construction and efficiency in generative models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate diffusion annealed Langevin dynamics as an alternative to classical Langevin diffusion in generative models.

Method: The authors analyze and prove the existence, uniqueness, and efficiency of annealed Langevin diffusion using Poincaré and logarithmic Sobolev inequalities.

Result: They establish a Poincaré inequality for conditional distributions and show that a stronger logarithmic Sobolev inequality enhances model efficiency.

Conclusion: Diffusion annealed Langevin dynamics is rigorously constructed, with efficiency improvements through strengthened inequalities offering theoretical advantages in generative models.

Abstract: In this work we study the diffusion annealed Langevin dynamics, a score-based diffusion process recently introduced in the theory of generative models and which is an alternative to the classical overdamped Langevin diffusion. Our goal is to provide a rigorous construction and to study the theoretical efficiency of these models for general base distribution as well as target distribution. As a matter of fact these diffusion processes are a particular case of Nelson processes i.e. diffusion processes with a given flow of time marginals.
  Providing existence and uniqueness of the solution to the annealed Langevin diffusion leads to proving a Poincaré inequality for the conditional distribution of $X$ knowing $X+Z=y$ uniformly in $y$, as recently observed by one of us and her coauthors. Part of this work is thus devoted to the study of such Poincaré inequalities. Additionally we show that strengthening the Poincaré inequality into a logarithmic Sobolev inequality improves the efficiency of the model.

Motivation: The study aims to address challenges in turbulent flow modeling by ensuring accurate Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) models with effective tensor-based, symmetry-driven closures.

Method: A learning approach using equivariant neural networks (ENNs) is proposed, enforcing algebraic contraction relations among tensor components based on the structure tensor framework.

Result: Experiments demonstrate ENNs' ability to effectively learn relationships involving high-order tensors, outperforming or matching classical models, particularly for predicting rapid pressure-strain correlations.

Conclusion: ENNs provide a consistent and effective alternative to traditional tensor basis models, aiding end-to-end learning and rapid testing of dependencies in turbulent flow modeling.

Abstract: Accurate and generalizable Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) models for turbulent flows rely on effective closures. We introduce tensor-based, symmetry aware closures using equivariant neural networks (ENNs) and present an algorithm for enforcing algebraic contraction relations among tensor components. The modeling approach builds on the structure tensor framework introduced by Kassinos and Reynolds to learn closures in the rapid distortion theory setting. Experiments show that ENNs can effectively learn relationships involving high-order tensors, meeting or exceeding the performance of existing models in tasks such as predicting the rapid pressure-strain correlation. Our results show that ENNs provide a physically consistent alternative to classical tensor basis models, enabling end-to-end learning of unclosed terms in RANS and fast exploration of model dependencies.

TL;DR: This paper presents a framework that integrates human domain knowledge into generative recommender models to improve accuracy and beyond-accuracy objectives like diversity and personalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current recommender systems prioritize accuracy but often neglect other objectives like diversity and personalization. Human domain knowledge is underutilized in generative recommendation models, despite its potential to enhance user satisfaction.

Method: The authors propose a framework using prior-conditioned adapter heads and hierarchical strategies to incorporate human priors into end-to-end generative recommender training. These methods guide models to interpret user intent in a structured, human-understandable manner.

Result: Experiments on three large-scale datasets show improvements in both accuracy and beyond-accuracy objectives. The approach also enables models to benefit more from longer context lengths and larger sizes.

Conclusion: Integrating human priors into generative recommendation models can significantly improve user satisfaction and model performance on diverse metrics, without requiring architecture-specific modifications.

Abstract: Optimizing recommender systems for objectives beyond accuracy, such as diversity, novelty, and personalization, is crucial for long-term user satisfaction. To this end, industrial practitioners have accumulated vast amounts of structured domain knowledge, which we term human priors (e.g., item taxonomies, temporal patterns). This knowledge is typically applied through post-hoc adjustments during ranking or post-ranking. However, this approach remains decoupled from the core model learning, which is particularly undesirable as the industry shifts to end-to-end generative recommendation foundation models. On the other hand, many methods targeting these beyond-accuracy objectives often require architecture-specific modifications and discard these valuable human priors by learning user intent in a fully unsupervised manner.
  Instead of discarding the human priors accumulated over years of practice, we introduce a backbone-agnostic framework that seamlessly integrates these human priors directly into the end-to-end training of generative recommenders. With lightweight, prior-conditioned adapter heads inspired by efficient LLM decoding strategies, our approach guides the model to disentangle user intent along human-understandable axes (e.g., interaction types, long- vs. short-term interests). We also introduce a hierarchical composition strategy for modeling complex interactions across different prior types. Extensive experiments on three large-scale datasets demonstrate that our method significantly enhances both accuracy and beyond-accuracy objectives. We also show that human priors allow the backbone model to more effectively leverage longer context lengths and larger model sizes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the accessibility challenges in Internet measurement research, where creating diagnostic workflows demands extensive expertise and manual effort.

Method: ArachNet employs four specialized agents to automate workflow creation, mimicking expert reasoning patterns in systematic problem-solving and solution implementation.

Result: ArachNet generates expert-like workflows independently, handles complex analysis integration, and reduces manual coordination typically required for measurement tasks.

Conclusion: ArachNet enables broader access to Internet measurement tools by automating expert reasoning processes, fostering efficiency and maintaining analytical rigor.

Abstract: Internet measurement research faces an accessibility crisis: complex analyses require custom integration of multiple specialized tools that demands specialized domain expertise. When network disruptions occur, operators need rapid diagnostic workflows spanning infrastructure mapping, routing analysis, and dependency modeling. However, developing these workflows requires specialized knowledge and significant manual effort.
  We present ArachNet, the first system demonstrating that LLM agents can independently generate measurement workflows that mimics expert reasoning. Our core insight is that measurement expertise follows predictable compositional patterns that can be systematically automated. ArachNet operates through four specialized agents that mirror expert workflow, from problem decomposition to solution implementation. We validate ArachNet with progressively challenging Internet resilience scenarios. The system independently generates workflows that match expert-level reasoning and produce analytical outputs similar to specialist solutions. Generated workflows handle complex multi-framework integration that traditionally requires days of manual coordination. ArachNet lowers barriers to measurement workflow composition by automating the systematic reasoning process that experts use, enabling broader access to sophisticated measurement capabilities while maintaining the technical rigor required for research-quality analysis.

Motivation: To address reliability challenges in MAS and explore whether LLM-based agents can outperform traditional ones in fault-prone environments.

Method: The paper studies LLM-based agents' capabilities in handling erroneous message flows and proposes CP-WBFT, a weighted Byzantine consensus mechanism leveraging LLMs’ reflective abilities.

Result: Experiments show CP-WBFT significantly improves MAS reliability under extreme Byzantine conditions, achieving remarkable accuracy and stability.

Conclusion: LLM-based agents offer enhanced reliability in MAS settings, with CP-WBFT demonstrating superior fault tolerance and accuracy in challenging environments.

Abstract: Ensuring the reliability of agent architectures and effectively identifying problematic agents when failures occur are crucial challenges in multi-agent systems (MAS). Advances in large language models (LLMs) have established LLM-based agents as a major branch of MAS, enabling major breakthroughs in complex problem solving and world modeling. However, the reliability implications of this shift remain largely unexplored. i.e., whether substituting traditional agents with LLM-based agents can effectively enhance the reliability of MAS. In this work, we investigate and quantify the reliability of LLM-based agents from the perspective of Byzantine fault tolerance. We observe that LLM-based agents demonstrate stronger skepticism when processing erroneous message flows, a characteristic that enables them to outperform traditional agents across different topological structures. Motivated by the results of the pilot experiment, we design CP-WBFT, a confidence probe-based weighted Byzantine Fault Tolerant consensus mechanism to enhance the stability of MAS with different topologies. It capitalizes on the intrinsic reflective and discriminative capabilities of LLMs by employing a probe-based, weighted information flow transmission method to improve the reliability of LLM-based agents. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CP-WBFT achieves superior performance across diverse network topologies under extreme Byzantine conditions (85.7\% fault rate). Notably, our approach surpasses traditional methods by attaining remarkable accuracy on various topologies and maintaining strong reliability in both mathematical reasoning and safety assessment tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address challenges in cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning, specifically task alignment and reward assignment issues during decentralized policy deployment.

Method: MAICC uses a centralized embedding model to capture trajectory representations and decentralized models to retrieve task-specific context. It includes a novel memory mechanism for test-time decision-making and employs a hybrid utility score for credit assignment.

Result: MAICC demonstrated faster adaptation to unseen tasks in cooperative MARL benchmarks such as Level-Based Foraging and SMAC.

Conclusion: MAICC enhances coordination in multi-agent systems by combining decentralized memory retrieval with effective credit assignment mechanisms, improving adaptability to new tasks.

Abstract: Large transformer models, trained on diverse datasets, have demonstrated impressive few-shot performance on previously unseen tasks without requiring parameter updates. This capability has also been explored in Reinforcement Learning (RL), where agents interact with the environment to retrieve context and maximize cumulative rewards, showcasing strong adaptability in complex settings. However, in cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL), where agents must coordinate toward a shared goal, decentralized policy deployment can lead to mismatches in task alignment and reward assignment, limiting the efficiency of policy adaptation. To address this challenge, we introduce Multi-agent In-context Coordination via Decentralized Memory Retrieval (MAICC), a novel approach designed to enhance coordination by fast adaptation. Our method involves training a centralized embedding model to capture fine-grained trajectory representations, followed by decentralized models that approximate the centralized one to obtain team-level task information. Based on the learned embeddings, relevant trajectories are retrieved as context, which, combined with the agents' current sub-trajectories, inform decision-making. During decentralized execution, we introduce a novel memory mechanism that effectively balances test-time online data with offline memory. Based on the constructed memory, we propose a hybrid utility score that incorporates both individual- and team-level returns, ensuring credit assignment across agents. Extensive experiments on cooperative MARL benchmarks, including Level-Based Foraging (LBF) and SMAC (v1/v2), show that MAICC enables faster adaptation to unseen tasks compared to existing methods.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: This paper studies how people's moral preferences change over time and its implications for AI alignment, particularly focusing on kidney allocation decisions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the issue of aligning AI systems to human morality, which is often treated as static, despite the fact that moral preferences can evolve over time.

Method: The study involved over 400 participants providing responses to hypothetical kidney transplant scenarios across multiple sessions and analyzing moral preference consistency and its impact on AI predictive models.

Result: Findings reveal significant response and model instability over time, leading to reduced AI predictive performance and challenges for maintaining alignment.

Conclusion: AI alignment should account for dynamic human moral preferences, rather than assuming static ones, to enhance trust and effectiveness in high-stakes domains like healthcare.

Abstract: Alignment methods in moral domains seek to elicit moral preferences of human stakeholders and incorporate them into AI. This presupposes moral preferences as static targets, but such preferences often evolve over time. Proper alignment of AI to dynamic human preferences should ideally account for "legitimate" changes to moral reasoning, while ignoring changes related to attention deficits, cognitive biases, or other arbitrary factors. However, common AI alignment approaches largely neglect temporal changes in preferences, posing serious challenges to proper alignment, especially in high-stakes applications of AI, e.g., in healthcare domains, where misalignment can jeopardize the trustworthiness of the system and yield serious individual and societal harms. This work investigates the extent to which people's moral preferences change over time, and the impact of such changes on AI alignment. Our study is grounded in the kidney allocation domain, where we elicit responses to pairwise comparisons of hypothetical kidney transplant patients from over 400 participants across 3-5 sessions. We find that, on average, participants change their response to the same scenario presented at different times around 6-20% of the time (exhibiting "response instability"). Additionally, we observe significant shifts in several participants' retrofitted decision-making models over time (capturing "model instability"). The predictive performance of simple AI models decreases as a function of both response and model instability. Moreover, predictive performance diminishes over time, highlighting the importance of accounting for temporal changes in preferences during training. These findings raise fundamental normative and technical challenges relevant to AI alignment, highlighting the need to better understand the object of alignment (what to align to) when user preferences change significantly over time.

Result: PAD significantly reduced hand motion compared to trackpad use while maintaining task completion times, especially when prediction accuracies were high.

Conclusion: AI-assisted input systems like PAD can effectively minimize fine-motor strain while maintaining user efficiency, showcasing potential in ergonomic design innovation.

Abstract: Repetitive strain injury (RSI) affects roughly one in five computer users and remains largely unresolved despite decades of ergonomic mouse redesign. All such devices share a fundamental limitation: they still require fine-motor motion to operate. This work investigates whether predictive, AI-assisted input can reduce that motion by replacing physical pointing with ranked on-screen suggestions. To preserve user agency, we introduce Preview Accept Discard (PAD), a zero-click interaction paradigm that lets users preview predicted GUI targets, cycle through a small set of ranked alternatives, and accept or discard them via key-release timing. We evaluate PAD in two settings: a browser-based email client and a ISO 9241-9 keyboard-prediction task under varying top-3 accuracies. Across both studies, PAD substantially reduces hand motion relative to trackpad use while maintaining comparable task times with the trackpad only when accuracies are similar to those of the best spell-checkers.

### [405] [Bridging Constraints and Stochasticity: A Fully First-Order Method for Stochastic Bilevel Optimization with Linear Constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09845)
*Cac Phan*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: This paper achieves finite-time convergence for linearly constrained stochastic bilevel optimization without relying on second-order methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the theoretical challenge of combining linear constraints, stochastic noise, and finite-time analysis in bilevel optimization.

Method: Introduces a framework using hypergradient approximations via smoothed penalty functions and solving primal/dual approximations to handle linear constraints under stochastic conditions.

Result: The paper demonstrates explicit finite-time bounds on hypergradient estimator error and establishes complexity results with convergence to $δ, ε$-Goldstein stationary points.

Conclusion: This work successfully establishes finite-time guarantees using gradient-based techniques for a previously intractable problem class in constrained stochastic bilevel optimization.

Abstract: This work provides the first finite-time convergence guarantees for linearly constrained stochastic bilevel optimization using only first-order methods, requiring solely gradient information without any Hessian computations or second-order derivatives. We address the unprecedented challenge of simultaneously handling linear constraints, stochastic noise, and finite-time analysis in bilevel optimization, a combination that has remained theoretically intractable until now. While existing approaches either require second-order information, handle only unconstrained stochastic problems, or provide merely asymptotic convergence results, our method achieves finite-time guarantees using gradient-based techniques alone. We develop a novel framework that constructs hypergradient approximations via smoothed penalty functions, using approximate primal and dual solutions to overcome the fundamental challenges posed by the interaction between linear constraints and stochastic noise. Our theoretical analysis provides explicit finite-time bounds on the bias and variance of the hypergradient estimator, demonstrating how approximation errors interact with stochastic perturbations. We prove that our first-order algorithm converges to $(δ, ε)$-Goldstein stationary points using $Θ(δ^{-1}ε^{-5})$ stochastic gradient evaluations, establishing the first finite-time complexity result for this challenging problem class and representing a significant theoretical breakthrough in constrained stochastic bilevel optimization.

*Minrui Luo,Weihang Xu,Xiang Gao,Maryam Fazel,Simon Shaolei Du*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: The paper establishes a global convergence guarantee for four-layer matrix factorization using randomly initialized gradient descent.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to bridge the gap in global convergence guarantees for deep matrix factorization under random initialization, particularly for more than two layers.

Method: It uses new analytical techniques to demonstrate the avoidance of saddle points in gradient descent dynamics and studies changes in eigenvalues of layer weights.

Result: A polynomial-time global convergence guarantee for four-layer matrix factorization is demonstrated under specified conditions and with a balanced regularization term.

Conclusion: The results contribute to the theoretical understanding of deep matrix factorization, extending previous two-layer results to deeper architectures.

Abstract: Gradient descent dynamics on the deep matrix factorization problem is extensively studied as a simplified theoretical model for deep neural networks. Although the convergence theory for two-layer matrix factorization is well-established, no global convergence guarantee for general deep matrix factorization under random initialization has been established to date. To address this gap, we provide a polynomial-time global convergence guarantee for randomly initialized gradient descent on four-layer matrix factorization, given certain conditions on the target matrix and a standard balanced regularization term. Our analysis employs new techniques to show saddle-avoidance properties of gradient decent dynamics, and extends previous theories to characterize the change in eigenvalues of layer weights.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges in distributed optimization with non-smooth objectives while ensuring efficiency and decentralization.

Method: Introduced the dHPR method leveraging symmetric Gauss-Seidel decomposition to decouple linear operators and avoid large proximal terms, ensuring parallelizability.

Result: Demonstrates superior performance of dHPR through numerical experiments on distributed LASSO, group LASSO, and regularized logistic regression problems.

Conclusion: The dHPR method provides an efficient and decentralized algorithm for distributed optimization tasks with provably fast convergence.

Abstract: This paper introduces the distributed Halpern Peaceman--Rachford (dHPR) method, an efficient algorithm for solving distributed convex composite optimization problems with non-smooth objectives, which achieves a non-ergodic $O(1/k)$ iteration complexity regarding Karush--Kuhn--Tucker residual. By leveraging the symmetric Gauss--Seidel decomposition, the dHPR effectively decouples the linear operators in the objective functions and consensus constraints while maintaining parallelizability and avoiding additional large proximal terms, leading to a decentralized implementation with provably fast convergence. The superior performance of dHPR is demonstrated through comprehensive numerical experiments on distributed LASSO, group LASSO, and $L_1$-regularized logistic regression problems.

### [408] [Global Solutions to Non-Convex Functional Constrained Problems with Hidden Convexity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10626)
*Ilyas Fatkhullin,Niao He,Guanghui Lan,Florian Wolf*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: The paper tackles constrained non-convex optimization problems by leveraging hidden convexity and introduces algorithms achieving global minima with computational complexities comparable to unconstrained convex optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation lies in addressing constrained non-convex optimization challenges prevalent in applications like control and reinforcement learning, where hidden convexity exists but transformations to convex programs are implicit or unknown.

Method: The authors modified the inexact proximal point method for non-smooth settings, providing a convergence rate of \(\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\varepsilon^{-3})\). For smooth problems, they developed a bundle-level method with linearly constrained quadratic subproblems, achieving a complexity of \(\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\varepsilon^{-1})\).

Result: The proposed methods solve constrained non-convex problems to their global minima without requiring constraint qualifications and handle hidden convex equality constraints, matching complexities of unconstrained hidden convex optimization.

Conclusion: The work presents efficient and globally convergent algorithms for constrained non-convex optimization, demonstrating their significant theoretical advancements and practical relevance in hidden convexity scenarios.

Abstract: Constrained non-convex optimization is fundamentally challenging, as global solutions are generally intractable and constraint qualifications may not hold. However, in many applications, including safe policy optimization in control and reinforcement learning, such problems possess hidden convexity, meaning they can be reformulated as convex programs via a nonlinear invertible transformation. Typically such transformations are implicit or unknown, making the direct link with the convex program impossible. On the other hand, (sub-)gradients with respect to the original variables are often accessible or can be easily estimated, which motivates algorithms that operate directly in the original (non-convex) problem space using standard (sub-)gradient oracles. In this work, we develop the first algorithms to provably solve such non-convex problems to global minima. First, using a modified inexact proximal point method, we establish global last-iterate convergence guarantees with $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\varepsilon^{-3})$ oracle complexity in non-smooth setting. For smooth problems, we propose a new bundle-level type method based on linearly constrained quadratic subproblems, improving the oracle complexity to $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\varepsilon^{-1})$. Surprisingly, despite non-convexity, our methodology does not require any constraint qualifications, can handle hidden convex equality constraints, and achieves complexities matching those for solving unconstrained hidden convex optimization.

### [409] [Simulating Misinformation Propagation in Social Networks using Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10384)
*Raj Gaurav Maurya,Vaibhav Shukla,Raj Abhijit Dandekar,Rajat Dandekar,Sreedath Panat*

Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: The paper explores how misinformation spreads on social media using synthetic agents modeled on biases and ideologies, introducing a framework to measure and track informational drift through networks of rewrites.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and analyze how misinformation evolves and escalates within social media ecosystems and to simulate human-like biases in misinformation spread.

Method: The authors model large language models (LLMs) as user-like agents with specific personas and simulate the propagation of misinformation through sequential rewrites. They use an auditing system to measure factual fidelity, propose indices to quantify misinformation spread, and conduct controlled experiments with persona-based simulations.

Result: The study finds that certain personas, particularly those driven by identity or ideology, amplify misinformation, while expert-driven personas maintain factual accuracy. Heterogeneous interactions further accelerate the transition to severe misinformation like propaganda.

Conclusion: This framework highlights the role of LLMs in both replicating human cognitive biases and mitigating misinformation. The findings contribute to understanding and potentially mitigating the dynamics of misinformation propagation.

Abstract: Misinformation on social media thrives on surprise, emotion, and identity-driven reasoning, often amplified through human cognitive biases. To investigate these mechanisms, we model large language model (LLM) personas as synthetic agents that mimic user-level biases, ideological alignments, and trust heuristics. Within this setup, we introduce an auditor--node framework to simulate and analyze how misinformation evolves as it circulates through networks of such agents. News articles are propagated across networks of persona-conditioned LLM nodes, each rewriting received content. A question--answering-based auditor then measures factual fidelity at every step, offering interpretable, claim-level tracking of misinformation drift. We formalize a misinformation index and a misinformation propagation rate to quantify factual degradation across homogeneous and heterogeneous branches of up to 30 sequential rewrites. Experiments with 21 personas across 10 domains reveal that identity- and ideology-based personas act as misinformation accelerators, especially in politics, marketing, and technology. By contrast, expert-driven personas preserve factual stability. Controlled-random branch simulations further show that once early distortions emerge, heterogeneous persona interactions rapidly escalate misinformation to propaganda-level distortion. Our taxonomy of misinformation severity -- spanning factual errors, lies, and propaganda -- connects observed drift to established theories in misinformation studies. These findings demonstrate the dual role of LLMs as both proxies for human-like biases and as auditors capable of tracing information fidelity. The proposed framework provides an interpretable, empirically grounded approach for studying, simulating, and mitigating misinformation diffusion in digital ecosystems.

### [410] [Two Americas of Well-Being: Divergent Rural-Urban Patterns of Life Satisfaction and Happiness from 2.6 B Social Media Posts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10542)
*Stefano Maria Iacus,Giuseppe Porro*

Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: Using 2.6 billion geolocated social-media posts, the study constructs U.S. county-level life satisfaction and happiness indicators, uncovering a rural-urban divide where rural areas express more life satisfaction, while urban areas show higher happiness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address conflicting findings on rural and urban well-being by using large-scale social-media data and advanced language models to separate evaluative and hedonic well-being measures.

Method: Leveraged 2.6 billion geolocated social-media posts (2014-2022) and a fine-tuned generative language model to create indicators of life satisfaction and happiness across U.S. counties.

Result: The rural-urban paradox emerges: rural counties report higher life satisfaction, urban counties demonstrate greater happiness. Distinction between evaluative (life satisfaction) and hedonic (happiness) well-being clarifies divergent patterns across regions, politics, and time.

Conclusion: Language-based large-scale indicators can disambiguate rural-urban well-being conflicts, distinguishing types of well-being and providing a reproducible supplement to traditional surveys.

Abstract: Using 2.6 billion geolocated social-media posts (2014-2022) and a fine-tuned generative language model, we construct county-level indicators of life satisfaction and happiness for the United States. We document an apparent rural-urban paradox: rural counties express higher life satisfaction while urban counties exhibit greater happiness. We reconcile this by treating the two as distinct layers of subjective well-being, evaluative vs. hedonic, showing that each maps differently onto place, politics, and time. Republican-leaning areas appear more satisfied in evaluative terms, but partisan gaps in happiness largely flatten outside major metros, indicating context-dependent political effects. Temporal shocks dominate the hedonic layer: happiness falls sharply during 2020-2022, whereas life satisfaction moves more modestly. These patterns are robust across logistic and OLS specifications and align with well-being theory. Interpreted as associations for the population of social-media posts, the results show that large-scale, language-based indicators can resolve conflicting findings about the rural-urban divide by distinguishing the type of well-being expressed, offering a transparent, reproducible complement to traditional surveys.

TL;DR: The paper evaluates strategies for navigating Wikipedia in the WikiRace game, finding semantic-based approaches using language models highly effective.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and optimize strategies for goal-directed search in complex information networks like Wikipedia.

Method: Compared navigation agents using graph-theoretic, semantic, and hybrid strategies on a large Wikipedia subgraph in the WikiRace game.

Result: A greedy semantic-guided approach achieved perfect success with significantly better efficiency than structural or hybrid methods.

Conclusion: Semantic-based strategies, powered by language models, outperform structural heuristics for navigation in complex networks.

Abstract: The WikiRace game, where players navigate between Wikipedia articles using only hyperlinks, serves as a compelling benchmark for goal-directed search in complex information networks. This paper presents a systematic evaluation of navigation strategies for this task, comparing agents guided by graph-theoretic structure (betweenness centrality), semantic meaning (language model embeddings), and hybrid approaches. Through rigorous benchmarking on a large Wikipedia subgraph, we demonstrate that a purely greedy agent guided by the semantic similarity of article titles is overwhelmingly effective. This strategy, when combined with a simple loop-avoidance mechanism, achieved a perfect success rate and navigated the network with an efficiency an order of magnitude better than structural or hybrid methods. Our findings highlight the critical limitations of purely structural heuristics for goal-directed search and underscore the transformative potential of large language models to act as powerful, zero-shot semantic navigators in complex information spaces.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 3D medical image classification faces challenges due to complex spatial relationships and lack of large-scale multimodal datasets. TomoGraphView proposes omnidirectional slicing and spherical graph-based aggregation to enhance analysis effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rising demand for medical tomography examinations and the necessity for automated tools to support physicians require improved methods to classify and analyze complex 3D volumetric data.

Method: TomoGraphView uses omnidirectional volume slicing combined with spherical graph-based feature aggregation to address limitations in capturing spatial coherence and 3D structures in medical images.

Result: The proposed framework enhances feature extraction and spatial coherence in 3D medical image analysis. It is accompanied by publicly available code and a user-friendly slicing library.

Conclusion: The use of omnidirectional slicing and spherical graph-based aggregation demonstrates improved 3D medical image classification, addressing shortcomings of traditional 2D slice-based methods.

Abstract: The growing number of medical tomography examinations has necessitated the development of automated methods capable of extracting comprehensive imaging features to facilitate downstream tasks such as tumor characterization, while assisting physicians in managing their growing workload. However, 3D medical image classification remains a challenging task due to the complex spatial relationships and long-range dependencies inherent in volumetric data. Training models from scratch suffers from low data regimes, and the absence of 3D large-scale multimodal datasets has limited the development of 3D medical imaging foundation models. Recent studies, however, have highlighted the potential of 2D vision foundation models, originally trained on natural images, as powerful feature extractors for medical image analysis. Despite these advances, existing approaches that apply 2D models to 3D volumes via slice-based decomposition remain suboptimal. Conventional volume slicing strategies, which rely on canonical planes such as axial, sagittal, or coronal, may inadequately capture the spatial extent of target structures when these are misaligned with standardized viewing planes. Furthermore, existing slice-wise aggregation strategies rarely account for preserving the volumetric structure, resulting in a loss of spatial coherence across slices. To overcome these limitations, we propose TomoGraphView, a novel framework that integrates omnidirectional volume slicing with spherical graph-based feature aggregation. We publicly share our accessible code base at http://github.com/compai-lab/2025-MedIA-kiechle and provide a user-friendly library for omnidirectional volume slicing at https://pypi.org/project/OmniSlicer.

*Huanhuan Zhao,Connor Vernachio,Laxmi Bhurtel,Wooin Yang,Ruben Millan-Solsona,Spenser R. Brown,Marti Checa,Komal Sharma Agrawal,Adam M. Guss,Liam Collins,Wonhee Ko,Arpan Biswas*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper presents a global denoising model (GDM) to enhance microscopy images by removing artifacts while preserving physically important weaker features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Microscopy techniques face difficulties in achieving high-quality imaging due to time-consuming controls and artifact-induced errors, which hinder accurate extraction and analysis of material properties.

Method: The proposed GDM uses a two-channel imaging approach with goal-specific pre-processing and integrates pixel-based and FFT-based loss functions in training a U-net model.

Result: Comparative analysis showed the GDM outperformed non-FFT denoising models for STM, AFM, and SEM-generated images of various materials and structures.

Conclusion: This innovative GDM provides flexibility for experimentalists to improve microscopy image quality and supports domain-specific adjustments, ensuring preservation of critical physical details in imaging.

Abstract: Microscopy such as Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM), Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) are essential tools in material imaging at micro- and nanoscale resolutions to extract physical knowledge and materials structure-property relationships. However, tuning microscopy controls (e.g. scanning speed, current setpoint, tip bias etc.) to obtain a high-quality of images is a non-trivial and time-consuming effort. On the other hand, with sub-standard images, the key features are not accurately discovered due to noise and artifacts, leading to erroneous analysis. Existing denoising models mostly build on generalizing the weak signals as noises while the strong signals are enhanced as key features, which is not always the case in microscopy images, thus can completely erase a significant amount of hidden physical information. To address these limitations, we propose a global denoising model (GDM) to smartly remove artifacts of microscopy images while preserving weaker but physically important features. The proposed model is developed based on 1) first designing a two-imaging input channel of non-pair and goal specific pre-processed images with user-defined trade-off information between two channels and 2) then integrating a loss function of pixel- and fast Fourier-transformed (FFT) based on training the U-net model. We compared the proposed GDM with the non-FFT denoising model over STM-generated images of Copper(Cu) and Silicon(Si) materials, AFM-generated Pantoea sp.YR343 bio-film images and SEM-generated plastic degradation images. We believe this proposed workflow can be extended to improve other microscopy image quality and will benefit the experimentalists with the proposed design flexibility to smartly tune via domain-experts preferences.

*Cumi Oyemike,Elizabeth Akpan,Pierre Hervé-Berdys*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: The paper introduces the concept of alignment debt, the user burden arising from AI misalignment with cultural, linguistic, infrastructural, or epistemic contexts, particularly in the Global South. It measures this through a four-part taxonomy surveyed among 411 users in Kenya and Nigeria.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges posed by frontier LLMs when applied in the Global South and unveil the user-side burdens arising from systemic misalignments in AI systems.

Method: The study develops a four-part taxonomy of alignment debt and validates it through a survey conducted among 411 AI users in Kenya and Nigeria.

Result: Cultural and Linguistic debt prevalence was found at 51.9%; Infrastructural at 43.1%; Epistemic at 33.8%; and Interaction at 14.0%. There are notable variations between countries where infrastructural and interaction debts differ significantly. Verification rates and debt burden correlations highlight the extent of user compensatory labor.

Conclusion: The study emphasizes the need for fairness evaluations to consider user burdens alongside model metrics. Context-aware safeguards are crucial for addressing alignment debts and promoting inclusive AI governance in the Global South.

Abstract: Frontier LLMs are optimised around high-resource assumptions about language, knowledge, devices, and connectivity. Whilst widely accessible, they often misfit conditions in the Global South. As a result, users must often perform additional work to make these systems usable. We term this alignment debt: the user-side burden that arises when AI systems fail to align with cultural, linguistic, infrastructural, or epistemic contexts. We develop and validate a four-part taxonomy of alignment debt through a survey of 411 AI users in Kenya and Nigeria. Among respondents measurable on this taxonomy (n = 385), prevalence is: Cultural and Linguistic (51.9%), Infrastructural (43.1%), Epistemic (33.8%), and Interaction (14.0%). Country comparisons show a divergence in Infrastructural and Interaction debt, challenging one-size-fits-Africa assumptions. Alignment debt is associated with compensatory labour, but responses vary by debt type: users facing Epistemic challenges verify outputs at significantly higher rates (91.5% vs. 80.8%; p = 0.037), and verification intensity correlates with cumulative debt burden (Spearmans rho = 0.147, p = 0.004). In contrast, Infrastructural and Interaction debts show weak or null associations with verification, indicating that some forms of misalignment cannot be resolved through verification alone. These findings show that fairness must be judged not only by model metrics but also by the burden imposed on users at the margins, compelling context-aware safeguards that alleviate alignment debt in Global South settings. The alignment debt framework provides an empirically grounded way to measure user burden, informing both design practice and emerging African AI governance efforts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To aid self-regulated learning in competitive programming by utilizing AI for generating reflective and context-aware prompts.

Method: Implemented Owlgorithm, which integrates GPT-4o to generate reflective prompts based on student submissions in a competitive programming course.

Result: Generated prompts facilitated reflection and debugging, though issues with feedback accuracy and classroom usability were identified.

Conclusion: GenAI, like Owlgorithm, holds potential for enhancing reflection in learning, but further refinements in usability and prompt accuracy are crucial for broader adoption and effectiveness.

Abstract: We present Owlgorithm, an educational platform that supports Self-Regulated Learning (SRL) in competitive programming (CP) through AI-generated reflective questions. Leveraging GPT-4o, Owlgorithm produces context-aware, metacognitive prompts tailored to individual student submissions. Integrated into a second- and third-year CP course, the system-provided reflective prompts adapted to student outcomes: guiding deeper conceptual insight for correct solutions and structured debugging for partial or failed ones.
  Our exploratory assessment of student ratings and TA feedback revealed both promising benefits and notable limitations. While many found the generated questions useful for reflection and debugging, concerns were raised about feedback accuracy and classroom usability. These results suggest advantages of LLM-supported reflection for novice programmers, though refinements are needed to ensure reliability and pedagogical value for advanced learners.
  From our experience, several key insights emerged: GenAI can effectively support structured reflection, but careful prompt design, dynamic adaptation, and usability improvements are critical to realizing their potential in education. We offer specific recommendations for educators using similar tools and outline next steps to enhance Owlgorithm's educational impact. The underlying framework may also generalize to other reflective learning contexts.

*Yuxin Gou,Aming Wu,Richang Hong,Meng Wang*

Main category: physics.chem-ph

TL;DR: The study proposes MPSU-Mamba, a Mamba-driven framework for molecular ground-state conformation prediction, achieving superior results on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve molecular ground-state conformation prediction by leveraging advanced state space models like Mamba, which remain underexplored in this context.

Method: The MPSU-Mamba framework analyzes molecular structure through three elements: atom types, positions, and connections using a multi-perspective structural approach with scanning strategies and defined mechanisms.

Result: The proposed MPSU-Mamba framework outperformed existing methods on the QM9 and Molecule3D datasets, excelling even with limited training samples.

Conclusion: MPSU-Mamba demonstrates its efficacy and potential in comprehensively understanding molecular structures, offering superior performance and robustness.

Abstract: A comprehensive understanding of molecular structures is important for the prediction of molecular ground-state conformation involving property information. Meanwhile, state space model (e.g., Mamba) has recently emerged as a promising mechanism for long sequence modeling and has achieved remarkable results in various language and vision tasks. However, towards molecular ground-state conformation prediction, exploiting Mamba to understand molecular structure is underexplored. To this end, we strive to design a generic and efficient framework with Mamba to capture critical components. In general, molecular structure could be considered to consist of three elements, i.e., atom types, atom positions, and connections between atoms. Thus, considering the three elements, an approach of Mamba-driven multi-perspective structural understanding (MPSU-Mamba) is proposed to localize molecular ground-state conformation. Particularly, for complex and diverse molecules, three different kinds of dedicated scanning strategies are explored to construct a comprehensive perception of corresponding molecular structures. And a bright-channel guided mechanism is defined to discriminate the critical conformation-related atom information. Experimental results on QM9 and Molecule3D datasets indicate that MPSU-Mamba significantly outperforms existing methods. Furthermore, we observe that for the case of few training samples, MPSU-Mamba still achieves superior performance, demonstrating that our method is indeed beneficial for understanding molecular structures.

Main category: physics.chem-ph

TL;DR: The paper introduces VEDA, a framework addressing efficiency and accuracy issues in 3D molecular generation using diffusion models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve the generation of conformationally accurate 3D molecular structures by addressing inefficiencies and inaccuracies in existing diffusion and flow-based models.

Method: VEDA combines variance-exploding diffusion with annealing and SE(3)-equivariant architectures using novel scheduling and preconditioning schemes.

Result: VEDA achieves chemical accuracy with 100 sampling steps, high stability in generated structures, and significant reduction in relaxation energy on QM9 and GEOM-DRUGS datasets.

Conclusion: VEDA successfully integrates VE diffusion and SE(3)-equivariant architectures to balance sampling efficiency and conformational accuracy in 3D molecular generation.

Abstract: Diffusion models show promise for 3D molecular generation, but face a fundamental trade-off between sampling efficiency and conformational accuracy. While flow-based models are fast, they often produce geometrically inaccurate structures, as they have difficulty capturing the multimodal distributions of molecular conformations. In contrast, denoising diffusion models are more accurate but suffer from slow sampling, a limitation attributed to sub-optimal integration between diffusion dynamics and SE(3)-equivariant architectures. To address this, we propose VEDA, a unified SE(3)-equivariant framework that combines variance-exploding diffusion with annealing to efficiently generate conformationally accurate 3D molecular structures. Specifically, our key technical contributions include: (1) a VE schedule that enables noise injection functionally analogous to simulated annealing, improving 3D accuracy and reducing relaxation energy; (2) a novel preconditioning scheme that reconciles the coordinate-predicting nature of SE(3)-equivariant networks with a residual-based diffusion objective, and (3) a new arcsin-based scheduler that concentrates sampling in critical intervals of the logarithmic signal-to-noise ratio. On the QM9 and GEOM-DRUGS datasets, VEDA matches the sampling efficiency of flow-based models, achieving state-of-the-art valency stability and validity with only 100 sampling steps. More importantly, VEDA's generated structures are remarkably stable, as measured by their relaxation energy during GFN2-xTB optimization. The median energy change is only 1.72 kcal/mol, significantly lower than the 32.3 kcal/mol from its architectural baseline, SemlaFlow.

Main category: physics.chem-ph

TL;DR: The paper introduces Solvaformer, a geometry-aware graph transformer for predicting small molecule solubility and solvation free energy, combining accurate performance with interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Predicting small molecule solubility is important for synthesis and process optimization, but current approaches rely on costly quantum-derived descriptors or lack interpretability.

Method: Solvaformer combines intramolecular SE(3)-equivariant attention with intermolecular scalar attention, modeling solution systems as multiple molecules with independent SE(3) symmetries. It employs multi-task training on quantum-mechanical and experimental data.

Result: Solvaformer achieves state-of-the-art performance among learned models and approaches the results of DFT-assisted methods, outperforming baselines and providing chemically interpretable attributions.

Conclusion: Solvaformer is a scalable, accurate, and interpretable method for predicting solution-phase properties, leveraging its geometric inductive bias and mixed dataset training strategy.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of small molecule solubility using material-sparing approaches is critical for accelerating synthesis and process optimization, yet experimental measurement is costly and many learning approaches either depend on quantumderived descriptors or offer limited interpretability. We introduce Solvaformer, a geometry-aware graph transformer that models solutions as multiple molecules with independent SE(3) symmetries. The architecture combines intramolecular SE(3)-equivariant attention with intermolecular scalar attention, enabling cross-molecular communication without imposing spurious relative geometry. We train Solvaformer in a multi-task setting to predict both solubility (log S) and solvation free energy, using an alternating-batch regimen that trains on quantum-mechanical data (CombiSolv-QM) and on experimental measurements (BigSolDB 2.0). Solvaformer attains the strongest overall performance among the learned models and approaches a DFT-assisted gradient-boosting baseline, while outperforming an EquiformerV2 ablation and sequence-based alternatives. In addition, token-level attention produces chemically coherent attributions: case studies recover known intra- vs. inter-molecular hydrogen-bonding patterns that govern solubility differences in positional isomers. Taken together, Solvaformer provides an accurate, scalable, and interpretable approach to solution-phase property prediction by uniting geometric inductive bias with a mixed dataset training strategy on complementary computational and experimental data.

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: The paper explores employing autoencoders (AE) to replace conventional parameters in analyzing cosmic ray data from TAIGA detectors, achieving accurate primary particle energy reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the analysis of extensive air showers (EAS) by overcoming limitations of empirical parameter selection in TAIGA's multimodal detector system.

Method: Autoencoders are applied to extract latent space parameters for seamless integration of data from heterogeneous detectors, followed by a neural network to reconstruct primary particle parameters.

Result: Monte Carlo simulations show satisfactory energy reconstruction accuracy using AE latent space parameters, surpassing traditional empirical methods.

Conclusion: The AE-based approach provides a promising tool for efficient multimodal EAS data analysis and accurate primary particle parameter reconstruction.

Abstract: The aim of extensive air shower (EAS) analysis is to reconstruct the physical parameters of the primary particle that initiated the shower. The TAIGA experiment is a hybrid detector system that combines several imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes (IACTs) and an array of non-imaging Cherenkov detectors (TAIGA-HiSCORE) for EAS detection. Because the signals recorded by different detector types differ in physical nature, the direct merging of data is unfeasible, which complicates multimodal analysis. Currently, to analyze data from the IACTs and TAIGA-HiSCORE, a set of auxiliary parameters specific to each detector type is calculated from the recorded signals. These parameters are chosen empirically, so there is no certainty that they retain all important information and are the best suited for the respective problems. We propose to use autoencoders (AE) for the analysis of TAIGA experimental data and replace the conventionally used auxiliary parameters with the parameters of the AE latent space. The advantage of the AE latent space parameters is that they preserve essential physics from experimental data without prior assumptions. This approach also holds potential for enabling seamless integration of heterogeneous IACT and HiSCORE data through a joint latent space. To reconstruct the parameters of the primary particle of the EAS from the latent space of the AE, a separate artificial neural network is used. In this paper, the proposed approach is used to reconstruct the energy of the EAS primary particles based on Monte Carlo simulation data for TAIGA-HiSCORE. The dependence of the energy determination accuracy on the dimensionality of the latent space is analyzed, and these results are also compared with the results obtained by the conventional technique. It is shown that when using the AE latent space, the energy of the primary particle is reconstructed with satisfactory accuracy.

### [421] [Theoretical Analysis of Resource-Induced Phase Transitions in Estimation Strategies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10184)
*Takehiro Tottori,Tetsuya J. Kobayashi*

Main category: physics.bio-ph

TL;DR: The paper analytically characterizes how resource limitations lead to phase transitions between memoryless and memory-based estimation strategies in biological systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how organisms adapt estimation strategies under resource limitations, especially in volatile environments where sensory reliability varies.

Method: Analytical methods were used to derive conditions and mechanisms behind resource-induced phase transitions in information processing.

Result: The study identified how limited resources influence discontinuous, nonmonotonic, and scaling behaviors in estimation strategies.

Conclusion: Resource constraints fundamentally alter biological information processing, providing insight into adaptation mechanisms in volatile environments.

Abstract: Organisms adapt to volatile environments by integrating sensory information with internal memory, yet their information processing is constrained by resource limitations. Such limitations can fundamentally alter optimal estimation strategies in biological systems. For example, recent experiments suggest that organisms exhibit nonmonotonic phase transitions between memoryless and memory-based estimation strategies depending on sensory reliability. However, an analytical understanding of these resource-induced phase transitions is still missing. This Letter presents an analytical characterization of resource-induced phase transitions in optimal estimation strategies. Our result identifies the conditions under which resource limitations alter estimation strategies and analytically reveals the mechanism underlying the emergence of discontinuous, nonmonotonic, and scaling behaviors. These results provide a theoretical foundation for understanding how limited resources shape information processing in biological systems.

*Tom Pan,Evan Dramko,Mitchell D. Miller,Anastasios Kyrillidis,George N. Phillips*

Main category: physics.bio-ph

TL;DR: This paper integrates experimental crystallographic data with machine learning models for enhanced protein structure determination.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Protein structure determination remains a key challenge in structural biology, and while machine learning has made advances, it often overlooks direct experimental data integration.

Method: The authors developed a hybrid 3D vision transformer and convolutional network, utilizing Patterson maps and partial structure templates derived from AlphaFold predictions.

Result: The approach enhanced crystallographic phase improvements, completed missing regions in template structures, and improved electron density map agreement with ground truth atomic structures.

Conclusion: The hybrid ML-crystallographic approach effectively combines traditional and modern methods to aid protein structure determination, showing promise in refining structural predictions.

Abstract: Protein structure determination has long been one of the primary challenges of structural biology, to which deep machine learning (ML)-based approaches have increasingly been applied. However, these ML models generally do not incorporate the experimental measurements directly, such as X-ray crystallographic diffraction data. To this end, we explore an approach that more tightly couples these traditional crystallographic and recent ML-based methods, by training a hybrid 3-d vision transformer and convolutional network on inputs from both domains. We make use of two distinct input constructs / Patterson maps, which are directly obtainable from crystallographic data, and ``partial structure'' template maps derived from predicted structures deposited in the AlphaFold Protein Structure Database with subsequently omitted residues. With these, we predict electron density maps that are then post-processed into atomic models through standard crystallographic refinement processes. Introducing an initial dataset of small protein fragments taken from Protein Data Bank entries and placing them in hypothetical crystal settings, we demonstrate that our method is effective at both improving the phases of the crystallographic structure factors and completing the regions missing from partial structure templates, as well as improving the agreement of the electron density maps with the ground truth atomic structures.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: This paper introduces SACRED-Bench, a benchmark designed to assess the vulnerability of large language models (LLMs) to cross-modal audio-based attacks, and proposes SALMONN-Guard as a safeguard.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the emergence of safety risks associated with LLMs handling complex audio inputs inadequately, which could expose vulnerabilities and lead to harmful outcomes.

Method: The paper employs SACRED-Bench, which uses speech-audio composition techniques—speech overlap, speech-audio mixture, and diverse spoken instructions—to evaluate the robustness of LLMs. It also proposes SALMONN-Guard as a safeguard LLM that integrates speech, audio, and text for improved safety judgments.

Result: Experiments reveal that even advanced models like Gemini 2.5 Pro have a high attack success rate (66%) in SACRED-Bench tests, while SALMONN-Guard reduces this rate to 20%.

Conclusion: The findings highlight the urgent need for audio-aware safety mechanisms in multimodal LLMs, as demonstrated by SACRED-Bench and SALMONN-Guard's effectiveness in reducing vulnerabilities.

Abstract: Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has enabled understanding of both speech and non-speech audio, but exposing new safety risks emerging from complex audio inputs that are inadequately handled by current safeguards. We introduce SACRED-Bench (Speech-Audio Composition for RED-teaming) to evaluate the robustness of LLMs under complex audio-based attacks. Unlike existing perturbation-based methods that rely on noise optimization or white-box access, SACRED-Bench exploits speech-audio composition mechanisms. SACRED-Bench adopts three mechanisms: (a) speech overlap and multi-speaker dialogue, which embeds harmful prompts beneath or alongside benign speech; (b) speech-audio mixture, which imply unsafe intent via non-speech audio alongside benign speech or audio; and (c) diverse spoken instruction formats (open-ended QA, yes/no) that evade text-only filters. Experiments show that, even Gemini 2.5 Pro, the state-of-the-art proprietary LLM, still exhibits 66% attack success rate in SACRED-Bench test set, exposing vulnerabilities under cross-modal, speech-audio composition attacks. To bridge this gap, we propose SALMONN-Guard, a safeguard LLM that jointly inspects speech, audio, and text for safety judgments, reducing attack success down to 20%. Our results highlight the need for audio-aware defenses for the safety of multimodal LLMs. The benchmark and SALMONN-Guard checkpoints can be found at https://huggingface.co/datasets/tsinghua-ee/SACRED-Bench.

*Hannah Lu,Lluıs Salo-Salgado,Ruben Juanes*

Main category: physics.geo-ph

TL;DR: The study analyzes fault permeability influenced by lithology using a probabilistic framework (PREDICT), proposing a neural network surrogate to address computational issues and enable sensitivity analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fault zones have uncertain yet critical permeability structures essential for subsurface flow modeling, necessitating better understanding and predictive modeling approaches.

Method: This study employs the PREDICT framework, combining stochastic fault geometry generation, material placement, and computationally expensive flow-based upscaling. To mitigate computational bottlenecks, a neural network surrogate is adopted for faster and accurate emulation.

Result: The surrogate model effectively reduces computational demands while maintaining accuracy, enabling global sensitivity analysis (GSA). The GSA uncovers parameter interactions and identifies dominant and negligible lithological controls on fault permeability.

Conclusion: Integrating neural network surrogates into the PREDICT framework enhances sensitivity analysis capabilities and provides deeper insights into the complex interplay of lithological factors affecting fault permeability.

Abstract: Fault zones exhibit complex and heterogeneous permeability structures influenced by stratigraphic, compositional, and structural factors, making them critical yet uncertain components in subsurface flow modeling. In this study, we investigate how lithological controls influence fault permeability using the PREDICT framework: a probabilistic workflow that couples stochastic fault geometry generation, physically constrained material placement, and flow-based upscaling. The flow-based upscaling step, however, is a very computationally expensive component of the workflow and presents a major bottleneck that makes global sensitivity analysis (GSA) intractable, as it requires millions of model evaluations. To overcome this challenge, we develop a neural network surrogate to emulate the flow-based upscaling step. This surrogate model dramatically reduces the computational cost while maintaining high accuracy, thereby making GSA feasible. The surrogate-model-enabled GSA reveals new insights into the effects of lithological controls on fault permeability. In addition to identifying dominant parameters and negligible ones, the analysis uncovers significant nonlinear interactions between parameters that cannot be captured by traditional local sensitivity methods.

TL;DR: The paper develops a causal model-based MARL framework to address sample inefficiency challenges in wireless IoT systems, offering interpretable decisions and improved learning efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle the issue of sample inefficiency in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) used for medium access control (MAC) in Internet of Things (IoT) environments.

Method: The framework employs structural causal models (SCMs) and attention-based inference networks to represent causal dependencies. Data augmentation techniques are utilized with synthetic rollouts for policy optimization via proximal policy optimization (PPO).

Result: Analytical results show exponential sample complexity gains, while simulations demonstrate a 58% reduction in environment interactions and faster convergence compared to model-free baselines.

Conclusion: Causal MBRL is shown to be an effective approach for wireless systems, combining sample efficiency and interpretability while revealing key network conditions influencing policies.

Abstract: Despite the advantages of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) for wireless use case such as medium access control (MAC), their real-world deployment in Internet of Things (IoT) is hindered by their sample inefficiency. To alleviate this challenge, one can leverage model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) solutions, however, conventional MBRL approaches rely on black-box models that are not interpretable and cannot reason. In contrast, in this paper, a novel causal model-based MARL framework is developed by leveraging tools from causal learn- ing. In particular, the proposed model can explicitly represent causal dependencies between network variables using structural causal models (SCMs) and attention-based inference networks. Interpretable causal models are then developed to capture how MAC control messages influence observations, how transmission actions determine outcomes, and how channel observations affect rewards. Data augmentation techniques are then used to generate synthetic rollouts using the learned causal model for policy optimization via proximal policy optimization (PPO). Analytical results demonstrate exponential sample complexity gains of causal MBRL over black-box approaches. Extensive simulations demonstrate that, on average, the proposed approach can reduce environment interactions by 58%, and yield faster convergence compared to model-free baselines. The proposed approach inherently is also shown to provide interpretable scheduling decisions via attention-based causal attribution, revealing which network conditions drive the policy. The resulting combination of sample efficiency and interpretability establishes causal MBRL as a practical approach for resource-constrained wireless systems.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve the theoretical understanding and computational performance of randomized solvers for general linear systems using block Kaczmarz methods.

Method: The authors devised a unified framework using randomized batch-sampling Kaczmarz methods, applied concentration inequalities for analysis, and introduced scale-invariant linear convergence rate bounds.

Result: They derived tighter expected convergence bounds compared to existing ones and demonstrated their effectiveness in experiments, showing better empirical convergence behavior for block methods.

Conclusion: This framework introduces significant theoretical advancement and experimental insights, offering the potential for improved efficiency in specific application scenarios with learnable batch-sampling distributions.

Abstract: To conduct a more in-depth investigation of randomized solvers for general linear systems, we adopt a unified randomized batch-sampling Kaczmarz framework with per-iteration costs as low as cyclic block methods, and develop a general analysis technique to establish its convergence guarantee. With concentration inequalities, we derive new expected linear convergence rate bounds. The analysis applies to any randomized non-extended block Kaczmarz methods with static stochastic samplings. In addition, the new rate bounds are scale-invariant which eliminate the dependence on the magnitude of the data matrix. In most experiments, the new bounds are significantly tighter than existing ones and better reflect the empirical convergence behavior of block methods. Within this new framework, the batch-sampling distribution, as a learnable parameter, provides the possibility for block methods to achieve efficient performance in specific application scenarios, which deserves further investigation.

Conclusion: Pk-IOTA enhances OPC UA security by addressing certificate management issues and presents a practical solution for secure industrial deployments with negligible performance impact.

Abstract: The OPC UA protocol is becoming the de facto standard for Industry 4.0 machine-to-machine communication. It stands out as one of the few industrial protocols that provide robust security features designed to prevent attackers from manipulating and damaging critical infrastructures.

In this paper, we present Pk-IOTA, an automated solution designed to secure OPC UA communications by integrating programmable data plane switches for in-network certificate validation and leveraging the IOTA Tangle for decen- tralized certificate distribution. Our evaluation is performed on a physical testbed representing a real-world industrial scenario and shows that Pk-IOTA introduces a minimal overhead while providing a scalable and tamper-proof mechanism for OPC UA certificate management.

Our experiment demonstrates that the explainable RF-RFE achieved a detection accuracy of 99.9%, reducing false positive and computational cost in comparison to traditional classifiers. The findings underscore the effectiveness of integrating explainable AI and feature selection to develop a robust, transparent, and deployable IDS solution.

TL;DR: The paper presents a privacy-preserving approach using SHAP entropy regularization to mitigate privacy risks in Explainable AI techniques for AIoT environments, ensuring reduced privacy leakage while maintaining model accuracy and explanation fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Emerging privacy risks in post-hoc explanatory methods such as SHAP and LIME in AIoT applications necessitate novel solutions to balance interpretation and security.

Method: Proposing SHAP entropy regularization, an approach that penalizes low-entropy SHAP distributions to create uniformly spread explanations without exposing sensitive attributes.

Result: Experimental outcomes reveal reduced privacy leakage and retained prediction accuracy and explanation fidelity compared to baseline models.

Conclusion: The proposed method improves privacy in explainable AI techniques for AIoT, facilitating secure and trustworthy systems.

Abstract: The widespread integration of Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT) in smart home environments has amplified the demand for transparent and interpretable machine learning models. To foster user trust and comply with emerging regulatory frameworks, the Explainable AI (XAI) methods, particularly post-hoc techniques such as SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), and Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME), are widely employed to elucidate model behavior. However, recent studies have shown that these explanation methods can inadvertently expose sensitive user attributes and behavioral patterns, thereby introducing new privacy risks. To address these concerns, we propose a novel privacy-preserving approach based on SHAP entropy regularization to mitigate privacy leakage in explainable AIoT applications. Our method incorporates an entropy-based regularization objective that penalizes low-entropy SHAP attribution distributions during training, promoting a more uniform spread of feature contributions. To evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we developed a suite of SHAP-based privacy attacks that strategically leverage model explanation outputs to infer sensitive information. We validate our method through comparative evaluations using these attacks alongside utility metrics on benchmark smart home energy consumption datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that SHAP entropy regularization substantially reduces privacy leakage compared to baseline models, while maintaining high predictive accuracy and faithful explanation fidelity. This work contributes to the development of privacy-preserving explainable AI techniques for secure and trustworthy AIoT applications.

TL;DR: The paper explores the importance of training datasets free from vulnerabilities to improve the security of AI-generated code.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the tendency of AI programming assistants to generate code with security vulnerabilities due to flawed training data.

Method: The authors used static analysis to curate a vulnerability-free dataset from an existing Python corpus and trained transformer models on both the curated and unfiltered datasets.

Result: Models trained on the curated dataset yielded outputs more secure and equally functionally correct compared to those trained on unfiltered data.

Conclusion: Filtering training data for security improves the reliability of AI-generated code, but further architectural and evaluative enhancements are required for robust results.

Abstract: AI programming assistants have demonstrated a tendency to generate code containing basic security vulnerabilities. While developers are ultimately responsible for validating and reviewing such outputs, improving the inherent quality of these generated code snippets remains essential. A key contributing factor to insecure outputs is the presence of vulnerabilities in the training datasets used to build large language models (LLMs). To address this issue, we propose curating training data to include only code that is free from detectable vulnerabilities. In this study, we constructed a secure dataset by filtering an existing Python corpus using a static analysis tool to retain only vulnerability-free functions. We then trained two transformer-based models: one on the curated dataset and one on the original, unfiltered dataset. The models were evaluated on both the correctness and security of the code they generated in response to natural language function descriptions. Our results show that the model trained on the curated dataset produced outputs with fewer security issues, while maintaining comparable functional correctness. These findings highlight the importance of secure training data in improving the reliability of AI-based programming assistants, though further enhancements to model architecture and evaluation are needed to reinforce these outcomes.

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Adversarial Retroreflective Patch (ARP) as a stealthy and highly deployable adversarial attack method on Traffic Sign Recognition (TSR) systems. The ARP utilizes retroreflective materials to exploit vulnerabilities in TSR systems under vehicle headlight illumination.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address vulnerabilities in TSR systems to adversarial attacks, which could compromise safe transportation, by exploring new attack vectors that reduce visual detectability and implementation constraints.

Method: The proposed method employs retroreflective materials activated by headlight illumination. The authors developed a retroreflection simulation method and used black-box optimization to enhance the attack’s success. They also proposed a defense methodology called DPR Shield using polarized filters.

Result: The ARP attack achieved a success rate of 93.4% in dynamic scenarios at 35 meters and over 60% success rate against commercial systems in real-world settings. It also demonstrated improved stealthiness compared to previous methods.

Conclusion: The study identifies a new vulnerability in TSR systems through the ARP attack and provides a complementary defense mechanism (DPR Shield) to mitigate the identified risk effectively. The findings emphasize the need for enhanced security in TSR systems.

Abstract: Traffic sign recognition plays a critical role in ensuring safe and efficient transportation of autonomous vehicles but remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks using stickers or laser projections. While existing attack vectors demonstrate security concerns, they suffer from visual detectability or implementation constraints, suggesting unexplored vulnerability surfaces in TSR systems. We introduce the Adversarial Retroreflective Patch (ARP), a novel attack vector that combines the high deployability of patch attacks with the stealthiness of laser projections by utilizing retroreflective materials activated only under victim headlight illumination. We develop a retroreflection simulation method and employ black-box optimization to maximize attack effectiveness. ARP achieves $\geq$93.4\% success rate in dynamic scenarios at 35 meters and $\geq$60\% success rate against commercial TSR systems in real-world conditions. Our user study demonstrates that ARP attacks maintain near-identical stealthiness to benign signs while achieving $\geq$1.9\% higher stealthiness scores than previous patch attacks. We propose the DPR Shield defense, employing strategically placed polarized filters, which achieves $\geq$75\% defense success rates for stop signs and speed limit signs against micro-prism patches.

Conclusion: The study confirms that active GIAs in FL are detectable using the proposed methods, improving client security and maintaining data privacy in collaborative training scenarios.

Abstract: One of the key advantages of Federated Learning (FL) is its ability to collaboratively train a Machine Learning (ML) model while keeping clients' data on-site. However, this can create a false sense of security. Despite not sharing private data increases the overall privacy, prior studies have shown that gradients exchanged during the FL training remain vulnerable to Gradient Inversion Attacks (GIAs). These attacks allow reconstructing the clients' local data, breaking the privacy promise of FL. GIAs can be launched by either a passive or an active server. In the latter case, a malicious server manipulates the global model to facilitate data reconstruction. While effective, earlier attacks falling under this category have been demonstrated to be detectable by clients, limiting their real-world applicability. Recently, novel active GIAs have emerged, claiming to be far stealthier than previous approaches. This work provides the first comprehensive analysis of these claims, investigating four state-of-the-art GIAs. We propose novel lightweight client-side detection techniques, based on statistically improbable weight structures and anomalous loss and gradient dynamics. Extensive evaluation across several configurations demonstrates that our methods enable clients to effectively detect active GIAs without any modifications to the FL training protocol.

*Deniz Yilmaz,Liangyu Wu,Julia Gonski*

Main category: physics.ins-det

TL;DR: The paper proposes the use of machine learning for real-time cluster counting in drift chambers to improve particle identification and reduce data loads.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Future collider machines, like a Higgs factory, need higher granularity and improved particle identification methods, leading to challenges in processing large data volumes.

Method: Machine learning algorithms are employed for cluster counting directly at the readout level (edge processing), and their performance is compared with traditional techniques.

Result: The ML-based cluster counting outperforms traditional methods in particle separation and can be implemented on FPGA with low latency for real-time operations.

Conclusion: Integrating ML algorithms in detector hardware improves the efficiency of data handling and advances the capabilities of future drift chambers and hardware-based edge applications in high-energy physics.

Abstract: Drift chambers have long been central to collider tracking, but future machines like a Higgs factory motivate higher granularity and cluster counting for particle ID, posing new data processing challenges. Machine learning (ML) at the "edge", or in cell-level readout, can dramatically reduce the off-detector data rate for high-granularity drift chambers by performing cluster counting at-source. We present machine learning algorithms for cluster counting in real-time readout of future drift chambers. These algorithms outperform traditional derivative-based techniques based on achievable pion-kaon separation. When synthesized to FPGA resources, they can achieve latencies consistent with real-time operation in a future Higgs factory scenario, thus advancing both R&D for future collider detectors as well as hardware-based ML for edge applications in high energy physics.

Conclusion: MATAI demonstrates the potential to transform alloy discovery by achieving rapid, data-driven design of high-performance materials under real-world constraints.

Abstract: The discovery of advanced metallic alloys is hindered by vast composition spaces, competing property objectives, and real-world constraints on manufacturability. Here we introduce MATAI, a generalist machine learning framework for property prediction and inverse design of as-cast alloys. MATAI integrates a curated alloy database, deep neural network-based property predictors, a constraint-aware optimization engine, and an iterative AI-experiment feedback loop. The framework estimates key mechanical propertie, sincluding density, yield strength, ultimate tensile strength, and elongation, directly from composition, using multi-task learning and physics-informed inductive biases. Alloy design is framed as a constrained optimization problem and solved using a bi-level approach that combines local search with symbolic constraint programming. We demonstrate MATAI's capabilities on the Ti-based alloy system, a canonical class of lightweight structural materials, where it rapidly identifies candidates that simultaneously achieve lower density (<4.45 g/cm3), higher strength (>1000 MPa) and appreciable ductility (>5%) through only seven iterations. Experimental validation confirms that MATAI-designed alloys outperform commercial references such as TC4, highlighting the framework's potential to accelerate the discovery of lightweight, high-performance materials under real-world design constraints.

*Hao Xu,Yuntian Chen,Dongxiao Zhang*

Main category: cond-mat.mtrl-sci

TL;DR: This paper presents a graph-based framework for automatically discovering constitutive laws to predict material behavior from experimental data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional phenomenological models lack generalizability and depend on predefined functional forms and manual intuition.

Method: This work leverages a graph-based equation discovery framework that formulates constitutive laws as directed graphs, with nodes for operators and variables, and edges for computational and parametric relationships.

Result: Using this method, new constitutive models for alloy steel and lithium metal were found, achieving more compact representations with higher predictive accuracy compared to empirical models.

Conclusion: This framework offers a generalizable, interpretable alternative for data-driven scientific modeling and addresses complexities beyond the capabilities of conventional empirical formulations.

Abstract: Constitutive models are fundamental to solid mechanics and materials science, underpinning the quantitative description and prediction of material responses under diverse loading conditions. Traditional phenomenological models, which are derived through empirical fitting, often lack generalizability and rely heavily on expert intuition and predefined functional forms. In this work, we propose a graph-based equation discovery framework for the automated discovery of constitutive laws directly from multisource experimental data. This framework expresses equations as directed graphs, where nodes represent operators and variables, edges denote computational relations, and edge features encode parametric dependencies. This enables the generation and optimization of free-form symbolic expressions with undetermined material-specific parameters. Through the proposed framework, we have discovered new constitutive models for strain-rate effects in alloy steel materials and the deformation behavior of lithium metal. Compared with conventional empirical models, these new models exhibit compact analytical structures and achieve higher accuracy. The proposed graph-based equation discovery framework provides a generalizable and interpretable approach for data-driven scientific modelling, particularly in contexts where traditional empirical formulations are inadequate for representing complex physical phenomena.

### [438] [Music Flamingo: Scaling Music Understanding in Audio Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10289)

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: The paper introduces Music Flamingo, a model designed to better understand music by leveraging a new dataset and advanced training methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance in music comprehension.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research addresses the unique challenges of music understanding, such as its complex, layered nature, lack of high-quality annotations, and limited cultural diversity in existing models.

Method: The authors developed MF-Skills, a sophisticated music dataset, fine-tuned the Audio Flamingo 3 model on this dataset, and employed a novel post-training strategy combining chain-of-thought data (MF-Think) and reinforcement learning to enhance reasoning capabilities.

Result: Music Flamingo outperforms previous models across 10+ benchmarks in music understanding and reasoning, showcasing superior comprehension of harmony, structure, timbre, lyrics, and cultural context.

Conclusion: This work represents a significant step forward in music understanding, offering a robust foundation and tools to build future models that engage with music on a deeper, human-like level.

Abstract: We introduce Music Flamingo, a novel large audio-language model designed to advance music (including song) understanding in foundational audio models. While audio-language research has progressed rapidly, music remains challenging due to its dynamic, layered, and information-dense nature. Progress has been further limited by the difficulty of scaling open audio understanding models, primarily because of the scarcity of high-quality music data and annotations. As a result, prior models are restricted to producing short, high-level captions, answering only surface-level questions, and showing limited generalization across diverse musical cultures. To address these challenges, we curate MF-Skills, a large-scale dataset labeled through a multi-stage pipeline that yields rich captions and question-answer pairs covering harmony, structure, timbre, lyrics, and cultural context. We fine-tune an enhanced Audio Flamingo 3 backbone on MF-Skills and further strengthen multiple skills relevant to music understanding. To improve the model's reasoning abilities, we introduce a post-training recipe: we first cold-start with MF-Think, a novel chain-of-thought dataset grounded in music theory, followed by GRPO-based reinforcement learning with custom rewards. Music Flamingo achieves state-of-the-art results across 10+ benchmarks for music understanding and reasoning, establishing itself as a generalist and musically intelligent audio-language model. Beyond strong empirical results, Music Flamingo sets a new standard for advanced music understanding by demonstrating how models can move from surface-level recognition toward layered, human-like perception of songs. We believe this work provides both a benchmark and a foundation for the community to build the next generation of models that engage with music as meaningfully as humans do.

### [439] [Safe Planning in Interactive Environments via Iterative Policy Updates and Adversarially Robust Conformal Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10586)
*Omid Mirzaeedodangeh,Eliot Shekhtman,Nikolai Matni,Lars Lindemann*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: The paper addresses safe planning for autonomous agents in interactive environments by proposing an iterative framework that maintains safety guarantees across policy updates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ensuring the safety of autonomous agents in environments where the behavior of surroundings is reactive and changes based on the agent's actions poses a significant challenge, particularly when existing methods fail due to interaction-driven distribution shifts.

Method: The authors introduce an iterative framework leveraging adversarially robust conformal prediction (CP). They transfer safety guarantees across policy updates by analytically adjusting CP results to account for distribution shifts based on policy-to-trajectory sensitivity analysis.

Result: The framework is shown to provide safety and convergence guarantees through both analytical contraction analysis and empirical validation in a 2D car-pedestrian scenario.

Conclusion: The proposed framework is the first to introduce valid safety guarantees for autonomous agents in interactive and dynamic environments, addressing the gap caused by non-exchangeable data.

Abstract: Safe planning of an autonomous agent in interactive environments -- such as the control of a self-driving vehicle among pedestrians and human-controlled vehicles -- poses a major challenge as the behavior of the environment is unknown and reactive to the behavior of the autonomous agent. This coupling gives rise to interaction-driven distribution shifts where the autonomous agent's control policy may change the environment's behavior, thereby invalidating safety guarantees in existing work. Indeed, recent works have used conformal prediction (CP) to generate distribution-free safety guarantees using observed data of the environment. However, CP's assumption on data exchangeability is violated in interactive settings due to a circular dependency where a control policy update changes the environment's behavior, and vice versa. To address this gap, we propose an iterative framework that robustly maintains safety guarantees across policy updates by quantifying the potential impact of a planned policy update on the environment's behavior. We realize this via adversarially robust CP where we perform a regular CP step in each episode using observed data under the current policy, but then transfer safety guarantees across policy updates by analytically adjusting the CP result to account for distribution shifts. This adjustment is performed based on a policy-to-trajectory sensitivity analysis, resulting in a safe, episodic open-loop planner. We further conduct a contraction analysis of the system providing conditions under which both the CP results and the policy updates are guaranteed to converge. We empirically demonstrate these safety and convergence guarantees on a two-dimensional car-pedestrian case study. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first results that provide valid safety guarantees in such interactive settings.

### [440] [Fault Detection in Solar Thermal Systems using Probabilistic Reconstructions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10296)
*Florian Ebmeier,Nicole Ludwig,Jannik Thuemmel,Georg Martius,Volker H. Franz*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: This paper proposes a probabilistic reconstruction-based framework for anomaly detection in solar thermal systems, offering improvements in fault detection over existing models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need to address faults in solar thermal systems due to improper installation, maintenance, or operation, which impact efficiency and lead to damage. Automated anomaly detection can provide a cost-effective solution for monitoring.

Method: The authors propose a probabilistic reconstruction-based framework for detecting anomalies in solar thermal systems using data-driven techniques, tested on the PaSTS dataset.

Result: The proposed method detects system faults effectively, outperforming both simple and more complex deep learning models, with heteroscedastic uncertainty estimation being a key factor.

Conclusion: The framework improves fault detection quality while keeping the engineering overhead minimal, emphasizing the value of simple deep learning models for operational effectiveness.

Abstract: Solar thermal systems (STS) present a promising avenue for low-carbon heat generation, with a well-running system providing heat at minimal cost and carbon emissions. However, STS can exhibit faults due to improper installation, maintenance, or operation, often resulting in a substantial reduction in efficiency or even damage to the system. As monitoring at the individual level is economically prohibitive for small-scale systems, automated monitoring and fault detection should be used to address such issues. Recent advances in data-driven anomaly detection, particularly in time series analysis, offer a cost-effective solution by leveraging existing sensors to identify abnormal system states.
  Here, we propose a probabilistic reconstruction-based framework for anomaly detection. We evaluate our method on the publicly available PaSTS dataset of operational domestic STS, which features real-world complexities and diverse fault types. Our experiments show that reconstruction-based methods can detect faults in domestic STS both qualitatively and quantitatively, while generalizing to previously unseen systems. We also demonstrate that our model outperforms both simple and more complex deep learning baselines. Additionally, we show that heteroscedastic uncertainty estimation is essential to fault detection performance. Finally, we discuss the engineering overhead required to unlock these improvements and make a case for simple deep learning models.

### [441] [Robustness and Imperceptibility Analysis of Hybrid Spatial-Frequency Domain Image Watermarking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10245)
*Rizal Khoirul Anam*

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: This paper evaluates and compares digital image watermarking techniques (LSB, DFT, and hybrid LSB+DFT) in terms of imperceptibility and robustness against attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for robust copyright protection and content authentication in the digital age by comparing and optimizing image watermarking methods.

Method: Three watermarking techniques (LSB, DFT, hybrid LSB+DFT) are tested within a MATLAB framework using metrics such as PSNR, NC, and BER, under common image processing attacks.

Result: The hybrid LSB+DFT approach strikes the best balance, providing high visual fidelity and superior resilience against attacks compared to standalone methods.

Conclusion: Combining spatial and frequency domain methods (LSB+DFT) produces an optimal watermarking technique for digital media protection.

Abstract: The proliferation of digital media necessitates robust methods for copyright protection and content authentication. This paper presents a comprehensive comparative study of digital image watermarking techniques implemented using the spatial domain (Least Significant Bit - LSB), the frequency domain (Discrete Fourier Transform - DFT), and a novel hybrid (LSB+DFT) approach. The core objective is to evaluate the trade-offs between imperceptibility (measured by Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio - PSNR) and robustness (measured by Normalized Correlation - NC and Bit Error Rate - BER). We implemented these three techniques within a unified MATLAB-based experimental framework. The watermarked images were subjected to a battery of common image processing attacks, including JPEG compression, Gaussian noise, and salt-and-pepper noise, at varying intensities. Experimental results generated from standard image datasets (USC-SIPI) demonstrate that while LSB provides superior imperceptibility, it is extremely fragile. The DFT method offers significant robustness at the cost of visual quality. The proposed hybrid LSB+DFT technique, which leverages redundant embedding and a fallback extraction mechanism, is shown to provide the optimal balance, maintaining high visual fidelity while exhibiting superior resilience to all tested attacks.
