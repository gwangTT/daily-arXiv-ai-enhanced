### [1] [AI-Powered Math Tutoring: Platform for Personalized and Adaptive Education](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12484)
*Jarosław A. Chudziak,Adam Kostka*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper presents a novel multi-agent AI tutoring platform tailored for mathematics that combines personalized feedback, structured course generation, and textbook knowledge retrieval.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AI tutoring systems lack the ability to promote deep learning reflection and fail to integrate structured pedagogical strategies, especially in math education.

Method: The system utilizes a multi-agent AI platform that integrates adaptive and modular learning tools, combining personalized feedback, course design, and extensive knowledge retrieval.

Result: The platform enables structured, individualized learning experiences, helping students practice, identify weaknesses, and prepare effectively for exams with personalized exercises.

Conclusion: The proposed platform enhances AI-driven learning by integrating pedagogical agents and modular systems, improving teaching methodologies in math education.

Abstract: The growing ubiquity of artificial intelligence (AI), in particular large
language models (LLMs), has profoundly altered the way in which learners gain
knowledge and interact with learning material, with many claiming that AI
positively influences their learning achievements. Despite this advancement,
current AI tutoring systems face limitations associated with their reactive
nature, often providing direct answers without encouraging deep reflection or
incorporating structured pedagogical tools and strategies. This limitation is
most apparent in the field of mathematics, in which AI tutoring systems remain
underdeveloped. This research addresses the question: How can AI tutoring
systems move beyond providing reactive assistance to enable structured,
individualized, and tool-assisted learning experiences? We introduce a novel
multi-agent AI tutoring platform that combines adaptive and personalized
feedback, structured course generation, and textbook knowledge retrieval to
enable modular, tool-assisted learning processes. This system allows students
to learn new topics while identifying and targeting their weaknesses, revise
for exams effectively, and practice on an unlimited number of personalized
exercises. This article contributes to the field of artificial intelligence in
education by introducing a novel platform that brings together pedagogical
agents and AI-driven components, augmenting the field with modular and
effective systems for teaching mathematics.

### [2] [MR-LDM -- The Merge-Reactive Longitudinal Decision Model: Game Theoretic Human Decision Modeling for Interactive Sim Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12494)
*Dustin Holley,Jovin D'sa,Hossein Nourkhiz Mahjoub,Gibran Ali*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a unified game-theoretic and dynamics model to improve highway merge simulations, validated with real-world data and integrated into high-fidelity simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need to enhance simulation environments to mimic real-world driver behavior, especially for autonomous vehicle technology development.

Method: The authors developed a game-theoretic model for tactical decision-making coupled with dynamics modeling, allowing for realistic and interpretable highway merge interactions.

Result: The model successfully replicated complex real-world merging interactions when tested on real-world data and was computationally efficient for integration into large-scale simulation environments.

Conclusion: The proposed simulation model effectively captures merging interactions and is viable for use in large-scale autonomous vehicle development environments.

Abstract: Enhancing simulation environments to replicate real-world driver behavior,
i.e., more humanlike sim agents, is essential for developing autonomous vehicle
technology. In the context of highway merging, previous works have studied the
operational-level yielding dynamics of lag vehicles in response to a merging
car at highway on-ramps. Other works focusing on tactical decision modeling
generally consider limited action sets or utilize payoff functions with large
parameter sets and limited payoff bounds. In this work, we aim to improve the
simulation of the highway merge scenario by targeting a game theoretic model
for tactical decision-making with improved payoff functions and lag actions. We
couple this with an underlying dynamics model to have a unified decision and
dynamics model that can capture merging interactions and simulate more
realistic interactions in an explainable and interpretable fashion. The
proposed model demonstrated good reproducibility of complex interactions when
validated on a real-world dataset. The model was finally integrated into a high
fidelity simulation environment and confirmed to have adequate computation time
efficiency for use in large-scale simulations to support autonomous vehicle
development.

### [3] [A Survey of Explainable Reinforcement Learning: Targets, Methods and Needs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12599)
*Léo Saulières*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper reviews the field of eXplainable Reinforcement Learning (XRL) and establishes a taxonomy based on 'What' and 'How' questions, analyzing over 250 papers to discuss its state-of-the-art and future needs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the opacity of internal mechanisms in AI models, especially those using deep neural networks, by focusing on the subdomain of explainable reinforcement learning to better understand and explain agent actions.

Method: The paper introduces an intuitive taxonomy ('What' and 'How') to categorize and review XRL methods and conducts an extensive literature review of over 250 papers in the field.

Result: The study organizes the XRL methods in a structured taxonomy, identifies related domains requiring further attention, and presents an up-to-date review of the field to inform future research.

Conclusion: The paper underlines the importance of focusing on related domains in XRL and highlights several research needs, serving as a comprehensive guide for the community to advance the field.

Abstract: The success of recent Artificial Intelligence (AI) models has been
accompanied by the opacity of their internal mechanisms, due notably to the use
of deep neural networks. In order to understand these internal mechanisms and
explain the output of these AI models, a set of methods have been proposed,
grouped under the domain of eXplainable AI (XAI). This paper focuses on a
sub-domain of XAI, called eXplainable Reinforcement Learning (XRL), which aims
to explain the actions of an agent that has learned by reinforcement learning.
We propose an intuitive taxonomy based on two questions "What" and "How". The
first question focuses on the target that the method explains, while the second
relates to the way the explanation is provided. We use this taxonomy to provide
a state-of-the-art review of over 250 papers. In addition, we present a set of
domains close to XRL, which we believe should get attention from the community.
Finally, we identify some needs for the field of XRL.

### [4] [Fly, Fail, Fix: Iterative Game Repair with Reinforcement Learning and Large Multimodal Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12666)
*Alex Zook,Josef Spjut,Jonathan Tremblay*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework for automated game design, integrating RL agents for playtesting with LMMs for iterative game revisions based on behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern generative systems lack the ability to analyze dynamic player behavior resulting from game rules and design, creating a need for better tools.

Method: The framework pairs RL agents to generate gameplay data with LMMs that analyze these traces to iteratively refine game mechanics based on goals.

Result: The authors demonstrate that LMMs can effectively use player behavioral data to guide iterative improvements in game design.

Conclusion: This work shows the potential for scalable, practical AI tools in automated, behavior-sensitive game design workflows.

Abstract: Game design hinges on understanding how static rules and content translate
into dynamic player behavior - something modern generative systems that inspect
only a game's code or assets struggle to capture. We present an automated
design iteration framework that closes this gap by pairing a reinforcement
learning (RL) agent, which playtests the game, with a large multimodal model
(LMM), which revises the game based on what the agent does. In each loop the RL
player completes several episodes, producing (i) numerical play metrics and/or
(ii) a compact image strip summarising recent video frames. The LMM designer
receives a gameplay goal and the current game configuration, analyses the play
traces, and edits the configuration to steer future behaviour toward the goal.
We demonstrate results that LMMs can reason over behavioral traces supplied by
RL agents to iteratively refine game mechanics, pointing toward practical,
scalable tools for AI-assisted game design.

### [5] [Benchmarking Deception Probes via Black-to-White Performance Boosts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12691)
*Avi Parrack,Carlo Leonardo Attubato,Stefan Heimersheim*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper evaluates and benchmarks the effectiveness of deception probes, which are linear classifiers trained to identify deception in AI assistants.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the practical effectiveness and limitations of deception probes in detecting deceptive responses by AI assistants.

Method: Comparison between white-box monitoring (probe activation access) and black-box monitoring (without probe activation access), using the black-to-white performance boost as a benchmark.

Result: Weak but promising improvement is seen in monitoring performance when transitioning from black-box to white-box monitoring using existing deception probes.

Conclusion: Current deception probes show limited capability but offer encouraging prospects for detecting deceptive behaviors in AI systems.

Abstract: AI assistants will occasionally respond deceptively to user queries.
Recently, linear classifiers (called "deception probes") have been trained to
distinguish the internal activations of a language model during deceptive
versus honest responses. However, it's unclear how effective these probes are
at detecting deception in practice, nor whether such probes are resistant to
simple counter strategies from a deceptive assistant who wishes to evade
detection. In this paper, we compare white-box monitoring (where the monitor
has access to token-level probe activations) to black-box monitoring (without
such access). We benchmark deception probes by the extent to which the white
box monitor outperforms the black-box monitor, i.e. the black-to-white
performance boost. We find weak but encouraging black-to-white performance
boosts from existing deception probes.

### [6] [Imitating Mistakes in a Learning Companion AI Agent for Online Peer Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12801)
*Sosui Moribe,Taketoshi Ushiama*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This study develops an AI Agent for peer learning in English composition, focusing on matching learner proficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in human peer learning by creating an AI that can ensure effective peer learning through matching proficiency levels.

Method: Designing an AI Agent as a learning companion that simulates peers of equal proficiency in the context of English composition.

Result: The study demonstrates a proof-of-concept for validating the approach of AI-assisted peer learning at matched proficiency levels.

Conclusion: AI can potentially overcome limitations in traditional peer learning by acting as an adaptable and available learning companion.

Abstract: In recent years, peer learning has gained attention as a method that promotes
spontaneous thinking among learners, and its effectiveness has been confirmed
by numerous studies. This study aims to develop an AI Agent as a learning
companion that enables peer learning anytime and anywhere. However, peer
learning between humans has various limitations, and it is not always
effective. Effective peer learning requires companions at the same proficiency
levels. In this study, we assume that a learner's peers with the same
proficiency level as the learner make the same mistakes as the learner does and
focus on English composition as a specific example to validate this approach.

*Zhiwei Liu,Jielin Qiu,Shiyu Wang,Jianguo Zhang,Zuxin Liu,Roshan Ram,Haolin Chen,Weiran Yao,Huan Wang,Shelby Heinecke,Silvio Savarese,Caiming Xiong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces MCPEval, a framework for automating LLM agent evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the limitations of static benchmarks and manual data collection in evaluating LLM agents, emphasizing the need for scalable and robust assessment methods.

Method: MCPEval uses a Model Context Protocol (MCP) to automate task generation, integrate agent tools, and standardize evaluation metrics.

Result: The framework was empirically validated across five real-world domains, showcasing its ability to uncover detailed, domain-specific performance insights.

Conclusion: MCPEval is effective, reproducible, and significantly advances standardized and automated evaluation of LLM agents.

Abstract: The rapid rise of Large Language Models (LLMs)-based intelligent agents
underscores the need for robust, scalable evaluation frameworks. Existing
methods rely on static benchmarks and labor-intensive data collection, limiting
practical assessment. We introduce \oursystemname, an open-source Model Context
Protocol (MCP)-based framework that automates end-to-end task generation and
deep evaluation of LLM agents across diverse domains. MCPEval standardizes
metrics, seamlessly integrates with native agent tools, and eliminates manual
effort in building evaluation pipelines. Empirical results across five
real-world domains show its effectiveness in revealing nuanced, domain-specific
performance. We publicly release MCPEval
https://github.com/SalesforceAIResearch/MCPEval to promote reproducible and
standardized LLM agent evaluation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To better understand and characterize the mathematical properties of fuzzy classification aggregation functions.

Method: Employs formal proofs to demonstrate the necessary characteristics of optimal, independent, and zero unanimous fuzzy classification aggregation functions.

Result: Shows that such aggregation functions for classifying multiple objects must be a weighted arithmetic mean.

Conclusion: This provides a foundational understanding and specific characterization of the structure of fuzzy classification aggregation functions.

Abstract: We prove that any optimal, independent, and zero unanimous fuzzy

classifications of $m\ge 3$ objects into $2\le p\le m$ types must be a weighted
arithmetic mean. We also provide a characterization for the case when $m=p=2$.

### [10] [Assessing adaptive world models in machines with novel games](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12821)

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper highlights the concept of rapid adaptability in human intelligence and advocates for improved evaluation frameworks in AI systems, focusing on their ability to induce and refine adaptable world models through novel environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limited understanding of adaptable world models in AI and draw inspiration from human cognitive science, aiming for AI systems capable of swift adaptability and robust generalization.

Method: Proposing a novel benchmarking framework using carefully designed games with deep and continuously refreshing structures, termed 'novel games,' along with metrics to evaluate world model induction.

Result: Detailed guidelines for constructing challenging games and metrics that measure AI performance in learning and adapting to novel environments are provided.

Conclusion: The new framework aims to guide AI research towards creating systems with human-like adaptability, contributing a critical step to achieving artificial general intelligence.

Abstract: Human intelligence exhibits a remarkable capacity for rapid adaptation and
effective problem-solving in novel and unfamiliar contexts. We argue that this
profound adaptability is fundamentally linked to the efficient construction and
refinement of internal representations of the environment, commonly referred to
as world models, and we refer to this adaptation mechanism as world model
induction. However, current understanding and evaluation of world models in
artificial intelligence (AI) remains narrow, often focusing on static
representations learned from training on a massive corpora of data, instead of
the efficiency and efficacy of models in learning these representations through
interaction and exploration within a novel environment. In this Perspective, we
provide a view of world model induction drawing on decades of research in
cognitive science on how humans learn and adapt so efficiently; we then call
for a new evaluation framework for assessing adaptive world models in AI.
Concretely, we propose a new benchmarking paradigm based on suites of carefully
designed games with genuine, deep and continually refreshing novelty in the
underlying game structures -- we refer to this kind of games as novel games. We
detail key desiderata for constructing these games and propose appropriate
metrics to explicitly challenge and evaluate the agent's ability for rapid
world model induction. We hope that this new evaluation framework will inspire
future evaluation efforts on world models in AI and provide a crucial step
towards developing AI systems capable of the human-like rapid adaptation and
robust generalization -- a critical component of artificial general
intelligence.

### [11] [Information-Theoretic Aggregation of Ethical Attributes in Simulated-Command](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12862)
*Hussein Abbass,Taylan Akay,Harrison Tolley*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes a method to incorporate ethical decision-making within AI-driven simulations by automating ethical decision evaluation during simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to simulate a large number of scenarios with ethical decision-making in AI systems makes human judgement impractical due to the workload and time constraints.

Method: Human commanders design an ethical metric space, and the simulation environment dynamically explores decisions' ethical weights using algorithms from the multi-criteria decision making field.

Result: The paper establishes a framework for dynamically weighting ethical attributes in simulations using entropy-based methods from multi-criteria decision making literature.

Conclusion: The described method facilitates scalable ethical decision-making in simulation environments and reduces the direct involvement of human judgement during the simulation phase while still retaining human oversight in the decision-making loop.

Abstract: In the age of AI, human commanders need to use the computational powers
available in today's environment to simulate a very large number of scenarios.
Within each scenario, situations occur where different decision design options
could have ethical consequences. Making these decisions reliant on human
judgement is both counter-productive to the aim of exploring very large number
of scenarios in a timely manner and infeasible when considering the workload
needed to involve humans in each of these choices. In this paper, we move human
judgement outside the simulation decision cycle. Basically, the human will
design the ethical metric space, leaving it to the simulated environment to
explore the space. When the simulation completes its testing cycles, the
testing environment will come back to the human commander with a few options to
select from. The human commander will then exercise human-judgement to select
the most appropriate course of action, which will then get executed
accordingly. We assume that the problem of designing metrics that are
sufficiently granular to assess the ethical implications of decisions is
solved. Subsequently, the fundamental problem we look at in this paper is how
to weight ethical decisions during the running of these simulations; that is,
how to dynamically weight the ethical attributes when agents are faced with
decision options with ethical implications during generative simulations. The
multi-criteria decision making literature has started to look at nearby
problems, where the concept of entropy has been used to determine the weights
during aggregation. We draw from that literature different approaches to
automatically calculate the weights for ethical attributes during
simulation-based testing and evaluation.

### [12] [Manipulation Attacks by Misaligned AI: Risk Analysis and Safety Case Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12872)
*Rishane Dassanayake,Mario Demetroudi,James Walpole,Lindley Lentati,Jason R. Brown,Edward James Young*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper examines the risk of manipulation attacks posed by frontier AI systems and proposes a systematic safety framework to assess and mitigate these risks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to tackle the growing threat posed by AI systems capable of persuading, deceiving, and influencing human behavior, which could undermine cybersecurity through employee manipulation.

Method: It introduces a safety case framework focused on three arguments: inability, control, and trustworthiness, including evidence requirements and evaluation methodologies.

Result: A structured methodology for AI companies to integrate manipulation risk assessment and mitigation into their safety protocols.

Conclusion: The paper establishes a foundation for AI safety governance to address manipulation risks before systems are deployed.

Abstract: Frontier AI systems are rapidly advancing in their capabilities to persuade,
deceive, and influence human behaviour, with current models already
demonstrating human-level persuasion and strategic deception in specific
contexts. Humans are often the weakest link in cybersecurity systems, and a
misaligned AI system deployed internally within a frontier company may seek to
undermine human oversight by manipulating employees. Despite this growing
threat, manipulation attacks have received little attention, and no systematic
framework exists for assessing and mitigating these risks. To address this, we
provide a detailed explanation of why manipulation attacks are a significant
threat and could lead to catastrophic outcomes. Additionally, we present a
safety case framework for manipulation risk, structured around three core lines
of argument: inability, control, and trustworthiness. For each argument, we
specify evidence requirements, evaluation methodologies, and implementation
considerations for direct application by AI companies. This paper provides the
first systematic methodology for integrating manipulation risk into AI safety
governance, offering AI companies a concrete foundation to assess and mitigate
these threats before deployment.

### [13] [VAR-MATH: Probing True Mathematical Reasoning in Large Language Models via Symbolic Multi-Instance Benchmarks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12885)
*Jian Yao,Ran Cheng,Kay Chen Tan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Recent findings show reinforcement learning (RL) can seemingly enhance large language model (LLM) reasoning on benchmarks but may exploit benchmark-specific patterns. A new framework, VAR-MATH, is proposed to ensure consistent and contamination-free evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To question whether improvements in LLMs' mathematical reasoning through RL signify genuine reasoning skills or overfitting to benchmarks, given the presence of flawed reward signals.

Method: Developed the VAR-MATH framework, which converts numeric problems into symbolic templates requiring consistent reasoning across multiple problem variants. This mitigates benchmark contamination and enhances evaluation robustness.

Result: Experiments with transformed benchmarks (VAR-AMC23 and VAR-AIME24) show significant performance decline (average 48.0% on AMC23 and 58.3% on AIME24) for RL-trained models, revealing their dependence on superficial heuristics.

Conclusion: The VAR-MATH framework highlights that many RL methods fail to generalize in mathematical reasoning, shifting the focus toward principled evaluation methods to probe genuine reasoning ability.

Abstract: Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) have led to substantial
improvements in the mathematical reasoning abilities of large language models
(LLMs), as measured by standard benchmarks. However, these gains often persist
even when models are trained with flawed signals, such as random or inverted
rewards, raising a fundamental question: do such improvements reflect true
reasoning, or are they merely artifacts of overfitting to benchmark-specific
patterns? To address this question, we take an evaluation-centric perspective
and identify two critical shortcomings in existing protocols. First,
\emph{benchmark contamination} arises from the public availability of test
problems, increasing the risk of data leakage. Second, \emph{evaluation
fragility} stems from the reliance on single-instance assessments, which are
highly sensitive to stochastic outputs and fail to capture reasoning
consistency. To overcome these limitations, we introduce {VAR-MATH}, a symbolic
evaluation framework designed to probe genuine reasoning ability. By converting
fixed numerical problems into symbolic templates and requiring models to solve
multiple instantiations of each, VAR-MATH enforces consistent reasoning across
structurally equivalent variants, thereby mitigating contamination and
improving evaluation robustness. We apply VAR-MATH to transform two popular
benchmarks, AMC23 and AIME24, into their symbolic counterparts, VAR-AMC23 and
VAR-AIME24. Experimental results reveal substantial performance drops for
RL-trained models on the variabilized versions, especially for smaller models,
with average declines of 48.0\% on AMC23 and 58.3\% on AIME24. These findings
suggest that many existing RL methods rely on superficial heuristics and fail
to generalize beyond specific numerical forms. Overall, VAR-MATH offers a
principled, contamination-resistant evaluation paradigm for mathematical
reasoning.

### [14] [A Translation of Probabilistic Event Calculus into Markov Decision Processes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12989)
*Lyris Xu,Fabio Aurelio D'Asaro,Luke Dickens*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper integrates Probabilistic Event Calculus (PEC) with Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), enabling PEC to handle goal-directed reasoning and planning tasks. PEC's interpretability is preserved.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PEC is powerful for reasoning in uncertain environments but lacks mechanisms for goal-directed reasoning, limiting its utility for planning tasks.

Method: The authors propose a formal translation of PEC domains into MDPs, introducing 'action-taking situations' to ensure the preservation of PEC's action semantics.

Result: The integration allows established MDP algorithms to be applied within PEC domains, facilitating both temporal reasoning and objective-driven planning while maintaining interpretability.

Conclusion: This work enhances PEC, bridging the gap for goal-directed reasoning while ensuring its original capabilities and interpretability remain intact.

Abstract: Probabilistic Event Calculus (PEC) is a logical framework for reasoning about
actions and their effects in uncertain environments, which enables the
representation of probabilistic narratives and computation of temporal
projections. The PEC formalism offers significant advantages in
interpretability and expressiveness for narrative reasoning. However, it lacks
mechanisms for goal-directed reasoning. This paper bridges this gap by
developing a formal translation of PEC domains into Markov Decision Processes
(MDPs), introducing the concept of "action-taking situations" to preserve PEC's
flexible action semantics. The resulting PEC-MDP formalism enables the
extensive collection of algorithms and theoretical tools developed for MDPs to
be applied to PEC's interpretable narrative domains. We demonstrate how the
translation supports both temporal reasoning tasks and objective-driven
planning, with methods for mapping learned policies back into human-readable
PEC representations, maintaining interpretability while extending PEC's
capabilities.

*Roger Xavier Lera-Leri,Filippo Bistaffa,Athina Georgara,Juan Antonio Rodriguez-Aguilar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: X-MILP introduces a new approach for generating contrastive explanations for MILPs using constraint reasoning and presenting this information in an easily interpretable graph format.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the trustworthiness and interpretability of AI models, especially in optimization scenarios like MILPs, by providing clear, contrastive explanations for their decision-making processes.

Method: The authors devised X-MILP, which encodes user queries about MILP solutions into constraints, identifies explanations through Irreducible Infeasible Subsystems (IIS), and visualizes these in a graph for user interpretation.

Result: The approach was tested on standard optimization problems and successfully evaluated for its computational feasibility in providing explanations.

Conclusion: X-MILP offers a domain-agnostic framework for generating understandable contrastive explanations for MILPs, fostering transparency and user trust.

Abstract: Following the recent push for trustworthy AI, there has been an increasing
interest in developing contrastive explanation techniques for optimisation,
especially concerning the solution of specific decision-making processes
formalised as MILPs. Along these lines, we propose X-MILP, a domain-agnostic
approach for building contrastive explanations for MILPs based on constraint
reasoning techniques. First, we show how to encode the queries a user makes
about the solution of an MILP problem as additional constraints. Then, we
determine the reasons that constitute the answer to the user's query by
computing the Irreducible Infeasible Subsystem (IIS) of the newly obtained set
of constraints. Finally, we represent our explanation as a "graph of reasons"
constructed from the IIS, which helps the user understand the structure among
the reasons that answer their query. We test our method on instances of
well-known optimisation problems to evaluate the empirical hardness of
computing explanations.

Abstract: The study "Prediction of Highway Traffic Flow Based on Artificial
Intelligence Algorithms Using California Traffic Data" presents a machine
learning-based traffic flow prediction model to address global traffic
congestion issues. The research utilized 30-second interval traffic data from
California Highway 78 over a five-month period from July to November 2022,
analyzing a 7.24 km westbound section connecting "Melrose Dr" and "El-Camino
Real" in the San Diego area. The study employed Multiple Linear Regression
(MLR) and Random Forest (RF) algorithms, analyzing data collection intervals
ranging from 30 seconds to 15 minutes. Using R^2, MAE, and RMSE as performance
metrics, the analysis revealed that both MLR and RF models performed optimally
with 10-minute data collection intervals. These findings are expected to
contribute to future traffic congestion solutions and efficient traffic

### [17] [From Roots to Rewards: Dynamic Tree Reasoning with RL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13142)
*Ahmed Bahloul,Simon Malberg*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a dynamic reinforcement learning framework to improve tree-based reasoning for language models, addressing limitations of static Probabilistic Tree-of-Thought methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Language models face challenges in error propagation and integrating knowledge during complex reasoning. Current tree-based methods like ProbTree struggle with their static nature and computational inefficiency.

Method: The authors propose a reinforcement learning approach that incrementally builds reasoning trees by dynamically adapting to intermediate results, optimizing action selection for decomposition, retrieval, or aggregation.

Result: The presented framework enhances computational efficiency and reasoning quality by selectively expanding reasoning steps and leveraging real-time confidence estimates.

Conclusion: This work advances tree-structured reasoning by integrating dynamic adaptation and reinforcement learning, making it both reliable and flexible for real-world question-answering tasks.

Abstract: Modern language models address complex questions through chain-of-thought
(CoT) reasoning (Wei et al., 2023) and retrieval augmentation (Lewis et al.,
2021), yet struggle with error propagation and knowledge integration.
Tree-structured reasoning methods, particularly the Probabilistic
Tree-of-Thought (ProbTree)(Cao et al., 2023) framework, mitigate these issues
by decomposing questions into hierarchical structures and selecting answers
through confidence-weighted aggregation of parametric and retrieved knowledge
(Yao et al., 2023). However, ProbTree's static implementation introduces two
key limitations: (1) the reasoning tree is fixed during the initial
construction phase, preventing dynamic adaptation to intermediate results, and
(2) each node requires exhaustive evaluation of all possible solution
strategies, creating computational inefficiency. We present a dynamic
reinforcement learning (Sutton and Barto, 2018) framework that transforms
tree-based reasoning into an adaptive process. Our approach incrementally
constructs the reasoning tree based on real-time confidence estimates, while
learning optimal policies for action selection (decomposition, retrieval, or
aggregation). This maintains ProbTree's probabilistic rigor while improving
both solution quality and computational efficiency through selective expansion
and focused resource allocation. The work establishes a new paradigm for
treestructured reasoning that balances the reliability of probabilistic
frameworks with the flexibility required for real-world question answering
systems.

### [18] [Black Box Deployed -- Functional Criteria for Artificial Moral Agents in the LLM Era](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13175)
*Matthew E. Brophy*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper revises philosophical evaluation criteria for artificial moral agents due to the opacity and stochastic behavior of large language models, presenting ten functional criteria to guide assessment and alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional ethical frameworks fail to accommodate the opaque nature of large language models, necessitating new criteria for evaluating their role as artificial moral agents.

Method: The paper introduces ten functional criteria for assessing artificial moral agents and illustrates their application using hypothetical scenarios involving an autonomous public bus.

Result: The defined criteria—such as moral concordance, context sensitivity, and trustworthiness—offer a more practical framework for evaluating moral agency in LLM-powered systems.

Conclusion: To better align LLM-based artificial moral agents with societal values, philosophical evaluation frameworks must adopt revised, functionally oriented criteria focusing on adaptability and integrity in morally salient contexts.

Abstract: The advancement of powerful yet opaque large language models (LLMs)
necessitates a fundamental revision of the philosophical criteria used to
evaluate artificial moral agents (AMAs). Pre-LLM frameworks often relied on the
assumption of transparent architectures, which LLMs defy due to their
stochastic outputs and opaque internal states. This paper argues that
traditional ethical criteria are pragmatically obsolete for LLMs due to this
mismatch. Engaging with core themes in the philosophy of technology, this paper
proffers a revised set of ten functional criteria to evaluate LLM-based
artificial moral agents: moral concordance, context sensitivity, normative
integrity, metaethical awareness, system resilience, trustworthiness,
corrigibility, partial transparency, functional autonomy, and moral
imagination. These guideposts, applied to what we term "SMA-LLS" (Simulating
Moral Agency through Large Language Systems), aim to steer AMAs toward greater
alignment and beneficial societal integration in the coming years. We
illustrate these criteria using hypothetical scenarios involving an autonomous
public bus (APB) to demonstrate their practical applicability in morally
salient contexts.

### [19] [Higher-Order Pattern Unification Modulo Similarity Relations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13208)
*Besik Dundua,Temur Kutsia*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper integrates higher-order patterns with fuzzy equivalences using similarity relations and proposes a unification algorithm that is proven to terminate, be sound, and complete.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many decision-making tasks involve reasoning across abstract functions and predicates where exact matches are rare, necessitating efficient computational methods combining higher-order reasoning and fuzzy logic.

Method: The approach integrates higher-order patterns with fuzzy logic based on minimum T-norm similarity relations, and designs a unification algorithm to compute most general unifiers under these conditions.

Result: The unification algorithm for higher-order patterns and fuzzy similarity relations is unitary and successfully computes a most general unifier with the highest degree of approximation.

Conclusion: The proposed algorithm effectively bridges higher-order reasoning and fuzzy logic, demonstrating both theoretical soundness and computational practicality in handling abstract decision-making tasks.

Abstract: The combination of higher-order theories and fuzzy logic can be useful in
decision-making tasks that involve reasoning across abstract functions and
predicates, where exact matches are often rare or unnecessary. Developing
efficient reasoning and computational techniques for such a combined formalism
presents a significant challenge. In this paper, we adopt a more
straightforward approach aiming at integrating two well-established and
computationally well-behaved components: higher-order patterns on one side and
fuzzy equivalences expressed through similarity relations based on minimum
T-norm on the other. We propose a unification algorithm for higher-order
patterns modulo these similarity relations and prove its termination,
soundness, and completeness. This unification problem, like its crisp
counterpart, is unitary. The algorithm computes a most general unifier with the
highest degree of approximation when the given terms are unifiable.

### [20] [The Generative Energy Arena (GEA): Incorporating Energy Awareness in Large Language Model (LLM) Human Evaluations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13302)
*Carlos Arriaga,Gonzalo Martínez,Eneko Sendin,Javier Conde,Pedro Reviriego*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces GEA, an evaluation platform that integrates energy consumption data into the assessment of LLMs, showing users tend to favor energy-efficient models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Evaluate approaches for assessing LLMs and incorporate sustainability metrics like energy consumption to understand their impact on user preferences.

Method: Designed GEA, an arena where human evaluators rank LLM responses with additional energy consumption metrics displayed during the evaluation process.

Result: Preliminary results suggest users tend to prioritize energy-efficient models over top-performing ones when aware of the energy consumption information.

Conclusion: Energy consumption awareness affects user preferences, indicating that smaller, more efficient models could be favored over costly and complex ones in many scenarios.

Abstract: The evaluation of large language models is a complex task, in which several
approaches have been proposed. The most common is the use of automated
benchmarks in which LLMs have to answer multiple-choice questions of different
topics. However, this method has certain limitations, being the most
concerning, the poor correlation with the humans. An alternative approach, is
to have humans evaluate the LLMs. This poses scalability issues as there is a
large and growing number of models to evaluate making it impractical (and
costly) to run traditional studies based on recruiting a number of evaluators
and having them rank the responses of the models. An alternative approach is
the use of public arenas, such as the popular LM arena, on which any user can
freely evaluate models on any question and rank the responses of two models.
The results are then elaborated into a model ranking. An increasingly important
aspect of LLMs is their energy consumption and, therefore, evaluating how
energy awareness influences the decisions of humans in selecting a model is of
interest. In this paper, we present GEA, the Generative Energy Arena, an arena
that incorporates information on the energy consumption of the model in the
evaluation process. Preliminary results obtained with GEA are also presented,
showing that for most questions, when users are aware of the energy
consumption, they favor smaller and more energy efficient models. This suggests
that for most user interactions, the extra cost and energy incurred by the more
complex and top-performing models do not provide an increase in the perceived
quality of the responses that justifies their use.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces FormulaOne, a challenging benchmark focused on graph theory, logic, and algorithms. Current models perform poorly on it, showcasing the gap between AI and human-level expertise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to assess the true reasoning and problem-solving abilities of frontier AI models by moving away from synthetic problems and focusing on practical, challenging, real-world research problems.

Method: The authors created FormulaOne, a benchmark designed using Monadic Second-Order logic on graphs, embedded with real-world optimization problems, and evaluated AI models like OpenAI's o3 against it.

Result: State-of-the-art AI models, including OpenAI's o3, performed poorly, solving less than 1% of the problems even after multiple attempts and prompts.

Conclusion: AI remains far from achieving expert-level understanding in advanced problem-solving areas, and the FormulaOne benchmark serves as a tool to drive progress and investigate these limitations.

Abstract: Frontier AI models demonstrate formidable breadth of knowledge. But how close
are they to true human -- or superhuman -- expertise? Genuine experts can
tackle the hardest problems and push the boundaries of scientific
understanding. To illuminate the limits of frontier model capabilities, we turn
away from contrived competitive programming puzzles, and instead focus on
real-life research problems.
  We construct FormulaOne, a benchmark that lies at the intersection of graph
theory, logic, and algorithms, all well within the training distribution of
frontier models. Our problems are incredibly demanding, requiring an array of
reasoning steps. The dataset has three key properties. First, it is of
commercial interest and relates to practical large-scale optimisation problems,
such as those arising in routing, scheduling, and network design. Second, it is
generated from the highly expressive framework of Monadic Second-Order (MSO)
logic on graphs, paving the way toward automatic problem generation at scale;
ideal for building RL environments. Third, many of our problems are intimately
related to the frontier of theoretical computer science, and to central
conjectures therein, such as the Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis (SETH). As
such, any significant algorithmic progress on our dataset, beyond known
results, could carry profound theoretical implications.
  Remarkably, state-of-the-art models like OpenAI's o3 fail entirely on
FormulaOne, solving less than 1% of the questions, even when given 10 attempts
and explanatory fewshot examples -- highlighting how far they remain from
expert-level understanding in some domains. To support further research, we
additionally curate FormulaOne-Warmup, offering a set of simpler tasks, from
the same distribution. We release the full corpus along with a comprehensive
evaluation framework.

TL;DR: The paper focuses on enhancing RISC-V ISA modularity by introducing compositionality into the SAIL-RISCV golden model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address compositionality issues in RISC-V ISA modularity across the specification and development flow, including emulation, simulation, and verification.

Method: Proposed and implemented modular SAIL to inject compositionality into the SAIL-RISCV golden model, adapting the SAIL-RISCV flow and analyzing both static and dynamic binding.

Result: Achieved a pluggable emulator exhibiting the same functional behavior as the original monolithic emulator while comparing performance metrics.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates the feasibility of integrating compositionality within the SAIL-RISCV framework, paving the way for enhanced modularity.

Abstract: In order to truly benefit from RISC-V ISA modularity, the community has to
address the issue of compositionality, going beyond modules at the
specification level covering larger subsets of the RISC-V development flow
including emulation, simulation and verification. In this paper we introduce
modular SAIL, an experiment to inject compositionality into the SAIL-RISCV
golden model. We show that it is, in principle, not difficult to adapt the
SAIL-RISCV flow (and ideally the SAIL compiler itself) to support modules at
the emulator level. We back our findings by a comparative study of the
resulting pluggable emulator's performance using both static and dynamic
binding, which both exhibit same functional behavior as the original monolithic
emulator (aka RISC-V ISS).

TL;DR: The paper presents an energy-efficient CGRA architecture for transformer models, optimized for edge devices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformers, though powerful, require high computational resources, making their deployment on low-power edge devices challenging.

Method: The paper proposes a novel CGRA with a 4x4 PE array, 4x2 MOBs for memory optimization, and a switchless mesh torus interconnect for low-latency communication.

Result: The architecture provides scalable, efficient computation and dataflow to meet the demands of transformer models on edge devices.

Conclusion: The proposed CGRA architecture enables the deployment of advanced transformer models on edge devices by addressing energy and performance constraints.

Abstract: Transformers have revolutionized deep learning with applications in natural
language processing, computer vision, and beyond. However, their computational
demands make it challenging to deploy them on low-power edge devices. This
paper introduces an ultra-low-power, Coarse-Grained Reconfigurable Array (CGRA)
architecture specifically designed to accelerate General Matrix Multiplication
(GEMM) operations in transformer models tailored for the energy and resource
constraints of edge applications. The proposed architecture integrates a 4 x 4
array of Processing Elements (PEs) for efficient parallel computation and
dedicated 4 x 2 Memory Operation Blocks (MOBs) for optimized LOAD/STORE
operations, reducing memory bandwidth demands and enhancing data reuse. A
switchless mesh torus interconnect network further minimizes power and latency
by enabling direct communication between PEs and MOBs, eliminating the need for
centralized switching. Through its heterogeneous array design and efficient
dataflow, this CGRA architecture addresses the unique computational needs of
transformers, offering a scalable pathway to deploy sophisticated machine
learning models on edge devices.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a "Model Synthesis Architecture" to replicate human reasoning by combining global relevance retrieval with bespoke mental model construction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Humans excel at drawing relevant information from a wide range of background knowledge and reasoning coherently in novel situations. The paper investigates how this ability can be computationally replicated.

Method: The authors propose using language models for relevance-based retrieval and probabilistic programs to construct coherent mental models, evaluating their approach on a dataset that challenges human-like reasoning.

Result: The proposed Model Synthesis Architecture (MSA) outperforms language model-only baselines in capturing human judgments on a reasoning dataset involving novel causal structures and extensive background knowledge.

Conclusion: MSAs provide a promising computational framework for mimicking human reasoning in open-ended domains by blending distributed and symbolic representations to create tailored mental models.

Abstract: When faced with novel situations, people are able to marshal relevant
considerations from a wide range of background knowledge and put these to use
in inferences and predictions. What permits us to draw in globally relevant
information and reason over it coherently? Here, we explore the hypothesis that
people use a combination of distributed and symbolic representations to
construct bespoke mental models tailored to novel situations. We propose a
computational implementation of this idea -- a ``Model Synthesis Architecture''
(MSA) -- using language models to implement global relevance-based retrieval
and model synthesis and probabilistic programs to implement bespoke, coherent
world models. We evaluate our MSA as a model of human judgments on a novel
reasoning dataset. The dataset -- built around a `Model Olympics` domain of
sports vignettes -- tests models' capacity for human-like, open-ended reasoning
by requiring (i) judgments about novel causal structures described in language;
(ii) drawing on large bodies of background knowledge; and (iii) doing both in
light of observations that introduce arbitrary novel variables. Our MSA
approach captures human judgments better than language model-only baselines,
under both direct and chain-of-thought generations from the LM that supports
model synthesis. These results suggest that MSAs can be implemented in a way
that mirrors people's ability to deliver locally coherent reasoning over
globally relevant variables, offering a path to understanding and replicating
human reasoning in open-ended domains.

*Michael A. Lepori,Jennifer Hu,Ishita Dasgupta,Roma Patel,Thomas Serre,Ellie Pavlick*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper investigates how language models (LMs) categorize sentences based on modality, identifying linear representations that differentiate modal categories and showing consistency with human judgments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Languages models' capacity to understand and categorize modality has been questioned in recent studies, necessitating deeper exploration into their reliability in differentiating modal categories.

Method: The authors identify linear representations called modal difference vectors within various LMs and assess their correlation with human categorization via mechanistic interpretability techniques.

Result: The study finds that LMs demonstrate reliable modal categorization judgments, with modal difference vectors emerging progressively as models improve in competence. These vectors also align with human categorization behavior.

Conclusion: The paper provides insights into both machine and human modal categorization, suggesting that emerging modal representations in LMs could offer a new perspective on how humans process modality.

Abstract: Language models (LMs) are used for a diverse range of tasks, from question
answering to writing fantastical stories. In order to reliably accomplish these
tasks, LMs must be able to discern the modal category of a sentence (i.e.,
whether it describes something that is possible, impossible, completely
nonsensical, etc.). However, recent studies have called into question the
ability of LMs to categorize sentences according to modality (Michaelov et al.,
2025; Kauf et al., 2023). In this work, we identify linear representations that
discriminate between modal categories within a variety of LMs, or modal
difference vectors. Analysis of modal difference vectors reveals that LMs have
access to more reliable modal categorization judgments than previously
reported. Furthermore, we find that modal difference vectors emerge in a
consistent order as models become more competent (i.e., through training steps,
layers, and parameter count). Notably, we find that modal difference vectors
identified within LM activations can be used to model fine-grained human
categorization behavior. This potentially provides a novel view into how human
participants distinguish between modal categories, which we explore by
correlating projections along modal difference vectors with human participants'
ratings of interpretable features. In summary, we derive new insights into LM
modal categorization using techniques from mechanistic interpretability, with
the potential to inform our understanding of modal categorization in humans.

Motivation: Chechen is a vulnerable language with limited resources, necessitating efforts to support its preservation through technological advancements.

Method: The researchers fine-tuned the NLLB-200 multilingual translation model and collected data to train and evaluate it.

TL;DR: The study leverages NLP, specifically fine-tuned BioClinicalBERT, to automate and improve drug overdose classification from coroner reports, achieving high accuracy and scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rising drug-related deaths, especially from fentanyl, necessitate efficient surveillance methods because manual ICD-10 coding is slow and prone to information loss.

Method: The paper evaluated multiple NLP models, including encoder- and decoder-based models like BERT and Llama, using datasets from U.S. jurisdictions and external validation. The performance was benchmarked using macro F1 scores.

Result: Fine-tuned BioClinicalBERT achieved superior accuracy (macro F1 = 0.998 internally, 0.966 externally), outperforming other models and methods.

Conclusion: NLP models like BioClinicalBERT are highly effective for timely and accurate overdose classification, enabling scalable solutions for near real-time surveillance and overcoming current manual limitations.

Abstract: The rising rate of drug-related deaths in the United States, largely driven
by fentanyl, requires timely and accurate surveillance. However, critical
overdose data are often buried in free-text coroner reports, leading to delays
and information loss when coded into ICD (International Classification of
Disease)-10 classifications. Natural language processing (NLP) models may
automate and enhance overdose surveillance, but prior applications have been
limited. A dataset of 35,433 death records from multiple U.S. jurisdictions in
2020 was used for model training and internal testing. External validation was
conducted using a novel separate dataset of 3,335 records from 2023-2024.
Multiple NLP approaches were evaluated for classifying specific drug
involvement from unstructured death certificate text. These included
traditional single- and multi-label classifiers, as well as fine-tuned
encoder-only language models such as Bidirectional Encoder Representations from
Transformers (BERT) and BioClinicalBERT, and contemporary decoder-only large
language models such as Qwen 3 and Llama 3. Model performance was assessed
using macro-averaged F1 scores, and 95% confidence intervals were calculated to
quantify uncertainty. Fine-tuned BioClinicalBERT models achieved near-perfect
performance, with macro F1 scores >=0.998 on the internal test set. External
validation confirmed robustness (macro F1=0.966), outperforming conventional
machine learning, general-domain BERT models, and various decoder-only large
language models. NLP models, particularly fine-tuned clinical variants like
BioClinicalBERT, offer a highly accurate and scalable solution for overdose
death classification from free-text reports. These methods can significantly
accelerate surveillance workflows, overcoming the limitations of manual ICD-10
coding and supporting near real-time detection of emerging substance use
trends.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in accurately extracting sentiment and aspect terms in multimodal datasets, where text and images interact in complex ways.

Method: The model employs dynamic modality weighting and context-adaptive attention to focus on interactions between textual and visual cues, enhancing their complementary contribution to analysis.

Result: AdaptiSent outperformed traditional text-based and multimodal baselines in precision, recall, and F1 scores on Twitter datasets, showcasing its effectiveness in capturing nuanced inter-modal relationships.

Conclusion: AdaptiSent sets a new benchmark for MABSA by improving accuracy and depth in multimodal sentiment and aspect term extraction, especially for complex multimodal data.

Abstract: We introduce AdaptiSent, a new framework for Multimodal Aspect-Based
Sentiment Analysis (MABSA) that uses adaptive cross-modal attention mechanisms
to improve sentiment classification and aspect term extraction from both text
and images. Our model integrates dynamic modality weighting and
context-adaptive attention, enhancing the extraction of sentiment and
aspect-related information by focusing on how textual cues and visual context
interact. We tested our approach against several baselines, including
traditional text-based models and other multimodal methods. Results from
standard Twitter datasets show that AdaptiSent surpasses existing models in
precision, recall, and F1 score, and is particularly effective in identifying
nuanced inter-modal relationships that are crucial for accurate sentiment and
aspect term extraction. This effectiveness comes from the model's ability to
adjust its focus dynamically based on the context's relevance, improving the
depth and accuracy of sentiment analysis across various multimodal data sets.
AdaptiSent sets a new standard for MABSA, significantly outperforming current
methods, especially in understanding complex multimodal information.

TL;DR: The paper examines the use of Large Audio Models (LAMs) as unified evaluation systems for speech, addressing poor correlation with human preferences and system design complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current speech evaluation methods show poor correlation with human preferences and are hard to design for specific audio characteristics.

Method: The study leverages LAMs with a prompt engineering strategy, including audio concatenation and in-context learning, and introduces a multi-aspect ensemble approach for better evaluation.

Result: LAMs achieve up to 0.91 Spearman correlation with human preferences on speech evaluation while maintaining robustness under acoustic noise.

Conclusion: LAM-based evaluation shows promise as a unified framework for diverse audio tasks, though biases like verbosity and positional effects require additional attention.

Abstract: Current speech evaluation suffers from two critical limitations: the need and
difficulty of designing specialized systems targeting individual audio
characteristics, and poor correlation between automatic evaluation methods and
human preferences. This work presents a systematic study of Large Audio Model
(LAM) as a Judge, AudioJudge, investigating whether it can provide a unified
evaluation framework that addresses both challenges. We systematically explore
AudioJudge across audio characteristic detection tasks, including
pronunciation, speaking rate, speaker identification and speech quality, and
system-level human preference simulation for automated benchmarking. We
investigate different prompt engineering strategies, finding that audio
concatenation combined with in-context learning significantly improves
performance across both audio characteristic detection and human preference
simulation tasks. We further introduce a multi-aspect ensemble AudioJudge to
enable general-purpose multi-aspect audio evaluation. This method decomposes
speech assessment into specialized judges for lexical content, speech quality,
and paralinguistic features, achieving up to 0.91 Spearman correlation with
human preferences on our system ranking benchmark. Robustness analysis reveals
that while LAMs maintain strong performance under acoustic noise, they exhibit
significant verbosity and positional biases that require careful mitigation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces FLEXITOKENS, a byte-level LM with a flexible, learnable tokenizer to address inefficiencies caused by rigid subword tokenization during language model adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Language models struggle with adaptation to new data distributions due to rigid subword tokenizers which inefficiently tokenize out-of-distribution domains, unseen languages, or scripts.

Method: FLEXITOKENS employs a learnable tokenizer submodule that predicts boundaries in byte sequences, using a simplified training objective rather than fixed compression rates to enable efficient adaptation.

Result: FLEXITOKENS reduces token over-fragmentation and achieves up to 10% improvements in downstream task performance across diverse multilingual benchmarks.

Conclusion: FLEXITOKENS provides a flexible approach to tokenization, improving language model adaptation efficiency and performance across various tasks and domains.

Abstract: Language models (LMs) are challenging to adapt to new data distributions by
simple finetuning. This is due to the rigidity of their subword tokenizers,
which typically remain unchanged during adaptation. This inflexibility often
leads to inefficient tokenization, causing overfragmentation of
out-of-distribution domains, unseen languages, or scripts. In this work, we
develop byte-level LMs with learnable tokenizers to make tokenization adaptive.
Our models include a submodule that learns to predict boundaries between the
input byte sequence, encoding it into variable-length segments. Existing
tokenizer-free methods train this boundary predictor using an auxiliary loss
that enforces a fixed compression rate across the training corpus, introducing
a new kind of rigidity. We propose FLEXITOKENS, a simplified training objective
that enables significantly greater flexibility during adaptation. Evaluating
across multiple multilingual benchmarks, morphologically diverse tasks, and
domains, we demonstrate that FLEXITOKENS consistently reduces token
over-fragmentation and achieves up to 10\% improvements on downstream task
performance compared to subword and other gradient-based tokenizers. Code and
data for our experiments will be released at

### [32] [TransEvalnia: Reasoning-based Evaluation and Ranking of Translations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12724)
*Richard Sproat,Tianyu Zhao,Llion Jones*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces TransEvalnia, a reasoning-based translation evaluation system that outperforms state-of-the-art methods and aligns well with human ratings. The system also tackles position bias.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for fine-grained and reasoning-based machine translation evaluation that aligns better with human judgments and surpasses limitations in current state-of-the-art methods.

Method: TransEvalnia uses reasoning-driven evaluations, employs specific Multidimensional Quality Metrics (MQM), provides numeric scores across dimensions, and combines these with ranking. It relies on large language models like Claude-3.5-Sonnet and Qwen-2.5-72B-Instruct for its assessments.

Result: TransEvalnia demonstrates superior performance compared to MT-Ranker on English-Japanese and other WMT language pairs. It correlates highly with human assessments and exposes sensitivity to translation order, suggesting remedies for position bias.

Conclusion: TransEvalnia is a robust, reliable, and publicly-available translation evaluation system that combines reasoning with fine-grained metrics, paving the way for improved human-aligned MT evaluation processes.

Abstract: We present TransEvalnia, a prompting-based translation evaluation and ranking
system that uses reasoning in performing its evaluations and ranking. This
system presents fine-grained evaluations based on a subset of the
Multidimensional Quality Metrics (https://themqm.org/), returns an assessment
of which translation it deems the best, and provides numerical scores for the
various dimensions and for the overall translation. We show that TransEvalnia
performs as well as or better than the state-of-the-art MT-Ranker (Moosa et al.
2024) on our own English-Japanese data as well as several language pairs from
various WMT shared tasks. Using Anthropic's Claude-3.5-Sonnet and
Qwen-2.5-72B-Instruct as the evaluation LLMs, we show that the evaluations
returned are deemed highly acceptable to human raters, and that the scores
assigned to the translations by Sonnet, as well as other LLMs, correlate well
with scores assigned by the human raters. We also note the sensitivity of our
system -- as well as MT-Ranker -- to the order in which the translations are
presented, and we propose methods to address this position bias. All data,
including the system's evaluation and reasoning, human assessments, as well as
code is released.

### [33] [Strategy Adaptation in Large Language Model Werewolf Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12732)
*Fuya Nakamori,Yin Jou Huang,Fei Cheng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method for enhancing Werewolf agents by dynamically switching strategies based on game context and player roles, showing improved performance over fixed-strategy agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Werewolf agents lack the ability to adapt to changing game situations as they rely on fixed or implicit strategies.

Method: The proposed method explicitly selects strategies based on the game context and the estimated roles of other players.

Result: The study demonstrates that the strategy-adaptation agents outperform baseline agents with fixed or implicit strategies.

Conclusion: Dynamic strategy adaptation enhances the effectiveness of Werewolf agents in variable game situations.

Abstract: This study proposes a method to improve the performance of Werewolf agents by
switching between predefined strategies based on the attitudes of other players
and the context of conversations. While prior works of Werewolf agents using
prompt engineering have employed methods where effective strategies are
implicitly defined, they cannot adapt to changing situations. In this research,
we propose a method that explicitly selects an appropriate strategy based on
the game context and the estimated roles of other players. We compare the
strategy adaptation Werewolf agents with baseline agents using implicit or
fixed strategies and verify the effectiveness of our proposed method.

### [34] [Logit Arithmetic Elicits Long Reasoning Capabilities Without Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12759)
*Yunxiang Zhang,Muhammad Khalifa,Lechen Zhang,Xin Liu,Ayoung Lee,Xinliang Frederick Zhang,Farima Fatahi Bayat,Lu Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces ThinkLogit, a decoding-time approach using logits arithmetic to enhance long reasoning in large reasoning models without extra training, along with ThinkLogit-DPO for improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate if long reasoning abilities inherent in large reasoning models can be elicited without additional training.

Method: ThinkLogit utilizes logits arithmetic for long reasoning alignment, guided by a smaller model. ThinkLogit-DPO includes preference optimization using sampled reasoning pairs.

Result: ThinkLogit and ThinkLogit-DPO improve pass@1 by 26% and 29%, respectively, when applied to large models guided by smaller ones. Transfers from reinforcement learning add a further 13% improvement.

Conclusion: This decoding-time method offers a computationally efficient way to unlock long reasoning abilities in large models with minimal or no extra training.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) can do complex reasoning via long
chain-of-thought (CoT) involving cognitive strategies such as backtracking and
self-correction. Recent studies suggest that some models inherently possess
these long reasoning abilities, which may be unlocked via extra training. Our
work first investigates whether we can elicit such behavior without any
training. To this end, we propose a decoding-time approach, ThinkLogit, which
utilizes logits arithmetic (Liu et al., 2024) to tune a target large LM for
long reasoning using a substantially smaller model as guider. We then show that
we can further boost performance by training the guider model with preference
optimization over correct/incorrect reasoning pairs sampled from both the
target and guider model -- a setup we refer to as ThinkLogit-DPO. Our
experiments demonstrate that ThinkLogit and ThinkLogit-DPO achieve a relative
improvement in pass@1 by 26% and 29%, respectively, over four mathematical
datasets using the Qwen2.5-32B when guided by R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B -- a model
21x smaller. Lastly, we show that ThinkLogit can transfer long reasoning skills
acquired through reinforcement learning, improving pass@1 by 13% relative
compared to the Qwen2.5-32B base model. Our work presents a
computationally-efficient method to elicit long reasoning in large models with
minimal or no additional training.

### [35] [Synergy: End-to-end Concept Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12769)
*Keli Zheng,Zerong Xie*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces "Synergy," a byte-level language model that learns tokenization and rivals BBPE tokenizers, achieving comparable performance and showcasing tokenizer-free architecture feasibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to explore a tokenizer-free language model to simplify pipelines and enhance robustness and flexibility by eliminating traditional tokenization steps.

Method: Synergy employs a byte-level language model with a learned routing mechanism, and trained to autonomously tokenize bytes. Model evaluation includes comparison with Llama3 and an investigation into positional encoding effects.

Result: Synergy learned to tokenize bytes efficiently, producing fewer concept tokens than BBPE while maintaining performance. It also displayed improved middle-layer abstraction when positional encodings were removed.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that tokenizer-free models like Synergy are viable and promising for creating robust, flexible language model pipelines without compromising performance.

Abstract: In this paper, we present Synergy, a language model that bridges different
levels of abstraction in an end-to-end fashion through a learned routing
mechanism. Focusing on low-level linguistic abstraction, we trained our model
as a byte-level language model. Our model spontaneously learns to tokenize
bytes, producing fewer concept tokens than Byte-level Byte Pair Encoder (BBPE)
tokenizers while keeping comparable performance. By comparing with Llama3, we
observed an advantage of Synergy under the same model scale and training
dataset size. Further studies show that the middle part (the higher abstraction
part) of our model performs better when positional encodings are removed,
suggesting the emergence of position-independent concepts. These findings
demonstrate the feasibility of tokenizer-free architectures, paving the way for
more robust and flexible pipelines.

### [36] [Learning Robust Negation Text Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12782)
*Thinh Hung Truong,Karin Verspoor,Trevor Cohn,Timothy Baldwin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes a strategy to enhance text encoders to better handle negation by utilizing distilled data from large language models and employing contrastive learning for fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Negation is a semantic aspect that standard text encoders struggle to capture, negatively impacting their performance in downstream applications.

Method: The paper uses data distilled from large language models featuring diverse negation patterns and applies contrastive learning techniques to fine-tune a BERT-based model.

Result: The approach significantly improved the negation understanding capabilities of text encoders while retaining competitive performance on general benchmarks. It was also successfully adapted to large language models for improved negation performance.

Conclusion: Enhancing text encoders with this strategy delivers better negation handling without sacrificing general performance, and the method is extendable to large language models for further improvements.

Abstract: Despite rapid adoption of autoregressive large language models, smaller text
encoders still play an important role in text understanding tasks that require
rich contextualized representations. Negation is an important semantic function
that is still not properly captured by such methods, affecting many downstream
applications relying on text embeddings. We propose a strategy to improve
negation robustness of text encoders, by distilling data from large language
models using diverse patterns of negation and hedging. We adopt a standard
contrastive learning strategy to finetune a strong BERT-based model, and
observe large improvement in negation understanding capabilities while
maintaining competitive performance on general benchmarks. In addition, we also
show that our method can be adapted to LLMs, leading to improved performance on
negation benchmarks.

### [37] [Large Language Models' Internal Perception of Symbolic Music](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12808)
*Andrew Shin,Kunitake Kaneko*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper explores how large language models (LLMs) implicitly model symbolic music by generating MIDI files from textual prompts and evaluating their utility in musical tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To examine the extent to which LLMs can represent and generate symbolic music, an area that remains underexplored compared to other symbolic domains.

Method: The authors generate symbolic music data using LLMs based on textual prompts, create a dataset of LLM-generated MIDI files, and train neural networks to perform genre and style classification as well as melody completion.

Result: The study shows that LLMs can infer basic musical structures and temporal relationships from text, but their utility is limited by the absence of explicit musical context.

Conclusion: LLMs exhibit some capability to encode and generate symbolic music patterns, though their limitations highlight the need for more explicit scaffolding in musical contexts.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at modeling relationships between strings
in natural language and have shown promise in extending to other symbolic
domains like coding or mathematics. However, the extent to which they
implicitly model symbolic music remains underexplored. This paper investigates
how LLMs represent musical concepts by generating symbolic music data from
textual prompts describing combinations of genres and styles, and evaluating
their utility through recognition and generation tasks. We produce a dataset of
LLM-generated MIDI files without relying on explicit musical training. We then
train neural networks entirely on this LLM-generated MIDI dataset and perform
genre and style classification as well as melody completion, benchmarking their
performance against established models. Our results demonstrate that LLMs can
infer rudimentary musical structures and temporal relationships from text,
highlighting both their potential to implicitly encode musical patterns and
their limitations due to a lack of explicit musical context, shedding light on
their generative capabilities for symbolic music.

### [38] [Are Knowledge and Reference in Multilingual Language Models Cross-Lingually Consistent?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12838)
*Xi Ai,Mahardika Krisna Ihsani,Min-Yen Kan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper studies cross-lingual consistency in multilingual models using code-mixed coreferential statements and evaluates strategies to improve such consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To examine and address discrepancies in factual knowledge transfer and performance across languages in multilingual models.

Method: Code-mixed coreferential data and interpretability tools were applied to analyze cross-lingual knowledge consistency in multilingual models.

Result: Multilingual models exhibit varying consistency levels influenced by language families and certain layers; code-switching training and alignment objectives improve cross-lingual consistency.

Conclusion: Supervision using cross-lingual alignment and code-switching training enhances multilingual model performance and consistency simultaneously.

Abstract: Cross-lingual consistency should be considered to assess cross-lingual
transferability, maintain the factuality of the model knowledge across
languages, and preserve the parity of language model performance. We are thus
interested in analyzing, evaluating, and interpreting cross-lingual consistency
for factual knowledge. We examine code-mixed coreferential statements conveyed
identical knowledge across languages to study cross-lingual knowledge
consistency. We use some interpretability approaches to analyze the behavior of
a model in cross-lingual contexts, discovering that multilingual models show
different levels of consistency, subject to language families, linguistic
factors, and a bottleneck in cross-lingual consistency on a particular layer.
In addition, we evaluate common strategies aimed at improving multilingual
performance to observe whether these strategies can improve knowledge
consistency at the same time. While knowledge is not cross-lingual consistency
in many cases, code-switching training and cross-lingual word alignment
objectives show the most promising results, emphasizing the noteworthiness of
cross-lingual alignment supervision and code-switching training for both
multilingual performance and cross-lingual consistency enhancement.

### [39] [Making Language Model a Hierarchical Classifier and Generator](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12930)
*Yihong Wang,Zhonglin Jiang,Ningyuan Xi,Yue Zhao,Qingqing Gu,Xiyuan Chen,Hao Wu,Sheng Xu,Hange Zhou,Yong Chen,Luo Ji*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a hierarchical decoder architecture for language models, modifying GPT or LLaMA to allow intermediate layers to also generate text.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study is motivated by the hierarchical thinking ability of humans and explores the possibility of mimicking this in language models.

Method: Intermediate layers of a pretrained language model are adapted by assigning them language heads from the last layer and fine-tuning them for specific tasks.

Result: Experiments show that these intermediate layers can generate meaningful text, achieving state-of-the-art results in hierarchical text-related tasks.

Conclusion: Hierarchical decoders open pathways toward creating a generalized hierarchical reasoning system, including potential pretraining from scratch.

Abstract: Decoder-only language models, such as GPT and LLaMA, generally decode on the
last layer. Motivated by human's hierarchical thinking capability, we propose
that a hierarchical decoder architecture could be built with different layers
decoding texts simultaneously. Due to limited time and computationally
resources, we choose to adapt a pretrained language model into this form of
hierarchical decoder. Language heads of the last layer are copied to different
selected intermediate layers, and fine-tuned with different task inputs. By
thorough experiments, we validate that these selective intermediate layers
could be adapted to speak meaningful and reasonable contents, and this paradigm
of hierarchical decoder can obtain state-of-the-art performances on multiple
tasks such as hierarchical text classification, classification-guided
generation, and hierarchical text generation. This study suggests the
possibility of a generalized hierarchical reasoner, pretraining from scratch.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a method for effectively answering questions about Spanish-language tables by leveraging advancements in LLM-driven code generation.

Method: The solution involves analyzing and understanding table content, selecting relevant columns, generating natural language instructions, converting them into Python code, executing the code, and addressing errors using open-source LLMs and tailored prompts.

Result: The proposed approach achieved 85% accuracy on the IberLEF 2025 PRESTA Task.

Conclusion: Using LLMs for Python code generation and fine-tuned prompts is an effective solution for table-based Q&A tasks in Spanish.

Abstract: This paper presents our approach for the IberLEF 2025 Task PRESTA: Preguntas
y Respuestas sobre Tablas en Espa\~nol (Questions and Answers about Tables in
Spanish). Our solution obtains answers to the questions by implementing Python
code generation with LLMs that is used to filter and process the table. This
solution evolves from the MRT implementation for the Semeval 2025 related task.
The process consists of multiple steps: analyzing and understanding the content
of the table, selecting the useful columns, generating instructions in natural
language, translating these instructions to code, running it, and handling
potential errors or exceptions. These steps use open-source LLMs and
fine-grained optimized prompts for each step. With this approach, we achieved
an accuracy score of 85\% in the task.

*Quentin Goux,Nadira Lammari*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a formal UML-based model for attack scenarios to enhance cybersecurity automation and demonstrates its application in attack analysis and automatic script generation for training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing need for cybersecurity automation due to a dynamic threat landscape and the requirement for formalized input data for processes like attack simulation and analysis.

Method: A formal model is developed using a UML class diagram to describe both the attack context and scenarios.

Result: The model is applied in two use cases: upstream attack analysis and automatic generation of attack scripts for cybersecurity training.

Conclusion: The proposed model helps streamline processes like attack analysis and training simulation through automation, addressing the challenges brought by evolving cybersecurity threats.

Abstract: Organizations face an ever-changing threat landscape. They must continuously
dedicate significant efforts to protect their assets, making their adoption of
increased cybersecurity automation inevitable. However, process automation
requires formalization of input data. Through this paper, we address this need
for processes that use attack scenarios as input. Among these processes, one
can mention both the generation of scripts for attack simulation and training
purposes, as well as the analysis of attacks. Therefore, the paper's main
research contribution is a novel formal model that encompasses the attack's
context description and its scenario. It is abstracted using UML class model.
Once the description of our model done, we will show how it could serve an
upstream attack analysis process. We will show also its use for an automatic
generation of attack scripts in the context of cybersecurity training. These
two uses cases constitute the second contribution of this present research
work.

*Marc Brinner,Sina Zarriess*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SemCSE proposes a method for learning semantic embeddings of scientific texts using LLM-generated summaries and contrastive learning, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for embedding scientific texts often fail to accurately capture semantic similarity, as traditional citation-based approaches do not inherently represent semantic content.

Method: SemCSE employs unsupervised contrastive learning with LLM-generated summaries, training a model to position semantically related texts closer in the embedding space.

Result: The proposed method outperforms other models of its size on the SciRepEval benchmark and shows stronger semantic separation in embeddings.

Conclusion: SemCSE successfully leverages semantic embeddings for scientific texts, offering a significant improvement over citation-based approaches and achieving state-of-the-art results.

Abstract: We introduce SemCSE, an unsupervised method for learning semantic embeddings
of scientific texts. Building on recent advances in contrastive learning for
text embeddings, our approach leverages LLM-generated summaries of scientific
abstracts to train a model that positions semantically related summaries closer
together in the embedding space. This resulting objective ensures that the
model captures the true semantic content of a text, in contrast to traditional
citation-based approaches that do not necessarily reflect semantic similarity.
To validate this, we propose a novel benchmark designed to assess a model's
ability to understand and encode the semantic content of scientific texts,
demonstrating that our method enforces a stronger semantic separation within
the embedding space. Additionally, we evaluate SemCSE on the comprehensive
SciRepEval benchmark for scientific text embeddings, where it achieves
state-of-the-art performance among models of its size, thus highlighting the
benefits of a semantically focused training approach.

*Jaya Caporusso,Matthew Purver,Senja Pollak*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This proposal aims to create a computational framework to identify Self-aspects in text using NLP techniques, supported by an ontology and annotated dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of systematic NLP analysis of the multifaceted concept of the Self, which is important for mental health and cognitive studies.

Method: Develop an ontology and annotated dataset of Self-aspects, apply NLP models including discriminative, generative, and embedding-based approaches, and evaluate against interpretability and efficiency.

Result: Frameworks and models capable of accurately identifying Self-aspects in text will be developed and tested in mental health and phenomenology case studies.

Conclusion: This work will contribute to NLP and interdisciplinary research by enabling a deeper understanding of the Self in language, with applications in mental health and cognitive science.

Abstract: This Ph.D. proposal introduces a plan to develop a computational framework to
identify Self-aspects in text. The Self is a multifaceted construct and it is
reflected in language. While it is described across disciplines like cognitive
science and phenomenology, it remains underexplored in natural language
processing (NLP). Many of the aspects of the Self align with psychological and
other well-researched phenomena (e.g., those related to mental health),
highlighting the need for systematic NLP-based analysis. In line with this, we
plan to introduce an ontology of Self-aspects and a gold-standard annotated
dataset. Using this foundation, we will develop and evaluate conventional
discriminative models, generative large language models, and embedding-based
retrieval approaches against four main criteria: interpretability, ground-truth
adherence, accuracy, and computational efficiency. Top-performing models will
be applied in case studies in mental health and empirical phenomenology.

*Hadi Mohammadi,Tina Shahedi,Pablo Mosteiro,Massimo Poesio,Ayoub Bagheri,Anastasia Giachanou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores annotation variability in sexism detection by studying demographic biases and evaluating Generative AI models as annotators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and mitigate demographic bias in NLP systems for tasks like sexism detection.

Method: Used a Generalized Linear Mixed Model to measure demographic influence on annotation decisions, and evaluated Generative AI models guided by demographic personas.

Result: Demographic factors contributed to only 8% of variance; Generative AI persona prompting degraded alignment with human judgments.

Conclusion: Focusing on content-driven approaches and robust annotations is more effective for fairness than demographically guided personas.

Abstract: Understanding the sources of variability in annotations is crucial for
developing fair NLP systems, especially for tasks like sexism detection where
demographic bias is a concern. This study investigates the extent to which
annotator demographic features influence labeling decisions compared to text
content. Using a Generalized Linear Mixed Model, we quantify this inf luence,
finding that while statistically present, demographic factors account for a
minor fraction ( 8%) of the observed variance, with tweet content being the
dominant factor. We then assess the reliability of Generative AI (GenAI) models
as annotators, specifically evaluating if guiding them with demographic
personas improves alignment with human judgments. Our results indicate that
simplistic persona prompting often fails to enhance, and sometimes degrades,
performance compared to baseline models. Furthermore, explainable AI (XAI)
techniques reveal that model predictions rely heavily on content-specific
tokens related to sexism, rather than correlates of demographic
characteristics. We argue that focusing on content-driven explanations and
robust annotation protocols offers a more reliable path towards fairness than
potentially persona simulation.

*Emma Sharratt,Annelien Smith,Retief Louw,Daleen Klop,Febe de Wet,Herman Kamper*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study uses machine learning to analyze oral narrative features in young Afrikaans- and isiXhosa-speaking children to identify predictors of developmental proficiency and intervention needs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to investigate oral narrative features as predictors of literacy development and to address challenges in assessing narrative proficiency in multilingual, linguistically distinct contexts.

Method: The study applies machine learning techniques to analyze recorded oral narratives from four- and five-year-old children speaking Afrikaans and isiXhosa, focusing on lexical diversity, mean utterance length, articulation rate, and verb usage.

Result: The findings show that lexical diversity and mean utterance length are effective indicators of typical development, while articulation rate is less informative. Specific verb and auxiliary usage are linked to goal-directed storytelling and reduce the likelihood of needing intervention, despite cross-linguistic differences.

Conclusion: Language-specific and shared predictors of oral narrative proficiency were identified, highlighting the potential for improving early assessment approaches in multilingual educational settings.

Abstract: Oral narrative skills are strong predictors of later literacy development.
This study examines the features of oral narratives from children who were
identified by experts as requiring intervention. Using simple machine learning
methods, we analyse recorded stories from four- and five-year-old Afrikaans-
and isiXhosa-speaking children. Consistent with prior research, we identify
lexical diversity (unique words) and length-based features (mean utterance
length) as indicators of typical development, but features like articulation
rate prove less informative. Despite cross-linguistic variation in
part-of-speech patterns, the use of specific verbs and auxiliaries associated
with goal-directed storytelling is correlated with a reduced likelihood of
requiring intervention. Our analysis of two linguistically distinct languages
reveals both language-specific and shared predictors of narrative proficiency,
with implications for early assessment in multilingual contexts.

*Jisoo Lee,Raeyoung Chang,Dongwook Kwon,Harmanpreet Singh,Nikhil Verma*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces GEMMAS, a framework for evaluating multi-agent systems' internal collaboration through graph-based metrics, uncovering inefficiencies overlooked by outcome-only evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of current evaluations of multi-agent systems, which focus solely on final output correctness, ignoring inefficiencies and coordination issues during collaboration.

Method: The authors propose GEMMAS, a graph-based framework that models inter-agent interactions as a directed acyclic graph and introduces two metrics: Information Diversity Score (IDS) and Unnecessary Path Ratio (UPR).

Result: Using GEMMAS, it was found that systems with minimal accuracy differences show significant variations in IDS (12.8%) and UPR (80%), highlighting inefficiencies in collaboration processes.

Conclusion: Outcome-only evaluations are inadequate for multi-agent systems; process-level metrics like IDS and UPR are crucial for designing more interpretable and efficient AI collaborations.

Abstract: Multi-agent systems built on language models have shown strong performance on
collaborative reasoning tasks. However, existing evaluations focus only on the
correctness of the final output, overlooking how inefficient communication and
poor coordination contribute to redundant reasoning and higher computational
costs. We introduce GEMMAS, a graph-based evaluation framework that analyzes
the internal collaboration process by modeling agent interactions as a directed
acyclic graph. To capture collaboration quality, we propose two process-level
metrics: Information Diversity Score (IDS) to measure semantic variation in
inter-agent messages, and Unnecessary Path Ratio (UPR) to quantify redundant
reasoning paths. We evaluate GEMMAS across five benchmarks and highlight
results on GSM8K, where systems with only a 2.1% difference in accuracy differ
by 12.8% in IDS and 80% in UPR, revealing substantial variation in internal
collaboration. These findings demonstrate that outcome-only metrics are
insufficient for evaluating multi-agent performance and highlight the
importance of process-level diagnostics in designing more interpretable and
resource-efficient collaborative AI systems.

TL;DR: The paper develops an automated system to assess preschool children's narrative and comprehension skills in Afrikaans and isiXhosa.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Preschool teachers face challenges in identifying students needing intervention in large classrooms, which is crucial for early literacy development.

Method: The system leverages automatic speech recognition and machine learning models (linear and LLM-based) to analyze and score children's oral narratives.

Result: The LLM-based model is more accurate and comparable to a human expert in flagging children needing intervention, though the simpler linear model is competitive.

Conclusion: This research paves the way for automated tools in classrooms, freeing up teachers to provide tailored support to children.

Abstract: Developing narrative and comprehension skills in early childhood is critical
for later literacy. However, teachers in large preschool classrooms struggle to
accurately identify students who require intervention. We present a system for
automatically assessing oral narratives of preschool children in Afrikaans and
isiXhosa. The system uses automatic speech recognition followed by a machine
learning scoring model to predict narrative and comprehension scores. For
scoring predicted transcripts, we compare a linear model to a large language
model (LLM). The LLM-based system outperforms the linear model in most cases,
but the linear system is competitive despite its simplicity. The LLM-based
system is comparable to a human expert in flagging children who require
intervention. We lay the foundation for automatic oral assessments in
classrooms, giving teachers extra capacity to focus on personalised support for
children's learning.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces CAST, a framework for enhancing task transfer in large language models (LLMs) by steering their activation states, showing improved scalability and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges LLMs face in unseen and data-scarce tasks, as well as the robustness and efficiency issues in cross-task in-context learning.

Method: The CAST framework modifies LLMs' internal activation states by analyzing activation patterns, selecting diverse samples, and utilizing contrastive representations from high-resource tasks to adapt to low-resource ones.

Result: CAST demonstrates improved performance across cross-domain and cross-lingual tasks, surpassing competitive baselines in scalability and computational efficiency.

Conclusion: Activation steering as proposed in CAST is an effective and efficient approach to enhance cross-task knowledge transfer in LLMs without requiring parameter updates or input expansion.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive abilities in leveraging
pretrained knowledge through prompting, but they often struggle with unseen
tasks, particularly in data-scarce scenarios. While cross-task in-context
learning offers a direct solution for transferring knowledge across tasks, it
still faces critical challenges in terms of robustness, scalability, and
efficiency. In this paper, we investigate whether cross-task transfer can be
achieved via latent space steering without parameter updates or input
expansion. Through an analysis of activation patterns in the latent space of
LLMs, we observe that the enhanced activations induced by in-context examples
have consistent patterns across different tasks. Inspired by these findings, we
propose CAST, a novel Cross-task Activation Steering Transfer framework that
enables effective transfer by manipulating the model's internal activation
states. Our approach first selects influential and diverse samples from
high-resource tasks, then utilizes their contrastive representation-enhanced
activations to adapt LLMs to low-resource tasks. Extensive experiments across
both cross-domain and cross-lingual transfer settings show that our method
outperforms competitive baselines and demonstrates superior scalability and
lower computational costs.

### [49] [HATS: Hindi Analogy Test Set for Evaluating Reasoning in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13238)
*Ashray Gupta,Rohan Joseph,Sunny Rai*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study introduces the Hindi Analogy Test Set (HATS) to evaluate large language models' reasoning abilities in Hindi using multiple-choice analogy questions, and proposes a Chain of Thought approach to enhance model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the gap in evaluating reasoning capabilities of large language models in Indic languages, particularly Hindi, since most evaluations focus on English.

Method: The researchers created HATS with 405 analogy questions from Indian government exams and tested multilingual LLMs using various prompting strategies, including a grounded Chain of Thought approach based on cognitive theories of analogical reasoning.

Result: Models performed better with English prompts compared to Hindi, and the Chain of Thought approach notably improved performance on Hindi analogy questions.

Conclusion: The HATS dataset fills a significant resource gap for assessing large language models in Hindi, highlighting the importance of approaches tailored for Indic language reasoning evaluation.

Abstract: Analogies test a model's ability to infer implicit relationships between
concepts, making them a key benchmark for evaluating reasoning capabilities.
While large language models (LLMs) are widely evaluated for reasoning in
English, their abilities in Indic languages remain understudied, limiting our
understanding of whether these models generalize across languages. To address
this gap, we introduce a new Hindi Analogy Test Set (HATS), comprising 405
multiple-choice questions sourced from Indian government exams. We benchmark
state-of-the-art multilingual LLMs using various prompting strategies and
introduce a grounded Chain of Thought approach that leverages cognitive
theories of analogical reasoning. This approach improves model performance on
Hindi analogy questions. Our experiments show that models perform best with
English prompts, irrespective of the prompting strategy. Our test set addresses
the lack of a critical resource to evaluate LLM reasoning capabilities in
Hindi.

### [50] [Automating Steering for Safe Multimodal Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13255)
*Lyucheng Wu,Mengru Wang,Ziwen Xu,Tri Cao,Nay Oo,Bryan Hooi,Shumin Deng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AutoSteer is a modular intervention system developed for improving the inference-time safety of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) against adversarial multimodal inputs, without requiring fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address safety concerns posed by adversarial multimodal inputs in MLLMs, ensuring safer deployment of these powerful systems during inference without compromising their general functionality.

Method: AutoSteer integrates three components: a Safety Awareness Score (SAS) to identify safety-relevant features in model layers, an adaptive safety prober for estimating toxicity risks, and a lightweight Refusal Head to modulate outputs when safety issues arise.

Result: Through experiments on safety benchmarks with LLaVA-OV and Chameleon, AutoSteer achieved significant reductions in Attack Success Rates (ASR) for textual, visual, and cross-modal adversarial threats, while preserving the general reasoning capabilities of the systems.

Conclusion: AutoSteer offers a practical, interpretable, and effective solution for enhancing safety in multimodal AI models, facilitating their safer deployment in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Recent progress in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has unlocked
powerful cross-modal reasoning abilities, but also raised new safety concerns,
particularly when faced with adversarial multimodal inputs. To improve the
safety of MLLMs during inference, we introduce a modular and adaptive
inference-time intervention technology, AutoSteer, without requiring any
fine-tuning of the underlying model. AutoSteer incorporates three core
components: (1) a novel Safety Awareness Score (SAS) that automatically
identifies the most safety-relevant distinctions among the model's internal
layers; (2) an adaptive safety prober trained to estimate the likelihood of
toxic outputs from intermediate representations; and (3) a lightweight Refusal
Head that selectively intervenes to modulate generation when safety risks are
detected. Experiments on LLaVA-OV and Chameleon across diverse safety-critical
benchmarks demonstrate that AutoSteer significantly reduces the Attack Success
Rate (ASR) for textual, visual, and cross-modal threats, while maintaining
general abilities. These findings position AutoSteer as a practical,
interpretable, and effective framework for safer deployment of multimodal AI
systems.

*Jiazheng Li,Hong Lu,Kaiyue Wen,Zaiwen Yang,Jiaxuan Gao,Hongzhou Lin,Yi Wu,Jingzhao Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces QuestA, a Question Augmentation approach for enhancing multi-step reasoning in LLMs using reinforcement learning, achieving state-of-the-art results on math benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of reinforcement learning in improving multi-step reasoning for hard problems in large language models.

Method: QuestA introduces partial solutions during RL training on math reasoning tasks to reduce problem difficulty and provides informative learning signals.

Result: QuestA significantly enhances pass@1 and pass@k metrics on problems, showing improvement over strong open-source models and achieving new state-of-the-art benchmarks.

Conclusion: QuestA demonstrates improved sample efficiency and scalability, providing a practical pathway for advancing reasoning capabilities in RL systems.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a key component in training large
language reasoning models (LLMs). However, recent studies questions its
effectiveness in improving multi-step reasoning-particularly on hard problems.
To address this challenge, we propose a simple yet effective strategy via
Question Augmentation: introduce partial solutions during training to reduce
problem difficulty and provide more informative learning signals. Our method,
QuestA, when applied during RL training on math reasoning tasks, not only
improves pass@1 but also pass@k-particularly on problems where standard RL
struggles to make progress. This enables continual improvement over strong
open-source models such as DeepScaleR and OpenMath Nemotron, further enhancing
their reasoning capabilities. We achieve new state-of-the-art results on math
benchmarks using 1.5B-parameter models: 67.1% (+5.3%) on AIME24, 59.5% (+10.0%)
on AIME25, and 35.5% (+4.0%) on HMMT25. Further, we provide theoretical
explanations that QuestA improves sample efficiency, offering a practical and
generalizable pathway for expanding reasoning capability through RL.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces TalentCLEF 2025, an evaluation campaign for language technologies in Human Capital Management, focusing on job title matching and skill prediction using anonymized labor market data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing influence of natural language technologies in Human Capital Management highlights a need for reliable, unbiased, and publicly benchmarked models to advance applications like talent acquisition and workforce planning.

Method: TalentCLEF 2025 comprises two tasks: multilingual job title matching and job title-based skill prediction. It uses anonymized, annotated datasets reflecting real-world labor market complexity. Evaluations consider monolingual, cross-lingual use cases, and gender bias.

Result: TalentCLEF attracted 76 teams with over 280 submissions. Models utilizing multilingual encoders fine-tuned through contrastive learning performed well, with training strategies influencing performance more than model size.

Conclusion: TalentCLEF establishes a public benchmark for job market-focused NLP, fostering fair, robust, and transferable technologies while emphasizing the importance of training approaches over sheer model size.

Abstract: Advances in natural language processing and large language models are driving
a major transformation in Human Capital Management, with a growing interest in
building smart systems based on language technologies for talent acquisition,
upskilling strategies, and workforce planning. However, the adoption and
progress of these technologies critically depend on the development of reliable
and fair models, properly evaluated on public data and open benchmarks, which
have so far been unavailable in this domain.
  To address this gap, we present TalentCLEF 2025, the first evaluation
campaign focused on skill and job title intelligence. The lab consists of two
tasks: Task A - Multilingual Job Title Matching, covering English, Spanish,
German, and Chinese; and Task B - Job Title-Based Skill Prediction, in English.
Both corpora were built from real job applications, carefully anonymized, and
manually annotated to reflect the complexity and diversity of real-world labor
market data, including linguistic variability and gender-marked expressions.
  The evaluations included monolingual and cross-lingual scenarios and covered
the evaluation of gender bias.
  TalentCLEF attracted 76 registered teams with more than 280 submissions. Most
systems relied on information retrieval techniques built with multilingual
encoder-based models fine-tuned with contrastive learning, and several of them
incorporated large language models for data augmentation or re-ranking. The
results show that the training strategies have a larger effect than the size of
the model alone. TalentCLEF provides the first public benchmark in this field
and encourages the development of robust, fair, and transferable language
technologies for the labor market.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RCPS framework enhances automated media presentation quality through structured narrative planning, adaptive layouts, and iterative optimization, validated by the PREVAL evaluation tool.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses challenges in generating high-quality automated media presentations, such as logical inconsistencies and poor design layouts, aiming to meet professional standards.

Method: The RCPS framework integrates three components: (1) Deep Structured Narrative Planning, (2) Adaptive Layout Generation, and (3) an Iterative Optimization Loop. Additionally, the PREVAL evaluation tool uses multi-dimensional rationale models to assess quality.

Result: Experimental results show that RCPS significantly outperforms baseline methods in Content, Coherence, and Design. PREVAL correlates strongly with human judgments of presentation quality.

Conclusion: RCPS framework effectively enhances the quality of automated presentations, approximating expert-level standards, while PREVAL provides a reliable automated evaluation method.

Abstract: Automated generation of high-quality media presentations is challenging,
requiring robust content extraction, narrative planning, visual design, and
overall quality optimization. Existing methods often produce presentations with
logical inconsistencies and suboptimal layouts, thereby struggling to meet
professional standards. To address these challenges, we introduce RCPS
(Reflective Coherent Presentation Synthesis), a novel framework integrating
three key components: (1) Deep Structured Narrative Planning; (2) Adaptive
Layout Generation; (3) an Iterative Optimization Loop. Additionally, we propose
PREVAL, a preference-based evaluation framework employing rationale-enhanced
multi-dimensional models to assess presentation quality across Content,
Coherence, and Design. Experimental results demonstrate that RCPS significantly
outperforms baseline methods across all quality dimensions, producing
presentations that closely approximate human expert standards. PREVAL shows
strong correlation with human judgments, validating it as a reliable automated
tool for assessing presentation quality.

*Yilun Zhao,Weiyuan Chen,Zhijian Xu,Manasi Patwardhan,Yixin Liu,Chengye Wang,Lovekesh Vig,Arman Cohan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AbGen is introduced as a benchmark to evaluate how well language models can design ablation studies for scientific research, revealing their performance gap from human experts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in evaluating the ability of large language models (LLMs) to design robust ablation studies, which are critical in scientific research.

Method: AbGen, a benchmark with 1,500 expert-annotated examples from NLP papers, was created for evaluating LLMs based on their design of ablation studies. Additionally, AbGen-Eval assesses automated evaluation reliability.

Result: Leading LLMs exhibit significant underperformance compared to humans in ablation study design quality, and existing automated evaluation methods are found unreliable.

Conclusion: The study calls for the development of better LLM-based evaluation systems for complex scientific tasks and sheds light on their present limitations.

Abstract: We introduce AbGen, the first benchmark designed to evaluate the capabilities
of LLMs in designing ablation studies for scientific research. AbGen consists
of 1,500 expert-annotated examples derived from 807 NLP papers. In this
benchmark, LLMs are tasked with generating detailed ablation study designs for
a specified module or process based on the given research context. Our
evaluation of leading LLMs, such as DeepSeek-R1-0528 and o4-mini, highlights a
significant performance gap between these models and human experts in terms of
the importance, faithfulness, and soundness of the ablation study designs.
Moreover, we demonstrate that current automated evaluation methods are not
reliable for our task, as they show a significant discrepancy when compared to
human assessment. To better investigate this, we develop AbGen-Eval, a
meta-evaluation benchmark designed to assess the reliability of commonly used
automated evaluation systems in measuring LLM performance on our task. We
investigate various LLM-as-Judge systems on AbGen-Eval, providing insights for
future research on developing more effective and reliable LLM-based evaluation
systems for complex scientific tasks.

### [55] [HapticCap: A Multimodal Dataset and Task for Understanding User Experience of Vibration Haptic Signals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13318)
*Guimin Hu,Daniel Hershcovich,Hasti Seifi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a dataset and task to connect user descriptions with haptic signals, addressing challenges like limited annotated datasets and model capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Haptic signals are useful for conveying information and enhancing realism, but there are difficulties in designing signals that align with user interpretations and in developing annotated datasets for this purpose.

Method: The authors created HapticCap, a large human-annotated haptic-text dataset with 92,070 pairs and introduced a haptic-caption retrieval task, using supervised contrastive learning with T5 and AST models.

Result: The combination of language model T5 and audio model AST outperformed others in the retrieval task, showing improved capabilities when trained for specific description categories.

Conclusion: HapticCap and the haptic-caption retrieval task advance the field by providing resources and methods to better connect textual descriptions with haptic signals, suggesting category-specific training for optimal performance.

Abstract: Haptic signals, from smartphone vibrations to virtual reality touch feedback,
can effectively convey information and enhance realism, but designing signals
that resonate meaningfully with users is challenging. To facilitate this, we
introduce a multimodal dataset and task, of matching user descriptions to
vibration haptic signals, and highlight two primary challenges: (1) lack of
large haptic vibration datasets annotated with textual descriptions as
collecting haptic descriptions is time-consuming, and (2) limited capability of
existing tasks and models to describe vibration signals in text. To advance
this area, we create HapticCap, the first fully human-annotated
haptic-captioned dataset, containing 92,070 haptic-text pairs for user
descriptions of sensory, emotional, and associative attributes of vibrations.
Based on HapticCap, we propose the haptic-caption retrieval task and present
the results of this task from a supervised contrastive learning framework that
brings together text representations within specific categories and vibrations.
Overall, the combination of language model T5 and audio model AST yields the
best performance in the haptic-caption retrieval task, especially when
separately trained for each description category.

*Amrit Poudel,Tim Weninger*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study examines how search engines and ideologically-motivated queries contribute to biased search results, amplifying ideological divides and information polarization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how search engines and user queries influence biases in search results and their role in shaping public perceptions.

Method: Analyzed outputs of major search engines using a dataset on political and social topics.

Result: Found that search engines prioritize content reflecting biases, with ideological user queries intensifying these biases. Significant differences in source prioritization were noted among search engines.

Conclusion: Search engines amplify ideological narratives, contributing to public perception biases and information polarization.

Abstract: Search engines play a crucial role in shaping public discourse by influencing
how information is accessed and framed. While prior research has extensively
examined various dimensions of search bias -- such as content prioritization,
indexical bias, political polarization, and sources of bias -- an important
question remains underexplored: how do search engines and
ideologically-motivated user queries contribute to bias in search results. This
study analyzes the outputs of major search engines using a dataset of political
and social topics. The findings reveal that search engines not only prioritize
content in ways that reflect underlying biases but also that
ideologically-driven user queries exacerbate these biases, resulting in the
amplification of specific narratives. Moreover, significant differences were
observed across search engines in terms of the sources they prioritize. These
results suggest that search engines may play a pivotal role in shaping public
perceptions by reinforcing ideological divides, thereby contributing to the
broader issue of information polarization.

*Yulu Qin,Dheeraj Varghese,Adam Dahlgren Lindström,Lucia Donatelli,Kanishka Misra,Najoung Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates how vision-and-language (VL) training impacts language models, finding mostly changes in how taxonomic knowledge is deployed rather than alterations in the knowledge itself.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to resolve inconsistencies in prior findings regarding changes in linguistic representations due to VL training, focusing on taxonomic knowledge as a potential domain of significant effect.

Method: The authors compare text-only language models (LMs) with VL-trained models (VLMs) using behavioral and representational analyses, evaluating their performance on a text-based question-answering task regarding taxonomic understanding.

Result: VL-trained models outperform text-only counterparts in deploying taxonomic knowledge in a linguistic task, despite no substantial changes in the underlying taxonomic knowledge itself.

Conclusion: Additional VL training does not alter taxonomic knowledge but enhances how it is utilized in task-specific contexts, even purely textual ones.

Abstract: Does vision-and-language (VL) training change the linguistic representations
of language models in meaningful ways? Most results in the literature have
shown inconsistent or marginal differences, both behaviorally and
representationally. In this work, we start from the hypothesis that the domain
in which VL training could have a significant effect is lexical-conceptual
knowledge, in particular its taxonomic organization. Through comparing minimal
pairs of text-only LMs and their VL-trained counterparts, we first show that
the VL models often outperform their text-only counterparts on a text-only
question-answering task that requires taxonomic understanding of concepts
mentioned in the questions. Using an array of targeted behavioral and
representational analyses, we show that the LMs and VLMs do not differ
significantly in terms of their taxonomic knowledge itself, but they differ in
how they represent questions that contain concepts in a taxonomic relation vs.
a non-taxonomic relation. This implies that the taxonomic knowledge itself does
not change substantially through additional VL training, but VL training does
improve the deployment of this knowledge in the context of a specific task,
even when the presentation of the task is purely linguistic.

*Zhouqi Hua,Wenwei Zhang,Chengqi Lyu,Yuzhe Gu,Songyang Gao,Kuikun Liu,Kai Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes TAIL (Turing MAchine Imitation Learning) to enhance large language models' (LLMs) ability to solve longer sequences by mimicking Turing Machine processes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the challenge of length generalization for Transformers-based LLMs, aiming for a general solution beyond task-specific approaches in reasoning problems solvable by algorithms.

Method: TAIL synthesizes chain-of-thought (CoT) data mimicking a Turing Machine's execution process. It uses atomic state expansion to prevent shortcut learning and explicit memory mechanisms to improve long-range data handling.

Result: TAIL significantly enhances Qwen2.5-7B's length generalization ability across 18 reasoning tasks in 8 algorithm classes using synthetic data, surpassing existing methods.

Conclusion: Turing Machine principles, not merely reasoning styles, are essential for length generalization in LLMs. TAIL introduces reproducible read-and-write dynamics in attention layers, offering a promising direction for learning reasoning from synthetic data.

Abstract: Length generalization, the ability to solve problems of longer sequences than
those observed during training, poses a core challenge of Transformer-based
large language models (LLM). Although existing studies have predominantly
focused on data-driven approaches for arithmetic operations and symbolic
manipulation tasks, these approaches tend to be task-specific with limited
overall performance. To pursue a more general solution, this paper focuses on a
broader case of reasoning problems that are computable, i.e., problems that
algorithms can solve, thus can be solved by the Turing Machine. From this
perspective, this paper proposes Turing MAchine Imitation Learning (TAIL) to
improve the length generalization ability of LLMs. TAIL synthesizes
chain-of-thoughts (CoT) data that imitate the execution process of a Turing
Machine by computer programs, which linearly expands the reasoning steps into
atomic states to alleviate shortcut learning and explicit memory fetch
mechanism to reduce the difficulties of dynamic and long-range data access in
elementary operations. To validate the reliability and universality of TAIL, we
construct a challenging synthetic dataset covering 8 classes of algorithms and
18 tasks. Without bells and whistles, TAIL significantly improves the length
generalization ability as well as the performance of Qwen2.5-7B on various
tasks using only synthetic data, surpassing previous methods and DeepSeek-R1.
The experimental results reveal that the key concepts in the Turing Machine,
instead of the thinking styles, are indispensable for TAIL for length
generalization, through which the model exhibits read-and-write behaviors
consistent with the properties of the Turing Machine in their attention layers.
This work provides a promising direction for future research in the learning of
LLM reasoning from synthetic data.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This survey introduces Context Engineering, categorizing its foundational components and advanced implementations while identifying gaps in Large Language Models' capability to generate sophisticated outputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to establish Context Engineering as a formal discipline that systematically optimizes the contextual information used by LLMs, addressing inefficiencies in current prompt design and system development.

Method: The survey reviews over 1,300 research papers and provides a taxonomy of Context Engineering by examining its core components (retrieval, generation, processing, management) and architectural implementations (RAG, memory systems, multi-agent systems).

Result: The survey highlights a significant asymmetry: although LLMs excel at processing complex contexts due to advanced techniques, they struggle with generating equally sophisticated long-form outputs.

Conclusion: The work provides a roadmap for advancing context-aware AI and identifies improving generative capabilities of LLMs as a priority for future research.

Abstract: The performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) is fundamentally determined
by the contextual information provided during inference. This survey introduces
Context Engineering, a formal discipline that transcends simple prompt design
to encompass the systematic optimization of information payloads for LLMs. We
present a comprehensive taxonomy decomposing Context Engineering into its
foundational components and the sophisticated implementations that integrate
them into intelligent systems. We first examine the foundational components:
context retrieval and generation, context processing and context management. We
then explore how these components are architecturally integrated to create
sophisticated system implementations: retrieval-augmented generation (RAG),
memory systems and tool-integrated reasoning, and multi-agent systems. Through
this systematic analysis of over 1300 research papers, our survey not only
establishes a technical roadmap for the field but also reveals a critical
research gap: a fundamental asymmetry exists between model capabilities. While
current models, augmented by advanced context engineering, demonstrate
remarkable proficiency in understanding complex contexts, they exhibit
pronounced limitations in generating equally sophisticated, long-form outputs.
Addressing this gap is a defining priority for future research. Ultimately,
this survey provides a unified framework for both researchers and engineers
advancing context-aware AI.

*Tyler Loakman,William Thorne,Chenghua Lin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates Large Language Models' (LLMs) ability to explain different humor types, finding limitations in their performance beyond simple joke forms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether LLMs' capability to explain humor depends on the complexity and type of the humor, addressing the narrow focus of previous research on simple puns.

Method: The authors curated a dataset of 600 jokes spanning 4 types, with manually written explanations, and evaluated the zero-shot abilities of various LLMs to explain the jokes.

Result: None of the tested models could reliably explain a broad range of joke types, highlighting that LLMs struggle with more complex humor forms requiring world knowledge and reasoning.

Conclusion: The research exposes significant challenges and limitations in LLMs' abilities to comprehensively understand and explain diverse humor types, suggesting a need for broader computational humor studies.

Abstract: Humour, as a complex language form, is derived from myriad aspects of life,
whilst existing work on computational humour has focussed almost exclusively on
short pun-based jokes. In this work, we investigate whether the ability of
Large Language Models (LLMs) to explain humour depends on the particular humour
form. We compare models on simple puns and more complex topical humour that
requires knowledge of real-world entities and events. In doing so, we curate a
dataset of 600 jokes split across 4 joke types and manually write high-quality
explanations. These jokes include heterographic and homographic puns,
contemporary internet humour, and topical jokes, where understanding relies on
reasoning beyond "common sense", rooted instead in world knowledge regarding
news events and pop culture. Using this dataset, we compare the zero-shot
abilities of a range of LLMs to accurately and comprehensively explain jokes of
different types, identifying key research gaps in the task of humour
explanation. We find that none of the tested models (inc. reasoning models) are
capable of reliably generating adequate explanations of all joke types, further
highlighting the narrow focus of most works in computational humour on overly
simple joke forms.

TL;DR: EaGERS is a training-free and model-agnostic method that improves document question answering (DocVQA) by generating natural language explanations and grounding them spatially for enhanced transparency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for transparency, interpretability, and reproducibility in document question answering systems without requiring additional training or model fine-tuning.

Method: EaGERS generates rationales using a vision-language model, grounds these rationales spatially using multimodal embedding similarity, and restricts response generation to relevant image regions using a masked image.

Result: Experiments on the DocVQA dataset show that EaGERS outperforms the base model in terms of accuracy and similarity metrics, while also improving transparency and reproducibility.

Conclusion: EaGERS provides an effective, interpretable, and reproducible approach to improving performance in DocVQA tasks, eliminating the need for additional training or fine-tuning.

Abstract: We introduce EaGERS, a fully training-free and model-agnostic pipeline that
(1) generates natural language rationales via a vision language model, (2)
grounds these rationales to spatial sub-regions by computing multimodal
embedding similarities over a configurable grid with majority voting, and (3)
restricts the generation of responses only from the relevant regions selected
in the masked image. Experiments on the DocVQA dataset demonstrate that our
best configuration not only outperforms the base model on exact match accuracy
and Average Normalized Levenshtein Similarity metrics but also enhances
transparency and reproducibility in DocVQA without additional model
fine-tuning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MindJourney enhances VLMs with 3D spatial reasoning by integrating a video diffusion-based world model, observing an 8% boost in performance on benchmarks like SAT.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-language models (VLMs) struggle with 3D spatial reasoning, such as predicting scene views after egocentric motion, due to their reliance on 2D image perception.

Method: MindJourney integrates VLMs with a controllable world model using video diffusion, allowing iterative camera trajectory planning and multi-view environment synthesis for improved reasoning.

Result: Without fine-tuning, MindJourney achieved an 8% performance improvement on the SAT benchmark and outperformed test-time inference methods trained via reinforcement learning.

Conclusion: MindJourney illustrates that coupling VLMs with world models at test-time is an effective, plug-and-play approach for advancing 3D reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Spatial reasoning in 3D space is central to human cognition and indispensable
for embodied tasks such as navigation and manipulation. However,
state-of-the-art vision-language models (VLMs) struggle frequently with tasks
as simple as anticipating how a scene will look after an egocentric motion:
they perceive 2D images but lack an internal model of 3D dynamics. We therefore
propose MindJourney, a test-time scaling framework that grants a VLM with this
missing capability by coupling it to a controllable world model based on video
diffusion. The VLM iteratively sketches a concise camera trajectory, while the
world model synthesizes the corresponding view at each step. The VLM then
reasons over this multi-view evidence gathered during the interactive
exploration. Without any fine-tuning, our MindJourney achieves over an average
8% performance boost on the representative spatial reasoning benchmark SAT,
showing that pairing VLMs with world models for test-time scaling offers a
simple, plug-and-play route to robust 3D reasoning. Meanwhile, our method also
improves upon the test-time inference VLMs trained through reinforcement
learning, which demonstrates the potential of our method that utilizes world
models for test-time scaling.

Method: The approach embeds visual parameter space into a pre-trained Large Language Model (LLM) using delta tuning, introduces Mono-InternVL, and enhances it with Endogenous Visual Pre-training (EViP and EViP++).

Result: Mono-InternVL outperforms existing MLLMs on 12 out of 15 benchmarks and significantly reduces latency during inference without compromising multimodal performance.

Conclusion: Mono-InternVL and Mono-InternVL-1.5 successfully tackle optimization and data cost challenges, setting competitive benchmarks in multimodal tasks with reduced computational overhead.

Abstract: This paper focuses on monolithic Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs),
which integrate visual encoding and language decoding into a single model.
Existing structures and pre-training strategies for monolithic MLLMs often
suffer from unstable optimization and catastrophic forgetting. To address these
challenges, our key idea is to embed a new visual parameter space into a
pre-trained LLM, enabling stable learning of visual knowledge from noisy data
via delta tuning. Based on this principle, we first introduce Mono-InternVL, an
advanced monolithic MLLM that incorporates a set of visual experts through a
multimodal mixture-of-experts architecture. In addition, we design an
innovative Endogenous Visual Pre-training (EViP) for Mono-InternVL to maximize
its visual capabilities via progressive learning. Mono-InternVL achieves
competitive performance against existing MLLMs but also leads to relatively
expensive data cost. Therefore, we further present Mono-InternVL-1.5, a cheaper
and stronger monolithic MLLM equipped with an improved EViP (EViP++). EViP++
introduces additional visual attention experts to Mono-InternVL-1.5 and
re-organizes the pre-training process in an efficient manner. During inference,
it includes a fused CUDA kernel to speed up its MoE operations. With these
designs, Mono-InternVL-1.5 significantly reduces training and inference costs,
while still maintaining competitive performance with Mono-InternVL. To evaluate
our approach, we conduct extensive experiments across 15 benchmarks. Results
demonstrate that Mono-InternVL outperforms existing monolithic MLLMs on 12 out
of 15 benchmarks, e.g., +114-point improvement over Emu3 on OCRBench. Compared
to its modular counterpart, i.e., InternVL-1.5, Mono-InternVL-1.5 achieves
similar multimodal performance while reducing first-token latency by up to 69%.

*Judy Long,Tao Liu,Sean Alexander Woznicki,Miljana Marković,Oskar Marko,Molly Sears*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study reviews pixel-wise crop mapping workflows, including conventional supervised learning and transfer learning techniques, with key findings on preprocessing methods, model performance, and transfer learning adaptability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve crop mapping accuracy and adaptability by systematically evaluating workflows, given the increasing reliance on remote sensing imagery for agricultural insights.

Method: Systematic experiments compared preprocessing techniques and classification models, evaluated training sample sizes and variable combinations, and assessed transfer learning across varied domain shifts using Landsat 8 data and labeled samples.

Result: Fine-scale interval preprocessing with Transformer models yielded top performance, while RF models excelled in speed and adaptability. Transfer learning proved effective, especially under constraints like labeled sample availability.

Conclusion: Workflow choice should align with data availability; supervised learning excels with sufficient labeled samples, whereas transfer learning is viable for smaller sample sizes and domain shift scenarios.

Abstract: Crop mapping involves identifying and classifying crop types using spatial
data, primarily derived from remote sensing imagery. This study presents the
first comprehensive review of large-scale, pixel-wise crop mapping workflows,
encompassing both conventional supervised methods and emerging transfer
learning approaches. To identify the optimal supervised crop mapping workflows,
we conducted systematic experiments, comparing six widely adopted satellite
image-based preprocessing methods, alongside eleven supervised pixel-wise
classification models. Additionally, we assessed the synergistic impact of
varied training sample sizes and variable combinations. Moreover, we identified
optimal transfer learning techniques for different magnitudes of domain shift.
The evaluation of best methods was conducted across five diverse agricultural
sites. Landsat 8 served as the primary satellite data source. Labels come from
CDL trusted pixels and field surveys.
  Our findings reveal three key insights. First, fine-scale interval
preprocessing paired with Transformer models consistently delivered optimal
performance for both supervised and transferable workflows. RF offered rapid
training and competitive performance in conventional supervised learning and
direct transfer to similar domains. Second, transfer learning techniques
enhanced workflow adaptability, with UDA being effective for homogeneous crop
classes while fine-tuning remains robust across diverse scenarios. Finally,
workflow choice depends heavily on the availability of labeled samples. With a
sufficient sample size, supervised training typically delivers more accurate
and generalizable results. Below a certain threshold, transfer learning that
matches the level of domain shift is a viable alternative to achieve crop
mapping. Repository:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the lack of publicly available eye-tracking datasets and the complexity of analyzing 3D medical imaging data, hindering the advancement of computer-aided diagnosis systems.

Method: A novel 3D scanpath predictor, CT-Searcher, was developed using a new pipeline that converts 2D gaze data into 3D data for pretraining. The model was evaluated qualitatively and quantitatively on CT-ScanGaze.

Result: The proposed CT-Searcher demonstrated its effectiveness in predicting radiologist-like 3D eye movements and set a foundation for assessing 3D scanpath predictions in medical imaging.

Conclusion: The introduction of CT-ScanGaze and CT-Searcher marks significant strides in understanding and replicating radiologist eye movement in CT reading, potentially improving computer-aided diagnosis systems.

Abstract: Understanding radiologists' eye movement during Computed Tomography (CT)
reading is crucial for developing effective interpretable computer-aided
diagnosis systems. However, CT research in this area has been limited by the
lack of publicly available eye-tracking datasets and the three-dimensional
complexity of CT volumes. To address these challenges, we present the first
publicly available eye gaze dataset on CT, called CT-ScanGaze. Then, we
introduce CT-Searcher, a novel 3D scanpath predictor designed specifically to
process CT volumes and generate radiologist-like 3D fixation sequences,
overcoming the limitations of current scanpath predictors that only handle 2D
inputs. Since deep learning models benefit from a pretraining step, we develop
a pipeline that converts existing 2D gaze datasets into 3D gaze data to
pretrain CT-Searcher. Through both qualitative and quantitative evaluations on
CT-ScanGaze, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and provide a
comprehensive assessment framework for 3D scanpath prediction in medical
imaging.

*Said Ohamouddou,Abdellatif El Afia,Hanaa El Afia,Raddouane Chiheb*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MS-DGCNN++ addresses the challenges of tree species classification from LiDAR data by incorporating multiscale hierarchical fusion, achieving state-of-the-art results in both tree classification and general 3D object recognition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods struggle to effectively classify tree species in complex forest environments due to the inability to capture relationships between hierarchical scales of tree structures, necessitating a novel approach.

Method: MS-DGCNN++ introduces a hierarchical framework that uses semantically meaningful feature extraction at three distinct scales - local, branch, and canopy - and employs cross-scale information propagation for enhanced classification.

Result: The proposed model achieved 94.96% accuracy on the STPCTLS dataset, 67.25% on FOR-species20K, 93.15% on ModelNet40, and 94.05% on ModelNet10, outperforming existing methods while being resource-efficient.

Conclusion: MS-DGCNN++ is an effective and resource-efficient approach for tree species classification and 3D object recognition, making it suitable for various point cloud applications beyond tree categorization.

Abstract: Tree species classification from terrestrial LiDAR point clouds is
challenging because of the complex multi-scale geometric structures in forest
environments. Existing approaches using multi-scale dynamic graph convolutional
neural networks (MS-DGCNN) employ parallel multi-scale processing, which fails
to capture the semantic relationships between the hierarchical levels of the
tree architecture. We present MS-DGCNN++, a hierarchical multiscale fusion
dynamic graph convolutional network that uses semantically meaningful feature
extraction at local, branch, and canopy scales with cross-scale information
propagation. Our method employs scale-specific feature engineering, including
standard geometric features for the local scale, normalized relative vectors
for the branch scale, and distance information for the canopy scale. This
hierarchical approach replaces uniform parallel processing with semantically
differentiated representations that are aligned with the natural tree
structure. Under the same proposed tree species data augmentation strategy for
all experiments, MS-DGCNN++ achieved an accuracy of 94.96 \% on STPCTLS,
outperforming DGCNN, MS-DGCNN, and the state-of-the-art model PPT. On
FOR-species20K, it achieves 67.25\% accuracy (6.1\% improvement compared to
MS-DGCNN). For standard 3D object recognition, our method outperformed DGCNN
and MS-DGCNN with overall accuracies of 93.15\% on ModelNet40 and 94.05\% on
ModelNet10. With lower parameters and reduced complexity compared to
state-of-the-art transformer approaches, our method is suitable for
resource-constrained applications while maintaining a competitive accuracy.
Beyond tree classification, the method generalizes to standard 3D object
recognition, establishing it as a versatile solution for diverse point cloud
processing applications. The implementation code is publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research addresses the challenge of limited annotated datasets for action anticipation in sports scenarios, specifically soccer penalty kicks.

Method: The paper employs a deep learning classifier combining HAR-based feature embeddings and contextual metadata, tested on a dataset with twenty-two backbone models across seven architecture families.

Result: The proposed methodology achieves up to 63.9% accuracy in predicting the shot direction, surpassing the performance of real goalkeepers.

Conclusion: The findings highlight the dataset's utility for anticipatory action recognition and affirm the model's capability for sports predictive tasks.

Abstract: Action anticipation has become a prominent topic in Human Action Recognition
(HAR). However, its application to real-world sports scenarios remains limited
by the availability of suitable annotated datasets. This work presents a novel
dataset of manually annotated soccer penalty kicks to predict shot direction
based on pre-kick player movements. We propose a deep learning classifier to
benchmark this dataset that integrates HAR-based feature embeddings with
contextual metadata. We evaluate twenty-two backbone models across seven
architecture families (MViTv2, MViTv1, SlowFast, Slow, X3D, I3D, C2D),
achieving up to 63.9% accuracy in predicting shot direction (left or right),
outperforming the real goalkeepers' decisions. These results demonstrate the
dataset's value for anticipatory action recognition and validate our model's
potential as a generalizable approach for sports-based predictive tasks.

*Sandipan Sarma,Agney Talwarr,Arijit Sur*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel HOID framework called Funnel-HOI to address long-tail distribution issues in human-object interaction detection using a top-down approach and novel co-attention mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the long-tail distribution problem in HOID and enhance zero-shot learning capabilities, as labeled data for exponential object-action combinations is limited.

Method: The method involves developing a top-down framework, Funnel-HOI, where well-defined objects are first detected and then associated with abstract actions using an asymmetric co-attention mechanism and a novel loss function.

Result: Extensive experiments on HICO-DET and V-COCO datasets show state-of-the-art performance, with up to 12.4% improvement for unseen HOI categories and 8.4% for rare categories.

Conclusion: Funnel-HOI effectively leverages HOI-specific cues during encoding, demonstrating superior performance in zero-shot and fully-supervised HOID settings by addressing limitations in existing methods.

Abstract: Human-object interaction detection (HOID) refers to localizing interactive
human-object pairs in images and identifying the interactions. Since there
could be an exponential number of object-action combinations, labeled data is
limited - leading to a long-tail distribution problem. Recently, zero-shot
learning emerged as a solution, with end-to-end transformer-based object
detectors adapted for HOID becoming successful frameworks. However, their
primary focus is designing improved decoders for learning entangled or
disentangled interpretations of interactions. We advocate that HOI-specific
cues must be anticipated at the encoder stage itself to obtain a stronger scene
interpretation. Consequently, we build a top-down framework named Funnel-HOI
inspired by the human tendency to grasp well-defined concepts first and then
associate them with abstract concepts during scene understanding. We first
probe an image for the presence of objects (well-defined concepts) and then
probe for actions (abstract concepts) associated with them. A novel asymmetric
co-attention mechanism mines these cues utilizing multimodal information
(incorporating zero-shot capabilities) and yields stronger interaction
representations at the encoder level. Furthermore, a novel loss is devised that
considers objectaction relatedness and regulates misclassification penalty
better than existing loss functions for guiding the interaction classifier.
Extensive experiments on the HICO-DET and V-COCO datasets across
fully-supervised and six zero-shot settings reveal our state-of-the-art
performance, with up to 12.4% and 8.4% gains for unseen and rare HOI
categories, respectively.

*Kaihua Chen,Tarasha Khurana,Deva Ramanan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CogNVS is a pipeline for synthesizing dynamic scenes from monocular videos. It mixes 3D reconstruction and 2D video diffusion for improved geometry and detail.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior methods rely either on expensive test-time optimizations or struggle with maintaining geometry in feed-forward training. This paper aims for an efficient solution for dynamic scene synthesis.

Method: A two-step approach: reconstructing 3D scene geometry for covisible regions and using a 2D video inpainting diffusion model (CogNVS) for hidden pixels. CogNVS is trained self-supervised on large in-the-wild video datasets and employs zero-shot adaptation to new videos.

Result: Empirical results demonstrate that CogNVS outperforms most prior methods in generating novel views of dynamic scenes from monocular videos.

Conclusion: CogNVS is a novel and effective method for monocular-video-based dynamic scene synthesis, balancing efficiency with performance.

Abstract: We explore novel-view synthesis for dynamic scenes from monocular videos.
Prior approaches rely on costly test-time optimization of 4D representations or
do not preserve scene geometry when trained in a feed-forward manner. Our
approach is based on three key insights: (1) covisible pixels (that are visible
in both the input and target views) can be rendered by first reconstructing the
dynamic 3D scene and rendering the reconstruction from the novel-views and (2)
hidden pixels in novel views can be "inpainted" with feed-forward 2D video
diffusion models. Notably, our video inpainting diffusion model (CogNVS) can be
self-supervised from 2D videos, allowing us to train it on a large corpus of
in-the-wild videos. This in turn allows for (3) CogNVS to be applied zero-shot
to novel test videos via test-time finetuning. We empirically verify that
CogNVS outperforms almost all prior art for novel-view synthesis of dynamic
scenes from monocular videos.

*Inamullah,Ernesto Elias Vidal Rosas,Imran Razzak,Shoaib Jameel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents an innovative framework linking retinal microvascular traits with serum lipidomic profiles to identify early cardiovascular disease biomarkers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is the need to improve early detection methods for cardiovascular disease, which remains the leading global cause of mortality.

Method: The study used deep learning-based image analysis for retinal phenotyping and UHPLC ESI HRMS for lipidomic profiling, followed by a large-scale, covariate-adjusted correlation analysis.

Result: Strong correlations were observed between retinal vascular traits like artery width and lipid subclasses such as TAGs, DAGs, and Cers, suggesting a link between microvascular remodeling and metabolic stress.

Conclusion: The integration of retinal imaging and lipid profiling provides insights into early CVD pathogenesis and paves the way for non-invasive, personalized biomarkers for improved cardiovascular care.

Abstract: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the leading global cause of mortality,
yet current risk stratification methods often fail to detect early, subclinical
changes. Previous studies have generally not integrated retinal
microvasculature characteristics with comprehensive serum lipidomic profiles as
potential indicators of CVD risk. In this study, an innovative imaging omics
framework was introduced, combining retinal microvascular traits derived
through deep learning based image processing with serum lipidomic data to
highlight asymptomatic biomarkers of cardiovascular risk beyond the
conventional lipid panel. This represents the first large scale, covariate
adjusted and stratified correlation analysis conducted in a healthy population,
which is essential for identifying early indicators of disease. Retinal
phenotypes were quantified using automated image analysis tools, while serum
lipid profiling was performed by Ultra High Performance Liquid Chromatography
Electrospray ionization High resolution mass spectrometry (UHPLC ESI HRMS).
Strong, age- and sex-independent correlations were established, particularly
between average artery width, vessel density, and lipid subclasses such as
triacylglycerols (TAGs), diacylglycerols (DAGs), and ceramides (Cers). These
associations suggest a converging mechanism of microvascular remodeling under
metabolic stress. By linking detailed
  vascular structural phenotypes to specific lipid species, this study fills a
critical gap in the understanding of early CVD pathogenesis. This integration
not only offers a novel perspective on microvascular metabolic associations but
also presents a significant opportunity for the identification of robust,
non-invasive biomarkers. Ultimately, these findings may support improved early
detection, targeted prevention, and personalized approaches in cardiovascular
healthcare.

Result: FORTRESS achieves 91% parameter reduction, 91% computational complexity reduction, and 3x inference speed improvement while maintaining state-of-the-art segmentation (F1-score 0.771, mean IoU 0.677).

Conclusion: The FORTRESS architecture establishes itself as a highly efficient and accurate solution for defect segmentation in civil infrastructure, particularly suitable for environments with limited computational resources.

Abstract: Automated structural defect segmentation in civil infrastructure faces a
critical challenge: achieving high accuracy while maintaining computational
efficiency for real-time deployment. This paper presents FORTRESS
(Function-composition Optimized Real-Time Resilient Structural Segmentation), a
new architecture that balances accuracy and speed by using a special method
that combines depthwise separable convolutions with adaptive Kolmogorov-Arnold
Network integration. FORTRESS incorporates three key innovations: a systematic
depthwise separable convolution framework achieving a 3.6x parameter reduction
per layer, adaptive TiKAN integration that selectively applies function
composition transformations only when computationally beneficial, and
multi-scale attention fusion combining spatial, channel, and KAN-enhanced
features across decoder levels. The architecture achieves remarkable efficiency
gains with 91% parameter reduction (31M to 2.9M), 91% computational complexity
reduction (13.7 to 1.17 GFLOPs), and 3x inference speed improvement while
delivering superior segmentation performance. Evaluation on benchmark
infrastructure datasets demonstrates state-of-the-art results with an F1- score
of 0.771 and a mean IoU of 0.677, significantly outperforming existing methods
including U-Net, SA-UNet, and U- KAN. The dual optimization strategy proves
essential for optimal performance, establishing FORTRESS as a robust solution
for practical structural defect segmentation in resource-constrained

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a lack of neural parametric models tailored for 3D plant leaves, which are crucial for sectors like agriculture and computer graphics. Unlike human or animal models, leaves present unique challenges due to their shape diversity and flexibility.

Method: The proposed framework, NeuraLeaf, separates leaves' geometry into 2D base shapes and 3D flexible deformations, leveraging existing 2D datasets and introducing a new dataset (DeformLeaf). A skeleton-free skinning model is also utilized for the 3D deformations.

Result: NeuraLeaf demonstrates its ability to generate diverse and accurate leaf shapes and deformations, effectively fitting 3D observational data such as depth maps and point clouds.

Conclusion: NeuraLeaf successfully overcomes the challenges of 3D leaf modeling by combining disentangled geometry, learning from 2D and 3D data, and a novel skinning approach. The publicly available dataset and code contribute to research advancements.

Abstract: We develop a neural parametric model for 3D leaves for plant modeling and
reconstruction that are essential for agriculture and computer graphics. While
neural parametric models are actively studied for humans and animals, plant
leaves present unique challenges due to their diverse shapes and flexible
deformation. To this problem, we introduce a neural parametric model for
leaves, NeuraLeaf. Capitalizing on the fact that flattened leaf shapes can be
approximated as a 2D plane, NeuraLeaf disentangles the leaves' geometry into
their 2D base shapes and 3D deformations. This representation allows learning
from rich sources of 2D leaf image datasets for the base shapes, and also has
the advantage of simultaneously learning textures aligned with the geometry. To
model the 3D deformation, we propose a novel skeleton-free skinning model and
create a newly captured 3D leaf dataset called DeformLeaf. We show that
NeuraLeaf successfully generates a wide range of leaf shapes with deformation,
resulting in accurate model fitting to 3D observations like depth maps and
point clouds. Our implementation and dataset are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video hair transfer faces challenges in achieving temporal consistency, spatial accuracy, and dynamic adaptability.

Method: Proposed 'Anchor Frame + Animation' framework integrates an Image Hair Transfer module and Multi-Scale Gated SPADE Decoder for consistency and blending.

Result: HairShifter outperforms existing methods, showing superior visual quality, smoothness, and scalability in video hairstyle transfer.

Conclusion: HairShifter provides seamless video hair transfer and could serve as a strong foundation for future advancements in the field.

Abstract: Hair transfer is increasingly valuable across domains such as social media,
gaming, advertising, and entertainment. While significant progress has been
made in single-image hair transfer, video-based hair transfer remains
challenging due to the need for temporal consistency, spatial fidelity, and
dynamic adaptability. In this work, we propose HairShifter, a novel "Anchor
Frame + Animation" framework that unifies high-quality image hair transfer with
smooth and coherent video animation. At its core, HairShifter integrates a
Image Hair Transfer (IHT) module for precise per-frame transformation and a
Multi-Scale Gated SPADE Decoder to ensure seamless spatial blending and
temporal coherence. Our method maintains hairstyle fidelity across frames while
preserving non-hair regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HairShifter
achieves state-of-the-art performance in video hairstyle transfer, combining
superior visual quality, temporal consistency, and scalability. The code will
be publicly available. We believe this work will open new avenues for
video-based hairstyle transfer and establish a robust baseline in this field.

TL;DR: The paper introduces "Mamba Snake," an innovative deep snake framework for Unified Medical Image Segmentation (UMIS) that effectively models anatomical relationships and achieves superior accuracy compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the challenges in UMIS stemming from multi-scale structural heterogeneity and anatomical modeling deficiencies in conventional pixel-based approaches.

Method: The proposed Mamba Snake uses hierarchical state space modeling, a specialized Mamba Evolution Block (MEB) for contour refinement, energy map shape priors for robustness, and a dual-classification mechanism for better detection and segmentation.

Result: Mamba Snake achieves an average Dice improvement of 3% over state-of-the-art medical image segmentation methods across evaluations conducted on five clinical datasets.

Conclusion: Mamba Snake successfully enhances UMIS by integrating anatomical insights and advanced modeling techniques, proving its effectiveness in handling complex morphologies and inter-organ relationships.

Abstract: Unified Medical Image Segmentation (UMIS) is critical for comprehensive
anatomical assessment but faces challenges due to multi-scale structural
heterogeneity. Conventional pixel-based approaches, lacking object-level
anatomical insight and inter-organ relational modeling, struggle with
morphological complexity and feature conflicts, limiting their efficacy in
UMIS. We propose Mamba Snake, a novel deep snake framework enhanced by state
space modeling for UMIS. Mamba Snake frames multi-contour evolution as a
hierarchical state space atlas, effectively modeling macroscopic inter-organ
topological relationships and microscopic contour refinements. We introduce a
snake-specific vision state space module, the Mamba Evolution Block (MEB),
which leverages effective spatiotemporal information aggregation for adaptive
refinement of complex morphologies. Energy map shape priors further ensure
robust long-range contour evolution in heterogeneous data. Additionally, a
dual-classification synergy mechanism is incorporated to concurrently optimize
detection and segmentation, mitigating under-segmentation of microstructures in
UMIS. Extensive evaluations across five clinical datasets reveal Mamba Snake's
superior performance, with an average Dice improvement of 3\% over
state-of-the-art methods.

*Hanlei Shi,Leyuan Qu,Yu Liu,Di Gao,Yuhua Zheng,Taihao Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel Think-Before-Draw framework for text-driven emotional talking-head generation, improving facial expressiveness through emotion-semantic parsing and guided denoising strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in current emotional talking-head generation methods that rely on predefined discrete emotion labels, which fail to capture the dynamic complexity of real emotional expressions.

Method: The authors propose a Chain-of-Thought approach for detailed emotion-semantic parsing, mapping high-level semantics to facial muscle movements. They also use a progressive guidance denoising strategy for refining micro-expressions.

Result: The method achieves state-of-the-art performance on MEAD and HDTF benchmarks and demonstrates strong zero-shot generation capabilities using a collected portrait image dataset.

Conclusion: The Think-Before-Draw framework enhances text-driven emotional talking-head generation by effectively linking abstract emotions to realistic facial dynamics, overcoming existing expressiveness limitations.

Abstract: Emotional talking-head generation has emerged as a pivotal research area at
the intersection of computer vision and multimodal artificial intelligence,
with its core value lying in enhancing human-computer interaction through
immersive and empathetic engagement.With the advancement of multimodal large
language models, the driving signals for emotional talking-head generation has
shifted from audio and video to more flexible text. However, current
text-driven methods rely on predefined discrete emotion label texts,
oversimplifying the dynamic complexity of real facial muscle movements and thus
failing to achieve natural emotional expressiveness.This study proposes the
Think-Before-Draw framework to address two key challenges: (1) In-depth
semantic parsing of emotions--by innovatively introducing Chain-of-Thought
(CoT), abstract emotion labels are transformed into physiologically grounded
facial muscle movement descriptions, enabling the mapping from high-level
semantics to actionable motion features; and (2) Fine-grained expressiveness
optimization--inspired by artists' portrait painting process, a progressive
guidance denoising strategy is proposed, employing a "global emotion
localization--local muscle control" mechanism to refine micro-expression
dynamics in generated videos.Our experiments demonstrate that our approach
achieves state-of-the-art performance on widely-used benchmarks, including MEAD
and HDTF. Additionally, we collected a set of portrait images to evaluate our
model's zero-shot generation capability.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the scarcity of diverse training data and the absence of object-level cues caused by environmental or sensor limitations in autonomous driving systems.

Method: The method includes a video generation pipeline for creating realistic driving scenarios using a world model and a dynamic prediction model with graph convolutions and temporal operators for spatio-temporal understanding.

Result: The proposed framework shows improved accuracy and lead time in accident anticipation based on experiments using public and newly introduced datasets.

Conclusion: The framework proves effective in overcoming current data limitations and modeling challenges, advancing safety-critical applications in autonomous driving.

Abstract: Reliable anticipation of traffic accidents is essential for advancing
autonomous driving systems. However, this objective is limited by two
fundamental challenges: the scarcity of diverse, high-quality training data and
the frequent absence of crucial object-level cues due to environmental
disruptions or sensor deficiencies. To tackle these issues, we propose a
comprehensive framework combining generative scene augmentation with adaptive
temporal reasoning. Specifically, we develop a video generation pipeline that
utilizes a world model guided by domain-informed prompts to create
high-resolution, statistically consistent driving scenarios, particularly
enriching the coverage of edge cases and complex interactions. In parallel, we
construct a dynamic prediction model that encodes spatio-temporal relationships
through strengthened graph convolutions and dilated temporal operators,
effectively addressing data incompleteness and transient visual noise.
Furthermore, we release a new benchmark dataset designed to better capture
diverse real-world driving risks. Extensive experiments on public and newly
released datasets confirm that our framework enhances both the accuracy and
lead time of accident anticipation, offering a robust solution to current data
and modeling limitations in safety-critical autonomous driving applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce high data acquisition costs and improve generalization in vision-language-action (VLA) models by moving towards a task-agnostic action paradigm.

Method: They develop ATARA, a self-supervised action data framework, and AnyPos, an inverse dynamics model with specialized modules like Arm-Decoupled Estimation and Direction-Aware Decoder.

Result: The AnyPos-ATARA pipeline yielded a 51% improvement in test accuracy and 30-40% higher success rates across diverse manipulation tasks, showing significant effectiveness.

Conclusion: The introduction of task-agnostic action paradigms and tools like ATARA and AnyPos demonstrates the potential for more scalable and efficient learning in robotic manipulation.

Abstract: Vision-language-action (VLA) models have shown promise on task-conditioned
control in complex settings such as bimanual manipulation. However, the heavy
reliance on task-specific human demonstrations limits their generalization and
incurs high data acquisition costs. In this work, we present a new notion of
task-agnostic action paradigm that decouples action execution from
task-specific conditioning, enhancing scalability, efficiency, and
cost-effectiveness. To address the data collection challenges posed by this
paradigm -- such as low coverage density, behavioral redundancy, and safety
risks -- we introduce ATARA (Automated Task-Agnostic Random Actions), a
scalable self-supervised framework that accelerates collection by over $
30\times $ compared to human teleoperation. To further enable effective
learning from task-agnostic data, which often suffers from distribution
mismatch and irrelevant trajectories, we propose AnyPos, an inverse dynamics
model equipped with Arm-Decoupled Estimation and a Direction-Aware Decoder
(DAD). We additionally integrate a video-conditioned action validation module
to verify the feasibility of learned policies across diverse manipulation
tasks. Extensive experiments show that the AnyPos-ATARA pipeline yields a 51%
improvement in test accuracy and achieves 30-40% higher success rates in
downstream tasks such as lifting, pick-and-place, and clicking, using
replay-based video validation. Project Page:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces ReToM, a new token merging strategy for improving efficiency in Stable Diffusion's text-to-image generation models without compromising image quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the inefficiencies in the time-consuming generation process of Stable Diffusion, caused by the quadratic complexity of attention operations.

Method: ReToM uses local boundaries (windows) to merge tokens contextually, and introduces a representative token that captures salient local features by finding the highest similarity—ensuring efficient computational overhead.

Result: ReToM improves FID scores by 6.2% and achieves higher CLIP scores compared to the baseline while also maintaining comparable inference time.

Conclusion: ReToM effectively balances visual quality and computational efficiency, making it a promising strategy for attention-based image generation models.

Abstract: Stable diffusion is an outstanding image generation model for text-to-image,
but its time-consuming generation process remains a challenge due to the
quadratic complexity of attention operations. Recent token merging methods
improve efficiency by reducing the number of tokens during attention
operations, but often overlook the characteristics of attention-based image
generation models, limiting their effectiveness. In this paper, we propose
local representative token guided merging (ReToM), a novel token merging
strategy applicable to any attention mechanism in image generation. To merge
tokens based on various contextual information, ReToM defines local boundaries
as windows within attention inputs and adjusts window sizes. Furthermore, we
introduce a representative token, which represents the most representative
token per window by computing similarity at a specific timestep and selecting
the token with the highest average similarity. This approach preserves the most
salient local features while minimizing computational overhead. Experimental
results show that ReToM achieves a 6.2% improvement in FID and higher CLIP
scores compared to the baseline, while maintaining comparable inference time.
We empirically demonstrate that ReToM is effective in balancing visual quality
and computational efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficient vision transformers are increasingly vital in addressing computational limitations in computer vision tasks.

Method: Proposes KCR-Transformer, which employs differentiable channel selection in MLP layers and uses theoretical generalization bounds to prune channels while retaining minimal generalization error.

Result: KCR-Transformer reduces FLOPs and parameters in vision transformers (e.g., ViT, Swin) while maintaining or improving prediction accuracy.

Conclusion: KCR-Transformer delivers computational efficiency and improved task performance by optimizing channel selection and preserving low generalization error in vision transformers.

Abstract: Self-attention and transformer architectures have become foundational
components in modern deep learning. Recent efforts have integrated transformer
blocks into compact neural architectures for computer vision, giving rise to
various efficient vision transformers. In this work, we introduce Transformer
with Kernel Complexity Reduction, or KCR-Transformer, a compact transformer
block equipped with differentiable channel selection, guided by a novel and
sharp theoretical generalization bound. KCR-Transformer performs input/output
channel selection in the MLP layers of transformer blocks to reduce the
computational cost. Furthermore, we provide a rigorous theoretical analysis
establishing a tight generalization bound for networks equipped with
KCR-Transformer blocks. Leveraging such strong theoretical results, the channel
pruning by KCR-Transformer is conducted in a generalization-aware manner,
ensuring that the resulting network retains a provably small generalization
error. Our KCR-Transformer is compatible with many popular and compact
transformer networks, such as ViT and Swin, and it reduces the FLOPs of the
vision transformers while maintaining or even improving the prediction
accuracy. In the experiments, we replace all the transformer blocks in the
vision transformers with KCR-Transformer blocks, leading to KCR-Transformer
networks with different backbones. The resulting TCR-Transformers achieve
superior performance on various computer vision tasks, achieving even better
performance than the original models with even less FLOPs and parameters.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new dataset, SVM-City, and the City-VLM model for outdoor scene understanding, addressing challenges in multimodal fusion and large-scale environments. City-VLM outperforms existing LVLMs by 18.14%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current large vision-language models (LVLMs) are primarily focused on indoor environments and struggle with outdoor scene complexities, such as larger scale, varied viewpoints, and the integration of multimodal data.

Method: The authors created the SVM-City dataset featuring multimodal outdoor data (images, point clouds, and question-answer pairs) and designed the City-VLM model employing incomplete multimodal learning and probabilistic fusion methods.

Result: City-VLM achieved 18.14% improvement in question-answering tasks on three outdoor scene understanding scenarios compared to existing models.

Conclusion: City-VLM demonstrates enhanced performance, practicality, and generalization in outdoor scene understanding tasks, paving the way for better LVLMs in outdoor contexts.

Abstract: Scene understanding enables intelligent agents to interpret and comprehend
their environment. While existing large vision-language models (LVLMs) for
scene understanding have primarily focused on indoor household tasks, they face
two significant limitations when applied to outdoor large-scale scene
understanding. First, outdoor scenarios typically encompass larger-scale
environments observed through various sensors from multiple viewpoints (e.g.,
bird view and terrestrial view), while existing indoor LVLMs mainly analyze
single visual modalities within building-scale contexts from humanoid
viewpoints. Second, existing LVLMs suffer from missing multidomain perception
outdoor data and struggle to effectively integrate 2D and 3D visual
information. To address the aforementioned limitations, we build the first
multidomain perception outdoor scene understanding dataset, named
\textbf{\underline{SVM-City}}, deriving from multi\textbf{\underline{S}}cale
scenarios with multi\textbf{\underline{V}}iew and
multi\textbf{\underline{M}}odal instruction tuning data. It contains $420$k
images and $4, 811$M point clouds with $567$k question-answering pairs from
vehicles, low-altitude drones, high-altitude aerial planes, and satellite. To
effectively fuse the multimodal data in the absence of one modality, we
introduce incomplete multimodal learning to model outdoor scene understanding
and design the LVLM named \textbf{\underline{City-VLM}}. Multimodal fusion is
realized by constructing a joint probabilistic distribution space rather than
implementing directly explicit fusion operations (e.g., concatenation).
Experimental results on three typical outdoor scene understanding tasks show
City-VLM achieves $18.14 \%$ performance surpassing existing LVLMs in
question-answering tasks averagely. Our method demonstrates pragmatic and
generalization performance across multiple outdoor scenes.

Conclusion: DeQA-Doc offers an advanced and precise approach for document quality assessment by leveraging MLLMs and innovative adaptations, making it widely applicable and reliable for related tasks.

Abstract: Document quality assessment is critical for a wide range of applications
including document digitization, OCR, and archival. However, existing
approaches often struggle to provide accurate and robust quality scores,
limiting their applicability in practical scenarios. With the rapid progress in
Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs), recent MLLM-based methods have
achieved remarkable performance in image quality assessment. In this work, we
extend this success to the document domain by adapting DeQA-Score, a
state-of-the-art MLLM-based image quality scorer, for document quality
assessment. We propose DeQA-Doc, a framework that leverages the visual language
capabilities of MLLMs and a soft label strategy to regress continuous document
quality scores. To adapt DeQA-Score to DeQA-Doc, we adopt two complementary
solutions to construct soft labels without the variance information. Also, we
relax the resolution constrains to support the large resolution of document
images. Finally, we introduce ensemble methods to further enhance the
performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DeQA-Doc significantly
outperforms existing baselines, offering accurate and generalizable document
quality assessment across diverse degradation types. Codes and model weights

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Sage, a method for long-tailed visual recognition, which utilizes semantic guidance from text to improve visual model fine-tuning and corrects prediction bias with a novel compensation factor.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the degraded performance of infrequent classes in long-tailed scenarios by fully leveraging the untapped potential of foundation models and improving the interaction between visual and textual modalities.

Method: Sage employs an SG-Adapter to integrate class descriptions, enhancing visual-textual alignment through attention mechanisms. It introduces a distribution mismatch-aware compensation factor to address prediction biases by integrating it into the loss function.

Result: The proposed method shows effectiveness in improving the performance of long-tailed visual learning across benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: Sage strengthens visual-textual alignment and addresses distributional inconsistencies, marking significant progress in foundation model fine-tuning for long-tailed learning.

Abstract: The variance in class-wise sample sizes within long-tailed scenarios often
results in degraded performance in less frequent classes. Fortunately,
foundation models, pre-trained on vast open-world datasets, demonstrate strong
potential for this task due to their generalizable representation, which
promotes the development of adaptive strategies on pre-trained models in
long-tailed learning. Advanced fine-tuning methods typically adjust visual
encoders while neglecting the semantics derived from the frozen text encoder,
overlooking the visual and textual alignment. To strengthen this alignment, we
propose a novel approach, Semantic-guided fine-tuning of foundation model for
long-tailed visual recognition (Sage), which incorporates semantic guidance
derived from textual modality into the visual fine-tuning process.
Specifically, we introduce an SG-Adapter that integrates class descriptions as
semantic guidance to guide the fine-tuning of the visual encoder. The
introduced guidance is passesed through the attention mechanism and enables the
model to focus more on semantically relevant content, strengthening the
alignment between the visual and textual modalities. Due to the inconsistent
class-conditional distributions neglected by the existing loss function, the
resulting prediction bias causes performance improvements for the tail class
less than for the head class, even when the multi-modal alignment is enhanced.
To address this challenge, we propose a novel distribution mismatch-aware
compensation factor, which is specifically designed to rectify the prediction
bias caused by the ignored inconsistent distribution based on our theoretical
analysis, and is seamlessly integrated into the loss function. Extensive
experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
Sage in enhancing performance in long-tailed learning.

TL;DR: This paper introduces the FIQ approach to improve Video Question Answering (VQA) by generating fundamental question-answer pairs from video descriptions and enhancing reasoning abilities, achieving state-of-the-art results on SUTD-TrafficQA.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VQA methods are limited by their reliance on event-centric annotations, which fail to capture the broader context, object types, spatial layouts, and descriptive attributes in videos, thus restricting the model's generalization and reasoning skills.

Method: The FIQ approach generates Q&A pairs based on descriptions extracted from videos to enhance scene understanding. It introduces the VQ-CAlign module to integrate task-specific question embeddings with visual features, preserving essential details and boosting downstream adaptability.

Result: FIQ improves interpretability and reasoning capabilities, achieving state-of-the-art performance on the SUTD-TrafficQA dataset compared to baseline methods.

Conclusion: FIQ enriches the training dataset with fundamental scene details, enabling better generalization, enhanced reasoning, and improved adaptability in VQA tasks.

Abstract: Video question answering (VQA) is a multimodal task that requires the
interpretation of a video to answer a given question. Existing VQA methods
primarily utilize question and answer (Q&A) pairs to learn the spatio-temporal
characteristics of video content. However, these annotations are typically
event-centric, which is not enough to capture the broader context of each
video. The absence of essential details such as object types, spatial layouts,
and descriptive attributes restricts the model to learning only a fragmented
scene representation. This issue limits the model's capacity for generalization
and higher-level reasoning. In this paper, we propose a fundamental question
generation with the integration of question embeddings for video question
answering (FIQ), a novel approach designed to strengthen the reasoning ability
of the model by enhancing the fundamental understanding of videos. FIQ
generates Q&A pairs based on descriptions extracted from videos, enriching the
training data with fundamental scene information. Generated Q&A pairs enable
the model to understand the primary context, leading to enhanced
generalizability and reasoning ability. Furthermore, we incorporate a VQ-CAlign
module that assists task-specific question embeddings with visual features,
ensuring that essential domain-specific details are preserved to increase the
adaptability of downstream tasks. Experiments on SUTD-TrafficQA demonstrate
that our FIQ achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to existing
baseline methods.

methods based on pre-trained models are cost-effective but still face notable
limitations. For example, sequential VLM-LLM pipelines process each modality
independently, which often results in information loss and limits cross-modal
interaction. In contrast, methods based on multimodal large language models
(MLLMs) often focus exclusively on applying changes indicated by the text,
without fully utilizing the contextual visual information from the reference
image. To address these issues, we propose multi-faceted Chain-of-Thought with
re-ranking (MCoT-RE), a training-free zero-shot CIR framework. MCoT-RE utilizes
multi-faceted Chain-of-Thought to guide the MLLM to balance explicit
modifications and contextual visual cues, generating two distinct captions: one
focused on modification and the other integrating comprehensive visual-textual
context. The first caption is used to filter candidate images. Subsequently, we
combine these two captions and the reference image to perform multi-grained
re-ranking. This two-stage approach facilitates precise retrieval by aligning
with the textual modification instructions while preserving the visual context
of the reference image. Through extensive experiments, MCoT-RE achieves
state-of-the-art results among training-free methods, yielding improvements of
up to 6.24% in Recall@10 on FashionIQ and 8.58% in Recall@1 on CIRR.

*Jeong-Woo Park,Young-Eun Kim,Seong-Whan Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenges of composed image retrieval (CIR) by proposing FAR-Net, a framework enhancing fusion methods for better semantic alignment and robust adaptability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhance the ability of composed image retrieval (CIR) systems to effectively fuse visual and textual modalities, addressing limitations in existing methods like early and late fusion.

Method: Propose FAR-Net, a two-module multi-stage fusion framework: an Enhanced Semantic Alignment Module (ESAM) for fine-grained semantic relationships using late fusion, and an Adaptive Reconciliation Module (ARM) applying early fusion with uncertainty embeddings for robustness.

Result: Achieved performance improvements on CIRR and FashionIQ datasets, with notable gains in metrics such as Recall@1 and Recall@50, surpassing state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: FAR-Net successfully improves CIR tasks through robust fusion methods, demonstrating scalability and enhanced performance with its novel multi-stage fusion approach.

Abstract: Composed image retrieval (CIR) is a vision language task that retrieves a
target image using a reference image and modification text, enabling intuitive
specification of desired changes. While effectively fusing visual and textual
modalities is crucial, existing methods typically adopt either early or late
fusion. Early fusion tends to excessively focus on explicitly mentioned textual
details and neglect visual context, whereas late fusion struggles to capture
fine-grained semantic alignments between image regions and textual tokens. To
address these issues, we propose FAR-Net, a multi-stage fusion framework
designed with enhanced semantic alignment and adaptive reconciliation,
integrating two complementary modules. The enhanced semantic alignment module
(ESAM) employs late fusion with cross-attention to capture fine-grained
semantic relationships, while the adaptive reconciliation module (ARM) applies
early fusion with uncertainty embeddings to enhance robustness and
adaptability. Experiments on CIRR and FashionIQ show consistent performance
gains, improving Recall@1 by up to 2.4% and Recall@50 by 1.04% over existing
state-of-the-art methods, empirically demonstrating that FAR Net provides a
robust and scalable solution to CIR tasks.

28 user-instruction types, and 300\,k high-quality data entries. We further
propose AnyCapEval, a new benchmark that provides more reliable evaluation
metrics for controllable captioning by decoupling content accuracy and
stylistic fidelity. ACM markedly improves caption quality across a diverse set

TL;DR: This paper introduces DINO-VO, a learning-based monocular visual odometry system that integrates the DINOv2 visual foundation model to achieve robustness, generalization, and efficiency in challenging environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenges of robustness, generalization, and efficiency in monocular visual odometry (VO) by leveraging advancements in visual foundation models like DINOv2.

Method: The approach includes tailoring a salient keypoints detector for DINOv2's coarse features, augmenting robust-semantic features with fine-grained geometric features, and employing a transformer-based matcher alongside differentiable pose estimation for precise camera motion estimation.

Result: DINO-VO outperformed prior methods in robustness, accuracy, and generalization on benchmarks like TartanAir and KITTI datasets, achieving competitive performance on EuRoC; all while operating efficiently at 72 FPS with low memory usage.

Conclusion: The integration of DINOv2 in DINO-VO improves monocular visual odometry performance, enabling it to match or exceed existing methods and compete with Visual SLAM systems in real-world scenarios while maintaining efficiency.

Abstract: Learning-based monocular visual odometry (VO) poses robustness,
generalization, and efficiency challenges in robotics. Recent advances in
visual foundation models, such as DINOv2, have improved robustness and
generalization in various vision tasks, yet their integration in VO remains
limited due to coarse feature granularity. In this paper, we present DINO-VO, a
feature-based VO system leveraging DINOv2 visual foundation model for its
sparse feature matching. To address the integration challenge, we propose a
salient keypoints detector tailored to DINOv2's coarse features. Furthermore,
we complement DINOv2's robust-semantic features with fine-grained geometric
features, resulting in more localizable representations. Finally, a
transformer-based matcher and differentiable pose estimation layer enable
precise camera motion estimation by learning good matches. Against prior
detector-descriptor networks like SuperPoint, DINO-VO demonstrates greater
robustness in challenging environments. Furthermore, we show superior accuracy
and generalization of the proposed feature descriptors against standalone
DINOv2 coarse features. DINO-VO outperforms prior frame-to-frame VO methods on
the TartanAir and KITTI datasets and is competitive on EuRoC dataset, while
running efficiently at 72 FPS with less than 1GB of memory usage on a single
GPU. Moreover, it performs competitively against Visual SLAM systems on outdoor

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces the SRE method using attention refocusing in CLIP to improve domain generalization by simulating domain shifts, refocusing attention maps, and employing ensemble learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP struggles to focus on domain-invariant regions, limiting its performance on unseen domain generalization tasks.

Method: The SRE method involves simulating target domains via augmentation, aligning attention maps in CLIP for refocusing, and using ensemble learning to enforce domain-invariant representations.

Result: SRE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches across various datasets in domain generalization tasks.

Conclusion: The attention-refocusing approach of SRE effectively mitigates domain shifts and enhances CLIP's performance for unseen target domains.

Abstract: Domain generalization (DG) aims to learn a model from source domains and
apply it to unseen target domains with out-of-distribution data. Owing to
CLIP's strong ability to encode semantic concepts, it has attracted increasing
interest in domain generalization. However, CLIP often struggles to focus on
task-relevant regions across domains, i.e., domain-invariant regions, resulting
in suboptimal performance on unseen target domains. To address this challenge,
we propose an attention-refocusing scheme, called Simulate, Refocus and
Ensemble (SRE), which learns to reduce the domain shift by aligning the
attention maps in CLIP via attention refocusing. SRE first simulates domain
shifts by performing augmentation on the source data to generate simulated
target domains. SRE then learns to reduce the domain shifts by refocusing the
attention in CLIP between the source and simulated target domains. Finally, SRE
utilizes ensemble learning to enhance the ability to capture domain-invariant
attention maps between the source data and the simulated target data. Extensive
experimental results on several datasets demonstrate that SRE generally
achieves better results than state-of-the-art methods. The code is available

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces SE-VLN, a self-evolving vision-language navigation (VLN) framework designed to enable VLN agents to evolve during testing by utilizing hierarchical memory, retrieval-augmented reasoning, and reflection modules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors identified limitations in using fixed knowledge bases within large language models (LLMs) for VLN tasks, as these models lack the capacity to efficiently incorporate experiential knowledge and evolve dynamically.

Method: The SE-VLN framework includes three core modules: (1) a hierarchical memory module for converting success and failure cases into reusable knowledge, (2) a retrieval-augmented thought-based reasoning module for multi-step decision-making, and (3) a reflection module to allow continual learning and evolution.

Result: SE-VLN achieved notable improvements on the R2R and REVERSE datasets, with navigation success rates of 57% and 35.2%, which represent substantial performance boosts of 23.9% and 15.0%, respectively, over existing state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: SE-VLN's ability to improve with an expanding experience repository demonstrates its potential as a self-evolving framework for VLN tasks, offering a new direction in creating more dynamic and adaptive VLN agents.

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language navigation (VLN) were mainly attributed to
emerging large language models (LLMs). These methods exhibited excellent
generalization capabilities in instruction understanding and task reasoning.
However, they were constrained by the fixed knowledge bases and reasoning
abilities of LLMs, preventing fully incorporating experiential knowledge and
thus resulting in a lack of efficient evolutionary capacity. To address this,
we drew inspiration from the evolution capabilities of natural agents, and
proposed a self-evolving VLN framework (SE-VLN) to endow VLN agents with the
ability to continuously evolve during testing. To the best of our knowledge, it
was the first time that an multimodal LLM-powered self-evolving VLN framework
was proposed. Specifically, SE-VLN comprised three core modules, i.e., a
hierarchical memory module to transfer successful and failure cases into
reusable knowledge, a retrieval-augmented thought-based reasoning module to
retrieve experience and enable multi-step decision-making, and a reflection
module to realize continual evolution. Comprehensive tests illustrated that the
SE-VLN achieved navigation success rates of 57% and 35.2% in unseen
environments, representing absolute performance improvements of 23.9% and 15.0%
over current state-of-the-art methods on R2R and REVERSE datasets,
respectively. Moreover, the SE-VLN showed performance improvement with
increasing experience repository, elucidating its great potential as a
self-evolving agent framework for VLN.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'SCORE,' a framework addressing challenges in open-vocabulary remote sensing instance segmentation by leveraging multi-granularity scene context to enhance visual and textual representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current remote sensing methods are limited to close-vocabulary tasks and struggle with novel categories and diverse scenarios, necessitating a robust approach for open-vocabulary instance segmentation.

Method: The proposed 'SCORE' method integrates regional and global scene context into visual and textual embeddings, using Region-Aware Integration and Global Context Adaptation strategies.

Result: SCORE achieves state-of-the-art performance in open-vocabulary remote sensing segmentation benchmarks across multiple datasets, outperforming baseline models.

Conclusion: The framework offers a scalable and effective solution for geospatial image analysis, demonstrating potential for real-world applications in Earth observation tasks.

Abstract: Most existing remote sensing instance segmentation approaches are designed
for close-vocabulary prediction, limiting their ability to recognize novel
categories or generalize across datasets. This restricts their applicability in
diverse Earth observation scenarios. To address this, we introduce
open-vocabulary (OV) learning for remote sensing instance segmentation. While
current OV segmentation models perform well on natural image datasets, their
direct application to remote sensing faces challenges such as diverse
landscapes, seasonal variations, and the presence of small or ambiguous objects
in aerial imagery. To overcome these challenges, we propose $\textbf{SCORE}$
($\textbf{S}$cene $\textbf{C}$ontext matters in $\textbf{O}$pen-vocabulary
$\textbf{RE}$mote sensing instance segmentation), a framework that integrates
multi-granularity scene context, i.e., regional context and global context, to
enhance both visual and textual representations. Specifically, we introduce
Region-Aware Integration, which refines class embeddings with regional context
to improve object distinguishability. Additionally, we propose Global Context
Adaptation, which enriches naive text embeddings with remote sensing global
context, creating a more adaptable and expressive linguistic latent space for
the classifier. We establish new benchmarks for OV remote sensing instance
segmentation across diverse datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that,
our proposed method achieves SOTA performance, which provides a robust solution
for large-scale, real-world geospatial analysis. Our code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a generalizable stereo matching model that performs efficiently across varying resolutions and disparity ranges without needing dataset-specific fine-tuning.

Method: The authors propose $S^2M^2$, a global matching architecture leveraging a multi-resolution transformer and a novel loss function for robust long-range correspondence and probability-concentrated matches.

Result: $S^2M^2$ outperforms prior methods in accuracy and efficiency on Middlebury v3 and ETH3D benchmarks while producing high-quality, detailed reconstructions.

Conclusion: $S^2M^2$ resolves prior trade-offs in stereo matching, achieving both state-of-the-art accuracy and efficiency without using cost volume filtering or deep refinement stacks.

Abstract: The pursuit of a generalizable stereo matching model, capable of performing
across varying resolutions and disparity ranges without dataset-specific
fine-tuning, has revealed a fundamental trade-off. Iterative local search
methods achieve high scores on constrained benchmarks, but their core mechanism
inherently limits the global consistency required for true generalization. On
the other hand, global matching architectures, while theoretically more robust,
have been historically rendered infeasible by prohibitive computational and
memory costs. We resolve this dilemma with $S^2M^2$: a global matching
architecture that achieves both state-of-the-art accuracy and high efficiency
without relying on cost volume filtering or deep refinement stacks. Our design
integrates a multi-resolution transformer for robust long-range correspondence,
trained with a novel loss function that concentrates probability on feasible
matches. This approach enables a more robust joint estimation of disparity,
occlusion, and confidence. $S^2M^2$ establishes a new state of the art on the
Middlebury v3 and ETH3D benchmarks, significantly outperforming prior methods
across most metrics while reconstructing high-quality details with competitive
efficiency.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VITA introduces a Vision-To-Action flow matching policy that directly maps visual inputs to actions for control tasks, eliminating the need for separate conditioning mechanisms and achieving state-of-the-art performance efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the inefficiencies in traditional visuomotor control methods that rely on separate conditioning modules and standard source distributions, which increase computational complexity and latency.

Method: VITA leverages a novel approach by using latent images as flow sources, creating a structured action latent space via autoencoders, and supervising flow matching with both encoder targets and action outputs through flow latent decoding. It simplifies the architecture to MLP layers.

Result: VITA demonstrated superior or equal performance compared to state-of-the-art generative policies in bi-manual manipulation tasks on the ALOHA platform, while reducing inference latency by up to 130%.

Conclusion: VITA simplifies visuomotor control tasks with an MLP-only architecture, producing efficient and effective solutions for complex manipulation tasks in simulation and real-world scenarios.

Abstract: We present VITA, a Vision-To-Action flow matching policy that evolves latent
visual representations into latent actions for visuomotor control. Traditional
flow matching and diffusion policies sample from standard source distributions
(e.g., Gaussian noise) and require additional conditioning mechanisms like
cross-attention to condition action generation on visual information, creating
time and space overheads. VITA proposes a novel paradigm that treats latent
images as the flow source, learning an inherent mapping from vision to action
while eliminating separate conditioning modules and preserving generative
modeling capabilities. Learning flows between fundamentally different
modalities like vision and action is challenging due to sparse action data
lacking semantic structures and dimensional mismatches between high-dimensional
visual representations and raw actions. We address this by creating a
structured action latent space via an autoencoder as the flow matching target,
up-sampling raw actions to match visual representation shapes. Crucially, we
supervise flow matching with both encoder targets and final action outputs
through flow latent decoding, which backpropagates action reconstruction loss
through sequential flow matching ODE solving steps for effective end-to-end
learning. Implemented as simple MLP layers, VITA is evaluated on challenging
bi-manual manipulation tasks on the ALOHA platform, including 5 simulation and
2 real-world tasks. Despite its simplicity, MLP-only VITA outperforms or
matches state-of-the-art generative policies while reducing inference latency
by 50-130% compared to conventional flow matching policies requiring different
conditioning mechanisms or complex architectures. To our knowledge, VITA is the
first MLP-only flow matching policy capable of solving complex bi-manual
manipulation tasks like those in ALOHA benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces HRSeg, a model for reasoning segmentation in images, leveraging high-resolution perception and enhancement modules for improved segmentation accuracy compared to prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing segmentation models struggle with low perceptual resolution and inefficiencies in enhancing resolution through traditional methods, resulting in suboptimal performance.

Method: HRSeg utilizes a High-Resolution Perception (HRP) module for processing high-resolution images and a High-Resolution Enhancement (HRE) module for refining mask features, ensuring precise segmentation guided by text features.

Result: HRSeg outperforms existing methods on multiple benchmark datasets, demonstrating superior segmentation quality validated by extensive ablation studies.

Conclusion: The proposed HRSeg model effectively addresses the limitations of previous methods by efficiently integrating high-resolution perception and refinement techniques, achieving state-of-the-art reasoning segmentation results.

Abstract: The reasoning segmentation task involves segmenting objects within an image
by interpreting implicit user instructions, which may encompass subtleties such
as contextual cues and open-world knowledge. Despite significant advancements
made by existing approaches, they remain constrained by low perceptual
resolution, as visual encoders are typically pre-trained at lower resolutions.
Furthermore, simply interpolating the positional embeddings of visual encoders
to enhance perceptual resolution yields only marginal performance improvements
while incurring substantial computational costs. To address this, we propose
HRSeg, an efficient model with high-resolution fine-grained perception. It
features two key innovations: High-Resolution Perception (HRP) and
High-Resolution Enhancement (HRE). The HRP module processes high-resolution
images through cropping, integrating local and global features for
multi-granularity quality. The HRE module enhances mask features by integrating
fine-grained information from high-resolution images, refining their alignment
with text features for precise segmentation. Extensive ablation studies
validate the effectiveness of our modules, while comprehensive experiments on
multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate HRSeg's superior performance.

embedded in a lightweight, necklace-style form factor. NeckSense captures
dynamic changes in tissue impedance around the neck, which are modulated by
head rotations and subtle muscle activations. To robustly estimate head pose,
we propose a deep learning framework that integrates anatomical priors,
including joint constraints and natural head rotation ranges, into the loss
function design. We validate NeckSense on 7 participants using the current SOTA
pose estimation model as ground truth. Our system achieves a mean per-vertex
error of 25.9 mm across various head movements with a leave-one-person-out
cross-validation method, demonstrating that a compact, line-of-sight-free
bio-impedance wearable can deliver head-tracking performance comparable to SOTA
vision-based methods.

*Mengke Song,Yuge Xie,Qi Cui,Luming Li,Xinyu Liu,Guotao Wang,Chenglizhao Chen,Shanchen Pang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel emotion recognition approach based on gaze fixation patterns and environmental interactions, using standard HD cameras for unobtrusive and scalable tracking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Explore limitations of existing emotion recognition systems that are dependent on explicit signals or complex hardware, aiming for a scalable and natural method.

Method: Propose a camera-based system that integrates gaze trajectories with environmental semantics, using temporal and spatial modeling without specialized hardware.

Result: The system achieves real-time, user-unaware emotion recognition by capturing dynamic interactions between gaze and the environment.

Conclusion: The approach effectively combines visual attention and environmental context, allowing for scalable, unobtrusive emotion detection with high generalizability.

Abstract: Emotion recognition,as a step toward mind reading,seeks to infer internal
states from external cues.Most existing methods rely on explicit signals-such
as facial expressions,speech,or gestures-that reflect only bodily responses and
overlook the influence of environmental context.These cues are often
voluntary,easy to mask,and insufficient for capturing deeper,implicit emotions.
Physiological signal-based approaches offer more direct access to internal
states but require complex sensors that compromise natural behavior and limit
scalability.Gaze-based methods typically rely on static fixation analysis and
fail to capture the rich,dynamic interactions between gaze and the
environment,and thus cannot uncover the deep connection between emotion and
implicit behavior.To address these limitations,we propose a novel
camera-based,user-unaware emotion recognition approach that integrates gaze
fixation patterns with environmental semantics and temporal dynamics.Leveraging
standard HD cameras,our method unobtrusively captures users'eye appearance and
head movements in natural settings-without the need for specialized hardware or
active user participation.From these visual cues,the system estimates gaze
trajectories over time and space, providing the basis for modeling the spatial,
semantic,and temporal dimensions of gaze behavior. This allows us to capture
the dynamic interplay between visual attention and the surrounding
environment,revealing that emotions are not merely physiological responses but
complex outcomes of human-environment interactions.The proposed approach
enables user-unaware,real-time,and continuous emotion recognition,offering high
generalizability and low deployment cost.

*Yin Wu,Daniel Slieter,Ahmed Abouelazm,Christian Hubschneider,J. Marius Zöllner*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces LanePerf, a new framework for label-free performance estimation in lane detection tasks, achieving high accuracy and robustness across diverse scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current lane detection models face reliability issues due to domain shifts and require resource-intensive data annotation for robustness, sparking interest in label-free performance estimation methods.

Method: The study adapts five methods from image classification for baseline comparisons and proposes LanePerf, which integrates image and lane features using pretrained encoders and DeepSets, addressing shortcomings in zero-lane detection and large domain shifts.

Result: LanePerf outperforms baselines in experiments on the OpenLane dataset, achieving lower MAE of 0.117 and higher Spearman rank correlation of 0.727 across varied domain shifts.

Conclusion: LanePerf demonstrates its viability as an efficient, label-free performance estimation framework for safer and robust lane detection under challenging driving conditions, reducing dependency on annotated data.

Abstract: Lane detection is a critical component of Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems
(ADAS) and Automated Driving System (ADS), providing essential spatial
information for lateral control. However, domain shifts often undermine model
reliability when deployed in new environments. Ensuring the robustness and
safety of lane detection models typically requires collecting and annotating
target domain data, which is resource-intensive. Estimating model performance
without ground-truth labels offers a promising alternative for efficient
robustness assessment, yet remains underexplored in lane detection. While
previous work has addressed performance estimation in image classification,
these methods are not directly applicable to lane detection tasks. This paper
first adapts five well-performing performance estimation methods from image
classification to lane detection, building a baseline. Addressing the
limitations of prior approaches that solely rely on softmax scores or lane
features, we further propose a new Lane Performance Estimation Framework
(LanePerf), which integrates image and lane features using a pretrained image
encoder and a DeepSets-based architecture, effectively handling zero-lane
detection scenarios and large domain-shift cases. Extensive experiments on the
OpenLane dataset, covering diverse domain shifts (scenes, weather, hours),
demonstrate that our LanePerf outperforms all baselines, achieving a lower MAE
of 0.117 and a higher Spearman's rank correlation coefficient of 0.727. These
findings pave the way for robust, label-free performance estimation in ADAS,
supporting more efficient testing and improved safety in challenging driving
scenarios.

*Shreyansh Jain,Koteswar Rao Jerripothula*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents a novel image classification dataset for Federated Learning and introduces two new algorithms, Fed-Cyclic and Fed-Star, which outperform existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Federated Learning offers privacy-preserving machine learning by decentralized collaboration, but lacks dedicated datasets for image classification and optimized algorithms for specific challenges like statistical heterogeneity.

Method: The paper introduces a new dataset with 23,326 images categorized into 31 classes. It also proposes two algorithms: Fed-Cyclic, where clients exchange weights cyclically, and Fed-Star, which uses pre-aggregation to handle heterogeneity and employs a star-like topology for weight updates.

Result: Experimental findings indicate that Fed-Cyclic and Fed-Star outperform existing Federated Learning baselines on the introduced dataset.

Conclusion: These advancements enrich Federated Learning research by providing a specialized dataset and innovative algorithms that improve effectiveness and tackle statistical challenges.

Abstract: Federated Learning is a collaborative machine learning paradigm that enables
multiple clients to learn a global model without exposing their data to each
other. Consequently, it provides a secure learning platform with
privacy-preserving capabilities. This paper introduces a new dataset containing
23,326 images collected from eight different commercial sources and classified
into 31 categories, similar to the Office-31 dataset. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first image classification dataset specifically designed
for Federated Learning. We also propose two new Federated Learning algorithms,
namely Fed-Cyclic and Fed-Star. In Fed-Cyclic, a client receives weights from
its previous client, updates them through local training, and passes them to
the next client, thus forming a cyclic topology. In Fed-Star, a client receives
weights from all other clients, updates its local weights through
pre-aggregation (to address statistical heterogeneity) and local training, and
sends its updated local weights to all other clients, thus forming a star-like
topology. Our experiments reveal that both algorithms perform better than
existing baselines on our newly introduced dataset.

*Tomohiro Suzuki,Ryota Tanaka,Calvin Yeung,Keisuke Fujii*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The authors introduced AthleticsPose, a dataset for monocular 3D pose estimation in sports, addressing the lack of realistic sports motion datasets and evaluating model reliability for sports tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing monocular 3D pose estimation models for sports analysis face limitations due to a lack of realistic datasets and unclear reliability across various sports motions.

Method: The paper presented the AthleticsPose dataset featuring real motions from athletes, trained a 3D pose estimation model using this dataset, compared performance with a baseline model, and analyzed factors affecting estimation accuracy.

Result: The model trained on AthleticsPose showed superior performance, reducing MPJPE by 75% compared to a baseline dataset, highlighting the importance of authentic motion data. It revealed sensitivity to camera view and subject scale, while case studies identified strengths in individual kinematic indicators but biases in speed-sensitive metrics.

Conclusion: The AthleticsPose dataset enhances pose estimation models' accuracy for sports analysis and demonstrates both the potential of pose estimation in capturing motion features and its limitations for high-speed metrics.

Abstract: Monocular 3D pose estimation is a promising, flexible alternative to costly
motion capture systems for sports analysis. However, its practical application
is hindered by two factors: a lack of realistic sports datasets and unclear
reliability for sports tasks. To address these challenges, we introduce the
AthleticsPose dataset, a new public dataset featuring ``real'' motions captured
from 23 athletes performing various athletics events on an athletic field.
Using this dataset, we trained a representative 3D pose estimation model and
performed a comprehensive evaluation. Our results show that the model trained
on AthleticsPose significantly outperforms a baseline model trained on an
imitated sports motion dataset, reducing MPJPE by approximately 75 %. These
results show the importance of training on authentic sports motion data, as
models based on imitated motions do not effectively transfer to real-world
motions. Further analysis reveals that estimation accuracy is sensitive to
camera view and subject scale. In case studies of kinematic indicators, the
model demonstrated the potential to capture individual differences in knee
angles but struggled with higher-speed metrics, such as knee-drive velocity,
due to prediction biases. This work provides the research community with a
valuable dataset and clarifies the potential and practical limitations of using
monocular 3D pose estimation for sports motion analysis. Our dataset, code, and
checkpoints are available at https://github.com/SZucchini/AthleticsPose.

### [110] [Argus: Leveraging Multiview Images for Improved 3-D Scene Understanding With Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12916)
*Yifan Xu,Chao Zhang,Hanqi Jiang,Xiaoyan Wang,Ruifei Ma,Yiwei Li,Zihao Wu,Zeju Li,Xiangde Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Argus introduces a 3D multimodal framework leveraging multi-view images and text inputs to enhance 3D scene understanding for large language models (LLMs), addressing deficiencies in 3D point cloud reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the shortcomings in 3D point cloud reconstruction, such as data loss in textureless planes and distorted details, and leverage multi-view images for enhanced representation in 3D scene understanding.

Method: Argus integrates text instructions, 2D multi-view images, and 3D point clouds to create 3D-aware embeddings by fusing multi-view image features with 3D features, overcoming the deficiencies of point cloud-only methods.

Result: Extensive experiments show that Argus surpasses existing 3D-LMMs in performance across various downstream tasks.

Conclusion: The Argus framework broadens the capability of LLMs for 3D scene understanding by compensating for 3D point cloud limitations through multimodal integration, establishing its effectiveness in downstream tasks.

Abstract: Advancements in foundation models have made it possible to conduct
applications in various downstream tasks. Especially, the new era has witnessed
a remarkable capability to extend Large Language Models (LLMs) for tackling
tasks of 3D scene understanding. Current methods rely heavily on 3D point
clouds, but the 3D point cloud reconstruction of an indoor scene often results
in information loss. Some textureless planes or repetitive patterns are prone
to omission and manifest as voids within the reconstructed 3D point clouds.
Besides, objects with complex structures tend to introduce distortion of
details caused by misalignments between the captured images and the dense
reconstructed point clouds. 2D multi-view images present visual consistency
with 3D point clouds and provide more detailed representations of scene
components, which can naturally compensate for these deficiencies. Based on
these insights, we propose Argus, a novel 3D multimodal framework that
leverages multi-view images for enhanced 3D scene understanding with LLMs. In
general, Argus can be treated as a 3D Large Multimodal Foundation Model
(3D-LMM) since it takes various modalities as input(text instructions, 2D
multi-view images, and 3D point clouds) and expands the capability of LLMs to
tackle 3D tasks. Argus involves fusing and integrating multi-view images and
camera poses into view-as-scene features, which interact with the 3D features
to create comprehensive and detailed 3D-aware scene embeddings. Our approach
compensates for the information loss while reconstructing 3D point clouds and
helps LLMs better understand the 3D world. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our method outperforms existing 3D-LMMs in various downstream tasks.

### [111] [DMQ: Dissecting Outliers of Diffusion Models for Post-Training Quantization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12933)
*Dongyeun Lee,Jiwan Hur,Hyounguk Shon,Jae Young Lee,Junmo Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes DMQ, a quantization method to reduce computational costs in diffusion models without losing image generation quality, particularly effective at low bit-widths.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models, while successful in image generation, are computationally intensive, creating challenges for deployment in resource-limited settings. Existing quantization approaches fail to address outliers adequately, leading to poor performance at low bit-widths.

Method: DMQ is introduced, combining Learned Equivalent Scaling (LES) to balance weight and activation quantization, and channel-wise Power-of-Two Scaling (PTS) to handle high inter-channel variance. An adaptive timestep weighting scheme and a robust PTS factor selection algorithm using voting are also included.

Result: Extensive experiments show that DMQ significantly improves performance at low bit-widths (e.g., W4A6, W4A8), preserving high-quality image generation and model stability compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: DMQ effectively addresses the computational challenges of diffusion models while maintaining image quality and stability, making it more suitable for low-resource environments.

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in image generation but
come with significant computational costs, posing challenges for deployment in
resource-constrained environments. Recent post-training quantization (PTQ)
methods have attempted to mitigate this issue by focusing on the iterative
nature of diffusion models. However, these approaches often overlook outliers,
leading to degraded performance at low bit-widths. In this paper, we propose a
DMQ which combines Learned Equivalent Scaling (LES) and channel-wise
Power-of-Two Scaling (PTS) to effectively address these challenges. Learned
Equivalent Scaling optimizes channel-wise scaling factors to redistribute
quantization difficulty between weights and activations, reducing overall
quantization error. Recognizing that early denoising steps, despite having
small quantization errors, crucially impact the final output due to error
accumulation, we incorporate an adaptive timestep weighting scheme to
prioritize these critical steps during learning. Furthermore, identifying that
layers such as skip connections exhibit high inter-channel variance, we
introduce channel-wise Power-of-Two Scaling for activations. To ensure robust
selection of PTS factors even with small calibration set, we introduce a voting
algorithm that enhances reliability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
method significantly outperforms existing works, especially at low bit-widths
such as W4A6 (4-bit weight, 6-bit activation) and W4A8, maintaining high image
generation quality and model stability. The code is available at

TL;DR: This paper proposes a framework using satellite imagery and deep learning for automatic landslide detection, with innovative techniques to enhance performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve automatic landslide detection while overcoming challenges such as imbalanced data and overfitting in deep learning algorithms.

Method: Combination of online and offline data augmentation to address data imbalance, EfficientNet_Large as the backbone deep learning model for feature extraction, and SVM classifier for post-processing.

Result: The framework achieved an impressive F1-score of 0.8938 on the public test set in the Zindi challenge.

Conclusion: The proposed model offers an effective approach to landslide detection, combining innovative augmentation techniques and robust classification methods to optimize performance.

Abstract: The use of satellite imagery combined with deep learning to support automatic
landslide detection is becoming increasingly widespread. However, selecting an
appropriate deep learning architecture to optimize performance while avoiding
overfitting remains a critical challenge. To address these issues, we propose a
deep-learning based framework for landslide detection from remote sensing image
in this paper. The proposed framework presents an effective combination of the
online an offline data augmentation to tackle the imbalanced data, a backbone
EfficientNet\_Large deep learning model for extracting robust embedding
features, and a post-processing SVM classifier to balance and enhance the
classification performance. The proposed model achieved an F1-score of 0.8938
on the public test set of the Zindi challenge.

*Yafei Zhang,Lingqi Kong,Huafeng Li,Jie Wen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a weakly supervised approach to cross-modal person re-identification (ReID), using single-modal identity labels instead of cross-modal ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address dependency on labeled cross-modal data in person ReID models and accommodate scenarios without such data.

Method: The study proposes a heterogeneous expert collaborative consistency learning framework that integrates predictions by specialized classification experts for each modality and uses cross-modal relationship fusion.

Result: Experimental results on two datasets demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method in achieving robust cross-modal identity recognition.

Conclusion: The proposed approach enhances modality-invariant feature extraction and tackles the challenge of missing cross-modal labels effectively for person ReID.

Abstract: To reduce the reliance of visible-infrared person re-identification (ReID)
models on labeled cross-modal samples, this paper explores a weakly supervised
cross-modal person ReID method that uses only single-modal sample identity
labels, addressing scenarios where cross-modal identity labels are unavailable.
To mitigate the impact of missing cross-modal labels on model performance, we
propose a heterogeneous expert collaborative consistency learning framework,
designed to establish robust cross-modal identity correspondences in a weakly
supervised manner. This framework leverages labeled data from each modality to
independently train dedicated classification experts. To associate cross-modal
samples, these classification experts act as heterogeneous predictors,
predicting the identities of samples from the other modality. To improve
prediction accuracy, we design a cross-modal relationship fusion mechanism that
effectively integrates predictions from different experts. Under the implicit
supervision provided by cross-modal identity correspondences, collaborative and
consistent learning among the experts is encouraged, significantly enhancing
the model's ability to extract modality-invariant features and improve
cross-modal identity recognition. Experimental results on two challenging
datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

*Yucheng Tang,Yunguan Fu,Weixi Yi,Yipei Wang,Daniel C. Alexander,Rhodri Davies,Yipeng Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a Multimodal Uncertainty Propagation Model (MUPM) to analyze uncertainties in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) using clinical data like cardiac MR scans and digital health records. The approach facilitates efficient uncertainty estimation, redundancy identification, and novel cardiac disease prediction tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in understanding interrelationships between input modalities, uncertainties in uni-modal data, and their clinical applications in large-scale MLLMs.

Method: A Multimodal Uncertainty Propagation Model (MUPM) is developed to optimize and generalize uncertainty quantifications using real clinical datasets and MLLMs with robust performance across different tasks and distributions.

Result: MUPMs are shown to be generalizable and transferable for diverse input data distributions. They reliably quantify uncertainties and identify redundant factors, enabling effective predictions for new cardiac disease tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed MUPM offers a novel way of modeling and analyzing uncertainties in MLLMs, fostering robust clinical applications, efficient predictions, and redundancy detection through multimodal inputs.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) can process and integrate
information from multimodality sources, such as text and images. However,
interrelationship among input modalities, uncertainties due to individual
uni-modal data and potential clinical applications following such an
uncertainty decomposition are yet fully understood in the context of
large-scale MLLMs. In this work, we propose a multimodal uncertainty
propagation model (MUPM) based on uncertainty propagation, to characterise the
relationship among the uncertainties arising from image-only, text-only, and
joint image-text variations in MLLM inputs. Using real clinical data consisting
of cardiac MR scans and digital health records, we describe that MUPMs can be
optimised robustly with a few samples. We then show that the fitted MUPMs are
generalisable across different input data distributions and, perhaps
surprisingly, across different downstream tasks. Such a transferability may be
explained by the shared pretraining, comparatively light MLLM fine-tuning,
along with the low-dimensional nature of the MUPMs. More importantly, this
learned transferability, quantifying the relationship between these
uncertainties, led to direct clinical applications in which uncertainties may
be estimated and thus analysed robustly for varying data or even a novel set of
cardiac disease prediction tasks. In addition, we show experimentally the
efficiency in multimodal data required for estimating the overall uncertainty
and its ability to identify redundant factors, both of which are considered
practical yet clinically useful applications with the proposed MUPMs. Codes are
available at https://github.com/yucheng722/MUPM.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces LoViC, a text-to-video generation framework that addresses scalability and coherence for long videos using a novel autoencoder, FlexFormer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scaling text-to-video generation to long-duration content remains a challenge due to quadratic complexity in self-attention, and existing methods compromise coherence or scalability.

Method: The authors propose LoViC, utilizing the FlexFormer autoencoder which compresses video and text into unified latent representations with variable-length inputs. This is achieved using a single query token design based on Q-Former architecture and position-aware mechanisms.

Result: LoViC successfully generates long, coherent videos through segment-wise generation and supports various tasks like prediction and interpolation, validated by extensive experiments across diverse scenarios.

Conclusion: LoViC demonstrates scalability and effectiveness for long-duration, coherent video generation within a unified framework, offering advancements over prior approaches.

Abstract: Despite recent advances in diffusion transformers (DiTs) for text-to-video
generation, scaling to long-duration content remains challenging due to the
quadratic complexity of self-attention. While prior efforts -- such as sparse
attention and temporally autoregressive models -- offer partial relief, they
often compromise temporal coherence or scalability. We introduce LoViC, a
DiT-based framework trained on million-scale open-domain videos, designed to
produce long, coherent videos through a segment-wise generation process. At the
core of our approach is FlexFormer, an expressive autoencoder that jointly
compresses video and text into unified latent representations. It supports
variable-length inputs with linearly adjustable compression rates, enabled by a
single query token design based on the Q-Former architecture. Additionally, by
encoding temporal context through position-aware mechanisms, our model
seamlessly supports prediction, retradiction, interpolation, and multi-shot
generation within a unified paradigm. Extensive experiments across diverse
tasks validate the effectiveness and versatility of our approach.

*Sidaty El Hadramy,Oumeymah Cherkaoui,Philippe C. Cattin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces cIDIR, a framework that uses Implicit Neural Representations for more efficient deformable image registration by conditioning regularization on hyperparameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to overcome the inefficiency of fine-tuning regularization parameters in traditional learning-based deformable image registration (DIR) methods, which is computationally expensive.

Method: The paper proposes cIDIR, which trains on a prior distribution of regularization hyperparameters, enabling optimization without retraining. It employs segmentations masks as observations and uses continuous, differentiable deformation vector fields for integration of advanced techniques.

Result: The framework shows high accuracy and robustness when evaluated on the DIR-LAB dataset, outperforming traditional approaches.

Conclusion: cIDIR achieves efficient and accurate deformable image registration by leveraging implicit neural representations and automatic differentiation, reducing computational burden in handling regularization parameters.

Abstract: Regularization is essential in deformable image registration (DIR) to ensure
that the estimated Deformation Vector Field (DVF) remains smooth, physically
plausible, and anatomically consistent. However, fine-tuning regularization
parameters in learning-based DIR frameworks is computationally expensive, often
requiring multiple training iterations. To address this, we propose cIDI, a
novel DIR framework based on Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) that
conditions the registration process on regularization hyperparameters. Unlike
conventional methods that require retraining for each regularization
hyperparameter setting, cIDIR is trained over a prior distribution of these
hyperparameters, then optimized over the regularization hyperparameters by
using the segmentations masks as an observation. Additionally, cIDIR models a
continuous and differentiable DVF, enabling seamless integration of advanced
regularization techniques via automatic differentiation. Evaluated on the
DIR-LAB dataset, $\operatorname{cIDIR}$ achieves high accuracy and robustness
across the dataset.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents FantasyPortrait, a framework for generating expressive facial animations from static images using a diffusion transformer, with a focus on subtle emotions and multi-character animations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing solutions struggle with capturing fine emotions in cross reenactment and managing multi-character animations due to feature interference.

Method: The authors employ an expression-augmented learning strategy and a masked cross-attention mechanism for better emotion control and independence in multi-character expressions.

Result: The proposed method significantly surpasses existing models in qualitative and quantitative evaluations, particularly excelling in cross reenactment and multi-character scenarios.

Conclusion: FantasyPortrait resolves critical limitations in prior methods by enabling high-fidelity single- and multi-character portrait animations. The newly introduced Multi-Expr dataset and ExprBench benchmarks further advance the research domain.

Abstract: Producing expressive facial animations from static images is a challenging
task. Prior methods relying on explicit geometric priors (e.g., facial
landmarks or 3DMM) often suffer from artifacts in cross reenactment and
struggle to capture subtle emotions. Furthermore, existing approaches lack
support for multi-character animation, as driving features from different
individuals frequently interfere with one another, complicating the task. To
address these challenges, we propose FantasyPortrait, a diffusion transformer
based framework capable of generating high-fidelity and emotion-rich animations
for both single- and multi-character scenarios. Our method introduces an
expression-augmented learning strategy that utilizes implicit representations
to capture identity-agnostic facial dynamics, enhancing the model's ability to
render fine-grained emotions. For multi-character control, we design a masked
cross-attention mechanism that ensures independent yet coordinated expression
generation, effectively preventing feature interference. To advance research in
this area, we propose the Multi-Expr dataset and ExprBench, which are
specifically designed datasets and benchmarks for training and evaluating
multi-character portrait animations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
FantasyPortrait significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both
quantitative metrics and qualitative evaluations, excelling particularly in
challenging cross reenactment and multi-character contexts. Our project page is

*Ammar Ahmed,Ali Shariq Imran,Zenun Kastrati,Sher Muhammad Daudpota*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper explores improving wrist pathology diagnosis using computer vision, integrating X-ray images and patient metadata to enhance accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diagnosing wrist pathologies is time-consuming and requires specialized expertise, exacerbated by the challenge of limited medical imaging datasets.

Method: The approach includes fine-grained recognition of X-ray pathologies, fusing patient metadata with images, and using weights pre-trained on a fine-grained dataset.

Result: Results demonstrate a 2% accuracy improvement with a limited dataset and over 10% with a larger fracture-focused dataset.

Conclusion: Integrating metadata and adopting a fine-grained methodology significantly enhances wrist pathology diagnostic capabilities, especially for constrained datasets.

Abstract: Wrist pathologies are frequently observed, particularly among children who
constitute the majority of fracture cases. However, diagnosing these conditions
is time-consuming and requires specialized expertise. Computer vision presents
a promising avenue, contingent upon the availability of extensive datasets, a
notable challenge in medical imaging. Therefore, reliance solely on one
modality, such as images, proves inadequate, especially in an era of diverse
and plentiful data types. In this study, we employ a multifaceted approach to
address the challenge of recognizing wrist pathologies using an extremely
limited dataset. Initially, we approach the problem as a fine-grained
recognition task, aiming to identify subtle X-ray pathologies that conventional
CNNs overlook. Secondly, we enhance network performance by fusing patient
metadata with X-ray images. Thirdly, rather than pre-training on a
coarse-grained dataset like ImageNet, we utilize weights trained on a
fine-grained dataset. While metadata integration has been used in other medical
domains, this is a novel application for wrist pathologies. Our results show
that a fine-grained strategy and metadata integration improve diagnostic
accuracy by 2% with a limited dataset and by over 10% with a larger
fracture-focused dataset.

### [119] [VisionThink: Smart and Efficient Vision Language Model via Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13348)
*Senqiao Yang,Junyi Li,Xin Lai,Bei Yu,Hengshuang Zhao,Jiaya Jia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VisionThink is a paradigm for visual token compression in vision-language models (VLMs) that dynamically adjusts visual token resolution case by case to enhance efficiency and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VLMs often use a large number of visual tokens to improve performance, which may be unnecessary for many real-world tasks.

Method: VisionThink starts by processing downsampled images and decides dynamically, using reinforcement learning and a "LLM-as-Judge" strategy, whether higher-resolution input is needed.

Result: VisionThink improves fine-grained understanding in OCR-related tasks, reduces visual token usage for simpler tasks, and achieves stable image resize call ratios through a carefully designed reward system.

Conclusion: The approach effectively balances task accuracy and computational efficiency, making it superior for both general VQA and OCR-specific tasks compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Recent advancements in vision-language models (VLMs) have improved
performance by increasing the number of visual tokens, which are often
significantly longer than text tokens. However, we observe that most real-world
scenarios do not require such an extensive number of visual tokens. While the
performance drops significantly in a small subset of OCR-related tasks, models
still perform accurately in most other general VQA tasks with only 1/4
resolution. Therefore, we propose to dynamically process distinct samples with
different resolutions, and present a new paradigm for visual token compression,
namely, VisionThink. It starts with a downsampled image and smartly decides
whether it is sufficient for problem solving. Otherwise, the model could output
a special token to request the higher-resolution image. Compared to existing
Efficient VLM methods that compress tokens using fixed pruning ratios or

### [120] [RGB Pre-Training Enhanced Unobservable Feature Latent Diffusion Model for Spectral Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12967)
*Keli Deng,Jie Nie,Yuntao Qian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents a method for spectral reconstruction (SR) which constructs hyperspectral images (HSIs) from RGB images by extending pre-trained RGB models to focus on spectral feature learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the challenge of estimating unobservable features in hyperspectral data, which contains critical spectral information missing in RGB images.

Method: They propose a two-stage pipeline: first, a spectral autoencoder (SpeUAE) extracts and compresses spectral features; second, distributions of these features are learned through a modified latent diffusion model (ULDM), leveraging pre-trained RGB models.

Result: Their method achieves state-of-the-art performance in spectral reconstruction and downstream applications like relighting tasks.

Conclusion: Extending RGB pre-trained models to handle spectral-spatial distributions enables more accurate spectral reconstructions while reducing redundancies in hyperspectral data.

Abstract: Spectral reconstruction (SR) is a crucial problem in image processing that
requires reconstructing hyperspectral images (HSIs) from the corresponding RGB
images. A key difficulty in SR is estimating the unobservable feature, which
encapsulates significant spectral information not captured by RGB imaging
sensors. The solution lies in effectively constructing the spectral-spatial
joint distribution conditioned on the RGB image to complement the unobservable
feature. Since HSIs share a similar spatial structure with the corresponding
RGB images, it is rational to capitalize on the rich spatial knowledge in RGB
pre-trained models for spectral-spatial joint distribution learning. To this
end, we extend the RGB pre-trained latent diffusion model (RGB-LDM) to an
unobservable feature LDM (ULDM) for SR. As the RGB-LDM and its corresponding
spatial autoencoder (SpaAE) already excel in spatial knowledge, the ULDM can
focus on modeling spectral structure. Moreover, separating the unobservable
feature from the HSI reduces the redundant spectral information and empowers
the ULDM to learn the joint distribution in a compact latent space.
Specifically, we propose a two-stage pipeline consisting of spectral structure
representation learning and spectral-spatial joint distribution learning to
transform the RGB-LDM into the ULDM. In the first stage, a spectral
unobservable feature autoencoder (SpeUAE) is trained to extract and compress
the unobservable feature into a 3D manifold aligned with RGB space. In the
second stage, the spectral and spatial structures are sequentially encoded by
the SpeUAE and the SpaAE, respectively. The ULDM is then acquired to model the
distribution of the coded unobservable feature with guidance from the
corresponding RGB images. Experimental results on SR and downstream relighting
tasks demonstrate that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art
performance.

*Uranik Berisha,Jens Mehnert,Alexandru Paul Condurache*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Variance-Based Pruning, a one-shot structured pruning method to compress large neural networks with minimal fine-tuning, significantly reducing computational demands while retaining high model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models, especially Vision Transformers, have increasing computational costs and deployment challenges on resource-limited hardware, creating a need to reduce their complexity efficiently without long and expensive retraining.

Method: The proposed Variance-Based Pruning method utilizes activation statistics to select neurons for pruning, while reintegrating mean activations back into the model to preserve performance. Only minimal fine-tuning is needed post-pruning.

Result: Experiments on the ImageNet-1k dataset show that DeiT-Base retains over 70% of its original accuracy immediately after pruning, regains 99% accuracy with 10 epochs of fine-tuning, reduces MACs by 35%, and decreases model size by 36%, leading to a 1.44x speed-up.

Conclusion: Variance-Based Pruning offers an effective and practical approach for structured model compression, addressing deployment challenges while maintaining performance with minimal retraining.

Abstract: Increasingly expensive training of ever larger models such as Vision
Transfomers motivate reusing the vast library of already trained
state-of-the-art networks. However, their latency, high computational costs and
memory demands pose significant challenges for deployment, especially on
resource-constrained hardware. While structured pruning methods can reduce
these factors, they often require costly retraining, sometimes for up to
hundreds of epochs, or even training from scratch to recover the lost accuracy
resulting from the structural modifications. Maintaining the provided
performance of trained models after structured pruning and thereby avoiding
extensive retraining remains a challenge. To solve this, we introduce
Variance-Based Pruning, a simple and structured one-shot pruning technique for
efficiently compressing networks, with minimal finetuning. Our approach first
gathers activation statistics, which are used to select neurons for pruning.
Simultaneously the mean activations are integrated back into the model to
preserve a high degree of performance. On ImageNet-1k recognition tasks, we
demonstrate that directly after pruning DeiT-Base retains over 70% of its
original performance and requires only 10 epochs of fine-tuning to regain 99%
of the original accuracy while simultaneously reducing MACs by 35% and model
size by 36%, thus speeding up the model by 1.44x.

### [122] [Differential-informed Sample Selection Accelerates Multimodal Contrastive Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12998)
*Zihua Zhao,Feng Hong,Mengxi Chen,Pengyi Chen,Benyuan Liu,Jiangchao Yao,Ya Zhang,Yanfeng Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces DISSect, a sample selection method for efficient training of multimodal models, improving noisy correspondence handling and accelerating training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal models require extensive datasets and compute resources. Efficient sample selection methods are needed to accelerate training without relying heavily on oracle models or overly depending on noisy, real-time predictions.

Method: DISSect uses the differential in predicted correlations between the current and historical models to effectively identify high-quality samples, addressing noisy correspondence issues. The method is robust and theoretically analyzed.

Result: DISSect consistently outperforms current sample selection methods across three benchmark datasets and various downstream tasks.

Conclusion: DISSect provides an accurate and efficient mechanism for sample selection in multimodal training, enabling training acceleration while managing noisy data correspondence effectively.

Abstract: The remarkable success of contrastive-learning-based multimodal models has
been greatly driven by training on ever-larger datasets with expensive compute
consumption. Sample selection as an alternative efficient paradigm plays an
important direction to accelerate the training process. However, recent
advances on sample selection either mostly rely on an oracle model to offline
select a high-quality coreset, which is limited in the cold-start scenarios, or
focus on online selection based on real-time model predictions, which has not
sufficiently or efficiently considered the noisy correspondence. To address
this dilemma, we propose a novel Differential-Informed Sample Selection
(DISSect) method, which accurately and efficiently discriminates the noisy
correspondence for training acceleration. Specifically, we rethink the impact
of noisy correspondence on contrastive learning and propose that the
differential between the predicted correlation of the current model and that of
a historical model is more informative to characterize sample quality. Based on
this, we construct a robust differential-based sample selection and analyze its
theoretical insights. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets and
various downstream tasks demonstrate the consistent superiority of DISSect over
current state-of-the-art methods. Source code is available at:

### [123] [Beyond Fully Supervised Pixel Annotations: Scribble-Driven Weakly-Supervised Framework for Image Manipulation Localization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13018)
*Songlin Li,Guofeng Yu,Zhiqing Guo,Yunfeng Diao,Dan Ma,Gaobo Yang,Liejun Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper pioneers a weakly supervised approach using scribble annotations for image manipulation localization (IML), achieving notable performance surpassing fully supervised methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fully supervised IML requires extensive pixel-level annotations, making it resource-intensive and inefficient. Existing weakly supervised methods using image-level labels are limited by insufficient supervision, necessitating better alternatives.

Method: The authors introduce scribble annotations to mainstream IML datasets and propose a weakly supervised framework leveraging novel modules like PFMM, GAFM, and a confidence-aware entropy minimization loss to optimize feature modulation, fusion, and prediction consistency.

Result: The proposed method demonstrates superior performance compared to fully supervised models, both in-distribution and out-of-distribution, showcasing the potential of scribble annotations for efficient IML.

Conclusion: Scribble-based weak supervision offers an efficient alternative to pixel-level annotations for IML, achieving improved detection accuracy while reducing annotation effort, making the approach viable for broader applications.

Abstract: Deep learning-based image manipulation localization (IML) methods have
achieved remarkable performance in recent years, but typically rely on
large-scale pixel-level annotated datasets. To address the challenge of
acquiring high-quality annotations, some recent weakly supervised methods
utilize image-level labels to segment manipulated regions. However, the
performance is still limited due to insufficient supervision signals. In this
study, we explore a form of weak supervision that improves the annotation
efficiency and detection performance, namely scribble annotation supervision.
We re-annotated mainstream IML datasets with scribble labels and propose the
first scribble-based IML (Sc-IML) dataset. Additionally, we propose the first
scribble-based weakly supervised IML framework. Specifically, we employ
self-supervised training with a structural consistency loss to encourage the
model to produce consistent predictions under multi-scale and augmented inputs.
In addition, we propose a prior-aware feature modulation module (PFMM) that
adaptively integrates prior information from both manipulated and authentic
regions for dynamic feature adjustment, further enhancing feature
discriminability and prediction consistency in complex scenes. We also propose
a gated adaptive fusion module (GAFM) that utilizes gating mechanisms to
regulate information flow during feature fusion, guiding the model toward
emphasizing potential tampered regions. Finally, we propose a confidence-aware
entropy minimization loss (${\mathcal{L}}_{ {CEM }}$). This loss dynamically
regularizes predictions in weakly annotated or unlabeled regions based on model
uncertainty, effectively suppressing unreliable predictions. Experimental
results show that our method outperforms existing fully supervised approaches
in terms of average performance both in-distribution and out-of-distribution.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The research refines Masked AutoRegressive (MAR) models for efficient image generation, introducing MaskGIL, a model matching state-of-the-art AR results with fewer steps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve the performance of MAR models to match or exceed AR models in image generation quality and efficiency.

Method: Evaluate image tokenizers, introduce bidirectional attention and 2D RoPE in a refined MAR model architecture, and scale parameters for performance optimization.

Result: MaskGIL achieves a FID score of 3.71 on ImageNet 256x256, matches state-of-the-art AR models, operates with only 8 inference steps, and supports text-to-image generation and real-time speech-to-image conversion.

Conclusion: MaskGIL demonstrates that MAR models can achieve competitive performance and efficiency for image generation, with applications extending to real-time tasks.

Abstract: AutoRegressive (AR) models have made notable progress in image generation,
with Masked AutoRegressive (MAR) models gaining attention for their efficient
parallel decoding. However, MAR models have traditionally underperformed when
compared to standard AR models. This study refines the MAR architecture to
improve image generation quality. We begin by evaluating various image
tokenizers to identify the most effective one. Subsequently, we introduce an
improved Bidirectional LLaMA architecture by replacing causal attention with
bidirectional attention and incorporating 2D RoPE, which together form our
advanced model, MaskGIL. Scaled from 111M to 1.4B parameters, MaskGIL achieves
a FID score of 3.71, matching state-of-the-art AR models in the ImageNet
256x256 benchmark, while requiring only 8 inference steps compared to the 256
steps of AR models. Furthermore, we develop a text-driven MaskGIL model with
775M parameters for generating images from text at various resolutions. Beyond
image generation, MaskGIL extends to accelerate AR-based generation and enable
real-time speech-to-image conversion. Our codes and models are available at

*Jingyao Wang,Yiming Chen,Lingyu Si,Changwen Zheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a Hierarchical Coresets Selection (HCS) mechanism to enable Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to better understand complex wide-area scenes without requiring fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research was motivated by the limitations of existing Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in handling unseen, complex, wide-area scenes effectively.

Method: The proposed method, HCS, selects image regions based on an importance function that accounts for utility, representativeness, robustness, and synergy. This approach eliminates the need for model fine-tuning and requires minimal interpretable regions.

Result: HCS showed superior performance and compatibility across various scene understanding tasks when applied to VLMs.

Conclusion: The HCS mechanism improves VLM adaptability to complex wide-area scenes and enhances performance while maintaining universality and efficiency.

Abstract: Scene understanding is one of the core tasks in computer vision, aiming to
extract semantic information from images to identify objects, scene categories,
and their interrelationships. Although advancements in Vision-Language Models
(VLMs) have driven progress in this field, existing VLMs still face challenges
in adaptation to unseen complex wide-area scenes. To address the challenges,
this paper proposes a Hierarchical Coresets Selection (HCS) mechanism to
advance the adaptation of VLMs in complex wide-area scene understanding. It
progressively refines the selected regions based on the proposed theoretically
guaranteed importance function, which considers utility, representativeness,
robustness, and synergy. Without requiring additional fine-tuning, HCS enables
VLMs to achieve rapid understandings of unseen scenes at any scale using
minimal interpretable regions while mitigating insufficient feature density.
HCS is a plug-and-play method that is compatible with any VLM. Experiments
demonstrate that HCS achieves superior performance and universality in various
tasks.

### [126] [Label-Consistent Dataset Distillation with Detector-Guided Refinement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13074)
*Yawen Zou,Guang Li,Zi Wang,Chunzhi Gu,Chao Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a detector-guided framework in dataset distillation to address label inconsistencies and structural issues in synthetic data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve dataset distillation quality by addressing label inconsistencies and insufficient structural details in synthetic samples.

Method: Use a pre-trained detector to identify and refine faulty synthetic images. Replace these with optimized candidates generated by a diffusion model using confidence scores and diversity considerations.

Result: The proposed method synthesizes high-quality images with better label consistency and richer details, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: The framework effectively ensures label consistency and improves image quality, making it a robust approach for high-quality dataset distillation.

Abstract: Dataset distillation (DD) aims to generate a compact yet informative dataset
that achieves performance comparable to the original dataset, thereby reducing
demands on storage and computational resources. Although diffusion models have
made significant progress in dataset distillation, the generated surrogate
datasets often contain samples with label inconsistencies or insufficient
structural detail, leading to suboptimal downstream performance. To address
these issues, we propose a detector-guided dataset distillation framework that
explicitly leverages a pre-trained detector to identify and refine anomalous
synthetic samples, thereby ensuring label consistency and improving image
quality. Specifically, a detector model trained on the original dataset is
employed to identify anomalous images exhibiting label mismatches or low
classification confidence. For each defective image, multiple candidates are
generated using a pre-trained diffusion model conditioned on the corresponding
image prototype and label. The optimal candidate is then selected by jointly
considering the detector's confidence score and dissimilarity to existing
qualified synthetic samples, thereby ensuring both label accuracy and
intra-class diversity. Experimental results demonstrate that our method can
synthesize high-quality representative images with richer details, achieving
state-of-the-art performance on the validation set.

*Riku Inoue,Masamitsu Tsuchiya,Yuji Yasui*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces Channel-wise Motion Features, a more efficient method for motion segmentation, improving real-time performance by relying solely on pose networks, and achieving faster FPS with reduced parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve real-time performance and computational efficiency in motion segmentation for safety-critical robotic applications, particularly autonomous driving.

Method: The paper introduces Channel-wise Motion Features, a novel cost-volume-based motion feature representation, which uses only a Pose Network for extracting depth features and capturing 3D motion information.

Result: The proposed approach achieves approximately 4 times the FPS of state-of-the-art models on datasets like KITTI and Cityscapes while maintaining equivalent accuracy and reducing the parameters to about 25%.

Conclusion: Channel-wise Motion Features significantly enhance the efficiency and applicability of motion segmentation models by reducing computational costs while retaining performance, making it highly suitable for real-time applications.

Abstract: For safety-critical robotics applications such as autonomous driving, it is
important to detect all required objects accurately in real-time. Motion
segmentation offers a solution by identifying dynamic objects from the scene in
a class-agnostic manner. Recently, various motion segmentation models have been
proposed, most of which jointly use subnetworks to estimate Depth, Pose,
Optical Flow, and Scene Flow. As a result, the overall computational cost of
the model increases, hindering real-time performance.
  In this paper, we propose a novel cost-volume-based motion feature
representation, Channel-wise Motion Features. By extracting depth features of
each instance in the feature map and capturing the scene's 3D motion
information, it offers enhanced efficiency. The only subnetwork used to build
Channel-wise Motion Features is the Pose Network, and no others are required.
Our method not only achieves about 4 times the FPS of state-of-the-art models
in the KITTI Dataset and Cityscapes of the VCAS-Motion Dataset, but also
demonstrates equivalent accuracy while reducing the parameters to about 25$\%$.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper addresses the challenges in Open World Object Detection (OWOD) by proposing "Decoupled PROB," which introduces ETOP and TDQI techniques to enhance performance and resolve learning conflicts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges in OWOD tasks, which involve detecting unknown objects without supervision and incrementally learning new classes without forgetting, particularly focusing on the limitations of the current state-of-the-art PROB model.

Method: Introduces "Decoupled PROB" with two key techniques: Early Termination of Objectness Prediction (ETOP) to mitigate learning conflicts and Task-Decoupled Query Initialization (TDQI) for better feature extraction of known and unknown objects.

Result: The proposed Decoupled PROB model outperforms all existing OWOD methods on standard benchmarks, achieving significant improvements across multiple performance metrics.

Conclusion: Decoupled PROB is a robust and efficient solution for OWOD tasks, resolving key limitations of the PROB model and setting a new benchmark in the field.

Abstract: Open World Object Detection (OWOD) is a challenging computer vision task that
extends standard object detection by (1) detecting and classifying unknown
objects without supervision, and (2) incrementally learning new object classes
without forgetting previously learned ones. The absence of ground truths for
unknown objects makes OWOD tasks particularly challenging. Many methods have
addressed this by using pseudo-labels for unknown objects. The recently
proposed Probabilistic Objectness transformer-based open-world detector (PROB)
is a state-of-the-art model that does not require pseudo-labels for unknown
objects, as it predicts probabilistic objectness. However, this method faces
issues with learning conflicts between objectness and class predictions.
  To address this issue and further enhance performance, we propose a novel
model, Decoupled PROB. Decoupled PROB introduces Early Termination of
Objectness Prediction (ETOP) to stop objectness predictions at appropriate
layers in the decoder, resolving the learning conflicts between class and
objectness predictions in PROB. Additionally, we introduce Task-Decoupled Query
Initialization (TDQI), which efficiently extracts features of known and unknown
objects, thereby improving performance. TDQI is a query initialization method
that combines query selection and learnable queries, and it is a module that
can be easily integrated into existing DETR-based OWOD models. Extensive
experiments on OWOD benchmarks demonstrate that Decoupled PROB surpasses all
existing methods across several metrics, significantly improving performance.

*Han Zhang,Xiangde Luo,Yong Chen,Kang Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DiffOSeg is a two-stage diffusion-based framework tackling annotation variability in medical image segmentation by addressing both consensus and expert-specific preferences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the issue of annotation variability in medical image segmentation due to ambiguous imaging boundaries and differing clinical expertise, which traditional deep learning models fail to effectively handle.

Method: The proposed framework, DiffOSeg, employs a two-stage diffusion-based approach: Stage I provides a population consensus through probabilistic strategies, while Stage II adapts prompts to reflect expert-specific preferences.

Result: When evaluated on two public datasets (LIDC-IDRI and NPC-170), DiffOSeg outperformed state-of-the-art methods on all examined metrics.

Conclusion: DiffOSeg provides a comprehensive solution for medical image segmentation by simultaneously capturing consensus and individual expert preferences, demonstrating its utility and effectiveness.

Abstract: Annotation variability remains a substantial challenge in medical image
segmentation, stemming from ambiguous imaging boundaries and diverse clinical
expertise. Traditional deep learning methods producing single deterministic
segmentation predictions often fail to capture these annotator biases. Although
recent studies have explored multi-rater segmentation, existing methods
typically focus on a single perspective -- either generating a probabilistic
``gold standard'' consensus or preserving expert-specific preferences -- thus
struggling to provide a more omni view. In this study, we propose DiffOSeg, a
two-stage diffusion-based framework, which aims to simultaneously achieve both
consensus-driven (combining all experts' opinions) and preference-driven
(reflecting experts' individual assessments) segmentation. Stage I establishes
population consensus through a probabilistic consensus strategy, while Stage II
captures expert-specific preference via adaptive prompts. Demonstrated on two
public datasets (LIDC-IDRI and NPC-170), our model outperforms existing
state-of-the-art methods across all evaluated metrics. Source code is available

*Yuqi Peng,Pengfei Wang,Jianzhuang Liu,Shifeng Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces GLAD, a simplified framework for tuning pre-trained vision-language models to address overfitting and dependency on task-specific architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing prompt-tuning methods face challenges like overfitting in few-shot scenarios and reliance on complex architectures and hyperparameters.

Method: The proposed GLAD framework applies LoRA for tuning and introduces a gradient-based regularization technique to enhance model stability.

Result: Extensive experiments on 15 datasets showed GLAD achieves superior generalization across classes, image domains, and datasets.

Conclusion: GLAD is a simpler, generalizable, and effective approach that overcomes previous limitations in tuning models for downstream tasks.

Abstract: Pre-trained vision-language models, such as CLIP, show impressive zero-shot
recognition ability and can be easily transferred to specific downstream tasks
via prompt tuning, even with limited training data. However, existing prompt
tuning methods face two main challenges: (1) In few-shot scenarios, data
scarcity often leads to overfitting, making the model sensitive to changes in
the input domain. (2) To mitigate overfitting, these methods typically rely on
complex task-specific model architectures and sensitive hyperparameter tuning,
severely restricting their general applicability. To address these issues, we
propose a simpler and more general framework called GLAD (Generalizable LoRA
tuning with RegulArized GraDient). We show that merely applying LoRA achieves
performance in downstream tasks comparable to current state-of-the-art
prompt-based methods. While LoRA is effective and easy to use, it remains
susceptible to overfitting in few-shot learning scenarios. To mitigate this
risk, we introduce a gradient-based regularization technique. This technique
effectively steers the optimization trajectory, encouraging the model to find a
more stable parameter region that is robust to variations in data distribution.
Through extensive experiments conducted on 15 benchmark datasets, we
demonstrate that GLAD outperforms previous tuning approaches in terms of
base-to-novel class generalization, image domain generalization, and
cross-dataset generalization. The code will be publicly available.

TL;DR: This paper proposes an automated pipeline for assessing fetal lung maturity using diffusion-weighted MRI with deep learning-based segmentation, achieving high accuracy and comparable results to manual segmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fetal lung maturity predicts neonatal outcomes and guides clinical intervention, but current methods relying on manual segmentation are time-consuming.

Method: They developed a pipeline using a 3D nnU-Net model for automatic fetal lung segmentation on MRI images, followed by model-fitting for IVIM parameter analysis.

Result: The automated segmentation yielded a mean Dice coefficient of 82.14% and showed comparable IVIM parameter assessment results to manual segmentation.

Conclusion: The proposed pipeline offers a reliable, automated solution for fetal lung maturity evaluation, enhancing its clinical applicability.

Abstract: Fetal lung maturity is a critical indicator for predicting neonatal outcomes
and the need for post-natal intervention, especially for pregnancies affected
by fetal growth restriction. Intra-voxel incoherent motion analysis has shown
promising results for non-invasive assessment of fetal lung development, but
its reliance on manual segmentation is time-consuming, thus limiting its
clinical applicability. In this work, we present an automated lung maturity
evaluation pipeline for diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance images that
consists of a deep learning-based fetal lung segmentation model and a
model-fitting lung maturity assessment. A 3D nnU-Net model was trained on
manually segmented images selected from the baseline frames of 4D
diffusion-weighted MRI scans. The segmentation model demonstrated robust
performance, yielding a mean Dice coefficient of 82.14%. Next, voxel-wise model
fitting was performed based on both the nnU-Net-predicted and manual lung
segmentations to quantify IVIM parameters reflecting tissue microstructure and
perfusion. The results suggested no differences between the two. Our work shows
that a fully automated pipeline is possible for supporting fetal lung maturity
assessment and clinical decision-making.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces Redundancy-Removal Mixture of Experts (R^2MoE), a technique for lifelong learning of visual concepts while addressing catastrophic forgetting and minimizing parameter expansion, achieving state-of-the-art results in terms of conceptual fidelity and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enable large-scale generative models to personalize visual concepts continuously for individual user preferences, overcoming the challenges of catastrophic forgetting and parameter inefficiency.

Method: The proposed method involves (1) a mixture-of-experts framework with routing distillation to mitigate forgetting, (2) a strategy to eliminate redundant experts for parameter efficiency, and (3) hierarchical local attention-guided inference to reduce concept interference.

Result: The R^2MoE framework achieved a significant 87.8% reduction in forgetting rates and 63.3% fewer parameters on the CustomConcept 101 dataset while generating highly accurate visual concepts.

Conclusion: The R^2MoE framework is a parameter-efficient solution for lifelong visual concept learning, effectively balancing new concept acquisition, reduced forgetting, and minimal parameter overhead.

Abstract: Enabling large-scale generative models to continuously learn new visual
concepts is essential for personalizing pre-trained models to meet individual
user preferences. Existing approaches for continual visual concept learning are
constrained by two fundamental challenges: catastrophic forgetting and
parameter expansion. In this paper, we propose Redundancy-Removal Mixture of
Experts (R^2MoE), a parameter-efficient framework for lifelong visual concept
learning that effectively learns new concepts while incurring minimal parameter
overhead. Our framework includes three key innovative contributions: First, we
propose a mixture-of-experts framework with a routing distillation mechanism
that enables experts to acquire concept-specific knowledge while preserving the
gating network's routing capability, thereby effectively mitigating
catastrophic forgetting. Second, we propose a strategy for eliminating
redundant layer-wise experts that reduces the number of expert parameters by
fully utilizing previously learned experts. Third, we employ a hierarchical
local attention-guided inference approach to mitigate interference between
generated visual concepts. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that our
method generates images with superior conceptual fidelity compared to the
state-of-the-art (SOTA) method, achieving an impressive 87.8\% reduction in
forgetting rates and 63.3\% fewer parameters on the CustomConcept 101 dataset.

*Zi Wang,Katsuya Hotta,Koichiro Kamide,Yawen Zou,Chao Zhang,Jun Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents a novel anomaly detection framework for 3D point clouds using a registration-based approach and cluster-wise analysis, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges like high computational cost, spatial misalignment sensitivity, and difficulty in localizing structural differences in high-resolution 3D point clouds for anomaly detection.

Method: The framework combines multi-prototype alignment for structural comparison with cluster-wise discrepancy analysis. Clustering is guided by keypoints to focus on feature-rich regions for robust anomaly evaluation.

Result: State-of-the-art results were achieved on the Real3D-AD benchmark for both object-level and point-level anomaly detection using just raw features.

Conclusion: Registration-based analysis with keypoint-guided clustering provides an effective solution to localizing anomalies in complex 3D point clouds.

Abstract: High-resolution 3D point clouds are highly effective for detecting subtle
structural anomalies in industrial inspection. However, their dense and
irregular nature imposes significant challenges, including high computational
cost, sensitivity to spatial misalignment, and difficulty in capturing
localized structural differences. This paper introduces a registration-based
anomaly detection framework that combines multi-prototype alignment with
cluster-wise discrepancy analysis to enable precise 3D anomaly localization.
Specifically, each test sample is first registered to multiple normal
prototypes to enable direct structural comparison. To evaluate anomalies at a
local level, clustering is performed over the point cloud, and similarity is
computed between features from the test sample and the prototypes within each
cluster. Rather than selecting cluster centroids randomly, a keypoint-guided
strategy is employed, where geometrically informative points are chosen as
centroids. This ensures that clusters are centered on feature-rich regions,
enabling more meaningful and stable distance-based comparisons. Extensive
experiments on the Real3D-AD benchmark demonstrate that the proposed method
achieves state-of-the-art performance in both object-level and point-level
anomaly detection, even using only raw features.

*Pranav Singh,Pravendra Singh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel multimodal infrared small target detection framework combining language and image data, resulting in improved accuracy and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing IRSTD methods rely solely on image modality, limiting their ability to effectively detect sparse, small targets in infrared blurry backgrounds.

Method: The proposed framework integrates language priors using GPT-4 vision model text descriptions to generate attention weights, improving target detection in conjunction with a newly curated multimodal infrared dataset.

Result: Experiments showcase significant performance improvements in IoU, nIoU, Pd, and Fa metrics on two subsets, surpassing the state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: Incorporating language guidance with image data enhances IRSTD effectiveness, setting a new benchmark for multimodal approaches in infrared target detection.

Abstract: IRSTD (InfraRed Small Target Detection) detects small targets in infrared
blurry backgrounds and is essential for various applications. The detection
task is challenging due to the small size of the targets and their sparse
distribution in infrared small target datasets. Although existing IRSTD methods
and datasets have led to significant advancements, they are limited by their
reliance solely on the image modality. Recent advances in deep learning and
large vision-language models have shown remarkable performance in various
visual recognition tasks. In this work, we propose a novel multimodal IRSTD
framework that incorporates language priors to guide small target detection. We
leverage language-guided attention weights derived from the language prior to
enhance the model's ability for IRSTD, presenting a novel approach that
combines textual information with image data to improve IRSTD capabilities.
Utilizing the state-of-the-art GPT-4 vision model, we generate text
descriptions that provide the locations of small targets in infrared images,
employing careful prompt engineering to ensure improved accuracy. Due to the
absence of multimodal IR datasets, existing IRSTD methods rely solely on image
data. To address this shortcoming, we have curated a multimodal infrared
dataset that includes both image and text modalities for small target
detection, expanding upon the popular IRSTD-1k and NUDT-SIRST datasets. We
validate the effectiveness of our approach through extensive experiments and
comprehensive ablation studies. The results demonstrate significant
improvements over the state-of-the-art method, with relative percentage
differences of 9.74%, 13.02%, 1.25%, and 67.87% in IoU, nIoU, Pd, and Fa on the
NUAA-SIRST subset, and 4.41%, 2.04%, 2.01%, and 113.43% on the IRSTD-1k subset
of the LangIR dataset, respectively.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces RS-TinyNet, a model for detecting tiny objects in remote sensing images, achieving state-of-the-art performance through novel feature enhancement modules and multi-stage feature fusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Detecting tiny objects in remote sensing imagery is challenging due to limited spatial information, weak feature representation, and dense distributions on complex backgrounds. Existing methods underperform in such scenarios.

Method: The authors propose RS-TinyNet, which integrates novel designs like tiny object saliency modeling and feature integrity reconstruction. It employs three key modules: multi-dimensional collaborative attention (MDCA), auxiliary reversible branch (ARB), and progressive fusion detection head (PFDH) for enhancing saliency, maintaining information flow, and fusing multi-level features.

Result: Experiments on the public AI-TOD dataset show RS-TinyNet surpassing existing SOTA detectors by 4.0% AP and 6.5% AP75. Further validation on the DIOR benchmark demonstrates its superior detection performance across different scenarios.

Conclusion: RS-TinyNet is a highly effective and practical solution for tiny object detection in complex remote sensing environments, leveraging multi-stage feature fusion and enhancement strategies.

Abstract: Detecting tiny objects in remote sensing (RS) imagery has been a
long-standing challenge due to their extremely limited spatial information,
weak feature representations, and dense distributions across complex
backgrounds. Despite numerous efforts devoted, mainstream detectors still
underperform in such scenarios. To bridge this gap, we introduce RS-TinyNet, a
multi-stage feature fusion and enhancement model explicitly tailored for RS
tiny object detection in various RS scenarios. RS-TinyNet comes with two novel
designs: tiny object saliency modeling and feature integrity reconstruction.
Guided by these principles, we design three step-wise feature enhancement
modules. Among them, the multi-dimensional collaborative attention (MDCA)
module employs multi-dimensional attention to enhance the saliency of tiny
objects. Additionally, the auxiliary reversible branch (ARB) and a progressive
fusion detection head (PFDH) module are introduced to preserve information flow
and fuse multi-level features to bridge semantic gaps and retain structural
detail. Comprehensive experiments on public RS dataset AI-TOD show that our
RS-TinyNet surpasses existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) detectors by 4.0% AP and
6.5% AP75. Evaluations on DIOR benchmark dataset further validate its superior
detection performance in diverse RS scenarios. These results demonstrate that
the proposed multi-stage feature fusion strategy offers an effective and
practical solution for tiny object detection in complex RS environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current world models in autonomous driving exhibit limitations in long-horizon generation and adaptability to complex scenarios, necessitating advancements.

Method: The researchers developed a streamlined model trained on 280 hours of video data, utilizing a hybrid tokenizer to compare discrete and continuous token approaches.

Result: The study demonstrated state-of-the-art performance of the continuous autoregressive model, especially in intricate driving scenarios like urban traffic and turning maneuvers.

Conclusion: Continuous models prove to be less fragile and more powerful than discrete token-based models in autonomous driving applications.

Abstract: Existing world models for autonomous driving struggle with long-horizon
generation and generalization to challenging scenarios. In this work, we
develop a model using simple design choices, and without additional supervision
or sensors, such as maps, depth, or multiple cameras. We show that our model
yields state-of-the-art performance, despite having only 469M parameters and
being trained on 280h of video data. It particularly stands out in difficult
scenarios like turning maneuvers and urban traffic. We test whether discrete
token models possibly have advantages over continuous models based on flow
matching. To this end, we set up a hybrid tokenizer that is compatible with
both approaches and allows for a side-by-side comparison. Our study concludes
in favor of the continuous autoregressive model, which is less brittle on
individual design choices and more powerful than the model built on discrete
tokens. Code, models and qualitative results are publicly available at

*Hongyang Zhao,Tianyu Liang,Sina Davari,Daeho Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method for generating synthetic images using Midjourney to address data scarcity in training deep neural networks for construction worker detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of diverse and substantial data in the construction domain for training visual AI models.

Method: A generative AI platform (Midjourney) was used to create 12,000 synthetic images through 3000 distinct prompts, followed by manual labeling and dataset preparation for DNN training.

Result: The model trained on this dataset achieved an AP of 0.937 and 0.642 on real construction data at IoU thresholds of 0.5 and 0.5-0.95, respectively. Near-perfect performance was achieved on the synthetic dataset with APs of 0.994 and 0.919.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the promise of generative AI in addressing data scarcity for training but also highlights its limitations.

Abstract: While recent advancements in deep neural networks (DNNs) have substantially
enhanced visual AI's capabilities, the challenge of inadequate data diversity
and volume remains, particularly in construction domain. This study presents a
novel image synthesis methodology tailored for construction worker detection,
leveraging the generative-AI platform Midjourney. The approach entails
generating a collection of 12,000 synthetic images by formulating 3000
different prompts, with an emphasis on image realism and diversity. These
images, after manual labeling, serve as a dataset for DNN training. Evaluation
on a real construction image dataset yielded promising results, with the model
attaining average precisions (APs) of 0.937 and 0.642 at
intersection-over-union (IoU) thresholds of 0.5 and 0.5 to 0.95, respectively.
Notably, the model demonstrated near-perfect performance on the synthetic
dataset, achieving APs of 0.994 and 0.919 at the two mentioned thresholds.
These findings reveal both the potential and weakness of generative AI in
addressing DNN training data scarcity.

*Keerthi Veeramachaneni,Praveen Tirupattur,Amrit Singh Bedi,Mubarak Shah*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a method to detect AI-generated videos using pre-trained visual models, achieving a detection accuracy of over 90% on a new dataset (VID-AID) and plans to release resources for further research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The advancement of video generation technology beyond deepfakes has created an urgent need for methods to detect AI-generated videos with generic content to combat misinformation, ensure privacy, and address security threats.

Method: Leveraging features from pre-trained visual models trained on real visual content, the authors distinguish between real and AI-generated videos. They incorporate a simple linear classification layer to improve detection performance.

Result: The proposed method achieves over 90% average detection accuracy on a dataset (VID-AID) consisting of 10,000 AI-generated and 4,000 real videos.

Conclusion: The approach effectively detects AI-generated videos with high accuracy and demonstrates the utility of pre-trained visual models. Plans to release resources aim to support and advance research in this domain.

Abstract: Recent advances in Generative AI (GenAI) have led to significant improvements
in the quality of generated visual content. As AI-generated visual content
becomes increasingly indistinguishable from real content, the challenge of
detecting the generated content becomes critical in combating misinformation,
ensuring privacy, and preventing security threats. Although there has been
substantial progress in detecting AI-generated images, current methods for
video detection are largely focused on deepfakes, which primarily involve human
faces. However, the field of video generation has advanced beyond DeepFakes,
creating an urgent need for methods capable of detecting AI-generated videos
with generic content. To address this gap, we propose a novel approach that
leverages pre-trained visual models to distinguish between real and generated
videos. The features extracted from these pre-trained models, which have been
trained on extensive real visual content, contain inherent signals that can
help distinguish real from generated videos. Using these extracted features, we
achieve high detection performance without requiring additional model training,
and we further improve performance by training a simple linear classification
layer on top of the extracted features. We validated our method on a dataset we
compiled (VID-AID), which includes around 10,000 AI-generated videos produced
by 9 different text-to-video models, along with 4,000 real videos, totaling
over 7 hours of video content. Our evaluation shows that our approach achieves
high detection accuracy, above 90% on average, underscoring its effectiveness.
Upon acceptance, we plan to publicly release the code, the pre-trained models,
and our dataset to support ongoing research in this critical area.

### [139] [Efficient Adaptation of Pre-trained Vision Transformer underpinned by Approximately Orthogonal Fine-Tuning Strategy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13260)
*Yiting Yang,Hao Luo,Yuan Sun,Qingsen Yan,Haokui Zhang,Wei Dong,Guoqing Wang,Peng Wang,Yang Yang,Hengtao Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces Approximately Orthogonal Fine-Tuning (AOFT) to enhance the generalization capability of fine-tuned Vision Transformers by ensuring orthogonality in down/up-projection matrices, achieving competitive performance in image classification tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors noticed that the approximate orthogonality in Vision Transformer (ViT) backbone matrices could reduce generalization error, but such a property was lacking in fine-tuning down/up-projection matrices, inspiring them to align their properties for improved performance.

Method: The method introduces a strategy called AOFT, which uses a single learnable vector to generate approximately orthogonal vectors for down/up-projection matrices to align their properties with the backbone.

Result: The proposed AOFT strategy demonstrates competitive performance on various downstream image classification tasks.

Conclusion: The AOFT method enhances the generalization capability of fine-tuned ViTs by ensuring approximate orthogonality in projection matrices, confirming its efficacy through extensive experiments.

Abstract: A prevalent approach in Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) of pre-trained
Vision Transformers (ViT) involves freezing the majority of the backbone
parameters and solely learning low-rank adaptation weight matrices to
accommodate downstream tasks. These low-rank matrices are commonly derived
through the multiplication structure of down-projection and up-projection
matrices, exemplified by methods such as LoRA and Adapter. In this work, we
observe an approximate orthogonality among any two row or column vectors within
any weight matrix of the backbone parameters; however, this property is absent
in the vectors of the down/up-projection matrices. Approximate orthogonality
implies a reduction in the upper bound of the model's generalization error,
signifying that the model possesses enhanced generalization capability. If the
fine-tuned down/up-projection matrices were to exhibit this same property as
the pre-trained backbone matrices, could the generalization capability of
fine-tuned ViTs be further augmented? To address this question, we propose an
Approximately Orthogonal Fine-Tuning (AOFT) strategy for representing the
low-rank weight matrices. This strategy employs a single learnable vector to
generate a set of approximately orthogonal vectors, which form the
down/up-projection matrices, thereby aligning the properties of these matrices
with those of the backbone. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our
method achieves competitive performance across a range of downstream image
classification tasks, confirming the efficacy of the enhanced generalization
capability embedded in the down/up-projection matrices.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces DiffClean, a model to counteract the impact of facial makeup on age estimation and face verification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the reliability of age estimation and face verification by addressing issues caused by makeup manipulation.

Method: Proposed DiffClean, a text-guided diffusion model designed to remove makeup traces from facial images.

Result: Achieved a 4.8% improvement in age estimation accuracy and an 8.9% enhancement in face verification TMR at FMR=0.01%.

Conclusion: DiffClean effectively mitigates the effects of makeup on facial analysis, outperforming competing methods in age verification and identity confirmation tasks.

Abstract: Accurate age verification can protect underage users from unauthorized access
to online platforms and e-commerce sites that provide age-restricted services.
However, accurate age estimation can be confounded by several factors,
including facial makeup that can induce changes to alter perceived identity and
age to fool both humans and machines. In this work, we propose DiffClean which
erases makeup traces using a text-guided diffusion model to defend against
makeup attacks. DiffClean improves age estimation (minor vs. adult accuracy by
4.8%) and face verification (TMR by 8.9% at FMR=0.01%) over competing baselines
on digitally simulated and real makeup images.

TL;DR: FashionPose enables text-guided generation of garment visualizations by predicting poses, generating detailed images, and adapting lighting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current garment visualization methods lack flexibility in adapting to diverse poses and lighting conditions while enabling personalized preview.

Method: FashionPose uses a 3-step pipeline: text-to-2D pose prediction, diffusion-based image generation, and lightweight relighting guided by natural language.

Result: The framework achieves accurate pose alignment, faithful garment rendering, and consistent relighting, as validated through experiments.

Conclusion: FashionPose offers a practical tool for personalized and adaptable virtual fashion displays in e-commerce contexts.

Abstract: Realistic and controllable garment visualization is critical for fashion
e-commerce, where users expect personalized previews under diverse poses and
lighting conditions. Existing methods often rely on predefined poses, limiting
semantic flexibility and illumination adaptability. To address this, we
introduce FashionPose, the first unified text-to-pose-to-relighting generation
framework. Given a natural language description, our method first predicts a 2D
human pose, then employs a diffusion model to generate high-fidelity person
images, and finally applies a lightweight relighting module, all guided by the
same textual input. By replacing explicit pose annotations with text-driven
conditioning, FashionPose enables accurate pose alignment, faithful garment
rendering, and flexible lighting control. Experiments demonstrate fine-grained
pose synthesis and efficient, consistent relighting, providing a practical
solution for personalized virtual fashion display.

TL;DR: The paper identifies reproducibility and benchmark-quality issues with the RPE benchmark for multimodal large language models and provides refined ground-truth annotations to improve consistency and reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Issues in fairness, consistency, and reproducibility in the RPE benchmark evaluations, along with problems like image redundancy, scenario imbalance, simple poses, and ambiguous text, hinder reliable assessments of pose-aware MLLMs.

Method: The authors performed meticulous visual matching to refine the ground-truth annotations and resolved reproducibility challenges by aligning them with the 3DPW dataset. These refined annotations are made publicly available.

Result: The paper resolves critical issues in RPE benchmark evaluations, improves the consistency of metrics like MPJPE and PA-MPJPE, and introduces open-source refined annotations.

Conclusion: By addressing deficiencies in the current RPE benchmark and releasing improved annotations, the study contributes to more reliable and uniform evaluations in human pose-aware multimodal reasoning research.

Abstract: The reasoning-based pose estimation (RPE) benchmark has emerged as a widely
adopted evaluation standard for pose-aware multimodal large language models
(MLLMs). Despite its significance, we identified critical reproducibility and
benchmark-quality issues that hinder fair and consistent quantitative
evaluations. Most notably, the benchmark utilizes different image indices from
those of the original 3DPW dataset, forcing researchers into tedious and
error-prone manual matching processes to obtain accurate ground-truth (GT)
annotations for quantitative metrics (\eg, MPJPE, PA-MPJPE). Furthermore, our
analysis reveals several inherent benchmark-quality limitations, including
significant image redundancy, scenario imbalance, overly simplistic poses, and
ambiguous textual descriptions, collectively undermining reliable evaluations
across diverse scenarios. To alleviate manual effort and enhance
reproducibility, we carefully refined the GT annotations through meticulous
visual matching and publicly release these refined annotations as an
open-source resource, thereby promoting consistent quantitative evaluations and
facilitating future advancements in human pose-aware multimodal reasoning.

Motivation: The paper addresses the real-time detection challenge for hand-object interactions, crucial for intuitive user experiences in egocentric vision applications.

Method: The proposed method features a cascaded architecture with an action recognition module (Mamba model using EfficientNetV2) and an object detection module (fine-tuned YOLOWorld). The modules function sequentially for efficient processing.

Result: The Mamba model achieves 38.52% p-AP on the ENIGMA-51 benchmark at 30fps, while the YOLOWorld model reaches 85.13% AP for detecting hands and objects.

Conclusion: The approach effectively balances efficiency and accuracy in real-time hand-object interaction detection, operating via a cascaded model architecture.

Abstract: Hand-object interaction detection remains an open challenge in real-time
applications, where intuitive user experiences depend on fast and accurate
detection of interactions with surrounding objects. We propose an efficient
approach for detecting hand-objects interactions from streaming egocentric
vision that operates in real time. Our approach consists of an action
recognition module and an object detection module for identifying active
objects upon confirmed interaction. Our Mamba model with EfficientNetV2 as
backbone for action recognition achieves 38.52% p-AP on the ENIGMA-51 benchmark
at 30fps, while our fine-tuned YOLOWorld reaches 85.13% AP for hand and object.
We implement our models in a cascaded architecture where the action recognition
and object detection modules operate sequentially. When the action recognition
predicts a contact state, it activates the object detection module, which in
turn performs inference on the relevant frame to detect and classify the active
object.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion Transformers (DiT) are computationally intensive, hindering their practical use for video generation tasks on mobile devices and for real-time purposes.

Method: The paper introduces three key optimizations: compressed variational autoencoder (VAE) for reduced dimensionality, KD-guided tri-level model pruning for mobile-friendly size, and adversarial step distillation to lower inference steps to four.

Result: The optimizations result in achieving over 10 frames per second (FPS) video generation on an iPhone 16 Pro Max, showcasing real-time capability.

Conclusion: The proposed strategies successfully enable high-quality, real-time video generation on mobile platforms while maintaining visual fidelity and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiT) have shown strong performance in video
generation tasks, but their high computational cost makes them impractical for
resource-constrained devices like smartphones, and real-time generation is even
more challenging. In this work, we propose a series of novel optimizations to
significantly accelerate video generation and enable real-time performance on
mobile platforms. First, we employ a highly compressed variational autoencoder
(VAE) to reduce the dimensionality of the input data without sacrificing visual
quality. Second, we introduce a KD-guided, sensitivity-aware tri-level pruning
strategy to shrink the model size to suit mobile platform while preserving
critical performance characteristics. Third, we develop an adversarial step
distillation technique tailored for DiT, which allows us to reduce the number
of inference steps to four. Combined, these optimizations enable our model to
achieve over 10 frames per second (FPS) generation on an iPhone 16 Pro Max,
demonstrating the feasibility of real-time, high-quality video generation on

TL;DR: The paper proposes a sliding iterative denoising process for improving spatio-temporal consistency in human view synthesis using 4D diffusion models, achieving better results than previous methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-fidelity view synthesis of humans using sparse-view videos suffers from insufficient observational data and spatio-temporal inconsistencies in generated videos from existing 4D diffusion models.

Method: The authors define a latent grid that encodes image, camera pose, and human pose information over space-time. A sliding iterative denoising process is applied alternately along spatial and temporal dimensions of the latent grid, which improves information flow and enhances 4D consistency while keeping GPU memory usage manageable.

Result: The method significantly enhances high-quality, consistent novel-view video synthesis and surpasses existing approaches, as demonstrated by evaluations on the DNA-Rendering and ActorsHQ datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed technique effectively addresses spatio-temporal inconsistency issues in sparse-view-based human view synthesis, enabling superior video quality and consistency compared to prior methods.

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of high-fidelity view synthesis of humans
with sparse-view videos as input. Previous methods solve the issue of
insufficient observation by leveraging 4D diffusion models to generate videos
at novel viewpoints. However, the generated videos from these models often lack
spatio-temporal consistency, thus degrading view synthesis quality. In this
paper, we propose a novel sliding iterative denoising process to enhance the
spatio-temporal consistency of the 4D diffusion model. Specifically, we define
a latent grid in which each latent encodes the image, camera pose, and human
pose for a certain viewpoint and timestamp, then alternately denoising the
latent grid along spatial and temporal dimensions with a sliding window, and
finally decode the videos at target viewpoints from the corresponding denoised
latents. Through the iterative sliding, information flows sufficiently across
the latent grid, allowing the diffusion model to obtain a large receptive field
and thus enhance the 4D consistency of the output, while making the GPU memory
consumption affordable. The experiments on the DNA-Rendering and ActorsHQ
datasets demonstrate that our method is able to synthesize high-quality and
consistent novel-view videos and significantly outperforms the existing
approaches. See our project page for interactive demos and video results:

Result: Using the IMBA loss, the proposed method showed significant improvements in the concept response capabilities of baseline models, achieving competitive results on a new benchmark (Inert-CompBench) and other public datasets.

Conclusion: The study successfully enhances the stability and accuracy of visual generation models in handling complex concepts with an efficient and minimally intrusive approach.

Abstract: In visual generation tasks, the responses and combinations of complex

TL;DR: AutoPartGen is a state-of-the-art model for generating 3D objects from parts in an autoregressive manner, based on latent space with strong compositionality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of generating compositional 3D objects with high-quality parts, motivated by the lack of effective methods for flexible and expressive part-based 3D generation.

Method: AutoPartGen builds on the latent representation of 3DShape2VecSet and uses an autoregressive approach to generate 3D object parts, conditioned on previous parts and input modalities like images, masks, or existing 3D objects.

Result: The model achieves state-of-the-art performance in generating high-quality 3D objects and their parts, with an automatic determination of part type and count.

Conclusion: AutoPartGen effectively demonstrates the capacity for compositional, autoregressive 3D part generation and assembly, advancing 3D reconstruction.

Abstract: We introduce AutoPartGen, a model that generates objects composed of 3D parts
in an autoregressive manner. This model can take as input an image of an
object, 2D masks of the object's parts, or an existing 3D object, and generate
a corresponding compositional 3D reconstruction. Our approach builds upon
3DShape2VecSet, a recent latent 3D representation with powerful geometric
expressiveness. We observe that this latent space exhibits strong compositional
properties, making it particularly well-suited for part-based generation tasks.
Specifically, AutoPartGen generates object parts autoregressively, predicting
one part at a time while conditioning on previously generated parts and
additional inputs, such as 2D images, masks, or 3D objects. This process
continues until the model decides that all parts have been generated, thus
determining automatically the type and number of parts. The resulting parts can
be seamlessly assembled into coherent objects or scenes without requiring
additional optimization. We evaluate both the overall 3D generation
capabilities and the part-level generation quality of AutoPartGen,
demonstrating that it achieves state-of-the-art performance in 3D part
generation.

Abstract: We introduce $\pi^3$, a feed-forward neural network that offers a novel
approach to visual geometry reconstruction, breaking the reliance on a
conventional fixed reference view. Previous methods often anchor their
reconstructions to a designated viewpoint, an inductive bias that can lead to
instability and failures if the reference is suboptimal. In contrast, $\pi^3$
employs a fully permutation-equivariant architecture to predict
affine-invariant camera poses and scale-invariant local point maps without any
reference frames. This design makes our model inherently robust to input
ordering and highly scalable. These advantages enable our simple and bias-free
approach to achieve state-of-the-art performance on a wide range of tasks,
including camera pose estimation, monocular/video depth estimation, and dense
point map reconstruction. Code and models are publicly available.

TL;DR: The paper explores improving hierarchical flow matching models by introducing mini-batch couplings to better adjust the complexity of velocity distributions, demonstrating the method's effectiveness on synthetic and imaging data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Expand the capability of hierarchical flow matching by addressing the uniform complexity limitations across different hierarchy levels in existing methodologies.

Method: Introduce mini-batch couplings to gradually modify the complexity of velocity distributions in hierarchical flow matching models.

Result: Showcased the advantages of the proposed approach through experiments on synthetic and imaging datasets, achieving promising performance.

Conclusion: Mini-batch couplings enhance hierarchical flow matching by enabling gradual complexity adjustments, delivering better results in multi-modal velocity modeling and data generation.

Abstract: Flow matching has emerged as a compelling generative modeling approach that
is widely used across domains. To generate data via a flow matching model, an
ordinary differential equation (ODE) is numerically solved via forward
integration of the modeled velocity field. To better capture the multi-modality
that is inherent in typical velocity fields, hierarchical flow matching was
recently introduced. It uses a hierarchy of ODEs that are numerically
integrated when generating data. This hierarchy of ODEs captures the
multi-modal velocity distribution just like vanilla flow matching is capable of
modeling a multi-modal data distribution. While this hierarchy enables to model
multi-modal velocity distributions, the complexity of the modeled distribution
remains identical across levels of the hierarchy. In this paper, we study how
to gradually adjust the complexity of the distributions across different levels
of the hierarchy via mini-batch couplings. We show the benefits of mini-batch
couplings in hierarchical rectified flow matching via compelling results on
synthetic and imaging data. Code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VideoITG proposes a system for customized frame sampling in videos, using human-like annotation processes for enhanced Video-LLMs performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods struggle with complex long video understanding using unsupervised learning paradigms, necessitating an approach to better utilize user instructions for frame sampling.

Method: The VidThinker pipeline, an automated annotation framework, generates detailed captions, retrieves relevant segments, and selects fine-grained frames aligned with user instructions.

Result: The VideoITG method achieves consistent improvements across multimodal video understanding benchmarks with the aid of Video-LLMs.

Conclusion: VideoITG demonstrates the potential for improved video understanding through instruction-aligned frame sampling and annotation methodologies.

Abstract: Recent studies have revealed that selecting informative and relevant video
frames can significantly improve the performance of Video Large Language Models
(Video-LLMs). Current methods, such as reducing inter-frame redundancy,
employing separate models for image-text relevance assessment, or utilizing
temporal video grounding for event localization, substantially adopt
unsupervised learning paradigms, whereas they struggle to address the complex
scenarios in long video understanding. We propose Instructed Temporal Grounding
for Videos (VideoITG), featuring customized frame sampling aligned with user
instructions. The core of VideoITG is the VidThinker pipeline, an automated
annotation framework that explicitly mimics the human annotation process.
First, it generates detailed clip-level captions conditioned on the
instruction; then, it retrieves relevant video segments through
instruction-guided reasoning; finally, it performs fine-grained frame selection
to pinpoint the most informative visual evidence. Leveraging VidThinker, we
construct the VideoITG-40K dataset, containing 40K videos and 500K instructed
temporal grounding annotations. We then design a plug-and-play VideoITG model,
which takes advantage of visual language alignment and reasoning capabilities
of Video-LLMs, for effective frame selection in a discriminative manner.
Coupled with Video-LLMs, VideoITG achieves consistent performance improvements
across multiple multimodal video understanding benchmarks, showing its
superiority and great potentials for video understanding.

*Yiliang Wan,Nitin Shivaraman,Akshaye Shenoi,Xiang Liu,Tao Luo,Jialin Li*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: This paper introduces 'Chora,' a new replication protocol optimized for modern data center systems, leveraging strong synchrony properties for enhanced performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to address the limitations of traditional state machine replication protocols in distributed systems, which operate under partially synchronous or asynchronous network conditions.

Method: The authors designed a network architecture with strong synchrony properties using kernel-bypass networking, multithreading, and loosened round length. They then co-designed the Chora replication protocol to exploit this synchrony for efficient pipelining and parallel proposal handling.

Result: Experiments showed Chora outperformed existing single-leader and multi-leader protocols by 255% and 109% in throughput, respectively.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that leveraging engineered synchrony in data centers enables significant efficiency gains in distributed protocols, validating the feasibility of their design approach.

Abstract: Distributed systems, such as state machine replication, are critical
infrastructures for modern applications. Practical distributed protocols make
minimum assumptions about the underlying network: They typically assume a
partially synchronous or fully asynchronous network model. In this work, we
argue that modern data center systems can be designed to provide strong
synchrony properties in the common case, where servers move in synchronous
lock-step rounds. We prove this hypothesis by engineering a practical design
that uses a combination of kernel-bypass network, multithreaded architecture,
and loosened round length, achieving a tight round bound under 2us. Leveraging
our engineered networks with strong synchrony, we co-design a new replication
protocol, Chora. Chora exploits the network synchrony property to efficiently
pipeline multiple replication instances, while allowing all replicas to propose
in parallel without extra coordination. Through experiments, we show that Chora
achieves 255% and 109% improvement in throughput over state-of-the-art
single-leader and multi-leader protocols, respectively.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in microservice systems caused by increased loads, such as uneven resource allocation, high latency, and low throughput.

Result: Experimental evaluations reveal enhanced response time, improved throughput, better resource utilization, cost efficiency, and adaptability under dynamic conditions.

Conclusion: The reinforcement learning-based method efficiently handles resource scheduling for microservices, providing adaptability and multi-objective optimization in diverse scenarios.

Abstract: This paper proposes a reinforcement learning-based method for microservice
resource scheduling and optimization, aiming to address issues such as uneven
resource allocation, high latency, and insufficient throughput in traditional
microservice architectures. In microservice systems, as the number of services
and the load increase, efficiently scheduling and allocating resources such as
computing power, memory, and storage becomes a critical research challenge. To
address this, the paper employs an intelligent scheduling algorithm based on
reinforcement learning. Through the interaction between the agent and the
environment, the resource allocation strategy is continuously optimized. In the
experiments, the paper considers different resource conditions and load
scenarios, evaluating the proposed method across multiple dimensions, including
response time, throughput, resource utilization, and cost efficiency. The
experimental results show that the reinforcement learning-based scheduling
method significantly improves system response speed and throughput under low
load and high concurrency conditions, while also optimizing resource
utilization and reducing energy consumption. Under multi-dimensional resource
conditions, the proposed method can consider multiple objectives and achieve
optimized resource scheduling. Compared to traditional static resource
allocation methods, the reinforcement learning model demonstrates stronger
adaptability and optimization capability. It can adjust resource allocation
strategies in real time, thereby maintaining good system performance in
dynamically changing load and resource environments.

Conclusion: MC$^2$A successfully demonstrates the potential of general-purpose hardware acceleration for MCMC applications, promoting their broader adoption in machine learning and optimization fields.

Abstract: An increasing number of applications are exploiting sampling-based algorithms
for planning, optimization, and inference. The Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
algorithms form the computational backbone of this emerging branch of machine
learning. Unfortunately, the high computational cost limits their feasibility

accelerator architecture with flexible and efficient support of MCMC kernels
with a pipeline of ISA-programmable tree-structured processing units,
reconfigurable samplers and a crossbar interconnect to support irregular
access. Thirdly, the core of \textbf{MC$^2$A} is powered by a novel Gumbel
sampler that eliminates exponential and normalization operations. In the
end-to-end case study, \textbf{MC$^2$A} achieves an overall {$307.6\times$,
$1.4\times$, $2.0\times$, $84.2\times$} speedup compared to the CPU, GPU, TPU

Motivation: To study the impact of reinforcement learning with verifiable reward signals on a small language model for reasoning tasks.

Method: The authors used enhancements to Group Relative Policy Optimization, implemented controlled KL regularization, clipping ratio, and frequent reference policy resets.

Result: Significant performance improvements were achieved: +14.7% in math, +13.9% in coding, and +54.8% in logic puzzles compared to baselines.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates the efficacy of advanced RL techniques for small language models and releases their model to promote further research.

Abstract: Recent advancements in reasoning-focused language models such as OpenAI's O1

*Yuxi Liu,Konpat Preechakul,Kananart Kuwaranancharoen,Yutong Bai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper identifies the limitations of parallelization in machine learning for inherently sequential problems, emphasizing the need for scaling serial computation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the overlooked limitations of current parallel-centric architectures in solving inherently serial problems.

Method: Formalize the constraints of existing parallel architectures using complexity theory and analyze their limitations on sequential tasks.

Result: Demonstrates why parallelized systems struggle with tasks that require dependent computational steps.

Conclusion: Scaling serial computation is essential alongside parallel computation for advancing AI in complex reasoning tasks.

Abstract: While machine learning has advanced through massive parallelization, we
identify a critical blind spot: some problems are fundamentally sequential.
These "inherently serial" problems-from mathematical reasoning to physical
simulations to sequential decision-making-require dependent computational steps
that cannot be parallelized. Drawing from complexity theory, we formalize this
distinction and demonstrate that current parallel-centric architectures face
fundamental limitations on such tasks. We argue that recognizing the serial
nature of computation holds profound implications on machine learning, model
design, hardware development. As AI tackles increasingly complex reasoning,
deliberately scaling serial computation-not just parallel computation-is
essential for continued progress.

TL;DR: The paper integrates mental imagery into machine thinking by proposing a new cognitive framework, detailing its validation and testing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Models and AI agents struggle with autonomous reasoning and integrating multi-domain knowledge, unlike humans.

Method: Proposes a machine thinking framework with a Cognitive Thinking Unit and three auxiliary units: Input Data, Needs, and Mental Imagery Units.

Result: Validated the framework using natural language and sketches as data inputs, showing its potential for improved decision-making.

Conclusion: Integrating mental imagery in cognitive frameworks can enhance machine reasoning, initiating thinking processes akin to humans.

Abstract: Although existing models can interact with humans and provide satisfactory
responses, they lack the ability to act autonomously or engage in independent
reasoning. Furthermore, input data in these models is typically provided as
explicit queries, even when some sensory data is already acquired.
  In addition, AI agents, which are computational entities designed to perform
tasks and make decisions autonomously based on their programming, data inputs,
and learned knowledge, have shown significant progress. However, they struggle
with integrating knowledge across multiple domains, unlike humans.
  Mental imagery plays a fundamental role in the brain's thinking process,
which involves performing tasks based on internal multisensory data, planned
actions, needs, and reasoning capabilities. In this paper, we investigate how
to integrate mental imagery into a machine thinking framework and how this
could be beneficial in initiating the thinking process. Our proposed machine
thinking framework integrates a Cognitive thinking unit supported by three
auxiliary units: the Input Data Unit, the Needs Unit, and the Mental Imagery
Unit. Within this framework, data is represented as natural language sentences
or drawn sketches, serving both informative and decision-making purposes. We
conducted validation tests for this framework, and the results are presented
and discussed.

TL;DR: The paper focuses on reducing the startup overhead in training large language models (LLMs), which accounts for significant wasted GPU time in industrial-scale environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training large language models faces challenges due to frequent failures and iterative debugging cycles, causing delays during startup overhead, wasting valuable GPU time.

Method: Bootseer, a system-level optimization framework, addresses startup bottlenecks via techniques like hot block record-and-prefetch, dependency snapshotting, and striped HDFS-FUSE.

Result: Bootseer achieved a 50% reduction in startup overhead in real LLM training workloads within production environments.

Conclusion: A systematic approach to minimizing startup overhead can significantly improve the efficiency of large-scale LLM training in industrial applications.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become a cornerstone of modern AI, driving
breakthroughs in natural language processing and expanding into multimodal jobs
involving images, audio, and video. As with most computational software, it is
important to distinguish between ordinary runtime performance and startup
overhead. Prior research has focused on runtime performance: improving training
efficiency and stability. This work focuses instead on the increasingly
critical issue of startup overhead in training: the delay before training jobs
begin execution. Startup overhead is particularly important in large,
industrial-scale LLMs, where failures occur more frequently and multiple teams
operate in iterative update-debug cycles. In one of our training clusters, more
than 3.5% of GPU time is wasted due to startup overhead alone.
  In this work, we present the first in-depth characterization of LLM training
startup overhead based on real production data. We analyze the components of
startup cost, quantify its direct impact, and examine how it scales with job
size. These insights motivate the design of Bootseer, a system-level
optimization framework that addresses three primary startup bottlenecks: (a)
container image loading, (b) runtime dependency installation, and (c) model
checkpoint resumption. To mitigate these bottlenecks, Bootseer introduces three
techniques: (a) hot block record-and-prefetch, (b) dependency snapshotting, and
(c) striped HDFS-FUSE. Bootseer has been deployed in a production environment
and evaluated on real LLM training workloads, demonstrating a 50% reduction in
startup overhead.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges of concept drift in data streams, propose improvements to dynamic selection techniques for efficient and accurate classification.

Method: Develop IncA-DES framework employing local experts, fusion of concept drift detector, overlap-based classification filters, and an optimized Online K-d tree algorithm.

Result: IncA-DES achieves the best average accuracy and faster processing time compared to seven state-of-the-art methods, with negligible accuracy loss from K-d tree optimization.

Conclusion: IncA-DES effectively handles concept drift in data streams, combining accuracy, efficiency, and scalability. Framework is publicly accessible.

Abstract: Data streams pose challenges not usually encountered in batch-based ML. One
of them is concept drift, which is characterized by the change in data
distribution over time. Among many approaches explored in literature, the
fusion of classifiers has been showing good results and is getting growing
attention. DS methods, due to the ensemble being instance-based, seem to be an
efficient choice under drifting scenarios. However, some attention must be paid
to adapting such methods for concept drift. The training must be done in order
to create local experts, and the commonly used neighborhood-search DS may
become prohibitive with the continuous arrival of data. In this work, we
propose IncA-DES, which employs a training strategy that promotes the
generation of local experts with the assumption that different regions of the
feature space become available with time. Additionally, the fusion of a concept
drift detector supports the maintenance of information and adaptation to a new
concept. An overlap-based classification filter is also employed in order to
avoid using the DS method when there is a consensus in the neighborhood, a
strategy that we argue every DS method should employ, as it was shown to make
them more applicable and quicker. Moreover, aiming to reduce the processing
time of the kNN, we propose an Online K-d tree algorithm, which can quickly
remove instances without becoming inconsistent and deals with unbalancing
concerns that may occur in data streams. Experimental results showed that the
proposed framework got the best average accuracy compared to seven
state-of-the-art methods considering different levels of label availability and
presented the smaller processing time between the most accurate methods.
Additionally, the fusion with the Online K-d tree has improved processing time
with a negligible loss in accuracy. We have made our framework available in an
online repository.

Result: ParametricSplit demonstrated superior performance in low-dimensional neural network layers and maintained competitive results in higher-dimensional settings.

Conclusion: Topology-aware activation functions like ParametricSplit can enhance neural network training, particularly in challenging topology scenarios, paving the way for future advancements.

Abstract: This study explores novel activation functions that enhance the ability of
neural networks to manipulate data topology during training. Building on the
limitations of traditional activation functions like $\mathrm{ReLU}$, we
propose $\mathrm{SmoothSplit}$ and $\mathrm{ParametricSplit}$, which introduce
topology "cutting" capabilities. These functions enable networks to transform
complex data manifolds effectively, improving performance in scenarios with
low-dimensional layers. Through experiments on synthetic and real-world

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of fairness in horizontal federated learning, where data heterogeneity causes substantial performance disparities across clients.

Method: Propose FedGA, employing the Gini coefficient to measure disparities, leveraging the relationship between Gini coefficient and global model update scale, and adjusting the aggregation weights dynamically according to system fairness status.

Result: FedGA improves fairness metrics (e.g., variance and Gini coefficient) while maintaining strong overall performance, as verified on Office-Caltech-10, CIFAR-10, and Synthetic datasets.

Conclusion: FedGA demonstrates its effectiveness in enhancing fairness in federated learning systems without sacrificing overall model performance.

Abstract: Fairness has emerged as one of the key challenges in federated learning. In
horizontal federated settings, data heterogeneity often leads to substantial
performance disparities across clients, raising concerns about equitable model
behavior. To address this issue, we propose FedGA, a fairness-aware federated
learning algorithm. We first employ the Gini coefficient to measure the
performance disparity among clients. Based on this, we establish a relationship
between the Gini coefficient $G$ and the update scale of the global model
${U_s}$, and use this relationship to adaptively determine the timing of
fairness intervention. Subsequently, we dynamically adjust the aggregation
weights according to the system's real-time fairness status, enabling the
global model to better incorporate information from clients with relatively
poor performance.We conduct extensive experiments on the Office-Caltech-10,
CIFAR-10, and Synthetic datasets. The results show that FedGA effectively
improves fairness metrics such as variance and the Gini coefficient, while
maintaining strong overall performance, demonstrating the effectiveness of our
approach.

Result: Assay2Mol achieved better performance than recent machine learning models in generating ligand molecules for target protein structures while maintaining synthesizability.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the utility of large language models in leveraging unstructured assay data, providing a novel avenue for improving early-stage drug discovery workflows.

Abstract: Scientific databases aggregate vast amounts of quantitative data alongside
descriptive text. In biochemistry, molecule screening assays evaluate the
functional responses of candidate molecules against disease targets.
Unstructured text that describes the biological mechanisms through which these
targets operate, experimental screening protocols, and other attributes of
assays offer rich information for new drug discovery campaigns but has been
untapped because of that unstructured format. We present Assay2Mol, a large
language model-based workflow that can capitalize on the vast existing
biochemical screening assays for early-stage drug discovery. Assay2Mol
retrieves existing assay records involving targets similar to the new target
and generates candidate molecules using in-context learning with the retrieved

that generate candidate ligand molecules for target protein structures, while

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to tackle the challenges of clustering ranking vectors, a specialized task involving ordered preference lists, which has practical applications in areas like personalization and decision making.

Method: The authors establish the NP-hardness of the problem, derive closed-form solutions for certain cases, propose the KRCA approximation algorithm, and introduce a branch-and-bound (BnB) algorithm for computational efficiency. They also provide theoretical error bounds.

Result: The KRCA algorithm delivers superior solution quality compared to baselines, with fast computational performance demonstrated on both synthetic and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: The methods proposed in this work provide significant advancements for ranking vector clustering, with implications for future research in decision-making and personalization systems.

Abstract: We study the problem of clustering ranking vectors, where each vector
represents preferences as an ordered list of distinct integers. Specifically,
we focus on the k-centroids ranking vectors clustering problem (KRC), which
aims to partition a set of ranking vectors into k clusters and identify the
centroid of each cluster. Unlike classical k-means clustering (KMC), KRC
constrains both the observations and centroids to be ranking vectors. We
establish the NP-hardness of KRC and characterize its feasible set. For the
single-cluster case, we derive a closed-form analytical solution for the
optimal centroid, which can be computed in linear time. To address the
computational challenges of KRC, we develop an efficient approximation
algorithm, KRCA, which iteratively refines initial solutions from KMC, referred
to as the baseline solution. Additionally, we introduce a branch-and-bound
(BnB) algorithm for efficient cluster reconstruction within KRCA, leveraging a
decision tree framework to reduce computational time while incorporating a
controlling parameter to balance solution quality and efficiency. We establish
theoretical error bounds for KRCA and BnB. Through extensive numerical
experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets, we demonstrate that KRCA
consistently outperforms baseline solutions, delivering significant
improvements in solution quality with fast computational times. This work
highlights the practical significance of KRC for personalization and
large-scale decision making, offering methodological advancements and insights
that can be built upon in future studies.

*Yinan Li,Kwang-Sung Jun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses the $[0,1]$-valued regression problem, demonstrating that the log loss minimizer yields a first-order bound, while introducing a new "betting loss" function to achieve a variance-dependent second-order bound.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve generalization bounds for the $[0,1]$-valued regression problem, extending ideas from cost-sensitive classification and exploring loss functions that adapt to data variance.

Method: The authors analyze the performance of the log loss in regression problems and propose a novel loss function called the "betting loss" that achieves variance-adaptive bounds without requiring prior knowledge of data variance.

Result: The paper finds that the log loss minimizer achieves a first-order bound, while the newly proposed betting loss leads to a second-order variance-dependent bound.

Conclusion: The proposed betting loss function represents a significant advancement in achieving variance-adaptive bounds for regression without requiring explicit variance modeling, differentiating it from distributional reinforcement learning methods.

Abstract: We consider the $[0,1]$-valued regression problem in the i.i.d. setting. In a
related problem called cost-sensitive classification, \citet{foster21efficient}
have shown that the log loss minimizer achieves an improved generalization
bound compared to that of the squared loss minimizer in the sense that the
bound scales with the cost of the best classifier, which can be arbitrarily
small depending on the problem at hand. Such a result is often called a
first-order bound. For $[0,1]$-valued regression, we first show that the log
loss minimizer leads to a similar first-order bound. We then ask if there
exists a loss function that achieves a variance-dependent bound (also known as
a second order bound), which is a strict improvement upon first-order bounds.
We answer this question in the affirmative by proposing a novel loss function
called the betting loss. Our result is ``variance-adaptive'' in the sense that
the bound is attained \textit{without any knowledge about the variance}, which
is in contrast to modeling label (or reward) variance or the label distribution
itself explicitly as part of the function class such as distributional
reinforcement learning.

*Antoni Zajko,Katarzyna Woźnica*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces two methods for learning tabular data representations tailored for Bayesian Hyperparameter Optimization, focusing on landmarkers' properties over universal features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of creating effective tabular data representations for meta-learning, particularly targeting better performance in warm-starting Bayesian Hyperparameter Optimization.

Method: Developed two approaches: deep metric learning and landmarkers-based reconstruction, emphasizing representations that align with specific meta-task requirements.

Result: The proposed methods successfully capture landmarkers' properties but do not consistently yield performance improvements in the meta-task of HPO warm-starting.

Conclusion: While the methods meet landmarkers requirements, their efficacy for boosting meta-task outcomes remains inconclusive.

Abstract: Effectively representing heterogeneous tabular datasets for meta-learning
purposes is still an open problem. Previous approaches rely on representations
that are intended to be universal. This paper proposes two novel methods for
tabular representation learning tailored to a specific meta-task -
warm-starting Bayesian Hyperparameter Optimization. Both follow the specific
requirement formulated by ourselves that enforces representations to capture
the properties of landmarkers. The first approach involves deep metric
learning, while the second one is based on landmarkers reconstruction. We
evaluate the proposed encoders in two ways. Next to the gain in the target
meta-task, we also use the degree of fulfillment of the proposed requirement as
the evaluation metric. Experiments demonstrate that while the proposed encoders
can effectively learn representations aligned with landmarkers, they may not
directly translate to significant performance gains in the meta-task of HPO
warm-starting.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TASKPGM introduces a framework to optimize training mixtures for finetuning large language models, improving performance and providing task insights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Selecting optimal blends of task datasets for LLM finetuning is a manual and heuristic-driven process, leading to potential inefficiencies and suboptimal performance.

Method: TASKPGM minimizes an energy function over a Markov Random Field (MRF) to optimize continuous task proportions, using divergences like Jensen Shannon Divergence and Pointwise Mutual Information, while offering closed-form solutions under constraints.

Result: Empirical improvements are demonstrated on models like Llama 2 and Mistral across evaluation suites such as MMLU and BIGBench, along with theoretical guarantees like weak submodularity.

Conclusion: TASKPGM is scalable, improves finetuning performance, and provides interpretability, making it valuable for robust and efficient LLM training.

Abstract: The performance of finetuned large language models (LLMs) hinges critically
on the composition of the training mixture. However, selecting an optimal blend
of task datasets remains a largely manual, heuristic driven process, with
practitioners often relying on uniform or size based sampling strategies. We
introduce TASKPGM, a principled and scalable framework for mixture optimization
that selects continuous task proportions by minimizing an energy function over
a Markov Random Field (MRF). Task relationships are modeled using behavioral
divergences such as Jensen Shannon Divergence and Pointwise Mutual Information
computed from the predictive distributions of single task finetuned models. Our
method yields a closed form solution under simplex constraints and provably
balances representativeness and diversity among tasks. We provide theoretical
guarantees, including weak submodularity for budgeted variants, and demonstrate
consistent empirical improvements on Llama 2 and Mistral across evaluation
suites such as MMLU and BIGBench. Beyond performance, TASKPGM offers
interpretable insights into task influence and mixture composition, making it a
powerful tool for efficient and robust LLM finetuning.

*Jake Ward,Chuqiao Lin,Constantin Venhoff,Neel Nanda*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study investigates how reasoning models develop backtracking behavior during fine-tuning, finding that existing directions in the base model activations are repurposed rather than newly learned.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the mechanisms behind the development of backtracking behavior elicited by reasoning fine-tuning in reasoning models.

Method: The researchers analyzed the residual stream of Llama-3.1-8B and identified specific directions that induce backtracking behavior in a distilled reasoning model, exploring their relationship to token-level attributes and testing their effects in the base model.

Result: They discovered that backtracking behavior is partially driven by repurposed directions in the base model activations, and that steering with these directions cannot be simply attributed to token-level attributes.

Conclusion: The study concludes that reasoning-fine-tuned models leverage pre-existing activations in the base model to create new behavioral circuits, instead of developing new capabilities from scratch.

Abstract: Backtracking, an emergent behavior elicited by reasoning fine-tuning, has
been shown to be a key mechanism in reasoning models' enhanced capabilities.
Prior work has succeeded in manipulating this behavior via steering vectors,
but the underlying mechanism remains poorly understood. In this work, we show
that the emergence of backtracking in DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B is in part
driven by a repurposed direction already present in base model activations.
Specifically, we identify a direction in base Llama-3.1-8B's residual stream
which systematically induces backtracking when used to steer the distilled
reasoning model, and find that the effects of steering with this direction
cannot be trivially explained by token-level attributes. We further find that
this direction does not induce backtracking in the base model, suggesting that
the reasoning finetuning process repurposes pre-existing representations to
form new behavioral circuits. Additionally, we hypothesize that this direction
is one of several which may work together to mediate backtracking. Our findings
offer a compelling picture that reasoning-finetuned models repurpose
pre-existing base model representations, rather than learn new capabilities
from scratch.

*Kai Malcolm,César Uribe,Momona Yamagami*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores federated learning (FL) in neural interfaces, highlighting performance-privacy tradeoffs in open- and closed-loop scenarios. FL shows promise in privacy-conscious neural decoding but struggles with real-time, single-user interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the privacy challenge of sharing neural signals for decoder training while exploring the potential of federated learning in adaptive neural interfaces.

Method: The study employs FL-based neural decoding using high-dimensional electromyography signals, with evaluations in open-loop simulations and closed-loop user studies, modifying FL for real-time single-user interactions.

Result: FL outperformed local learning in open-loop scenarios but underperformed in closed-loop setups where modified FL struggled with real-time single-user tasks. Local learning posed greater privacy risks despite its better performance.

Conclusion: The study underscores a performance-privacy tradeoff in adaptive neural interfaces and calls for developing FL methods tailored for co-adaptive, real-time, single-user applications.

Abstract: Invasive and non-invasive neural interfaces hold promise as high-bandwidth
input devices for next-generation technologies. However, neural signals
inherently encode sensitive information about an individual's identity and
health, making data sharing for decoder training a critical privacy challenge.
Federated learning (FL), a distributed, privacy-preserving learning framework,
presents a promising solution, but it remains unexplored in closed-loop
adaptive neural interfaces. Here, we introduce FL-based neural decoding and
systematically evaluate its performance and privacy using high-dimensional
electromyography signals in both open- and closed-loop scenarios. In open-loop
simulations, FL significantly outperformed local learning baselines,
demonstrating its potential for high-performance, privacy-conscious neural
decoding. In contrast, closed-loop user studies required adapting FL methods to
accommodate single-user, real-time interactions, a scenario not supported by
standard FL. This modification resulted in local learning decoders surpassing
the adapted FL approach in closed-loop performance, yet local learning still
carried higher privacy risks. Our findings highlight a critical
performance-privacy tradeoff in real-time adaptive applications and indicate
the need for FL methods specifically designed for co-adaptive, single-user
applications.

*Athanasios Papastathopoulos-Katsaros,Alexandra Stavrianidi,Zhandong Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper enhances Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) by improving their extrapolation performance through transfer learning and adaptive activation functions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PINNs struggle with poor extrapolation outside training domains and sensitivity to activation functions, limiting their broader applications.

Method: It introduces a transfer learning approach with selected collocation points and proposes adaptive activation functions as a combination of standard activation functions.

Result: The enhancements lead to a 40% reduction in relative L2 error and a 50% reduction in mean absolute error during extrapolation without increasing computational costs.

Conclusion: The proposed methods significantly improve the accuracy and robustness of PINNs, making them more effective for real-world applications.

Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) are deep learning models that
incorporate the governing physical laws of a system into the learning process,
making them well-suited for solving complex scientific and engineering
problems. Recently, PINNs have gained widespread attention as a powerful
framework for combining physical principles with data-driven modeling to
improve prediction accuracy. Despite their successes, however, PINNs often
exhibit poor extrapolation performance outside the training domain and are
highly sensitive to the choice of activation functions (AFs). In this paper, we
introduce a transfer learning (TL) method to improve the extrapolation
capability of PINNs. Our approach applies transfer learning (TL) within an
extended training domain, using only a small number of carefully selected
collocation points. Additionally, we propose an adaptive AF that takes the form
of a linear combination of standard AFs, which improves both the robustness and
accuracy of the model. Through a series of experiments, we demonstrate that our
method achieves an average of 40% reduction in relative L2 error and an average
of 50% reduction in mean absolute error in the extrapolation domain, all
without a significant increase in computational cost. The code is available at

### [169] [A Kernel Distribution Closeness Testing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12843)
*Zhijian Zhou,Liuhua Peng,Xunye Tian,Feng Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces Norm-Adaptive Maximum Mean Discrepancy (NAMMD) to improve distribution closeness testing for complex data, overcoming limitations of traditional and MMD-based approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for distribution closeness testing rely on measurements like total variation, which are not effective for complex high-dimensional data such as images. Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) is a step forward but lacks informativeness in assessing closeness for multiple distribution pairs.

Method: The authors propose NAMMD, which adjusts MMD values using reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) norms for better distribution discrepancy assessment. They derive its asymptotic distribution and incorporate it into a new distribution closeness testing framework.

Result: NAMMD-based DCT is proven to have higher test power with controlled type-I error compared to MMD-based DCT. Experiments using various data types validate these theoretical claims. NAMMD also enhances two-sample testing, outperforming traditional MMD-based methods.

Conclusion: NAMMD offers a more informative and powerful framework for assessing closeness and discrepancies between complex data distributions, addressing limitations of existing methods and enhancing broad applicability.

Abstract: The distribution closeness testing (DCT) assesses whether the distance
between a distribution pair is at least $\epsilon$-far. Existing DCT methods
mainly measure discrepancies between a distribution pair defined on discrete
one-dimensional spaces (e.g., using total variation), which limits their
applications to complex data (e.g., images). To extend DCT to more types of
data, a natural idea is to introduce maximum mean discrepancy (MMD), a powerful
measurement of the distributional discrepancy between two complex
distributions, into DCT scenarios. However, we find that MMD's value can be the
same for many pairs of distributions that have different norms in the same
reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), making MMD less informative when
assessing the closeness levels for multiple distribution pairs. To mitigate the
issue, we design a new measurement of distributional discrepancy, norm-adaptive
MMD (NAMMD), which scales MMD's value using the RKHS norms of distributions.
Based on the asymptotic distribution of NAMMD, we finally propose the
NAMMD-based DCT to assess the closeness levels of a distribution pair.
Theoretically, we prove that NAMMD-based DCT has higher test power compared to
MMD-based DCT, with bounded type-I error, which is also validated by extensive
experiments on many types of data (e.g., synthetic noise, real images).
Furthermore, we also apply the proposed NAMMD for addressing the two-sample
testing problem and find NAMMD-based two-sample test has higher test power than
the MMD-based two-sample test in both theory and experiments.

Conclusion: Understanding and addressing data heterogeneity is essential for improving AI processes, and this paper offers valuable insights into handling such complexities.

Abstract: Data heterogeneity is a prevalent issue, stemming from various conflicting
factors, making its utilization complex. This uncertainty, particularly
resulting from disparities in data formats, frequently necessitates the
involvement of experts to find resolutions. Current methodologies primarily
address conflicts related to data structures and schemas, often overlooking the
pivotal role played by data transformation. As the utilization of artificial

paramount. It customizes training data to enhance AI learning efficiency and
adapts input formats to suit diverse AI models. Selecting an appropriate
transformation technique is paramount in preserving crucial data details.
Despite the widespread integration of AI across various industries,
comprehensive reviews concerning contemporary data transformation approaches
are scarce. This survey explores the intricacies of data heterogeneity and its
underlying sources. It systematically categorizes and presents strategies to
address heterogeneity stemming from differences in data formats, shedding light

Motivation: The paper aims to leverage user activity sequences to enhance recommendations in large-scale platforms, addressing challenges in scalability, cost, latency, and adaptability.

Method: PinFM uses a transformer model with 20B+ parameters for pretraining on user activity data and fine-tunes it with existing models. It incorporates innovations like Deduplicated Cross-Attention Transformer (DCAT).

Result: PinFM achieved a 600% improvement in throughput and a 20% increase in engagement with new items, showcasing efficient interaction learning and scalability.

Conclusion: PinFM successfully handles high scalability demands, captures intricate user-item interactions, and adapts to unseen items, benefiting over half a billion users.

Abstract: User activity sequences have emerged as one of the most important signals in
recommender systems. We present a foundational model, PinFM, for understanding
user activity sequences across multiple applications at a billion-scale visual
discovery platform. We pretrain a transformer model with 20B+ parameters using
extensive user activity data, then fine-tune it for specific applications,
efficiently coupling it with existing models. While this
pretraining-and-fine-tuning approach has been popular in other domains, such as
Vision and NLP, its application in industrial recommender systems presents
numerous challenges. The foundational model must be scalable enough to score
millions of items every second while meeting tight cost and latency constraints
imposed by these systems. Additionally, it should capture the interactions
between user activities and other features and handle new items that were not
present during the pretraining stage.
  We developed innovative techniques to address these challenges. Our
infrastructure and algorithmic optimizations, such as the Deduplicated
Cross-Attention Transformer (DCAT), improved our throughput by 600% on
Pinterest internal data. We demonstrate that PinFM can learn interactions
between user sequences and candidate items by altering input sequences, leading
to a 20% increase in engagement with new items. PinFM is now deployed to help
improve the experience of more than a half billion users across various
applications.

Motivation: The authors aim to provide a theoretical understanding of the training dynamics in deep neural networks, which is currently unclear despite their widespread success in machine learning.

Method: They develop a continuous-time matrix-valued SDE framework to link stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with the spectral evolution of weight matrices, deriving key equations to describe singular-value dynamics.

Result: The paper establishes that squared singular values evolve according to Dyson Brownian motion and validates this theory through experiments on transformer and MLP architectures, showing consistency with empirical observations.

Conclusion: The work delivers a rigorous theoretical explanation for spectral structures ('bulk+tail') in trained networks, offering insights into the mechanics of deep learning success.

Abstract: Deep neural networks have revolutionized machine learning, yet their training
dynamics remain theoretically unclear-we develop a continuous-time,
matrix-valued stochastic differential equation (SDE) framework that rigorously
connects the microscopic dynamics of SGD to the macroscopic evolution of
singular-value spectra in weight matrices. We derive exact SDEs showing that
squared singular values follow Dyson Brownian motion with eigenvalue repulsion,
and characterize stationary distributions as gamma-type densities with
power-law tails, providing the first theoretical explanation for the
empirically observed 'bulk+tail' spectral structure in trained networks.
Through controlled experiments on transformer and MLP architectures, we
validate our theoretical predictions and demonstrate quantitative agreement
between SDE-based forecasts and observed spectral evolution, providing a
rigorous foundation for understanding why deep learning works.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address inefficiencies in training deep models caused by variable data quality, redundancy, and reliance on static or task-specific dataset pruning methods.

Method: The method introduces a dynamic dataset pruning framework that uses task-driven difficulty and cross-modality semantic consistency, leveraging supervision from pretrained multimodal foundation models.

Result: The framework enhances robustness and generalizability by filtering uninformative samples while monitoring training dynamics.

Conclusion: Integrating cross-modality alignment into dataset pruning can create more efficient and robust models, advancing data-centric learning practices across different domains.

Abstract: Modern deep models are trained on large real-world datasets, where data
quality varies and redundancy is common. Data-centric approaches such as
dataset pruning have shown promise in improving training efficiency and model
performance. However, most existing methods rely on static heuristics or
task-specific metrics, limiting their robustness and generalizability across
domains. In this work, we introduce a dynamic dataset pruning framework that
adaptively selects training samples based on both task-driven difficulty and
cross-modality semantic consistency. By incorporating supervision from
pretrained multimodal foundation models, our approach captures training
dynamics while effectively filtering out uninformative samples. Our work
highlights the potential of integrating cross-modality alignment for robust
sample selection, advancing data-centric learning toward more efficient and
robust practices across application domains.

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Layer Separation (LySep) model, an optimization framework to improve deep learning for solving partial differential equations (PDEs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning struggles with issues such as suboptimal convergence and gradient-related difficulties due to the non-convex nature of the loss function when solving PDEs.

Method: The LySep model introduces auxiliary variables to separate neural network layers, transforming deep architectures into shallow counterparts and coupling only neighboring layers via new loss functions. Alternating direction algorithms are used for optimal updates.

Result: Theoretical analyses show consistency between LySep and traditional deep models, and numerical experiments demonstrate its effectiveness in minimizing loss and reducing errors.

Conclusion: LySep improves optimization and performance in deep learning applications for PDEs by addressing fundamental challenges in non-convexity and gradient behavior.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new optimization framework, the layer separation
(LySep) model, to improve the deep learning-based methods in solving partial
differential equations. Due to the highly non-convex nature of the loss
function in deep learning, existing optimization algorithms often converge to
suboptimal local minima or suffer from gradient explosion or vanishing,
resulting in poor performance. To address these issues, we introduce auxiliary
variables to separate the layers of deep neural networks. Specifically, the
output and its derivatives of each layer are represented by auxiliary
variables, effectively decomposing the deep architecture into a series of
shallow architectures. New loss functions with auxiliary variables are
established, in which only variables from two neighboring layers are coupled.
Corresponding algorithms based on alternating directions are developed, where
many variables can be updated optimally in closed forms. Moreover, we provide
theoretical analyses demonstrating the consistency between the LySep model and
the original deep model. High-dimensional numerical results validate our theory
and demonstrate the advantages of LySep in minimizing loss and reducing
solution error.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a Triple-Channel Graph Isomorphism Network (GIN) for predicting financial risk in SMEs listed under China's NEEQ, using structured data, textual disclosures, and enterprise relationships. The model outperforms traditional methods in accuracy and provides practical tools for regulators and investors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many SMEs listed on the NEEQ face high financial distress risks due to limited scale and resilience. A more advanced predictive tool is needed to address this issue.

Method: The authors propose a multi-channel deep learning framework that combines structured financial data, textual disclosures, and enterprise relationship information. Specifically, they design a Triple-Channel Graph Isomorphism Network to handle these inputs using an attention-based mechanism and a gating unit for fusion.

Result: The model was validated on data from 7,731 real-world NEEQ companies and achieved superior performance over traditional and single-modality methods, excelling in AUC, Precision, Recall, and F1 Score.

Conclusion: The proposed model serves as both a theoretical and practical innovation for financial risk prediction in SMEs, offering a sophisticated tool for regulators and investors.

Abstract: With the continuous evolution of China's multi-level capital market, the
National Equities Exchange and Quotations (NEEQ), also known as the "New Third

enterprises (SMEs). However, due to their limited scale and financial
resilience, many NEEQ-listed companies face elevated risks of financial
distress. To address this issue, we propose a multi-channel deep learning
framework that integrates structured financial indicators, textual disclosures,
and enterprise relationship data for comprehensive financial risk prediction.
Specifically, we design a Triple-Channel Graph Isomorphism Network (GIN) that
processes numeric, textual, and graph-based inputs separately. These
modality-specific representations are fused using an attention-based mechanism
followed by a gating unit to enhance robustness and prediction accuracy.
Experimental results on data from 7,731 real-world NEEQ companies demonstrate
that our model significantly outperforms traditional machine learning methods
and single-modality baselines in terms of AUC, Precision, Recall, and F1 Score.

Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the challenges of non-stationarity, multi-scale periodicity, and transient dynamics in long-term time series prediction, which are not effectively tackled by existing Transformer-based and State-Space Models.

Method: FLDmamba leverages the Fourier and Laplace transforms for capturing multi-scale periodicity and transient dynamics while improving robustness against data noise.

Result: Extensive experiments show FLDmamba outperforming Transformer-based and Mamba-based models on time series prediction benchmarks.

Conclusion: FLDmamba offers an efficient and superior solution for long-term time series prediction, addressing key challenges while improving performance and robustness.

Abstract: Time series prediction, a crucial task across various domains, faces
significant challenges due to the inherent complexities of time series data,
including non-stationarity, multi-scale periodicity, and transient dynamics,
particularly when tackling long-term predictions. While Transformer-based
architectures have shown promise, their quadratic complexity with sequence
length hinders their efficiency for long-term predictions. Recent advancements
in State-Space Models, such as Mamba, offer a more efficient alternative for
long-term modeling, but they cannot capture multi-scale periodicity and
transient dynamics effectively. Meanwhile, they are susceptible to data noise
issues in time series. This paper proposes a novel framework, FLDmamba (Fourier
and Laplace Transform Decomposition Mamba), addressing these limitations.
FLDmamba leverages the strengths of both Fourier and Laplace transforms to
effectively capture both multi-scale periodicity, transient dynamics within
time series data, and improve the robustness of the model to the data noise
issue. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that FLDmamba achieves superior
performance on time series prediction benchmarks, outperforming both
Transformer-based and other Mamba-based architectures. To promote the

1) inadequate compression ratio, 2) low compression \& decompression
throughput, and 3) poor compression robustness limit their widespread adoption
and application in both industry and academia. To solve those challenges, we
propose a novel \underline{P}arallel \underline{M}ulti-\underline{K}nowledge
\underline{L}earning-based \underline{C}ompressor (PMKLC) with four crucial
designs: 1) We propose an automated multi-knowledge learning-based compression
framework as compressors' backbone to enhance compression ratio and robustness;
2) we design a GPU-accelerated ($s$,$k$)-mer encoder to optimize compression
throughput and computing resource usage; 3) we introduce data block
partitioning and Step-wise Model Passing (SMP) mechanisms for parallel
acceleration; 4) We design two compression modes PMKLC-S and PMKLC-M to meet
the complex application scenarios, where the former runs on a
resource-constrained single GPU and the latter is multi-GPU accelerated. We
benchmark PMKLC-S/M and 14 baselines (7 traditional and 7 leaning-based) on 15
real-world datasets with different species and data sizes. Compared to
baselines on the testing datasets, PMKLC-S/M achieve the average compression
ratio improvement up to 73.609\% and 73.480\%, the average throughput
improvement up to 3.036$\times$ and 10.710$\times$, respectively. Besides,
PMKLC-S/M also achieve the best robustness and competitive memory cost,
indicating its greater stability against datasets with different probability
distribution perturbations, and its strong ability to run on memory-constrained
devices.

### [179] [RONOM: Reduced-Order Neural Operator Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12814)
*Sven Dummer,Dongwei Ye,Christoph Brune*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents "Reduced-Order Neural Operator Modeling" (RONOM), combining reduced-order models (ROM) and neural operators for solving partial differential equations (PDEs), improving flexibility across discretizations and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional approaches like Reduced-Order Modeling are limited by fixed discretizations when solving PDEs, and neural operator methods lack rigorous quantifications of discretization errors. The paper aims to combine strengths of both approaches for improved computational efficiency and flexibility.

Method: The authors introduce RONOM, which systematically bridges ROM and neural operator learning concepts. They derive discretization error bounds akin to ROM and evaluate RONOM's robustness and convergence properties.

Result: Numerical tests show that RONOM offers comparable generalization performance, superior spatial super-resolution and discretization robustness compared to existing neural operators. It also provides insights into temporal super-resolution.

Conclusion: RONOM serves as a promising framework for combining benefits of ROM and neural operators in physics-based PDE modeling, showing improved computational flexibility and accuracy alongside rigorous error estimations.

Abstract: Time-dependent partial differential equations are ubiquitous in physics-based
modeling, but they remain computationally intensive in many-query scenarios,
such as real-time forecasting, optimal control, and uncertainty quantification.
Reduced-order modeling (ROM) addresses these challenges by constructing a
low-dimensional surrogate model but relies on a fixed discretization, which
limits flexibility across varying meshes during evaluation. Operator learning
approaches, such as neural operators, offer an alternative by parameterizing
mappings between infinite-dimensional function spaces, enabling adaptation to
data across different resolutions. Whereas ROM provides rigorous numerical
error estimates, neural operator learning largely focuses on discretization
convergence and invariance without quantifying the error between the
infinite-dimensional and the discretized operators. This work introduces the
reduced-order neural operator modeling (RONOM) framework, which bridges
concepts from ROM and operator learning. We establish a discretization error
bound analogous to those in ROM, and get insights into RONOM's discretization
convergence and discretization robustness. Moreover, two numerical examples are
presented that compare RONOM to existing neural operators for solving partial
differential equations. The results demonstrate that RONOM using standard
vector-to-vector neural networks achieves comparable performance in input
generalization and superior performance in both spatial super-resolution and
discretization robustness, while also offering novel insights into temporal
super-resolution scenarios.

### [180] [From Novelty to Imitation: Self-Distilled Rewards for Offline Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12815)
*Gaurav Chaudhary,Laxmidhar Behera*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ReLOAD introduces a framework for generating intrinsic rewards in offline reinforcement learning, using prediction errors derived from Random Network Distillation, eliminating the need for explicit reward annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Offline RL's reliance on manually engineered reward annotations is challenging and impractical in many scenarios.

Method: ReLOAD employs a predictor-target network setup. It uses prediction errors between a trained predictor network and a fixed target network's embeddings for generating intrinsic rewards.

Result: The proposed method produces structured rewards without handcrafted annotations and achieves competitive performance on benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: ReLOAD provides a feasible alternative to traditional reward annotation methods, enhancing practicality in offline RL application scenarios.

Abstract: Offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) aims to learn effective policies from a
static dataset without requiring further agent-environment interactions.
However, its practical adoption is often hindered by the need for explicit
reward annotations, which can be costly to engineer or difficult to obtain
retrospectively. To address this, we propose ReLOAD (Reinforcement Learning
with Offline Reward Annotation via Distillation), a novel reward annotation
framework for offline RL. Unlike existing methods that depend on complex
alignment procedures, our approach adapts Random Network Distillation (RND) to
generate intrinsic rewards from expert demonstrations using a simple yet
effective embedding discrepancy measure. First, we train a predictor network to
mimic a fixed target network's embeddings based on expert state transitions.
Later, the prediction error between these networks serves as a reward signal
for each transition in the static dataset. This mechanism provides a structured
reward signal without requiring handcrafted reward annotations. We provide a
formal theoretical construct that offers insights into how RND prediction
errors effectively serve as intrinsic rewards by distinguishing expert-like
transitions. Experiments on the D4RL benchmark demonstrate that ReLOAD enables
robust offline policy learning and achieves performance competitive with
traditional reward-annotated methods.

### [181] [Understanding the Evolution of the Neural Tangent Kernel at the Edge of Stability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12837)
*Kaiqi Jiang,Jeremy Cohen,Yuanzhi Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper examines how the eigenvectors of Neural Tangent Kernels (NTKs) behave during the Edge of Stability (EoS) phase in Gradient Descent, providing theoretical and experimental insights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the gap in understanding regarding the behavior of NTK eigenvectors during the Edge of Stability (EoS) phase, as prior studies have focused mainly on NTK eigenvalues.

Method: The method includes both experimental observation across various architectures and theoretical analysis of mechanisms using a two-layer linear network model.

Result: The study finds that larger learning rates cause stronger alignment of NTK eigenvectors with the training target.

Conclusion: This research provides deeper insights into the training dynamics of Gradient Descent in deep learning, particularly in the context of NTK behavior during EoS.

Abstract: The study of Neural Tangent Kernels (NTKs) in deep learning has drawn
increasing attention in recent years. NTKs typically actively change during
training and are related to feature learning. In parallel, recent work on
Gradient Descent (GD) has found a phenomenon called Edge of Stability (EoS), in
which the largest eigenvalue of the NTK oscillates around a value inversely
proportional to the step size. However, although follow-up works have explored
the underlying mechanism of such eigenvalue behavior in depth, the
understanding of the behavior of the NTK eigenvectors during EoS is still
missing. This paper examines the dynamics of NTK eigenvectors during EoS in
detail. Across different architectures, we observe that larger learning rates
cause the leading eigenvectors of the final NTK, as well as the full NTK
matrix, to have greater alignment with the training target. We then study the
underlying mechanism of this phenomenon and provide a theoretical analysis for
a two-layer linear network. Our study enhances the understanding of GD training
dynamics in deep learning.

*Danilo Avola,Andrea Bernardini,Francesco Danese,Mario Lezoche,Maurizio Mancini,Daniele Pannone,Amedeo Ranaldi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a transformer-based method for identifying stationary individuals using Wi-Fi Channel State Information (CSI), achieving 99.82% accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore human identification using Wi-Fi signals without requiring user movement, which has been less studied compared to motion-based methods.

Method: A dual-branch transformer processes amplitude and phase modalities from Wi-Fi CSI, combined with a tailored preprocessing pipeline for improved signal quality.

Result: The method achieved 99.82% classification accuracy on a dataset with six participants, outperforming other baselines such as convolutional and multilayer perceptrons.

Conclusion: Wi-Fi CSI can effectively encode biometric traits for person identification in a stationary state, making low-cost, device-free identification feasible in real-world settings.

Abstract: Wi-Fi sensing is gaining momentum as a non-intrusive and privacy-preserving
alternative to vision-based systems for human identification. However, person
identification through wireless signals, particularly without user motion,
remains largely unexplored. Most prior wireless-based approaches rely on
movement patterns, such as walking gait, to extract biometric cues. In
contrast, we propose a transformer-based method that identifies individuals
from Channel State Information (CSI) recorded while the subject remains
stationary. CSI captures fine-grained amplitude and phase distortions induced
by the unique interaction between the human body and the radio signal. To
support evaluation, we introduce a dataset acquired with ESP32 devices in a
controlled indoor environment, featuring six participants observed across
multiple orientations. A tailored preprocessing pipeline, including outlier
removal, smoothing, and phase calibration, enhances signal quality. Our
dual-branch transformer architecture processes amplitude and phase modalities
separately and achieves 99.82\% classification accuracy, outperforming
convolutional and multilayer perceptron baselines. These results demonstrate
the discriminative potential of CSI perturbations, highlighting their capacity
to encode biometric traits in a consistent manner. They further confirm the
viability of passive, device-free person identification using low-cost
commodity Wi-Fi hardware in real-world settings.

*Chongli Qin,Jost Tobias Springenberg*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a variation of supervised fine-tuning (SFT) called importance weighted supervised fine-tuning (iw-SFT) by highlighting its connections with reinforcement learning (RL).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The goal is to improve the performance of large language models and control policies by addressing the limitations of traditional behavior cloning (SFT) through exploring its relation to RL objectives.

Method: The authors introduce iw-SFT, which modifies standard SFT by incorporating importance weighting to better align with RL objectives. This method is also generalized to work with quality-scored data.

Result: iw-SFT is shown to optimize tighter bounds of RL objectives and outperforms SFT in various tasks. It also demonstrates competitive performance with advanced RL algorithms, such as achieving 66.7% on the AIME 2024 dataset.

Conclusion: iw-SFT bridges the gap between SFT and RL, offering a simple yet effective enhancement to behavior cloning strategies for training large language models and control policies.

Abstract: Behavior Cloning (BC) on curated (or filtered) data is the predominant
paradigm for supervised fine-tuning (SFT) of large language models; as well as
for imitation learning of control policies. Here, we draw on a connection
between this successful strategy and the theory and practice of finding optimal
policies via Reinforcement Learning (RL). Building on existing literature, we
clarify that SFT can be understood as maximizing a lower bound on the RL
objective in a sparse reward setting. Giving support to its often observed good
performance. From this viewpoint, we realize that a small modification to SFT
leads to an importance weighted variant that behaves closer to training with RL
as it: i) optimizes a tighter bound to the RL objective and, ii) can improve
performance compared to SFT on curated data. We refer to this variant as
importance weighted supervised fine-tuning (iw-SFT). We show that it is easy to
implement and can be further generalized to training with quality scored data.
The resulting SFT variants are competitive with more advanced RL algorithms for
large language models and for training policies in continuous control tasks.
For example achieving 66.7% on the AIME 2024 dataset.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional EEG-based biometric systems are secure but impractical due to cumbersome scalp electrode setups. The need for a user-friendly alternative is the driving factor.

Method: The study extracts temporal and spectral features from ear-EEG signals and applies a fully connected deep neural network for subject identification.

Result: The system achieves an 82% average accuracy in subject identification using the available ear-EEG dataset.

Conclusion: The findings suggest ear-EEG is a feasible and promising approach for next-generation biometric authentication systems.

Abstract: This work explores the feasibility of biometric authentication using EEG
signals acquired through in-ear devices, commonly referred to as ear-EEG.
Traditional EEG-based biometric systems, while secure, often suffer from low
usability due to cumbersome scalp-based electrode setups. In this study, we
propose a novel and practical framework leveraging ear-EEG signals as a
user-friendly alternative for everyday biometric authentication. The system
extracts an original combination of temporal and spectral features from ear-EEG
signals and feeds them into a fully connected deep neural network for subject
identification. Experimental results on the only currently available ear-EEG
dataset suitable for different purposes, including biometric authentication,
demonstrate promising performance, with an average accuracy of 82\% in a
subject identification scenario. These findings confirm the potential of
ear-EEG as a viable and deployable direction for next-generation real-world
biometric systems.

*Yao Feng,Hengkai Tan,Xinyi Mao,Guodong Liu,Shuhe Huang,Chendong Xiang,Hang Su,Jun Zhu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduced VIDAR: a bimanual robotic manipulation framework leveraging video diffusion pre-training and masked inverse dynamics modeling for better generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bimanual robotic manipulation faces challenges like data scarcity and heterogeneous robot embodiments, hindering scalability.

Method: Developed a two-stage framework combining large-scale video diffusion-based pre-training and masked inverse dynamics modeling for action prediction.

Result: VIDAR requires only 20 minutes of human demonstration on new platforms, generalizes well to unseen tasks and backgrounds, and outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: VIDAR showcases the potential of video foundation models and masked action prediction for scalable, generalizable robotic manipulation in diverse settings.

Abstract: Bimanual robotic manipulation, which involves the coordinated control of two
robotic arms, is foundational for solving challenging tasks. Despite recent
progress in general-purpose manipulation, data scarcity and embodiment
heterogeneity remain serious obstacles to further scaling up in bimanual
settings. In this paper, we introduce VIdeo Diffusion for Action Reasoning
(VIDAR), a two-stage framework that leverages large-scale, diffusion-based
video pre-training and a novel masked inverse dynamics model for action
prediction. We pre-train the video diffusion model on 750K multi-view videos
from three real-world bimanual robot platforms, utilizing a unified observation
space that encodes robot, camera, task, and scene contexts. Our masked inverse
dynamics model learns masks to extract action-relevant information from
generated trajectories without requiring pixel-level labels, and the masks can
effectively generalize to unseen backgrounds. Our experiments demonstrate that
with only 20 minutes of human demonstrations on an unseen robot platform (only
1% of typical data requirements), VIDAR generalizes to unseen tasks and
backgrounds with strong semantic understanding, surpassing state-of-the-art
methods. Our findings highlight the potential of video foundation models,
coupled with masked action prediction, to enable scalable and generalizable
robotic manipulation in diverse real-world settings.

*Luca Stradiotti,Dario Pesenti,Stefano Teso,Jesse Davis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework (LtX) that allows classifiers to reject inputs with low-quality explanations using the ULER method, outperforming existing methods and validated through multiple benchmarks and human-rated datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve users’ interpretability and trust in high-stakes applications of machine learning predictors, especially when explanations of predictions are of low quality.

Method: The authors introduced ULER (User-centric Low-quality Explanation Rejector), which uses human ratings and feature relevance judgments to create a rejector that aligns with human assessments of explanation quality.

Result: ULER exceeded performance benchmarks compared to state-of-the-art methods and explanation-aware reject strategies across eight datasets, as well as on a new human-annotated dataset.

Conclusion: Incorporating rejectors for low-quality explanations into predictive systems can enhance system reliability and interpretability. ULER shows strong promise in this context.

Abstract: Machine Learning predictors are increasingly being employed in high-stakes
applications such as credit scoring. Explanations help users unpack the reasons
behind their predictions, but are not always "high quality''. That is,
end-users may have difficulty interpreting or believing them, which can
complicate trust assessment and downstream decision-making. We argue that
classifiers should have the option to refuse handling inputs whose predictions
cannot be explained properly and introduce a framework for learning to reject
low-quality explanations (LtX) in which predictors are equipped with a rejector
that evaluates the quality of explanations. In this problem setting, the key
challenges are how to properly define and assess explanation quality and how to
design a suitable rejector. Focusing on popular attribution techniques, we
introduce ULER (User-centric Low-quality Explanation Rejector), which learns a
simple rejector from human ratings and per-feature relevance judgments to
mirror human judgments of explanation quality. Our experiments show that ULER
outperforms both state-of-the-art and explanation-aware learning to reject
strategies at LtX on eight classification and regression benchmarks and on a
new human-annotated dataset, which we will publicly release to support future
research.

*Jiadong Chen,Hengyu Ye,Fuxin Jiang,Xiao He,Tieying Zhang,Jianjun Chen,Xiaofeng Gao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Fremer is a deep forecasting model tailored for cloud workloads, outperforming SOTA models in efficiency, accuracy, and robustness while improving real-world application metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses a key challenge in cloud applications: efficiently forecasting workloads with complex periodic patterns for better auto-scaling and scheduling.

Method: Fremer leverages frequency domain analysis combined with deep learning techniques, offering better computational efficiency and accuracy than Transformer-based models.

Result: Fremer consistently achieves superior performance metrics over SOTA, including average improvements of 5.5% in MSE, 4.7% in MAE, and 8.6% in SMAPE on proprietary and public datasets. Additionally, it improves latency and reduces resource consumption in Kubernetes auto-scaling tests.

Conclusion: Fremer sets a new benchmark in workload forecasting by integrating efficiency, accuracy, and practical utility, validated with proprietary datasets and real-world tests.

Abstract: Workload forecasting is pivotal in cloud service applications, such as
auto-scaling and scheduling, with profound implications for operational
efficiency. Although Transformer-based forecasting models have demonstrated
remarkable success in general tasks, their computational efficiency often falls
short of the stringent requirements in large-scale cloud environments. Given
that most workload series exhibit complicated periodic patterns, addressing
these challenges in the frequency domain offers substantial advantages. To this
end, we propose Fremer, an efficient and effective deep forecasting model.
Fremer fulfills three critical requirements: it demonstrates superior
efficiency, outperforming most Transformer-based forecasting models; it
achieves exceptional accuracy, surpassing all state-of-the-art (SOTA) models in
workload forecasting; and it exhibits robust performance for multi-period
series. Furthermore, we collect and open-source four high-quality, open-source
workload datasets derived from ByteDance's cloud services, encompassing
workload data from thousands of computing instances. Extensive experiments on
both our proprietary datasets and public benchmarks demonstrate that Fremer
consistently outperforms baseline models, achieving average improvements of
5.5% in MSE, 4.7% in MAE, and 8.6% in SMAPE over SOTA models, while
simultaneously reducing parameter scale and computational costs. Additionally,
in a proactive auto-scaling test based on Kubernetes, Fremer improves average
latency by 18.78% and reduces resource consumption by 2.35%, underscoring its
practical efficacy in real-world applications.

*Chenrui Zhu,Louenas Bounia,Vu Linh Nguyen,Sébastien Destercke,Arthur Hoarau*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces using prediction uncertainty to enhance model explanation methods, focusing on epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in interpreting complex machine learning models by leveraging different types of uncertainty for better explanations.

Method: Distinguishing between aleatoric (data-related) and epistemic (model-related) uncertainties to guide the choice of explanation method and to reject unreliable explanations.

Result: Experiments show that uncertainty-aware approaches enhance the robustness and meaningfulness of explanations for machine learning and deep learning models.

Conclusion: Incorporating uncertainty quantification improves explainability, providing useful insights into model reliability and aiding in selecting explanation methods.

Abstract: Recent advancements in machine learning have emphasized the need for
transparency in model predictions, particularly as interpretability diminishes
when using increasingly complex architectures. In this paper, we propose
leveraging prediction uncertainty as a complementary approach to classical
explainability methods. Specifically, we distinguish between aleatoric
(data-related) and epistemic (model-related) uncertainty to guide the selection
of appropriate explanations. Epistemic uncertainty serves as a rejection
criterion for unreliable explanations and, in itself, provides insight into
insufficient training (a new form of explanation). Aleatoric uncertainty
informs the choice between feature-importance explanations and counterfactual
explanations. This leverages a framework of explainability methods driven by
uncertainty quantification and disentanglement. Our experiments demonstrate the
impact of this uncertainty-aware approach on the robustness and attainability
of explanations in both traditional machine learning and deep learning
scenarios.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses the trace reconstruction problem using a language model-based approach (TReconLM) to accurately recover sequences affected by insertion, deletion, and substitution errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Trace reconstruction is important for error correction in scenarios like DNA data storage, where current methods face challenges due to technology-specific noise patterns.

Method: The authors propose TReconLM, which uses pretrained and fine-tuned language models to predict sequences and handle noisy errors. It incorporates synthetic and real-world data to tackle technology-specific errors in trace reconstruction.

Result: TReconLM exceeds the performance of existing algorithms, recovering significantly more sequences without errors compared to state-of-the-art techniques.

Conclusion: TReconLM demonstrates notable advancements in the trace reconstruction problem, particularly in robustly correcting errors, making it a promising tool for DNA data storage and related applications.

Abstract: The general trace reconstruction problem seeks to recover an original
sequence from its noisy copies independently corrupted by deletions,
insertions, and substitutions. This problem arises in applications such as DNA
data storage, a promising storage medium due to its high information density
and longevity. However, errors introduced during DNA synthesis, storage, and
sequencing require correction through algorithms and codes, with trace
reconstruction often used as part of the data retrieval process. In this work,
we propose TReconLM, which leverages language models trained on next-token
prediction for trace reconstruction. We pretrain language models on synthetic
data and fine-tune on real-world data to adapt to technology-specific error
patterns. TReconLM outperforms state-of-the-art trace reconstruction
algorithms, including prior deep learning approaches, recovering a
substantially higher fraction of sequences without error.

*Hongze Tan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes two techniques to enhance the Differentiable Automatic Post-editing Optimization (DAPO) algorithm, focusing on stabilizing training and improving sample efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address instability and inefficiency issues in policy gradient methods, particularly in sparse reward scenarios.

Method: Two methods are introduced: regularizing target policy training using a stable pre-trained policy for off-policy experience, and re-utilizing zero-reward samples guided by an expert policy.

Result: Both methods lead to improved training stability, faster convergence, and enhanced sample efficiency. The theoretical analysis verifies convergence toward optimal solutions.

Conclusion: The mixed-policy approach improves the balance between exploration and exploitation, achieving more stable and efficient policy optimization in reinforcement learning contexts.

Abstract: This paper introduces two novel modifications to the Differentiable Automatic
Post-editing Optimization (DAPO) algorithm, approached from a mixed-policy
perspective. Standard policy gradient methods can suffer from instability and
sample inefficiency, particularly in sparse reward settings. To address this,
we first propose a method that incorporates a pre-trained, stable guiding
policy ($\piphi$) to provide off-policy experience, thereby regularizing the
training of the target policy ($\pion$). This approach improves training
stability and convergence speed by adaptively adjusting the learning step size.
Secondly, we extend this idea to re-utilize zero-reward samples, which are
often discarded by dynamic sampling strategies like DAPO's. By treating these
samples as a distinct batch guided by the expert policy, we further enhance
sample efficiency. We provide a theoretical analysis for both methods,
demonstrating that their objective functions converge to the optimal solution
within the established theoretical framework of reinforcement learning. The
proposed mixed-policy framework effectively balances exploration and
exploitation, promising more stable and efficient policy optimization.

*Weiqiu You,Anton Xue,Shreya Havaldar,Delip Rao,Helen Jin,Chris Callison-Burch,Eric Wong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces ARES, a novel framework to detect and prevent error propagation in reasoning chains generated by large language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reasoning errors in large language models (LLMs) often propagate due to the influence of initial errors on downstream judgment, undermining the reliability of results.

Method: ARES uses an inductive, probabilistic framework ensuring judgments are based only on verified prior premises, producing nuanced scores rather than binary labels.

Result: ARES achieves state-of-the-art performance with significant gains (+8.2 points Macro-F1) across four benchmarks and exhibits high robustness in identifying propagated errors, particularly in long reasoning chains.

Conclusion: ARES effectively mitigates error propagation in LLMs by introducing statistically sound methods of reasoning assessment, achieving better reliability and accuracy.

Abstract: In reasoning chains generated by large language models (LLMs), initial errors
often propagate and undermine the reliability of the final conclusion. Current
LLM-based error detection methods often fail to detect propagated errors
because they do not properly account for how earlier errors might corrupt
judgments of downstream reasoning. To better detect such propagated errors, we
introduce Autoregressive Reasoning Entailment Stability (ARES), a novel
probabilistic framework that prevents error propagation by judging each claim
based only on previously-assessed sound premises. This inductive method yields
a nuanced score for each step and provides certified statistical guarantees of
its soundness, rather than a brittle binary label. ARES achieves
state-of-the-art performance across four benchmarks (72.1% Macro-F1, +8.2
points) and demonstrates superior robustness on very long synthetic reasoning
chains, where it excels at detecting propagated errors (90.3% F1, +27.6
points).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Healthcare AI models require enhanced interpretability to ensure safety, transparency, and trust due to the significant impacts of their decisions.

Method: Matryoshka-SAE was used to analyze the internal representations of the MAIRA-2 multimodal model, identifying features through large-scale automated interpretability.

Result: Clinically relevant concepts such as medical devices, pathologies, and textual features were identified. Steering was tested to influence model behavior, with mixed success, revealing challenges.

Conclusion: The study highlights both practical challenges and initial insights into MAIRA-2's learned internal concepts, advancing the interpretability and transparency of radiology-specific AI models.

Abstract: Interpretability can improve the safety, transparency and trust of AI models,
which is especially important in healthcare applications where decisions often
carry significant consequences. Mechanistic interpretability, particularly
through the use of sparse autoencoders (SAEs), offers a promising approach for
uncovering human-interpretable features within large transformer-based models.
In this study, we apply Matryoshka-SAE to the radiology-specialised multimodal
large language model, MAIRA-2, to interpret its internal representations. Using
large-scale automated interpretability of the SAE features, we identify a range
of clinically relevant concepts - including medical devices (e.g., line and
tube placements, pacemaker presence), pathologies such as pleural effusion and
cardiomegaly, longitudinal changes and textual features. We further examine the
influence of these features on model behaviour through steering, demonstrating
directional control over generations with mixed success. Our results reveal
practical and methodological challenges, yet they offer initial insights into
the internal concepts learned by MAIRA-2 - marking a step toward deeper
mechanistic understanding and interpretability of a radiology-adapted
multimodal large language model, and paving the way for improved model
transparency. We release the trained SAEs and interpretations:

*Anna Bison,Alessandro Sperduti*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses over-smoothing in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) by revising the reservoir definition in Multiresolution Reservoir Graph Neural Network (MRGNN). It introduces a variant leveraging Fairing algorithms to provide controlled smoothing useful for tasks like graph classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the over-smoothing issue in GNNs, where graph signals converge toward low-frequency components. The paper aims to develop methods to allow controlled smoothing while preserving essential graph features.

Method: The authors adapt the Fairing algorithm, originally from surface design, to graphs using the Laplacian operator. This algorithm acts as a pass-band spectral filter for controlled smoothing.

Result: Theoretical analysis interprets spectral coefficient tuning as modulation of redundant random walks. Exploratory experiments demonstrate the approach's potential in graph classification tasks.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that controlled smoothing can mitigate over-smoothing and enhance GNN performance, opening pathways for further research in graph-based tasks.

Abstract: Reservoir computing has been successfully applied to graphs as a
preprocessing method to improve the training efficiency of Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs). However, a common issue that arises when repeatedly applying
layer operators on graphs is over-smoothing, which consists in the convergence
of graph signals toward low-frequency components of the graph Laplacian. This
work revisits the definition of the reservoir in the Multiresolution Reservoir
Graph Neural Network (MRGNN), a spectral reservoir model, and proposes a
variant based on a Fairing algorithm originally introduced in the field of
surface design in computer graphics. This algorithm provides a pass-band
spectral filter that allows smoothing without shrinkage, and it can be adapted
to the graph setting through the Laplacian operator. Given its spectral
formulation, this method naturally connects to GNN architectures for tasks
where smoothing, when properly controlled, can be beneficial,such as graph
classification. The core contribution of the paper lies in the theoretical
analysis of the algorithm from a random walks perspective. In particular, it
shows how tuning the spectral coefficients can be interpreted as modulating the
contribution of redundant random walks. Exploratory experiments based on the
MRGNN architecture illustrate the potential of this approach and suggest
promising directions for future research.

*Reza Riahi Samani,Alfredo Nunez,Bart De Schutter*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces WaveletInception-BiLSTM, a deep learning framework for monitoring infrastructure health using vibration signals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to enhance infrastructure health monitoring by utilizing vibration signals that capture spectral and temporal information, addressing limitations of preprocessing and speed variability.

Method: It proposes a WaveletInception-BiLSTM network combining Learnable Wavelet Packet Transform, Inception networks, and BiLSTM to process unprocessed vibration signals and infer health conditions.

Result: The framework significantly outperforms existing methods in estimating railway ballast and railpad stiffness using simulation data.

Conclusion: WaveletInception-BiLSTM shows promising results for automated, localized, and high-resolution health assessments in infrastructure through vibration analysis.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel deep learning-based framework for infrastructure
health monitoring using drive-by vibration response signals. Recognizing the
importance of spectral and temporal information, we introduce the
WaveletInception-BiLSTM network. The WaveletInception feature extractor
utilizes a Learnable Wavelet Packet Transform (LWPT) as the stem for extracting
vibration signal features, incorporating spectral information in the early
network layers. This is followed by 1D Inception networks that extract
multi-scale, high-level features at deeper layers. The extracted vibration
signal features are then integrated with operational conditions via a Long
Short-term Memory (LSTM) layer. The resulting feature extraction network
effectively analyzes drive-by vibration signals across various measurement
speeds without preprocessing and uses LSTM to capture interrelated temporal
dependencies among different modes of information and to create feature vectors
for health condition estimation. The estimator head is designed with a
sequential modeling architecture using bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM) networks,
capturing bi-directional temporal relationships from drive-by measurements.
This architecture allows for a high-resolution, beam-level assessment of
infrastructure health conditions. A case study focusing on railway track
stiffness estimation with simulated drive-by vibration signals shows that the
model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in estimating railway
ballast and railpad stiffness parameters. Results underscore the potential of
this approach for accurate, localized, and fully automated drive-by
infrastructure health monitoring.

*Youssef Tawfilis,Hossam Amer,Minar El-Aasser,Tallal Elshabrawy*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a decentralized GAN training method that leverages federated learning and heterogeneous split learning to address data and device constraints, achieving superior performance and privacy protection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the challenges of training generative models in decentralized settings, including lack of large datasets, computational limitations, and privacy constraints.

Method: The authors propose combining KLD-weighted Clustered Federated Learning with Heterogeneous U-Shaped split learning to handle data heterogeneity, multi-domain datasets, and device constraints without sharing raw or synthetic data or labels.

Result: The approach significantly improves image generation and classification tasks, achieving 1.1x–2.2x image generation score improvements, a 10% average boost in classification metrics (up to 50% in challenging settings), and faster performance compared to benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed approach demonstrates effective and efficient decentralized training of GANs, addressing privacy, data, and device heterogeneity issues.

Abstract: Federated Learning has gained increasing attention for its ability to enable
multiple nodes to collaboratively train machine learning models without sharing
their raw data. At the same time, Generative AI -- particularly Generative
Adversarial Networks (GANs) -- have achieved remarkable success across a wide
range of domains, such as healthcare, security, and Image Generation. However,
training generative models typically requires large datasets and significant
computational resources, which are often unavailable in real-world settings.
Acquiring such resources can be costly and inefficient, especially when many
underutilized devices -- such as IoT devices and edge devices -- with varying
capabilities remain idle. Moreover, obtaining large datasets is challenging due
to privacy concerns and copyright restrictions, as most devices are unwilling
to share their data. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach
for decentralized GAN training that enables the utilization of distributed data
and underutilized, low-capability devices while not sharing data in its raw
form. Our approach is designed to tackle key challenges in decentralized
environments, combining KLD-weighted Clustered Federated Learning to address
the issues of data heterogeneity and multi-domain datasets, with Heterogeneous
U-Shaped split learning to tackle the challenge of device heterogeneity under
strict data sharing constraints -- ensuring that no labels or raw data, whether
real or synthetic, are ever shared between nodes. Experimental results shows
that our approach demonstrates consistent and significant improvements across
key performance metrics, where it achieves 1.1x -- 2.2x higher image generation
scores, an average 10% boost in classification metrics (up to 50% in
multi-domain non-IID settings), in much lower latency compared to several
benchmarks. Find our code at https://github.com/youssefga28/HuSCF-GAN.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to improve Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) in capturing domain-specific features missed by their primary training through a residual learning approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the limitation of Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) in recognizing features that are domain-specific and underrepresented in training data.

Method: The method involves training a secondary Sparse Autoencoder to model the reconstruction error of a pretrained primary SAE on domain-specific texts. The outputs of both models are summed during inference to enhance feature recognition.

Result: The proposed approach achieved significant improvements in Large Language Model (LLM) metrics like cross-entropy and explained variance across various specialized domains.

Conclusion: The method integrates new domain knowledge into existing SAEs efficiently, enhances their interpretability in specific domains, and maintains their effectiveness in general tasks.

Abstract: Sparse Autoencoders have emerged as powerful tools for interpreting the
internal representations of Large Language Models, yet they often fail to
capture domain-specific features not prevalent in their training corpora. This
paper introduces a residual learning approach that addresses this feature
blindness without requiring complete retraining. We propose training a
secondary SAE specifically to model the reconstruction error of a pretrained
SAE on domain-specific texts, effectively capturing features missed by the
primary model. By summing the outputs of both models during inference, we
demonstrate significant improvements in both LLM cross-entropy and explained
variance metrics across multiple specialized domains. Our experiments show that
this method efficiently incorporates new domain knowledge into existing SAEs
while maintaining their performance on general tasks. This approach enables
researchers to selectively enhance SAE interpretability for specific domains of
interest, opening new possibilities for targeted mechanistic interpretability
of LLMs.

### [197] [SMART: Relation-Aware Learning of Geometric Representations for Knowledge Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13001)
*Kossi Amouzouvi,Bowen Song,Andrea Coletta,Luigi Bellomarini,Jens Lehmann,Sahar Vahdati*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel approach to improve knowledge graph embedding (KGE) models by leveraging relation-specific geometric transformations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing KGE models often use fixed geometric transformations for all relations, which limits their ability to optimally represent diverse structural and relational patterns.

Method: The framework evaluates relations' compatibility with various geometric transformations and assigns the optimal transformation using attention mechanisms or majority voting.

Result: The approach shows competitive performance on benchmark datasets and a real-world financial knowledge graph.

Conclusion: Tailoring geometric transformations to specific relations enhances KGE model efficacy and adds adaptability in representation.

Abstract: Knowledge graph representation learning approaches provide a mapping between
symbolic knowledge in the form of triples in a knowledge graph (KG) and their
feature vectors. Knowledge graph embedding (KGE) models often represent
relations in a KG as geometric transformations. Most state-of-the-art (SOTA)
KGE models are derived from elementary geometric transformations (EGTs), such
as translation, scaling, rotation, and reflection, or their combinations. These
geometric transformations enable the models to effectively preserve specific
structural and relational patterns of the KG. However, the current use of EGTs
by KGEs remains insufficient without considering relation-specific
transformations. Although recent models attempted to address this problem by
ensembling SOTA baseline models in different ways, only a single or composite
version of geometric transformations are used by such baselines to represent
all the relations. In this paper, we propose a framework that evaluates how
well each relation fits with different geometric transformations. Based on this
ranking, the model can: (1) assign the best-matching transformation to each
relation, or (2) use majority voting to choose one transformation type to apply
across all relations. That is, the model learns a single relation-specific EGT
in low dimensional vector space through an attention mechanism. Furthermore, we
use the correlation between relations and EGTs, which are learned in a low
dimension, for relation embeddings in a high dimensional vector space. The
effectiveness of our models is demonstrated through comprehensive evaluations
on three benchmark KGs as well as a real-world financial KG, witnessing a
performance comparable to leading models

*Luis Basora,Louison Bocquet-Nouaille,Elinirina Robinson,Serge Le Gonidec*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel onboard fault detection and diagnostic system for the electrical control system of space launcher engine valves, emphasizing confidence estimation, out-of-distribution detection, and false alarm control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for robust health monitoring in the next-generation reusable space launchers to ensure safety, reliability, and operational efficiency, particularly for critical sub-systems like engine valve controllers.

Method: The approach uses a temporal convolutional autoencoder to derive features from sensor data. Fault detection and diagnosis leverage binary and multiclass classifiers applied to the latent and residual spaces of the autoencoder. These classifiers use calibrated gradient boosting models to provide interpretable confidence levels. Out-of-distribution detection employs inductive conformal anomaly detection, and false alarms are limited using a cumulative sum control chart (CUSUM) with threshold adjustments for addressing class imbalance.

Result: The framework demonstrates promising performance on simulated data across both normal and fault scenarios. However, further testing with real operational data is needed to achieve deployable maturity.

Conclusion: The proposed onboard fault detection and diagnostic system is a positive advancement, but further validation with real-world data is needed to establish its operational feasibility.

Abstract: In the context of the health monitoring for the next generation of reusable
space launchers, we outline a first step toward developing an onboard fault
detection and diagnostic capability for the electrical system that controls the
engine valves. Unlike existing approaches in the literature, our solution is
designed to meet a broader range of key requirements. This includes estimating
confidence levels for predictions, detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) cases,
and controlling false alarms. The proposed solution is based on a temporal
convolutional autoencoder to automatically extract low-dimensional features
from raw sensor data. Fault detection and diagnosis are respectively carried
out using a binary and a multiclass classifier trained on the autoencoder
latent and residual spaces. The classifiers are histogram-based gradient
boosting models calibrated to output probabilities that can be interpreted as
confidence levels. A relatively simple technique, based on inductive conformal
anomaly detection, is used to identify OOD data. We leverage other simple yet
effective techniques, such as cumulative sum control chart (CUSUM) to limit the
false alarms, and threshold moving to address class imbalance in fault
detection. The proposed framework is highly configurable and has been evaluated
on simulated data, covering both nominal and anomalous operational scenarios.
The results indicate that our solution is a promising first step, though
testing with real data will be necessary to ensure that it achieves the
required maturity level for operational use.

### [199] [Confidence-Filtered Relevance (CFR): An Interpretable and Uncertainty-Aware Machine Learning Framework for Naturalness Assessment in Satellite Imagery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13034)
*Ahmed Emam,Ribana Roscher*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Confidence-Filtered Relevance (CFR), a data-centric framework combining interpretability methods and uncertainty estimation for analyzing naturalness in satellite imagery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for using satellite imagery to evaluate natural areas lack interpretability and fail to account for uncertainty in assessments.

Method: CFR integrates LRP Attention Rollout with Deep Deterministic Uncertainty (DDU) to filter relevance heatmaps by uncertainty thresholds, systematically analyzing model interpretability.

Result: Applying CFR to the AnthroProtect dataset, the framework revealed that regions like shrublands and forests are strongly linked to naturalness, while increased uncertainty leads to less clear attributions.

Conclusion: CFR demonstrates a useful approach for understanding how uncertainty impacts interpretability in satellite imagery-based naturalness evaluations, offering better insights for ecological monitoring.

Abstract: Protected natural areas play a vital role in ecological balance and ecosystem
services. Monitoring these regions at scale using satellite imagery and machine
learning is promising, but current methods often lack interpretability and
uncertainty-awareness, and do not address how uncertainty affects naturalness
assessment. In contrast, we propose Confidence-Filtered Relevance (CFR), a
data-centric framework that combines LRP Attention Rollout with Deep
Deterministic Uncertainty (DDU) estimation to analyze how model uncertainty
influences the interpretability of relevance heatmaps. CFR partitions the
dataset into subsets based on uncertainty thresholds, enabling systematic
analysis of how uncertainty shapes the explanations of naturalness in satellite
imagery. Applied to the AnthroProtect dataset, CFR assigned higher relevance to
shrublands, forests, and wetlands, aligning with other research on naturalness
assessment. Moreover, our analysis shows that as uncertainty increases, the
interpretability of these relevance heatmaps declines and their entropy grows,
indicating less selective and more ambiguous attributions. CFR provides a
data-centric approach to assess the relevance of patterns to naturalness in
satellite imagery based on their associated certainty.

TL;DR: The paper investigates the most effective Transformer architecture for Long-term Time Series Forecasting (LTSF) by proposing a new taxonomy, highlighting key architectural insights, and validating its conclusions via experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine the optimal Transformer architecture for LTSF tasks, given the variations in existing models and their coupling with time-series-specific designs.

Method: The authors propose a taxonomy disentangling various time-series-related architectural designs, then use it to systematically evaluate Transformer components like attention mechanisms, forecasting aggregations, and paradigms through experiments.

Result: Key findings include the effectiveness of bi-directional attention with joint-attention, the superiority of complete forecasting aggregation, and the advantage of the direct-mapping paradigm over autoregressive approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed taxonomy and experiments provide critical insights into Transformer design choices for LTSF, with their optimal model demonstrating better performance than existing methods and offering valuable guidance for future research.

Abstract: Transformer-based models have recently become dominant in Long-term Time
Series Forecasting (LTSF), yet the variations in their architecture, such as
encoder-only, encoder-decoder, and decoder-only designs, raise a crucial
question: What Transformer architecture works best for LTSF tasks? However,
existing models are often tightly coupled with various time-series-specific
designs, making it difficult to isolate the impact of the architecture itself.
To address this, we propose a novel taxonomy that disentangles these designs,
enabling clearer and more unified comparisons of Transformer architectures. Our
taxonomy considers key aspects such as attention mechanisms, forecasting
aggregations, forecasting paradigms, and normalization layers. Through
extensive experiments, we uncover several key insights: bi-directional
attention with joint-attention is most effective; more complete forecasting
aggregation improves performance; and the direct-mapping paradigm outperforms
autoregressive approaches. Furthermore, our combined model, utilizing optimal
architectural choices, consistently outperforms several existing models,
reinforcing the validity of our conclusions. We hope these findings offer
valuable guidance for future research on Transformer architectural designs in
LTSF. Our code is available at https://github.com/HALF111/TSF_architecture.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper investigates hypothesis classes based on permuted copies of infinite graphs and identifies conditions for PAC and online learnability in terms of graph properties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to understand the learnability of hypotheses generated by structural permutations of infinite graphs under PAC and online learning paradigms.

Method: The study analyzes learnable properties of finite-support and isomorphic copies of graphs, using methods such as automorphic triviality and relaxation of infinite random graph extension properties.

Result: PAC learnability of finite-support copies is linked to online learnability and automorphic triviality, and learnability for k-vertex permutations simplifies to 2-vertex permutations. A four-class partition of infinite graphs is also determined.

Conclusion: The paper provides a unified framework connecting graph properties to learnability notions, offering insights into the computational and descriptive complexity of infinite graphs.

Abstract: We study PAC and online learnability of hypothesis classes formed by copies
of a countably infinite graph G, where each copy is induced by permuting G's
vertices. This corresponds to learning a graph's labeling, knowing its
structure and label set. We consider classes where permutations move only
finitely many vertices. Our main result shows that PAC learnability of all such
finite-support copies implies online learnability of the full isomorphism type
of G, and is equivalent to the condition of automorphic triviality. We also
characterize graphs where copies induced by swapping two vertices are not
learnable, using a relaxation of the extension property of the infinite random
graph. Finally, we show that, for all G and k>2, learnability for k-vertex
permutations is equivalent to that for 2-vertex permutations, yielding a
four-class partition of infinite graphs, whose complexity we also determine
using tools coming from both descriptive set theory and computability theory.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces DASViT, a differentiable architecture search method for Vision Transformers, achieving innovative designs and superior performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing NAS methods, especially for Vision Transformers, rely on macro-level search spaces and discrete methods, which limit innovation, are computationally heavy, and time-demanding.

Method: The authors develop DASViT, a novel differentiable architecture search method tailored for Vision Transformers to address existing limitations.

Result: DASViT generates architectures that outperform the ViT-B/16 model in multiple datasets with better efficiency and fewer resources.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates that DASViT effectively introduces novel architectural designs for Vision Transformers, resulting in improved performance and efficiency.

Abstract: Designing effective neural networks is a cornerstone of deep learning, and
Neural Architecture Search (NAS) has emerged as a powerful tool for automating
this process. Among the existing NAS approaches, Differentiable Architecture
Search (DARTS) has gained prominence for its efficiency and ease of use,
inspiring numerous advancements. Since the rise of Vision Transformers (ViT),
researchers have applied NAS to explore ViT architectures, often focusing on
macro-level search spaces and relying on discrete methods like evolutionary
algorithms. While these methods ensure reliability, they face challenges in
discovering innovative architectural designs, demand extensive computational
resources, and are time-intensive. To address these limitations, we introduce
Differentiable Architecture Search for Vision Transformer (DASViT), which
bridges the gap in differentiable search for ViTs and uncovers novel designs.
Experiments show that DASViT delivers architectures that break traditional
Transformer encoder designs, outperform ViT-B/16 on multiple datasets, and
achieve superior efficiency with fewer parameters and FLOPs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Explainable AI (XAI) techniques often face challenges in being deterministic, model-agnostic, and convergent. The paper seeks to overcome these limitations to enhance the reliability and applicability of XAI methods.

Method: MUPAX employs a measure-theoretic formulation for structured perturbation analysis to identify feature importance, ensuring convergence across any input data dimension or problem context.

Result: MUPAX is shown to effectively apply in a variety of data modalities and tasks, enhancing AI model accuracy by focusing on key data patterns, and outperforms existing XAI techniques in precision and consistency.

Conclusion: The proposed MUPAX framework offers a robust XAI solution that ensures convergence, improves model reliability, and delivers understandable explanations applicable across diverse AI contexts. Code release is promised post-publication.

Abstract: Robust XAI techniques should ideally be simultaneously deterministic, model
agnostic, and guaranteed to converge. We propose MULTIDIMENSIONAL PROBLEM
AGNOSTIC EXPLAINABLE AI (MUPAX), a deterministic, model agnostic explainability
technique, with guaranteed convergency. MUPAX measure theoretic formulation
gives principled feature importance attribution through structured perturbation
analysis that discovers inherent input patterns and eliminates spurious
relationships. We evaluate MUPAX on an extensive range of data modalities and
tasks: audio classification (1D), image classification (2D), volumetric medical
image analysis (3D), and anatomical landmark detection, demonstrating dimension
agnostic effectiveness. The rigorous convergence guarantees extend to any loss
function and arbitrary dimensions, making MUPAX applicable to virtually any
problem context for AI. By contrast with other XAI methods that typically
decrease performance when masking, MUPAX not only preserves but actually
enhances model accuracy by capturing only the most important patterns of the
original data. Extensive benchmarking against the state of the XAI art
demonstrates MUPAX ability to generate precise, consistent and understandable
explanations, a crucial step towards explainable and trustworthy AI systems.

*Hyo-Jeong Jang,Hye-Bin Shin,Seong-Whan Lee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework to improve EEG model performance through a cross-modal knowledge distillation framework using visual models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address performance degradation in EEG-based models caused by label noise and inherent signal errors, leveraging cross-modal knowledge distillation.

Method: The authors proposed a prototype-based similarity module to align EEG and visual feature spaces and a task-specific distillation head to manage label misalignment.

Result: The proposed method showed improved EEG-based emotion regression and classification performance, outperforming unimodal and multimodal baselines.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates cross-modal knowledge distillation as an effective approach in enhancing EEG analysis, particularly for BCIs.

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) is a fundamental modality for cognitive state
monitoring in brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). However, it is highly
susceptible to intrinsic signal errors and human-induced labeling errors, which
lead to label noise and ultimately degrade model performance. To enhance EEG
learning, multimodal knowledge distillation (KD) has been explored to transfer
knowledge from visual models with rich representations to EEG-based models.
Nevertheless, KD faces two key challenges: modality gap and soft label
misalignment. The former arises from the heterogeneous nature of EEG and visual
feature spaces, while the latter stems from label inconsistencies that create
discrepancies between ground truth labels and distillation targets. This paper
addresses semantic uncertainty caused by ambiguous features and weakly defined
labels. We propose a novel cross-modal knowledge distillation framework that
mitigates both modality and label inconsistencies. It aligns feature semantics
through a prototype-based similarity module and introduces a task-specific
distillation head to resolve label-induced inconsistency in supervision.
Experimental results demonstrate that our approach improves EEG-based emotion
regression and classification performance, outperforming both unimodal and
multimodal baselines on a public multimodal dataset. These findings highlight
the potential of our framework for BCI applications.

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Neural Graph Topic Model (NGTM), a framework for graph generation that enhances interpretability by representing graphs as mixtures of latent topics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing graph generation methods lack interpretability, making it difficult to understand the rationale behind structural decisions.

Method: The paper proposes NGTM, inspired by topic modeling in NLP, which represents graphs as mixtures of latent topics to explain their structure. The method integrates topic distributions with global structural variables for semantic tracing.

Result: NGTM achieves competitive quality in graph generation and provides users with fine-grained control to adjust graph features or induce properties by topic-level modifications.

Conclusion: The NGTM framework bridges the gap between graph generation and interpretability, facilitating meaningful analysis and user control over graph structures.

Abstract: Graph generation plays a pivotal role across numerous domains, including
molecular design and knowledge graph construction. Although existing methods
achieve considerable success in generating realistic graphs, their
interpretability remains limited, often obscuring the rationale behind
structural decisions. To address this challenge, we propose the Neural Graph
Topic Model (NGTM), a novel generative framework inspired by topic modeling in
natural language processing. NGTM represents graphs as mixtures of latent
topics, each defining a distribution over semantically meaningful
substructures, which facilitates explicit interpretability at both local and
global scales. The generation process transparently integrates these topic
distributions with a global structural variable, enabling clear semantic
tracing of each generated graph. Experiments demonstrate that NGTM achieves
competitive generation quality while uniquely enabling fine-grained control and
interpretability, allowing users to tune structural features or induce
biological properties through topic-level adjustments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the lack of open-source datasets containing diverse nonverbal vocalizations (NVs) crucial for expressive speech synthesis research.

Method: The authors built a dataset from VoxCeleb and Expresso using automated detection, human validation, and a fusion algorithm. They fine-tuned TTS models on this dataset and evaluated their performance.

Result: Fine-tuned models on NVTTS achieved results comparable to closed-source systems like CosyVoice2 in terms of speaker similarity and NV fidelity.

Conclusion: By releasing NVTTS and its annotation guidelines, the paper resolves a major data bottleneck in expressive TTS research, promoting open-source advancements.

Abstract: Current expressive speech synthesis models are constrained by the limited
availability of open-source datasets containing diverse nonverbal vocalizations
(NVs). In this work, we introduce NonverbalTTS (NVTTS), a 17-hour open-access
dataset annotated with 10 types of NVs (e.g., laughter, coughs) and 8 emotional
categories. The dataset is derived from popular sources, VoxCeleb and Expresso,
using automated detection followed by human validation. We propose a
comprehensive pipeline that integrates automatic speech recognition (ASR), NV
tagging, emotion classification, and a fusion algorithm to merge transcriptions
from multiple annotators. Fine-tuning open-source text-to-speech (TTS) models
on the NVTTS dataset achieves parity with closed-source systems such as
CosyVoice2, as measured by both human evaluation and automatic metrics,
including speaker similarity and NV fidelity. By releasing NVTTS and its
accompanying annotation guidelines, we address a key bottleneck in expressive
TTS research. The dataset is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing representation learning in RL is often misaligned with RL tasks, as it is primarily focused on model learning rather than directly supporting value-based reinforcement.

Method: The paper introduces the Spectral Bellman Representation framework, derived from the Inherent Bellman Error condition, and grounds it on a spectral relationship between the Bellman operator and feature covariance, leading to a new objective for learning state-action features.

Result: The proposed method improves structured exploration, aligns feature covariance with Bellman dynamics, and boosts performance in hard-exploration and long-horizon credit assignment tasks.

Conclusion: The framework presents a principled path to learning robust representations for RL, compatible with value-based approaches and extendable to multi-step Bellman operators.

Abstract: The effect of representation has been demonstrated in reinforcement learning,
from both theoretical and empirical successes. However, the existing
representation learning mainly induced from model learning aspects, misaligning
with our RL tasks. This work introduces Spectral Bellman Representation, a
novel framework derived from the Inherent Bellman Error (IBE) condition, which
aligns with the fundamental structure of Bellman updates across a space of
possible value functions, therefore, directly towards value-based RL. Our key
insight is the discovery of a fundamental spectral relationship: under the
zero-IBE condition, the transformation of a distribution of value functions by
the Bellman operator is intrinsically linked to the feature covariance
structure. This spectral connection yields a new, theoretically-grounded
objective for learning state-action features that inherently capture this
Bellman-aligned covariance. Our method requires a simple modification to
existing algorithms. We demonstrate that our learned representations enable
structured exploration, by aligning feature covariance with Bellman dynamics,
and improve overall performance, particularly in challenging hard-exploration
and long-horizon credit assignment tasks. Our framework naturally extends to
powerful multi-step Bellman operators, further broadening its impact. Spectral
Bellman Representation offers a principled and effective path toward learning
more powerful and structurally sound representations for value-based
reinforcement learning.

*Shreyas Chaudhari,Srinivasa Pranav,José M. F. Moura*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Monotone Gradient Networks (mGradNets) to learn optimal transport mappings by minimizing a training loss tied to the Monge-Ampère equation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Optimal transport solutions, critical for applications like fluid dynamics and robot swarm control, require efficient computation methods. Monotone gradient functions are fundamental in this context.

Method: The authors employ mGradNets, neural networks designed to parameterize monotone gradient maps, optimizing their training loss using the Monge-Ampère equation.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that mGradNets' inherent design aids in learning optimal transport maps, showing success in a robot swarm control application.

Conclusion: mGradNets effectively capture structural biases and provide a promising neural network-based solution for optimal transport problems.

Abstract: Monotone gradient functions play a central role in solving the Monge
formulation of the optimal transport problem, which arises in modern
applications ranging from fluid dynamics to robot swarm control. When the
transport cost is the squared Euclidean distance, Brenier's theorem guarantees
that the unique optimal map is the gradient of a convex function, namely a
monotone gradient map, and it satisfies a Monge-Amp\`ere equation. In
[arXiv:2301.10862] [arXiv:2404.07361], we proposed Monotone Gradient Networks
(mGradNets), neural networks that directly parameterize the space of monotone
gradient maps. In this work, we leverage mGradNets to directly learn the
optimal transport mapping by minimizing a training loss function defined using
the Monge-Amp\`ere equation. We empirically show that the structural bias of
mGradNets facilitates the learning of optimal transport maps and employ our
method for a robot swarm control problem.

### [210] [MoTM: Towards a Foundation Model for Time Series Imputation based on Continuous Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13207)
*Etienne Le Naour,Tahar Nabil,Ghislain Agoua*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces MoTM, a new model for out-of-domain time series imputation that combines implicit neural representations (INRs) with a ridge regression approach, showing promise in handling diverse missing data scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the underexplored challenge of out-of-domain imputation for missing values in time series data, critical in scenarios with various sampling rates and distribution shifts.

Method: The method involves using a mixture of INRs (each trained on distinct time series families) combined with a ridge regressor to adapt and generalize during imputation tasks.

Result: MoTM demonstrates robust performance in both in-domain and out-of-domain generalization across different imputation scenarios, such as handling block and pointwise missingness and variable sampling rates.

Conclusion: The study sets a step forward toward creating foundation models capable of adaptable and effective time series imputation under various conditions.

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed a growing interest for time series foundation
models, with a strong emphasis on the forecasting task. Yet, the crucial task
of out-of-domain imputation of missing values remains largely underexplored. We
propose a first step to fill this gap by leveraging implicit neural
representations (INRs). INRs model time series as continuous functions and
naturally handle various missing data scenarios and sampling rates. While they
have shown strong performance within specific distributions, they struggle
under distribution shifts. To address this, we introduce MoTM (Mixture of
Timeflow Models), a step toward a foundation model for time series imputation.
Building on the idea that a new time series is a mixture of previously seen
patterns, MoTM combines a basis of INRs, each trained independently on a
distinct family of time series, with a ridge regressor that adapts to the
observed context at inference. We demonstrate robust in-domain and
out-of-domain generalization across diverse imputation scenarios (e.g., block
and pointwise missingness, variable sampling rates), paving the way for
adaptable foundation imputation models.

*Maria Margarida Mascarenhas,Jilles De Blauwe,Mikael Amelin,Hussain Kazmi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper studies how asynchronous electricity prices from interconnected markets can enhance forecasting accuracy in day-ahead markets, achieving improvements of 22% (Belgium) and 9% (Sweden) with specific methodological insights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address forecasting challenges in day-ahead electricity markets, where covariate data quality heavily impacts predictions, and explore if asynchronous price data from interconnected markets with differing gate closure times can improve forecast accuracy.

Method: The researchers use a state-of-the-art ensemble forecasting model, including price data from markets with earlier gate closure times to predict short-term prices in Belgium and Sweden, while also conducting interpretability analyses and recalibration studies.

Result: The inclusion of price data from Germany-Luxembourg, Austria, and Switzerland resulted in a 22% improvement in forecasting accuracy in Belgium and a 9% improvement in Sweden. The findings also highlight the need for frequent model recalibration and reveal that additional market data does not always lead to better results.

Conclusion: Incorporating asynchronous price data from interconnected markets enhances forecasting accuracy, but optimal strategies must balance the computational cost of model recalibration and the selective inclusion of relevant data from other markets.

Abstract: Accurate short-term electricity price forecasting is crucial for
strategically scheduling demand and generation bids in day-ahead markets. While
data-driven techniques have shown considerable prowess in achieving high
forecast accuracy in recent years, they rely heavily on the quality of input
covariates. In this paper, we investigate whether asynchronously published
prices as a result of differing gate closure times (GCTs) in some bidding zones
can improve forecasting accuracy in other markets with later GCTs. Using a
state-of-the-art ensemble of models, we show significant improvements of 22%
and 9% in forecast accuracy in the Belgian (BE) and Swedish bidding zones (SE3)
respectively, when including price data from interconnected markets with
earlier GCT (Germany-Luxembourg, Austria, and Switzerland). This improvement
holds for both general as well as extreme market conditions. Our analysis also
yields further important insights: frequent model recalibration is necessary
for maximum accuracy but comes at substantial additional computational costs,
and using data from more markets does not always lead to better performance - a
fact we delve deeper into with interpretability analysis of the forecast
models. Overall, these findings provide valuable guidance for market
participants and decision-makers aiming to optimize bidding strategies within
increasingly interconnected and volatile European energy markets.

### [212] [Merge Kernel for Bayesian Optimization on Permutation Space](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13263)
*Zikai Xie,Linjiang Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel Bayesian Optimization approach using sorting algorithms to generate kernel functions for permutation spaces, notably reducing computational complexity from quadratic to linearithmic.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The state-of-the-art Bayesian Optimization methods for permutation spaces rely on computationally expensive Mallows kernels, motivating the need for more efficient alternatives.

Method: A new framework based on sorting algorithms replaces the Mallows kernel with a Merge Kernel derived from merge sort. Supplemental descriptors like shift histogram, split-pair line, and sliding-window motifs enhance robustness.

Result: The Merge Kernel reduces complexity to \( n\log{n}\), provides compact feature vectors, and achieves better performance in various benchmarks compared to Mallows kernel.

Conclusion: The proposed Merge Kernel offers a more efficient and effective solution for Bayesian Optimization in permutation spaces, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Bayesian Optimization (BO) algorithm is a standard tool for black-box
optimization problems. The current state-of-the-art BO approach for permutation
spaces relies on the Mallows kernel-an $\Omega(n^2)$ representation that
explicitly enumerates every pairwise comparison. Inspired by the close
relationship between the Mallows kernel and pairwise comparison, we propose a
novel framework for generating kernel functions on permutation space based on
sorting algorithms. Within this framework, the Mallows kernel can be viewed as
a special instance derived from bubble sort. Further, we introduce the
\textbf{Merge Kernel} constructed from merge sort, which replaces the quadratic
complexity with $\Theta(n\log n)$ to achieve the lowest possible complexity.
The resulting feature vector is significantly shorter, can be computed in
linearithmic time, yet still efficiently captures meaningful permutation
distances. To boost robustness and right-invariance without sacrificing
compactness, we further incorporate three lightweight, task-agnostic
descriptors: (1) a shift histogram, which aggregates absolute element
displacements and supplies a global misplacement signal; (2) a split-pair line,
which encodes selected long-range comparisons by aligning elements across the
two halves of the whole permutation; and (3) sliding-window motifs, which
summarize local order patterns that influence near-neighbor objectives. Our
empirical evaluation demonstrates that the proposed kernel consistently
outperforms the state-of-the-art Mallows kernel across various permutation
optimization benchmarks. Results confirm that the Merge Kernel provides a more
compact yet more effective solution for Bayesian optimization in permutation
space.

*Vincenzo Marco De Luca,Giovanna Varni,Andrea Passerini*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces TRENN and MT-TRENN, advanced models for team dynamics prediction and interpretability in AI applications, demonstrating superior performance compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address practical demands of team modeling by creating unified models that can infer multiple constructs simultaneously, provide insights, and actionable recommendations, bridging the gap between temporal and relational dynamics in AI and Social Science research.

Method: TRENN integrates a temporal graph extractor, a tempo-relational encoder, a construct prediction decoder, and explainability modules. MT-TRENN extends TRENN by adding a multi-task head for learning shared Social Embeddings and simultaneously predicting multiple team constructs.

Result: TRENN and MT-TRENN outperform existing models focused solely on temporal or relational data. The explainability modules also provide insights and actionable recommendations to improve team performance.

Conclusion: The proposed models are highly effective and particularly suited for Human-Centered AI applications, offering interpretable and actionable insights essential for decision-making in collaborative environments.

Abstract: Team modeling remains a fundamental challenge at the intersection of
Artificial Intelligence and the Social Sciences. Social Science research
emphasizes the need to jointly model dynamics and relations, while practical
applications demand unified models capable of inferring multiple team
constructs simultaneously, providing interpretable insights and actionable
recommendations to enhance team performance. However, existing works do not
meet these practical demands. To bridge this gap, we present TRENN, a novel
tempo-relational architecture that integrates: (i) an automatic temporal graph
extractor, (ii) a tempo-relational encoder, (iii) a decoder for team construct
prediction, and (iv) two complementary explainability modules. TRENN jointly
captures relational and temporal team dynamics, providing a solid foundation
for MT-TRENN, which extends TReNN by replacing the decoder with a multi-task
head, enabling the model to learn shared Social Embeddings and simultaneously
predict multiple team constructs, including Emergent Leadership, Leadership
Style, and Teamwork components. Experimental results demonstrate that our
approach significantly outperforms approaches that rely exclusively on temporal
or relational information. Additionally, experimental evaluation has shown that
the explainability modules integrated in MT-TRENN yield interpretable insights
and actionable suggestions to support team improvement. These capabilities make
our approach particularly well-suited for Human-Centered AI applications, such
as intelligent decision-support systems in high-stakes collaborative
environments.

*Kyeongjin Ahn,Sungwon Han,Seungeon Lee,Donghyun Ahn,Hyoshin Kim,Jungwon Kim,Jihee Kim,Sangyoon Park,Meeyoung Cha*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces GeoReg, a regression model that integrates multiple data sources like satellite imagery and web-based information to effectively estimate socio-economic indicators in data-scarce regions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the critical need for accurate socio-economic data, which aids policy-making and development, especially in developing countries where such data is often scarce.

Method: The method employs a regression model called GeoReg, combining satellite and geospatial data with insights from large language models (LLMs). The LLM acts as a data engineer extracting features and incorporates both linear and nonlinear estimations for effective predictions.

Result: Experiments conducted across countries at varying development levels show GeoReg outperforms existing methods in estimating socio-economic indicators, particularly in low-income areas with limited data.

Conclusion: The study concludes that integrating advanced data techniques, such as LLM-based feature extraction and nonlinear modeling, is effective in addressing socio-economic data gaps, thus enhancing data-driven decision-making in under-resourced regions.

Abstract: Socio-economic indicators like regional GDP, population, and education
levels, are crucial to shaping policy decisions and fostering sustainable
development. This research introduces GeoReg a regression model that integrates
diverse data sources, including satellite imagery and web-based geospatial
information, to estimate these indicators even for data-scarce regions such as
developing countries. Our approach leverages the prior knowledge of large
language model (LLM) to address the scarcity of labeled data, with the LLM
functioning as a data engineer by extracting informative features to enable
effective estimation in few-shot settings. Specifically, our model obtains
contextual relationships between data features and the target indicator,
categorizing their correlations as positive, negative, mixed, or irrelevant.
These features are then fed into the linear estimator with tailored weight
constraints for each category. To capture nonlinear patterns, the model also
identifies meaningful feature interactions and integrates them, along with
nonlinear transformations. Experiments across three countries at different
stages of development demonstrate that our model outperforms baselines in
estimating socio-economic indicators, even for low-income countries with
limited data availability.

*Laker Newhouse,R. Preston Hess,Franz Cesista,Andrii Zahorodnii,Jeremy Bernstein,Phillip Isola*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores Lipschitz-constrained neural networks, showcasing novel tools that allow transformer models to maintain Lipschitz bounds during training and assessing their performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study seeks to address the sensitivity of neural networks to input and weight perturbations, which can lead to issues like adversarial vulnerability, divergent training, and overfitting.

Method: Develop and benchmark tools for norm-constrained matrices. Train transformer models under Lipschitz constraints using modified optimization techniques to analyze their stability and performance tradeoffs.

Result: Successfully implemented Lipschitz-constrained transformers, achieving 60% accuracy on Shakespeare text (2-Lipschitz model) and 21% accuracy on internet text (10-Lipschitz model), though with tradeoffs to match baseline accuracy.

Conclusion: While Lipschitz-constrained training shows promise in stabilizing neural networks, there are significant tradeoffs in performance when compared to unconstrained methods like NanoGPT.

Abstract: Neural networks are often highly sensitive to input and weight perturbations.
This sensitivity has been linked to pathologies such as vulnerability to
adversarial examples, divergent training, and overfitting. To combat these
problems, past research has looked at building neural networks entirely from
Lipschitz components. However, these techniques have not matured to the point
where researchers have trained a modern architecture such as a transformer with
a Lipschitz certificate enforced beyond initialization. To explore this gap, we
begin by developing and benchmarking novel, computationally-efficient tools for
maintaining norm-constrained weight matrices. Applying these tools, we are able
to train transformer models with Lipschitz bounds enforced throughout training.
We find that optimizer dynamics matter: switching from AdamW to Muon improves
standard methods -- weight decay and spectral normalization -- allowing models
to reach equal performance with a lower Lipschitz bound. Inspired by Muon's
update having a fixed spectral norm, we co-design a weight constraint method
that improves the Lipschitz vs. performance tradeoff on MLPs and 2M parameter
transformers. Our 2-Lipschitz transformer on Shakespeare text reaches
validation accuracy 60%. Scaling to 145M parameters, our 10-Lipschitz
transformer reaches 21% accuracy on internet text. However, to match the
NanoGPT baseline validation accuracy of 39.4%, our Lipschitz upper bound
increases to 10^264. Nonetheless, our Lipschitz transformers train without
stability measures such as layer norm, QK norm, and logit tanh softcapping.

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: This paper proposes a technique combining evolutionary algorithms and GANs to generate adversarial attacks against image classifiers, achieving notable success rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the growing security concerns posed by adversarial attacks on AI-based image classification systems.

Method: The paper combines evolutionary algorithms with generative adversarial networks to explore the latent space for generating adversarial vectors, tested on handwritten digits and object images.

Result: The approach achieved success rates of up to 35% for handwritten digits and 75% for object images, outperforming other methods in related studies.

Conclusion: The proposed method is effective for generating adversarial attacks, even in challenging datasets with diverse and complex information.

Abstract: Image classification currently faces significant security challenges due to
adversarial attacks, which consist of intentional alterations designed to
deceive classification models based on artificial intelligence. This article
explores an approach to generate adversarial attacks against image classifiers
using a combination of evolutionary algorithms and generative adversarial
networks. The proposed approach explores the latent space of a generative
adversarial network with an evolutionary algorithm to find vectors representing
adversarial attacks. The approach was evaluated in two case studies
corresponding to the classification of handwritten digits and object images.
The results showed success rates of up to 35% for handwritten digits, and up to
75% for object images, improving over other search methods and reported results
in related works. The applied method proved to be effective in handling data
diversity on the target datasets, even in problem instances that presented
additional challenges due to the complexity and richness of information.

TL;DR: This paper analyzes coevolutionary training strategies for GANs, finding that full generational replacement (mu, lambda) performs best in balancing diversity and quality of generated samples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to overcome training challenges of GANs, such as mode collapse and instability, by exploring coevolutionary approaches involving populations of generators and discriminators.

Method: The paper conducts an empirical comparison of different coevolutionary GAN strategies, including (mu, lambda), (mu+lambda) with elitism, and (mu+lambda) with tournament selection. These are tested on synthetic datasets and the MNIST image benchmark.

Result: The (mu, lambda) coevolutionary scheme, particularly with larger offspring sizes, outperforms others in generating high-quality and diverse samples. Elitist strategies show premature convergence and reduced diversity.

Conclusion: Balancing exploration and exploitation is key for effective coevolutionary GAN training, with full generational replacement being the most promising approach for improving performance.

Abstract: Generative adversarial networks (GANs) are powerful generative models but
remain challenging to train due to pathologies suchas mode collapse and
instability. Recent research has explored co-evolutionary approaches, in which
populations of generators and discriminators are evolved, as a promising
solution. This paper presents an empirical analysis of different coevolutionary
GAN training strategies, focusing on the impact of selection and replacement
mechanisms. We compare (mu,lambda), (mu+lambda) with elitism, and (mu+lambda)
with tournament selection coevolutionary schemes, along with a non-evolutionary
population based multi-generator multi-discriminator GAN baseline, across both
synthetic low-dimensional datasets (blob and gaussian mixtures) and an
image-based benchmark (MNIST). Results show that full generational replacement,
i.e., (mu,lambda), consistently outperforms in terms of both sample quality and
diversity, particularly when combined with larger offspring sizes. In contrast,
elitist approaches tend to converge prematurely and suffer from reduced
diversity. These findings highlight the importance of balancing exploration and
exploitation dynamics in coevolutionary GAN training and provide guidance for
designing more effective population-based generative models.

*Tom Smeding,Mikołaj Konarski,Simon Peyton Jones,Andrew Fitzgibbon*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a refined method for reverse-mode automatic differentiation (AD) with multidimensional arrays, improving performance but limiting support for higher-order code.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for reverse-mode AD are inefficient for array programs. The paper seeks to enhance performance while maintaining the simplicity of dual-numbers construction.

Method: The approach integrates three components: vectorization code transformation (BOT), adaptation of dual-numbers reverse AD to array languages, and symbolic interpretation for compilation.

Result: The method achieves first-class support for multidimensional arrays in reverse-mode AD, reducing performance overhead but with limited functionality for higher-order code.

Conclusion: By transforming higher-order programs to first-order ones, the method simplifies implementation and allows dual arrays to function effectively, at the cost of generalizing less to higher-order operations.

Abstract: The standard dual-numbers construction works well for forward-mode automatic
differentiation (AD) and is attractive due to its simplicity; recently, it also
has been adapted to reverse-mode AD, but practical performance, especially on
array programs, leaves a lot to be desired. In this paper we introduce
first-class support for multidimensional arrays in dual-numbers reverse-mode AD
with little to no performance overhead. The algorithm consists of three
loosely-coupled components: a semantics-preserving vectorisation code
transformation (the bulk-operation transform or BOT), a fairly straightforward
lifting of the basic dual-numbers reverse AD algorithm to a mostly first-order
array language, and symbolic interpretation to achieve an end-to-end
compilation pipeline. Unfortunately, we lose some of the nice generalisable
aspects of dual-numbers AD in the process, most importantly support for
higher-order code.
  We do support some higher-order array combinators, but only a
carefully-chosen set: 'build' (elementwise array construction), 'gather' and
'scatter'. In return, the BOT can eliminate the essential (for AD)
higher-orderness of the input program, meaning that AD gets essentially
presented with a first-order program. This allows the naive trick of lifting
dual numbers to "dual arrays" to work without much modification.

TL;DR: The paper offers a faithful semantics for modern regular expression languages with backtracking, mechanized proofs, and real-world applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing regular expression semantics lack practical, structured, and provably faithful formalizations, especially matching the backtracking behaviors of modern engines.

Method: The authors develop a mechanized and complete semantics for JavaScript regex, proving equivalence to the ECMAScript specification, using the Rocq proof assistant.

Result: The study introduces contextual equivalence and a formal proof of the PikeVM algorithm, enhancing semantic analysis and real-world regex engine understanding.

Conclusion: Their semantics not only ensures faithfulness to the ECMAScript spec but also records backtracking trees, offering new insights and applications in regex analysis.

Abstract: We present the first mechanized, succinct, practical, complete, and
proven-faithful semantics for a modern regular expression language with
backtracking semantics. We ensure its faithfulness by proving it equivalent to
a preexisting line-by-line embedding of the official ECMAScript specification
of JavaScript regular expressions. We demonstrate its practicality by
presenting two real-world applications. First, a new notion of contextual
equivalence for modern regular expressions, which we use to prove or disprove
rewrites drawn from previous work. Second, the first formal proof of the PikeVM
algorithm used in many real-world engines. In contrast with the specification
and other formalization work, our semantics captures not only the top-priority
match, but a full backtracking tree recording all possible matches and their
respective priority. All our definitions and results have been mechanized in
the Rocq proof assistant.

TL;DR: This paper introduces Astrogator, a system aimed at offering formal correctness guarantees for LLM-generated code in Ansible by integrating a formal query language and symbolic verification tools.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often generate incorrect code, and users, especially those with minimal programming experience, struggle to detect these errors. The authors aim to improve AI-assisted coding by ensuring formal correctness guarantees for generated code.

Method: The paper proposes a formal query language to represent user intent and introduces a system called Astrogator, which includes a calculus for Ansible programs and a symbolic interpreter to verify the correctness of LLM-generated code.

Result: In a benchmark of 21 code-generation tasks, Astrogator's verifier successfully verified correct code in 83% of cases and identified incorrect code in 92% of cases.

Conclusion: Astrogator demonstrates promising results in improving the reliability of LLM-generated code and offers a formal correctness framework that can aid users with limited programming knowledge.

Abstract: In the past few years LLMs have emerged as a tool that can aid programmers by
taking natural language descriptions and generating code based on it. However,
LLMs often generate incorrect code that users need to fix and the literature
suggests users often struggle to detect these errors. In this work we seek to
offer formal guarantees of correctness to LLM generated code; such guarantees
could improve the experience of using AI Code Assistants and potentially enable
natural language programming for users with little or no programming knowledge.
To address this challenge we propose to incorporate a formal query language
that can represent a user's intent in a formally defined but natural
language-like manner that a user can confirm matches their intent. Then, using
such a query we propose to verify LLM generated code to ensure it matches the
user's intent. We implement these ideas in our system, Astrogator, for the
Ansible programming language which includes such a formal query language, a
calculus for representing the behavior of Ansible programs, and a symbolic
interpreter which is used for the verification. On a benchmark suite of 21
code-generation tasks, our verifier is able to verify correct code in 83% of
cases and identify incorrect code in 92%.

Motivation: Addressing the insufficient consideration of LiDAR-specific effects in current Novel View Synthesis methods for better simulation and large-scale 3D scene reconstruction.

Method: Explicit modeling of sensor characteristics like rolling shutter, laser power variations, and intensity falloff in LiDAR simulation.

Result: Demonstrated effectiveness via comparisons with state-of-the-art methods, ablation studies, and advanced capabilities like high-resolution LiDAR scans in camera perspective.

Conclusion: The proposed method achieves improved accuracy in LiDAR simulation and showcases advanced resimulation capabilities, contributing valuable insights and tools to the field.

Abstract: Methods for Novel View Synthesis (NVS) have recently found traction in the
field of LiDAR simulation and large-scale 3D scene reconstruction. While
solutions for faster rendering or handling dynamic scenes have been proposed,
LiDAR specific effects remain insufficiently addressed. By explicitly modeling
sensor characteristics such as rolling shutter, laser power variations, and
intensity falloff, our method achieves more accurate LiDAR simulation compared
to existing techniques. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach
through quantitative and qualitative comparisons with state-of-the-art methods,

Motivation: To leverage the complementary strengths of FMs and WMs for task generalization and effective learning in reward-free scenarios.

Method: FOUNDER grounds FM representations in WM state space, enabling the learning of a goal-conditioned policy using temporal distance as an intrinsic reward.

Result: FOUNDER excels in multi-task visual control benchmarks, especially in overcoming complex observations, domain gaps, and demonstrating consistent reward reliability.

Conclusion: FOUNDER validates its effectiveness in integrating FM and WM for open-ended embodied task solving, showing significant improvements over prior methods.

Abstract: Foundation Models (FMs) and World Models (WMs) offer complementary strengths
in task generalization at different levels. In this work, we propose FOUNDER, a
framework that integrates the generalizable knowledge embedded in FMs with the
dynamic modeling capabilities of WMs to enable open-ended task solving in
embodied environments in a reward-free manner. We learn a mapping function that
grounds FM representations in the WM state space, effectively inferring the
agent's physical states in the world simulator from external observations. This
mapping enables the learning of a goal-conditioned policy through imagination
during behavior learning, with the mapped task serving as the goal state. Our
method leverages the predicted temporal distance to the goal state as an
informative reward signal. FOUNDER demonstrates superior performance on various
multi-task offline visual control benchmarks, excelling in capturing the
deep-level semantics of tasks specified by text or videos, particularly in
scenarios involving complex observations or domain gaps where prior methods
struggle. The consistency of our learned reward function with the ground-truth

TL;DR: ReAL-AD is a framework that improves end-to-end autonomous driving using a three-tiered reasoning structure aligned with human cognition and Vision-Language Models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current autonomous driving systems have limitations due to reliance on fixed, sparse trajectory supervision, failing to reflect the hierarchical reasoning processes of human drivers.

Method: ReAL-AD employs a three-tier approach: (1) Strategic Reasoning Injector for high-level strategies via Vision-Language Models, (2) Tactical Reasoning Integrator refining strategies to tactical choices, and (3) Hierarchical Trajectory Decoder for human-like trajectory execution.

Result: ReAL-AD improves planning accuracy and safety by over 30% compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The framework structures autonomous driving based on human-like reasoning processes, enhancing interpretability, situational awareness, and execution. It is a significant improvement for end-to-end autonomous driving.

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving has emerged as a promising approach to unify
perception, prediction, and planning within a single framework, reducing
information loss and improving adaptability. However, existing methods often
rely on fixed and sparse trajectory supervision, limiting their ability to
capture the hierarchical reasoning process that human drivers naturally employ.
To bridge this gap, we propose ReAL-AD, a Reasoning-Augmented Learning
framework that structures decision-making in autonomous driving based on the
three-tier human cognitive model: Driving Strategy, Driving Decision, and
Driving Operation, where Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are incorporated to
enhance situational awareness and structured reasoning across these levels.
Specifically, we introduce: (1) the Strategic Reasoning Injector, which
formulates high-level driving strategies by interpreting complex traffic
contexts from VLM-generated insights; (2) the Tactical Reasoning Integrator,
which refines strategic intent into interpretable tactical choices such as lane
changes, overtaking, and speed adjustments; and (3) the Hierarchical Trajectory
Decoder, which progressively translates tactical decisions into precise control
actions for smooth and human-like trajectory execution. Extensive evaluations
show that integrating our framework improves planning accuracy and safety by
over 30%, making end-to-end autonomous driving more interpretable and aligned
with human-like hierarchical reasoning. The project page can be found at:

Result: VLMgineer achieves superior task-solving capabilities compared to human-specified designs and traditional tools, demonstrating innovative solutions to manipulation challenges.

Conclusion: VLMgineer transforms complex robotics tasks into straightforward solutions and sets the stage for future automated tool invention research by providing benchmarks and code.

Abstract: Tool design and use reflect the ability to understand and manipulate the
physical world through creativity, planning, and foresight. As such, these
capabilities are often regarded as measurable indicators of intelligence across
biological species. While much of today's research on robotic intelligence
focuses on generating better controllers, inventing smarter tools offers a
complementary form of physical intelligence: shifting the onus of
problem-solving onto the tool's design. Given the vast and impressive
common-sense, reasoning, and creative capabilities of today's foundation
models, we investigate whether these models can provide useful priors to
automatically design and effectively wield such tools? We present VLMgineer, a
framework that harnesses the code generation abilities of vision language
models (VLMs) together with evolutionary search to iteratively co-design
physical tools and the action plans that operate them to perform a task. We
evaluate VLMgineer on a diverse new benchmark of everyday manipulation
scenarios that demand creative tool design and use. Across this suite,
VLMgineer consistently discovers tools and policies that solve tasks more
effectively and innovatively, transforming challenging robotics problems into
straightforward executions. It also outperforms VLM-generated designs from
human specifications and existing human-crafted tools for everyday tasks. To
facilitate future research on automated tool invention, we will release our
benchmark and code.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to measure soil moisture accurately in applications like agriculture and climate modeling is hindered by the high cost of existing methods.

Method: The authors developed MoistureMapper, a mobile robot equipped with TDR sensors and a drill mechanism, using Gaussian Process-based adaptive sampling for spatial moisture mapping.

Result: The robot's adaptive sampling approach reduced travel distance by up to 30% and moisture map variance by 5%, as demonstrated in computational simulations and proof-of-concept field tests.

Conclusion: MoistureMapper proves to be a more efficient and cost-effective solution for high-resolution soil moisture mapping compared to traditional methods.

Abstract: Soil moisture is a quantity of interest in many application areas including
agriculture and climate modeling. Existing methods are not suitable for scale
applications due to large deployment costs in high-resolution sensing
applications such as for variable irrigation. In this work, we design, build
and field deploy an autonomous mobile robot, MoistureMapper, for soil moisture
sensing. The robot is equipped with Time Domain Reflectometry (TDR) sensors and
a direct push drill mechanism for deploying the sensor to measure volumetric
water content in the soil. Additionally, we implement and evaluate multiple
adaptive sampling strategies based on a Gaussian Process based modeling to
build a spatial mapping of moisture distribution in the soil. We present
results from large scale computational simulations and proof-of-concept
deployment on the field. The adaptive sampling approach outperforms a greedy
benchmark approach and results in up to 30\% reduction in travel distance and
5\% reduction in variance in the reconstructed moisture maps. Link to video

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces IMUnet, a lightweight neural network for estimating mobile robot platform stability directly from proprioceptive data, eliminating the need for terrain models or force sensing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current stability metrics for wheeled robots navigating off-road environments are impractical, requiring precise measurements of contact forces and terrain geometry. This paper aims to simplify stability estimation using machine learning.

Method: The authors utilize IMUnet, a neural network trained on proprioceptive data, and develop a vision-based ArUco tracking approach to compute a C3 score that serves as the training signal for the stability model.

Result: The study demonstrates the generalization of IMUnet to varied terrain types and speeds, showcasing its ability to estimate platform stability under unseen conditions.

Conclusion: This approach enables accurate stability estimation for robots, facilitating effective tasks in complex environments like agriculture and space, and enhances traversability estimations for planning.

Abstract: Navigating in off-road environments for wheeled mobile robots is challenging
due to dynamic and rugged terrain. Traditional physics-based stability metrics,
such as Static Stability Margin (SSM) or Zero Moment Point (ZMP) require
knowledge of contact forces, terrain geometry, and the robot's precise
center-of-mass that are difficult to measure accurately in real-world field
conditions. In this work, we propose a learning-based approach to estimate
robot platform stability directly from proprioceptive data using a lightweight
neural network, IMUnet. Our method enables data-driven inference of robot
stability without requiring an explicit terrain model or force sensing.
  We also develop a novel vision-based ArUco tracking method to compute a
scalar score to quantify robot platform stability called C3 score. The score
captures image-space perturbations over time as a proxy for physical
instability and is used as a training signal for the neural network based
model. As a pilot study, we evaluate our approach on data collected across
multiple terrain types and speeds and demonstrate generalization to previously
unseen conditions. These initial results highlight the potential of using IMU
and robot velocity as inputs to estimate platform stability. The proposed
method finds application in gating robot tasks such as precision actuation and
sensing, especially for mobile manipulation tasks in agricultural and space
applications. Our learning method also provides a supervision mechanism for
perception based traversability estimation and planning.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a lightweight visual navigation framework leveraging a new segmentation model ASCnet and sliding window post-processing to improve deformable linear object (DLO) detection in edge devices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable effective ground-level obstacle detection for mobile robots where traditional LiDAR sensors fail, especially for deformable linear objects like wires.

Method: A visual navigation framework using Atrous Strip Convolution Network (ASCnet) with MobileNetV2 as backbone, ASC Spatial Pyramid Pooling for feature extraction, and a Sliding Window post-processing module.

Result: The method achieved 75.3% Miou score on a self-built dataset and 9.3 FPS inference speed on the Jetson Orin Nano edge device, outperforming existing models in DLO detection.

Conclusion: The proposed ASC-SW framework balances segmentation performance and inference speed, proving effective in physical robotic platforms for navigation tasks.

Abstract: With the rapid development of lightweight visual neural network
architectures, traditional high-performance vision models have undergone
significant compression, greatly improving their computational efficiency and
energy consumption ratio. This makes them feasible for deployment on
resource-constrained edge computing devices. We propose a visual-assisted
navigation framework called Atrous Strip Convolution-Sliding Window (ASC-SW),
which leverages a depth camera and a lightweight visual neural network to
assist map-based mobile robot navigation. This framework compensates for the
inability of traditional light detection and range (LiDAR) sensors to detect
ground-level obstacles such as ground-level wires. We introduce a lightweight
and efficient segmentation model, Atrous Strip Convolution Network (ASCnet),
for detecting deformable linear objects (DLOs). MobileNetV2 is used as the
backbone network, and Atrous Strip Convolution Spatial Pyramid Pooling (ASCSPP)
is designed to extract DLO features more effectively. Atrous Strip Convolution
is integrated into ASCSPP to accurately identify the linear structure of DLOs
with low computational cost. Additionally, a Sliding Window (SW)
post-processing module is proposed to denoise the output in complex
environments, improving recognition accuracy. Our method strikes a balance
between inference speed and segmentation performance. It achieves a mean
Intersection over Union (Miou) score of 75.3% on a self-built dataset and
reaches 9.3 FPS inference speed on the Jetson Orin Nano edge device. Overall,
our approach outperforms existing DLO detection models and has been
successfully validated on a physical robotic platform.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper examines how optimizing gait parameters (duty factor, phase shift, and stride duration) in quadrupedal robots impacts energy efficiency, using the Unitree A1 robot as a case study.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Energy efficiency in quadrupedal robots is critical for enhancing performance and autonomy, yet the role of gait parameters in affecting energy consumption remains underexplored.

Method: The researchers modeled the Unitree A1 quadrupedal robot, developed a controller that adjusts gait parameters, and conducted both simulations in Gazebo at various speeds and experimental validation tests.

Result: Optimization of gait parameters showed significant reductions in energy consumption, demonstrating how gait parameter tuning can improve energy efficiency in quadrupedal locomotion.

Conclusion: The findings provide actionable insights for developing energy-efficient control strategies in legged robots, contributing to advancements in robotics applicable to existing commercial platforms.

Abstract: Energy efficiency is a critical factor in the performance and autonomy of
quadrupedal robots. While previous research has focused on mechanical design
and actuation improvements, the impact of gait parameters on energetics has
been less explored. In this paper, we hypothesize that gait parameters,
specifically duty factor, phase shift, and stride duration, are key
determinants of energy consumption in quadrupedal locomotion. To test this
hypothesis, we modeled the Unitree A1 quadrupedal robot and developed a
locomotion controller capable of independently adjusting these gait parameters.
Simulations of bounding gaits were conducted in Gazebo across a range of gait
parameters at three different speeds: low, medium, and high. Experimental tests
were also performed to validate the simulation results. The findings
demonstrate that optimizing gait parameters can lead to significant reductions
in energy consumption, enhancing the overall efficiency of quadrupedal
locomotion. This work contributes to the advancement of energy-efficient
control strategies for legged robots, offering insights directly applicable to
commercially available platforms.

### [229] [osmAG-LLM: Zero-Shot Open-Vocabulary Object Navigation via Semantic Maps and Large Language Models Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12753)
*Fujing Xie,Sören Schwertfeger,Hermann Blum*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper develops a mapping and navigation system for robots that considers the dynamic location of objects, outperforming traditional methods in navigating to objects that may have moved or are unmapped.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-detail object mapping in open-vocabulary robot systems easily becomes outdated due to object movement, necessitating a method that accounts for dynamic environments.

Method: The paper combines environmental grounding maps with semantic priors from large language models (LLMs) and employs an active, online object navigation strategy instead of relying solely on detailed static maps.

Result: The proposed system achieves higher success rates with shorter paths for static objects and significantly outperforms prior methods for dynamic or unmapped object queries in both simulations and real-world experiments.

Conclusion: A focus on environmental grounding, semantic reasoning via LLMs, and active navigation strategies enables better robot navigation performance in dynamic contexts, addressing limitations in previous object mapping methods.

Abstract: Recent open-vocabulary robot mapping methods enrich dense geometric maps with
pre-trained visual-language features, achieving a high level of detail and
guiding robots to find objects specified by open-vocabulary language queries.
While the issue of scalability for such approaches has received some attention,
another fundamental problem is that high-detail object mapping quickly becomes
outdated, as objects get moved around a lot. In this work, we develop a mapping
and navigation system for object-goal navigation that, from the ground up,
considers the possibilities that a queried object can have moved, or may not be
mapped at all. Instead of striving for high-fidelity mapping detail, we
consider that the main purpose of a map is to provide environment grounding and
context, which we combine with the semantic priors of LLMs to reason about
object locations and deploy an active, online approach to navigate to the
objects. Through simulated and real-world experiments we find that our approach
tends to have higher retrieval success at shorter path lengths for static
objects and by far outperforms prior approaches in cases of dynamic or unmapped
object queries. We provide our code and dataset at:

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a lightweight and robust visual repeat navigation system for mobile robots, bypassing the need for precise localization and dense mapping.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mobile robot self-navigation faces challenges in efficiently and robustly navigating environments without relying on heavy computational modules.

Method: The method uses feature flow to create a qualitative mapping between pixel location biases and robot motion, representing navigation maps as keyframe graphs with encoded feature flow for relative motion.

Result: The system demonstrated efficiency and robustness in extensive experiments, outperforming baseline methods.

Conclusion: The method is a significant contribution to visual repeat navigation, providing an effective balance of efficiency and robustness without requiring dense reconstruction modules.

Abstract: Though visual and repeat navigation is a convenient solution for mobile robot
self-navigation, achieving balance between efficiency and robustness in task
environment still remains challenges. In this paper, we propose a novel visual
and repeat robotic autonomous navigation method that requires no accurate
localization and dense reconstruction modules, which makes our system featured
by lightweight and robustness. Firstly, feature flow is introduced and we
develop a qualitative mapping between feature flow and robot's motion, in which
feature flow is defined as pixel location bias between matched features. Based
on the mapping model, the map outputted by the teaching phase is represented as
a keyframe graph, in which the feature flow on the edge encodes the relative
motion between adjacent keyframes. Secondly, the visual repeating navigation is
essentially modeled as a feature flow minimization problem between current
observation and the map keyframe. To drive the robot to consistently reduce the
feature flow between current frame and map keyframes without accurate
localization, a probabilistic motion planning is developed based on our
qualitative feature flow-motion mapping indicator. Extensive experiments using
our mobile platform demonstrates that our proposed method is lightweight,
robust, and superior to baselines. The source code has been made public at

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces Long-term Active Embodied Question Answering (LA-EQA), where robots use memory and exploration to answer temporally-based questions, presenting a structured memory system inspired by cognitive science to address limitations in standard methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable robots to operate effectively over extended periods by leveraging accumulated knowledge and improving human assistance through recalling past experiences and exploring environments.

Method: The paper proposes a structured memory system inspired by the mind palace method, encoding experiences as scene-graph-based instances, along with a value-of-information-based method for balancing exploration and recall.

Result: Experiments on real-world setups and benchmarks show that the proposed approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in answer accuracy and exploration efficiency.

Conclusion: Structured memory systems with guided exploration and effective stopping criteria substantially enhance robots' ability to recall and use past experiences for temporally-grounded questions.

Abstract: As robots become increasingly capable of operating over extended periods --
spanning days, weeks, and even months -- they are expected to accumulate
knowledge of their environments and leverage this experience to assist humans
more effectively. This paper studies the problem of Long-term Active Embodied
Question Answering (LA-EQA), a new task in which a robot must both recall past
experiences and actively explore its environment to answer complex,
temporally-grounded questions. Unlike traditional EQA settings, which typically
focus either on understanding the present environment alone or on recalling a
single past observation, LA-EQA challenges an agent to reason over past,
present, and possible future states, deciding when to explore, when to consult
its memory, and when to stop gathering observations and provide a final answer.
Standard EQA approaches based on large models struggle in this setting due to
limited context windows, absence of persistent memory, and an inability to
combine memory recall with active exploration. To address this, we propose a
structured memory system for robots, inspired by the mind palace method from
cognitive science. Our method encodes episodic experiences as scene-graph-based
world instances, forming a reasoning and planning algorithm that enables
targeted memory retrieval and guided navigation. To balance the
exploration-recall trade-off, we introduce value-of-information-based stopping
criteria that determines when the agent has gathered sufficient information. We
evaluate our method on real-world experiments and introduce a new benchmark
that spans popular simulation environments and actual industrial sites. Our
approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, yielding
substantial gains in both answer accuracy and exploration efficiency.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces DEMONSTRATE, a methodology leveraging inverse optimal control and multitask learning to reduce reliance on engineering expertise in using large language models for robotic control tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current systems integrating LLMs with control systems rely heavily on expertly designed task examples, posing challenges in mathematical formulation and hallucination avoidance.

Method: DEMONSTRATE replaces prompt examples with task demonstrations and applies multitask learning to ensure task similarity, using hardware-based teleoperation to collect robot demonstrations.

Result: Simulation and hardware experiments showcase the approach's effectiveness in robotic tabletop manipulation tasks.

Conclusion: DEMONSTRATE simplifies task configuration for robots, minimizes expert input requirements, enhances efficiency, and addresses hallucination concerns.

Abstract: The integration of large language models (LLMs) with control systems has
demonstrated significant potential in various settings, such as task completion
with a robotic manipulator. A main reason for this success is the ability of
LLMs to perform in-context learning, which, however, strongly relies on the
design of task examples, closely related to the target tasks. Consequently,
employing LLMs to formulate optimal control problems often requires task
examples that contain explicit mathematical expressions, designed by trained
engineers. Furthermore, there is often no principled way to evaluate for
hallucination before task execution. To address these challenges, we propose
DEMONSTRATE, a novel methodology that avoids the use of LLMs for complex
optimization problem generations, and instead only relies on the embedding
representations of task descriptions. To do this, we leverage tools from
inverse optimal control to replace in-context prompt examples with task
demonstrations, as well as the concept of multitask learning, which ensures
target and example task similarity by construction. Given the fact that
hardware demonstrations can easily be collected using teleoperation or guidance
of the robot, our approach significantly reduces the reliance on engineering
expertise for designing in-context examples. Furthermore, the enforced
multitask structure enables learning from few demonstrations and assessment of
hallucinations prior to task execution. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our
method through simulation and hardware experiments involving a robotic arm
tasked with tabletop manipulation.

TL;DR: LaViPlan framework uses Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards to address decision misalignments in Vision-Language Models for better OOD performance in autonomous driving.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve autonomous vehicle behavior in OOD scenarios where existing Vision-Language Models struggle with misalignment between high-level decisions and low-level trajectory actions.

Method: Introducing LaViPlan, which employs Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) to refine Vision-Language Models with planning-oriented metrics.

Result: Experimental evidence shows enhanced situational awareness and decision-making in OOD conditions, reducing misalignment issues inherent in prior models.

Conclusion: LaViPlan represents a promising post-training framework for optimizing Vision-Language Models in autonomous driving, particularly for handling OOD scenarios effectively.

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios in autonomous driving refer to situations
that deviate from the training domain, often leading to unexpected and
potentially hazardous behavior from planners that lack prior exposure to such
cases. Recently, Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have been introduced into
autonomous driving research for their promising generalization capabilities in
OOD settings. Early studies demonstrated that VLMs could recognize OOD
scenarios and generate user-level decisions such as "go straight" or "turn
right." However, a new challenge has emerged due to the misalignment between
the VLM's high-level decisions or visual reasoning expressed in language, and
the low-level predicted trajectories interpreted as actions. In this paper, we
propose LaViPlan, a framework that leverages Reinforcement Learning with
Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) to optimize VLMs using planning-oriented metrics.
This approach addresses the vision-language-action misalignment observed in
existing VLMs fine-tuned via supervised learning, which can recognize driving
scenarios but often produce context-unaware decisions. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method improves situational awareness and decision-making
under OOD conditions, highlighting its potential to mitigate the misalignment
issue. This work introduces a promising post-training paradigm for VLM agents
in the context of autonomous driving.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces MoCap2GT, a method combining motion capture (MoCap) data and IMU measurements to achieve more accurate ground truth trajectories for SLAM evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SLAM benchmarks face challenges due to errors in MoCap-derived ground truth trajectories, including calibration errors and motion capture jitter, which limit the evaluation of rotation and inter-frame accuracy.

Method: MoCap2GT uses joint optimization, higher-order pose parameterization on SE(3), and measurement rejection strategies to improve the precision of ground truth trajectories. It also employs a robust state initializer for global convergence.

Result: The proposed MoCap2GT method achieves more accurate ground truth trajectories than previous techniques, allowing for improved SLAM algorithm benchmarking.

Conclusion: MoCap2GT enhances the assessment of SLAM algorithms by addressing inherent limitations of MoCap-based ground truth trajectories.

Abstract: Marker-based optical motion capture (MoCap) systems are widely used to
provide ground truth (GT) trajectories for benchmarking SLAM algorithms.
However, the accuracy of MoCap-based GT trajectories is mainly affected by two
factors: spatiotemporal calibration errors between the MoCap system and the
device under test (DUT), and inherent MoCap jitter. Consequently, existing
benchmarks focus primarily on absolute translation error, as accurate
assessment of rotation and inter-frame errors remains challenging, hindering
thorough SLAM evaluation. This paper proposes MoCap2GT, a joint optimization
approach that integrates MoCap data and inertial measurement unit (IMU)
measurements from the DUT for generating high-precision GT trajectories.
MoCap2GT includes a robust state initializer to ensure global convergence,
introduces a higher-order B-spline pose parameterization on the SE(3) manifold
with variable time offset to effectively model MoCap factors, and employs a
degeneracy-aware measurement rejection strategy to enhance estimation accuracy.
Experimental results demonstrate that MoCap2GT outperforms existing methods and
significantly contributes to precise SLAM benchmarking. The source code is

TL;DR: The paper presents a reinforcement learning-based training for diffusion models in autonomous robotic motion planning, enhancing safety and goal-reaching effectiveness by addressing non-differentiable objectives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the limitations of diffusion models in capturing non-differentiable objectives essential for safe and effective autonomous motion planning, such as collision avoidance and goal-reaching.

Method: The method involves incorporating a reinforcement learning-based training scheme paired with a novel reward-weighted dynamic thresholding algorithm to encode safety and effectiveness objectives into the diffusion motion planning models.

Result: The proposed approach outperforms differentiable-objective-trained models on pedestrian datasets (CrowdNav, ETH-UCY), demonstrating improved safety and effectiveness in motion planning.

Conclusion: The study provides a robust method that significantly improves motion planning for autonomous robots, making it safer and more effective through reinforcement learning-based diffusion model training.

Abstract: Safe and effective motion planning is crucial for autonomous robots.
Diffusion models excel at capturing complex agent interactions, a fundamental
aspect of decision-making in dynamic environments. Recent studies have
successfully applied diffusion models to motion planning, demonstrating their
competence in handling complex scenarios and accurately predicting multi-modal
future trajectories. Despite their effectiveness, diffusion models have
limitations in training objectives, as they approximate data distributions
rather than explicitly capturing the underlying decision-making dynamics.
However, the crux of motion planning lies in non-differentiable downstream
objectives, such as safety (collision avoidance) and effectiveness
(goal-reaching), which conventional learning algorithms cannot directly
optimize. In this paper, we propose a reinforcement learning-based training
scheme for diffusion motion planning models, enabling them to effectively learn
non-differentiable objectives that explicitly measure safety and effectiveness.
Specifically, we introduce a reward-weighted dynamic thresholding algorithm to
shape a dense reward signal, facilitating more effective training and
outperforming models trained with differentiable objectives. State-of-the-art
performance on pedestrian datasets (CrowdNav, ETH-UCY) compared to various
baselines demonstrates the versatility of our approach for safe and effective
motion planning.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework combining camera noise factor identification with situation coverage analysis to ensure safe and robust AI perception systems in the presence of sensor degradation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Safe operation in dynamic environments requires robust AI perception despite sensor degradation, which existing approaches addressing all sensor degradation scenarios fail to manage effectively.

Method: A novel framework integrates expert involvement and Operational Design Domain specifications for identifying camera noise factors, along with situation coverage analysis to elicit safety requirements.

Result: The framework systematically identifies robustness-related safety requirements, focusing on camera degradation in automotive applications.

Conclusion: This framework is a foundational step toward a systematic approach for considering sensor degradation and situational coverage to improve safety in AI perception systems.

Abstract: AI-based robots and vehicles are expected to operate safely in complex and
dynamic environments, even in the presence of component degradation. In such
systems, perception relies on sensors such as cameras to capture environmental
data, which is then processed by AI models to support decision-making. However,
degradation in sensor performance directly impacts input data quality and can
impair AI inference. Specifying safety requirements for all possible sensor
degradation scenarios leads to unmanageable complexity and inevitable gaps. In
this position paper, we present a novel framework that integrates camera noise
factor identification with situation coverage analysis to systematically elicit
robustness-related safety requirements for AI-based perception systems. We
focus specifically on camera degradation in the automotive domain. Building on
an existing framework for identifying degradation modes, we propose involving
domain, sensor, and safety experts, and incorporating Operational Design Domain
specifications to extend the degradation model by incorporating noise factors
relevant to AI performance. Situation coverage analysis is then applied to
identify representative operational contexts. This work marks an initial step
toward integrating noise factor analysis and situational coverage to support
principled formulation and completeness assessment of robustness requirements
for camera-based AI perception.

Method: Researchers systematically evaluated various VLN methods, including classification models, diffusion models, and LLM-integrated path planning, on humanoid, quadruped, and wheeled robots using the VLN-PE platform.

Result: The study shows that physical constraints, mobility issues, and environment-related factors significantly degrade VLN models' performance when applied to real-world robotics.

Conclusion: VLN-PE enables better evaluation and adaptation of VLN methods for physical embodiments, pushing the community toward more robust and practical designs for diverse robotic platforms.

Abstract: Recent Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) advancements are promising, but
their idealized assumptions about robot movement and control fail to reflect
physically embodied deployment challenges. To bridge this gap, we introduce
VLN-PE, a physically realistic VLN platform supporting humanoid, quadruped, and
wheeled robots. For the first time, we systematically evaluate several
ego-centric VLN methods in physical robotic settings across different technical
pipelines, including classification models for single-step discrete action
prediction, a diffusion model for dense waypoint prediction, and a train-free,
map-based large language model (LLM) integrated with path planning. Our results
reveal significant performance degradation due to limited robot observation
space, environmental lighting variations, and physical challenges like
collisions and falls. This also exposes locomotion constraints for legged
robots in complex environments. VLN-PE is highly extensible, allowing seamless
integration of new scenes beyond MP3D, thereby enabling more comprehensive VLN
evaluation. Despite the weak generalization of current models in physical
deployment, VLN-PE provides a new pathway for improving cross-embodiment's
overall adaptability. We hope our findings and tools inspire the community to
rethink VLN limitations and advance robust, practical VLN models. The code is

### [238] [What Can Robots Teach Us About Trust and Reliance? An interdisciplinary dialogue between Social Sciences and Social Robotics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13041)
*Julien Wacquez,Elisabetta Zibetti,Joffrey Becker,Lorenzo Aloe,Fabio Amadio,Salvatore Anzalone,Lola Cañamero,Serena Ivaldi*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper discusses the fragmented approaches to trust in human-robot interaction (HRI) and emphasizes the need for an interdisciplinary framework integrating social sciences and social robotics to better understand and shape trust.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the gap between sociology's established theories on trust and the fragmented approaches within Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) to ensure better integration and understanding of trust in human-robot systems.

Method: The authors explore trust through interdisciplinary insights, leveraging both social science theories and developments in social robotics.

Result: The study proposes initiating dialogue between disciplines to create a robust framework for conceptualizing trust in human-robot interactions.

Conclusion: An interdisciplinary approach combining sociology and robotics is essential for building a grounded and adaptable understanding of trust in HRI contexts.

Abstract: As robots find their way into more and more aspects of everyday life,
questions around trust are becoming increasingly important. What does it mean
to trust a robot? And how should we think about trust in relationships that
involve both humans and non-human agents? While the field of Human-Robot
Interaction (HRI) has made trust a central topic, the concept is often
approached in fragmented ways. At the same time, established work in sociology,
where trust has long been a key theme, is rarely brought into conversation with
developments in robotics. This article argues that we need a more
interdisciplinary approach. By drawing on insights from both social sciences
and social robotics, we explore how trust is shaped, tested and made visible.
Our goal is to open up a dialogue between disciplines and help build a more
grounded and adaptable framework for understanding trust in the evolving world
of human-robot interaction.

### [239] [Efficient Online Learning and Adaptive Planning for Robotic Information Gathering Based on Streaming Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13053)
*Sanjeev Ramkumar Sudha,Joel Jose,Erlend M. Coates*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper presents an adaptive robot information gathering method using streaming sparse Gaussian processes for efficient environmental mapping, showing improved computational performance while maintaining mapping accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research addresses the limitations of Gaussian process regression in mapping unknown or changing environments due to its poor scalability for large datasets, which is critical for adaptive robot information gathering.

Method: The authors propose an adaptive informative planning framework using streaming sparse Gaussian processes to achieve efficient online mapping of continuous scalar fields.

Result: Simulation experiments on synthetic datasets and evaluations with real-world data demonstrate that the proposed method achieves comparable mapping accuracy to existing techniques while significantly reducing computational complexity during longer missions.

Conclusion: The proposed approach enhances real-time performance for adaptive robotic mapping tasks, making it effective for scenarios with large and dynamic datasets.

Abstract: Robotic information gathering (RIG) techniques refer to methods where mobile
robots are used to acquire data about the physical environment with a suite of
sensors. Informative planning is an important part of RIG where the goal is to
find sequences of actions or paths that maximize efficiency or the quality of
information collected. Many existing solutions solve this problem by assuming
that the environment is known in advance. However, real environments could be
unknown or time-varying, and adaptive informative planning remains an active
area of research. Adaptive planning and incremental online mapping are required
for mapping initially unknown or varying spatial fields. Gaussian process (GP)
regression is a widely used technique in RIG for mapping continuous spatial
fields. However, it falls short in many applications as its real-time
performance does not scale well to large datasets. To address these challenges,
this paper proposes an efficient adaptive informative planning approach for
mapping continuous scalar fields with GPs with streaming sparse GPs. Simulation
experiments are performed with a synthetic dataset and compared against
existing benchmarks. Finally, it is also verified with a real-world dataset to
further validate the efficacy of the proposed method. Results show that our
method achieves similar mapping accuracy to the baselines while reducing
computational complexity for longer missions.

*Rahel Rickenbach,Alan A. Lahoud,Erik Schaffernicht,Melanie N. Zeilinger,Johannes A. Stork*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: ZipMPC proposes a compressed, context-aware cost function for short-horizon MPC to mimic long-horizon MPC while preserving computational efficiency and improving control performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The high computational cost of traditional long-horizon MPC makes it unsuitable for real-time applications, forcing the use of short horizons which compromises both long-term objectives and control design's robustness.

Method: ZipMPC uses a context-dependent cost function within short-horizon MPC and employs differentiable MPC with neural networks to propagate gradients of the imitation loss, combining learning-based techniques with optimization processes.

Result: Simulation and real-world experiments show that ZipMPC completes laps faster and more reliably than baselines, especially in challenging scenarios and unseen tracks, while maintaining computational efficiency.

Conclusion: ZipMPC demonstrates its effectiveness by achieving long-horizon MPC performance with the computational efficiency of short-horizon MPC, indicating its suitability for real-time applications and generalization to new environments.

Abstract: The computational burden of model predictive control (MPC) limits its
application on real-time systems, such as robots, and often requires the use of
short prediction horizons. This not only affects the control performance, but
also increases the difficulty of designing MPC cost functions that reflect the
desired long-term objective. This paper proposes ZipMPC, a method that imitates
a long-horizon MPC behaviour by learning a compressed and context-dependent
cost function for a short-horizon MPC. It improves performance over alternative
methods, such as approximate explicit MPC and automatic cost parameter tuning,
in particular in terms of i) optimizing the long term objective; ii)
maintaining computational costs comparable to a short-horizon MPC; iii)
ensuring constraint satisfaction; and iv) generalizing control behaviour to
environments not observed during training. For this purpose, ZipMPC leverages
the concept of differentiable MPC with neural networks to propagate gradients
of the imitation loss through the MPC optimization. We validate our proposed
method in simulation and real-world experiments on autonomous racing. ZipMPC
consistently completes laps faster than selected baselines, achieving lap times
close to the long-horizon MPC baseline. In challenging scenarios where the
short-horizon MPC baseline fails to complete a lap, ZipMPC is able to do so. In
particular, these performance gains are also observed on tracks unseen during
training.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes GraspGen, a framework for 6-DOF robotic grasping using a DiffusionTransformer and a discriminator, showing improvements in robustness and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving generalization and robustness in 6-DOF robotic grasping approaches, which currently face difficulties in diverse settings.

Method: Developing GraspGen, a model combining a DiffusionTransformer for grasp generation, a scoring discriminator with novel on-generator training, and a dataset of 53 million simulated grasps.

Result: GraspGen surpasses prior models in simulations with various grippers, sets a new benchmark on FetchBench, and performs well on real robots with noisy input.

Conclusion: GraspGen is a robust and scalable approach for generalized robotic grasping in diverse settings, showcasing state-of-the-art performance and practicality.

Abstract: Grasping is a fundamental robot skill, yet despite significant research
advancements, learning-based 6-DOF grasping approaches are still not turnkey
and struggle to generalize across different embodiments and in-the-wild
settings. We build upon the recent success on modeling the object-centric grasp
generation process as an iterative diffusion process. Our proposed framework,
GraspGen, consists of a DiffusionTransformer architecture that enhances grasp
generation, paired with an efficient discriminator to score and filter sampled
grasps. We introduce a novel and performant on-generator training recipe for
the discriminator. To scale GraspGen to both objects and grippers, we release a
new simulated dataset consisting of over 53 million grasps. We demonstrate that
GraspGen outperforms prior methods in simulations with singulated objects
across different grippers, achieves state-of-the-art performance on the
FetchBench grasping benchmark, and performs well on a real robot with noisy
visual observations.

*Suzie Kim,Hye-Bin Shin,Seong-Whan Lee*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework using EEG-based implicit feedback for reinforcement learning, achieving performance comparable to traditional dense rewards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional RL struggles with sparse rewards, and RLHF methods relying on explicit feedback are disruptive and cognitively demanding.

Method: The framework uses EEG signals, specifically error-related potentials (ErrPs), decoded through a pre-trained system to provide feedback for policy learning in a robot simulation task.

Result: Agents trained with EEG feedback matched the performance of agents trained with dense, manually designed rewards.

Conclusion: EEG-based implicit feedback offers a scalable and effective way to integrate human alignment into reinforcement learning systems.

Abstract: Conventional reinforcement learning (RL) ap proaches often struggle to learn
effective policies under sparse reward conditions, necessitating the manual
design of complex, task-specific reward functions. To address this limitation,
rein forcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has emerged as a promising
strategy that complements hand-crafted rewards with human-derived evaluation
signals. However, most existing RLHF methods depend on explicit feedback
mechanisms such as button presses or preference labels, which disrupt the
natural interaction process and impose a substantial cognitive load on the
user. We propose a novel reinforcement learning from implicit human feedback
(RLIHF) framework that utilizes non-invasive electroencephalography (EEG)
signals, specifically error-related potentials (ErrPs), to provide continuous,
implicit feedback without requiring explicit user intervention. The proposed
method adopts a pre-trained decoder to transform raw EEG signals into
probabilistic reward components, en abling effective policy learning even in
the presence of sparse external rewards. We evaluate our approach in a
simulation environment built on the MuJoCo physics engine, using a Kinova Gen2
robotic arm to perform a complex pick-and-place task that requires avoiding
obstacles while manipulating target objects. The results show that agents
trained with decoded EEG feedback achieve performance comparable to those
trained with dense, manually designed rewards. These findings validate the
potential of using implicit neural feedback for scalable and human-aligned
reinforcement learning in interactive robotics.

*Marina Y. Aoyama,Sethu Vijayakumar,Tetsuya Narita*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework for teaching robots tool-use skills using multimodal sensing with few-shot demonstrations, addressing challenges related to complex contact state identification and sim-to-real gaps in robotics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address challenges in teaching robots tool-use skills, which involve complex interactions between robots, tools, and the environment, and are hindered by limited real-world data and sim-to-real gaps.

Method: The proposed method involves pre-training a base policy in simulation to capture common contact states, followed by fine-tuning with few real-world human demonstrations on the target domain, utilizing proximity and tactile sensors for enhanced sensing.

Result: The framework successfully enables surface-following tasks using diverse tools on the Franka Emika robot arm, transferring tool-environment contact recognition skills effectively from pre-training to fine-tuning.

Conclusion: Combining multimodal sensors improves the robot's capability to understand contact states and environmental geometry, allowing effective tool-use skill transfer with minimal real-world training.

Abstract: Tools extend the manipulation abilities of robots, much like they do for
humans. Despite human expertise in tool manipulation, teaching robots these
skills faces challenges. The complexity arises from the interplay of two
simultaneous points of contact: one between the robot and the tool, and another
between the tool and the environment. Tactile and proximity sensors play a
crucial role in identifying these complex contacts. However, learning tool
manipulation using these sensors remains challenging due to limited real-world
data and the large sim-to-real gap. To address this, we propose a few-shot
tool-use skill transfer framework using multimodal sensing. The framework
involves pre-training the base policy to capture contact states common in
tool-use skills in simulation and fine-tuning it with human demonstrations
collected in the real-world target domain to bridge the domain gap. We validate
that this framework enables teaching surface-following tasks using tools with
diverse physical and geometric properties with a small number of demonstrations
on the Franka Emika robot arm. Our analysis suggests that the robot acquires
new tool-use skills by transferring the ability to recognise tool-environment
contact relationships from pre-trained to fine-tuned policies. Additionally,
combining proximity and tactile sensors enhances the identification of contact
states and environmental geometry.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of handling Signal Temporal Logic (STL)-based tasks in autonomous robots while incorporating robot-specific constraints and ensuring feasibility in diverse environments.

Method: The paper proposes a two-phase approach: (i) learning spatio-temporal motion primitives using reinforcement learning, and (ii) developing a sampling-based STL-compliant motion planning strategy using the learned primitives.

Result: The model-free approach was successfully validated on differential-drive and quadruped robots for various STL specifications, demonstrating its robustness and applicability.

Conclusion: This integrated co-design strategy effectively combines trajectory planning and control, enabling autonomous robots to perform STL-based tasks in practical scenarios.

Abstract: This work presents a novel co-design strategy that integrates trajectory
planning and control to handle STL-based tasks in autonomous robots. The method
consists of two phases: $(i)$ learning spatio-temporal motion primitives to
encapsulate the inherent robot-specific constraints and $(ii)$ constructing an
STL-compliant motion plan from these primitives. Initially, we employ
reinforcement learning to construct a library of control policies that perform
trajectories described by the motion primitives. Then, we map motion primitives
to spatio-temporal characteristics. Subsequently, we present a sampling-based
STL-compliant motion planning strategy tailored to meet the STL specification.
The proposed model-free approach, which generates feasible STL-compliant motion
plans across various environments, is validated on differential-drive and
quadruped robots across various STL specifications. Demonstration videos are

TL;DR: This study compares three reinforcement learning algorithms for training a simulated quadruped robot designed for autonomous navigation and obstacle avoidance, proposing the use of robotic guide dogs for visually impaired individuals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many applications for quadrupedal robots in healthcare, such as assisting visually impaired individuals, remain unexplored, prompting the need for research into robotic guide dogs.

Method: The effectiveness of three algorithms—Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), Deep Q-Network (DQN), and Q-learning—was evaluated in custom simulations using metrics like collision frequency, sensor input, and reward progression.

Result: Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) proved superior, outshining DQN and Q-learning across all metrics, especially in steps taken to achieve goals during episodes.

Conclusion: The study advances assistive robotics and healthcare applications by demonstrating PPO’s potential for effective AI-driven mobility in quadrupedal robots.

Abstract: Robots are increasingly integrated across industries, particularly in
healthcare. However, many valuable applications for quadrupedal robots remain
overlooked. This research explores the effectiveness of three reinforcement
learning algorithms in training a simulated quadruped robot for autonomous
navigation and obstacle avoidance. The goal is to develop a robotic guide dog
simulation capable of path following and obstacle avoidance, with long-term
potential for real-world assistance to guide dogs and visually impaired
individuals. It also seeks to expand research into medical 'pets', including
robotic guide and alert dogs.
  A comparative analysis of thirteen related research papers shaped key
evaluation criteria, including collision detection, pathfinding algorithms,
sensor usage, robot type, and simulation platforms. The study focuses on sensor
inputs, collision frequency, reward signals, and learning progression to
determine which algorithm best supports robotic navigation in complex
environments.
  Custom-made environments were used to ensure fair evaluation of all three
algorithms under controlled conditions, allowing consistent data collection.
Results show that Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) outperformed Deep
Q-Network (DQN) and Q-learning across all metrics, particularly in average and
median steps to goal per episode.
  By analysing these results, this study contributes to robotic navigation, AI
and medical robotics, offering insights into the feasibility of AI-driven
quadruped mobility and its role in assistive robotics.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper presents a method to reduce the data needed to train visuomotor robot policies by leveraging existing multi-embodiment datasets and introducing techniques like optic flow and Latent Policy Steering (LPS).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the challenge of minimizing data collection for training visuomotor policies, which traditionally requires extensive, costly demonstrations.

Method: The approach employs optic flow as a shared action representation and trains a World Model (WM) across datasets from various embodiments. The model is fine-tuned with target embodiment data, and a novel Latent Policy Steering (LPS) method improves the behavior-cloned policy's output.

Result: Using datasets from robots and human interactions, the proposed model demonstrated over 50% performance improvement with just 30 demonstrations and over 20% improvement with 50 demonstrations.

Conclusion: The proposed method significantly improves visuomotor policy learning efficiency by reducing the dependency on large-scale, expensive training datasets.

Abstract: Learning visuomotor policies via imitation has proven effective across a wide
range of robotic domains. However, the performance of these policies is heavily
dependent on the number of training demonstrations, which requires expensive
data collection in the real world. In this work, we aim to reduce data
collection efforts when learning visuomotor robot policies by leveraging
existing or cost-effective data from a wide range of embodiments, such as
public robot datasets and the datasets of humans playing with objects (human
data from play). Our approach leverages two key insights. First, we use optic
flow as an embodiment-agnostic action representation to train a World Model
(WM) across multi-embodiment datasets, and finetune it on a small amount of
robot data from the target embodiment. Second, we develop a method, Latent
Policy Steering (LPS), to improve the output of a behavior-cloned policy by
searching in the latent space of the WM for better action sequences. In real
world experiments, we observe significant improvements in the performance of
policies trained with a small amount of data (over 50% relative improvement
with 30 demonstrations and over 20% relative improvement with 50
demonstrations) by combining the policy with a WM pretrained on two thousand
episodes sampled from the existing Open X-embodiment dataset across different
robots or a cost-effective human dataset from play.

Motivation: The study aims to address the lack of interoperability and cumbersome manual transformations required to port quantum programs between various QSDKs.

Method: The proposed approach leverages the pretrained knowledge and reasoning abilities of LLMs to automate the transpilation process between different QSDKs.

Result: The study demonstrates the potential of LLMs to offer programming language-agnostic and scalable solutions for quantum program translations.

Conclusion: LLMs can serve as intelligent tools for general-purpose quantum software portability, eliminating the need for predefined transformation rules.

Abstract: There exist various Software Development Kits (SDKs) tailored to different
quantum computing platforms. These are known as Quantum SDKs (QSDKs). Examples
include but are not limited to Qiskit, Cirq, and PennyLane. However, this
diversity presents significant challenges for interoperability and
cross-platform development of hybrid quantum-classical software systems.
Traditional rule-based transpilers for translating code between QSDKs are
time-consuming to design and maintain, requiring deep expertise and rigid
mappings in the source and destination code. In this study, we explore the use
of Large Language Models (LLMs) as a flexible and automated solution.
Leveraging their pretrained knowledge and contextual reasoning capabilities, we
position LLMs as programming language-agnostic transpilers capable of
converting quantum programs from one QSDK to another while preserving
functional equivalence. Our approach eliminates the need for manually defined
transformation rules and offers a scalable solution to quantum software
portability. This work represents a step toward enabling intelligent,
general-purpose transpilation in the quantum computing ecosystem.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs struggle with limited context at inference and lack of explicit reasoning over large codebases. This hinders comprehensive code understanding and debugging.

Method: Kodezi Chronos combines multi-level embedding memory engines (vector and graph-based indexing) with continuous code-aware retrieval, enabling reasoning over extensive codebases and supporting repository-scale tasks.

Result: Chronos shows a 23% improvement in bug detection and reduces debugging cycles by 40% relative to traditional models. It excels in realistic software engineering challenges.

Conclusion: Kodezi Chronos significantly enhances code reliability and productivity by integrating into IDEs and workflows, enabling autonomous, real-time software maintenance with minimized manual intervention.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have advanced code generation and software
automation, but are fundamentally constrained by limited inference-time context
and lack of explicit code structure reasoning. We introduce Kodezi Chronos, a
next-generation architecture for autonomous code understanding, debugging, and
maintenance, designed to operate across ultra-long contexts comprising entire
codebases, histories, and documentation, all without fixed window limits.
Kodezi Chronos leverages a multi-level embedding memory engine, combining
vector and graph-based indexing with continuous code-aware retrieval. This
enables efficient and accurate reasoning over millions of lines of code,
supporting repository-scale comprehension, multi-file refactoring, and
real-time self-healing actions. Our evaluation introduces a novel Multi Random
Retrieval benchmark, specifically tailored to the software engineering domain.
Unlike classical retrieval benchmarks, this method requires the model to
resolve arbitrarily distant and obfuscated associations across code artifacts,
simulating realistic tasks such as variable tracing, dependency migration, and
semantic bug localization. Chronos outperforms prior LLMs and code models,
demonstrating a 23% improvement in real-world bug detection and reducing
debugging cycles by up to 40% compared to traditional sequence-based
approaches. By natively interfacing with IDEs and CI/CD workflows, Chronos
enables seamless, autonomous software maintenance, elevating code reliability
and productivity while reducing manual effort. These results mark a critical
advance toward self-sustaining, continuously optimized software ecosystems.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: RAGSum combines code retrieval and comment generation tasks into a unified framework using CodeT5, optimizing both retrieval relevance and comment quality while outperforming baselines across multiple programming languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to improve automated generation of informative comments for source code by addressing inefficiencies in existing retrieval-augmented approaches, where retrieval and generation are optimized separately.

Method: A unified framework called RAGSum enhances CodeT5-based code embeddings with contrastive pre-training for retrieval and utilizes end-to-end training with composite loss functions to optimize retrieval and comment generation. Additionally, a self-refinement loop improves the final output quality.

Result: On cross-language benchmarks (Java, Python, C), RAGSum significantly outperforms three baselines in BLEU, METEOR, and ROUTE-L metrics, demonstrating better retrieval and comment synthesis capabilities.

Conclusion: Coupling retrieval and generation in a unified framework can drastically elevate the accuracy of automated comment generation for code, suggesting potential for broader adoption in developer tools and further research.

Abstract: Automatically generating concise, informative comments for source code can
lighten documentation effort and accelerate program comprehension.
Retrieval-augmented approaches first fetch code snippets with existing comments
and then synthesize a new comment, yet retrieval and generation are typically
optimized in isolation, allowing irrelevant neighbors topropagate noise
downstream. To tackle the issue, we propose a novel approach named RAGSum with
the aim of both effectiveness and efficiency in recommendations. RAGSum is
built on top offuse retrieval and generation using a single CodeT5 backbone. We
report preliminary results on a unified retrieval-generation framework built on
CodeT5. A contrastive pre-training phase shapes code embeddings for
nearest-neighbor search; these weights then seed end-to-end training with a
composite loss that (i) rewards accurate top-k retrieval; and (ii) minimizes
comment-generation error. More importantly, a lightweight self-refinement loop
is deployed to polish the final output. We evaluated theframework on three
cross-language benchmarks (Java, Python, C), and compared it with three
well-established baselines. The results show that our approach substantially
outperforms thebaselines with respect to BLEU, METEOR, and ROUTE-L. These
findings indicate that tightly coupling retrieval and generationcan raise the
ceiling for comment automation and motivateforthcoming replications and
qualitative developer studies.

*Samal Nursapa,Anastassiya Samuilova,Alessio Bucaioni. Phuong T. Nguyen*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper uses transformer models to suggest refactorings for architectural smells, achieving high accuracy and releasing code for future use.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Architectural smells degrade software quality, and there is a gap in offering actionable fixes for detected smells.

Method: Fine-tuning transformer models CodeBERT and CodeT5 on 2 million refactoring instances from Java projects to classify suitable refactorings.

Result: CodeT5 achieves 96.9% accuracy and 95.2% F1, outperforming CodeBERT and traditional methods.

Conclusion: Transformer models effectively recommend refactorings for software smells, advancing tools in smell repair with open resources for further exploration.

Abstract: Architectural smells such as God Class, Cyclic Dependency, and Hub-like
Dependency degrade software quality and maintainability. Existing tools detect
such smells but rarely suggest how to fix them. This paper explores the use of
pre-trained transformer models--CodeBERT and CodeT5--for recommending suitable
refactorings based on detected smells. We frame the task as a three-class
classification problem and fine-tune both models on over 2 million refactoring
instances mined from 11,149 open-source Java projects. CodeT5 achieves 96.9%
accuracy and 95.2% F1, outperforming CodeBERT and traditional baselines. Our
results show that transformer-based models can effectively bridge the gap
between smell detection and actionable repair, laying the foundation for future
refactoring recommendation systems. We release all code, models, and data under
an open license to support reproducibility and further research.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper fine-tuned a 32B model for generating error-resilient Qiskit code using RL methods, achieving superior performance on benchmarks compared to baselines, though challenges remain on advanced tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantum circuits require accurate code generation due to error sensitivity, and existing language models output flawed Qiskit code, driving the need for improvement.

Method: The paper fine-tuned a 32B model using RL methods, Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and Odds-Ratio Preference Optimization (ORPO), with annotated synthetic datasets.

Result: On the Qiskit HumanEval benchmark, ORPO achieved 56.29% and GRPO scored 49%, outperforming general-purpose models. ORPO excelled at intermediate tasks, GRPO at basic tasks, while neither solved advanced tasks.

Conclusion: The study demonstrated significant advancements in AI-assisted quantum programming but emphasized the continued challenges in solving complex tasks.

Abstract: Quantum circuits must be error-resilient, yet LLMs like Granite-20B-Code and
StarCoder often output flawed Qiskit code. We fine-tuned a 32 B model with two
RL methods, Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and Odds-Ratio Preference
Optimization (ORPO), using a richly annotated synthetic dataset. On the Qiskit
HumanEval benchmark, ORPO reaches 56.29\% Pass@1 ($\approx+10$ pp over
Granite-8B-QK) and GRPO hits 49\%, both beating all general-purpose baselines;
on the original HumanEval they score 65.90\% and 63.00\%. GRPO excels on basic
tasks (42/54), ORPO on intermediate ones (41/68), and neither solves the five
advanced tasks, highlighting clear gains yet room for progress in AI-assisted
quantum programming.

### [254] [A Three-Phase Evaluation Approach for new Information and Data Models in the Smart Grid Domain](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12649)
*Christine van Stiphoudt,Sergio Potenciano Menci,Gilbert Fridgen*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces a three-phase evaluation approach to assess newly developed information and data models for smart grids, combining explicit and implicit methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise in digitalisation of smart grids necessitates reliable evaluation methods for new information and data models to avoid disruptions and ensure their functionality.

Method: A three-phase evaluation approach combining explicit and implicit methods, refined through the development of information and data models focused on industrial flexibility descriptions.

Result: The study presents a robust evaluation framework with practical insights and lessons learned from applying it to specific models.

Conclusion: The three-phase evaluation approach successfully bridges the gap between explicit and implicit methods, offering clear guidelines for assessing new models in the smart grid domain.

Abstract: The ongoing digitalisation of the smart grid is resulting in an increase in
automated information exchanges across distributed energy systems. This process
has led to the development of new information and data models when the existing
ones fall short. To prevent potential disruptions caused by flaws in the newly
designed information and data models, it is essential to evaluate them during
the design process before they are implemented in operation.
  Currently, general explicit evaluation approaches outside the smart grid
domain stay at a high level without defining clear steps. Meanwhile, implicit
evaluation approaches in the smart grid domain focus on testing systems that
utilise information and data models already in use for functionality in terms
of conformance and interoperability. Notably, no combination of explicit and
implicit evaluation approaches for newly designed information and data models
offers a clearly defined set of steps during their design process in the smart
grid context.
  Consequently, we design a three-phase evaluation approach using design
science research to address this gap. Our evaluation approach combines explicit
and implicit evaluation methods and is applicable when developing new
information and data models. We use the development of an information model and
data model focused on industrial flexibility descriptions to refine our
evaluation approach. Additionally, we provide lessons learned from our
experience.

*João Granja-Correia,Remedios Hernández-Linares,Luca Ferranti,Arménio Rego*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper proposes using fuzzy logic to better evaluate project success, focusing on sustained impact for end-users.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods, like Likert scales, fail to capture the complex, context-driven aspects of project success.

Method: The paper introduces a hierarchical Type-1 Mamdani fuzzy system to evaluate project outcomes, prioritizing end-user impact.

Result: The approach shifts focus from stakeholder satisfaction to sustained positive outcomes for end-users.

Conclusion: Integrating fuzzy logic provides a more nuanced measure of project success, with potential adaptability for broader, complex evaluations.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach to project success evaluation by
integrating fuzzy logic into an existing construct. Traditional Likert-scale
measures often overlook the context-dependent and multifaceted nature of
project success. The proposed hierarchical Type-1 Mamdani fuzzy system
prioritizes sustained positive impact for end-users, reducing emphasis on
secondary outcomes like stakeholder satisfaction and internal project success.
This dynamic approach may provide a more accurate measure of project success
and could be adaptable to complex evaluations. Future research will focus on
empirical testing and broader applications of fuzzy logic in social science.

TL;DR: The paper proposes the Single Conversation Methodology (SCM), a structured method for using large language models (LLMs) to guide software development in a single long-context dialogue.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the current ad hoc and passive reliance on LLMs in software development, seeking to reestablish the developer's active role.

Method: SCM is defined by structured, persistent dialogues for a project's lifecycle, emphasizing cognitive clarity, traceability, modularity, and documentation.

Result: The proposed methodology offers a framework that corrects current practices of passive interaction with LLMs, ensuring developer centrality.

Conclusion: The study argues that SCM enhances software development by combining structured LLM interaction with active developer involvement, improving clarity and accountability.

Abstract: We propose the Single Conversation Methodology (SCM), a novel and pragmatic
approach to software development using large language models (LLMs). In
contrast to ad hoc interactions with generative AI, SCM emphasizes a structured
and persistent development dialogue, where all stages of a project - from
requirements to architecture and implementation - unfold within a single,
long-context conversation. The methodology is grounded on principles of
cognitive clarity, traceability, modularity, and documentation. We define its
phases, best practices, and philosophical stance, while arguing that SCM offers
a necessary correction to the passive reliance on LLMs prevalent in current
practices. We aim to reassert the active role of the developer as architect and
supervisor of the intelligent tool.

*Keila Lucas,Rohit Gheyi,Márcio Ribeiro,Fabio Palomba,Luana Martins,Elvys Soares*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The study explores using Small Language Models (SLMs) to detect and explain test smells in manual test cases, achieving high accuracy without extensive rule definitions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual testing is vital but often plagued by quality issues like ambiguity and redundancy in test cases, which detection tools struggle to address due to scalability and dependency on manual rules.

Method: Evaluated three SLMs (Gemma3, Llama3.2, and Phi-4) on real-world Ubuntu test cases involving seven test smell types, analyzing their detection accuracy and ability to autonomously generate explanations and improvement suggestions.

Result: Phi-4 performed the best with 97% accuracy in identifying test smells, while Gemma3 and Llama3.2 achieved about 91%. The SLMs effectively suggested fixes without explicit programming or prompts.

Conclusion: SLMs are promising for scalable, private, and efficient detection of test smells, improving the quality of manual test cases and reducing reliance on manual rule-based tools.

Abstract: Manual testing, in which testers follow natural language instructions to
validate system behavior, remains crucial for uncovering issues not easily
captured by automation. However, these test cases often suffer from test
smells, quality issues such as ambiguity, redundancy, or missing checks that
reduce test reliability and maintainability. While detection tools exist, they
typically require manual rule definition and lack scalability. This study
investigates the potential of Small Language Models (SLMs) for automatically
detecting test smells. We evaluate Gemma3, Llama3.2, and Phi-4 on 143
real-world Ubuntu test cases, covering seven types of test smells. Phi-4
achieved the best results, reaching a pass@2 of 97% in detecting sentences with
test smells, while Gemma3 and Llama3.2 reached approximately 91%. Beyond
detection, SLMs autonomously explained issues and suggested improvements, even
without explicit prompt instructions. They enabled low-cost, concept-driven
identification of diverse test smells without relying on extensive rule
definitions or syntactic analysis. These findings highlight the potential of
SLMs as efficient tools that preserve data privacy and can improve test quality
in real-world scenarios.

*Dongming Jin,Weisong Sun,Jiangping Huang,Peng Liang,Jifeng Xuan,Yang Liu,Zhi Jin*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces iReDev, a knowledge-driven multi-agent framework for intelligent requirements development, enabling efficient human-agent collaboration and outperforming existing baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve efficiency and collaboration in requirements development, which is currently time-consuming, labor-intensive, and inadequately addressed by existing frameworks.

Method: iReDev utilizes six knowledge-driven agents equipped with human knowledge simulation, event-driven communication mechanisms, and human-in-the-loop collaboration to perform requirements development tasks.

Result: iReDev consistently outperformed existing baselines in generating software requirements specifications across multiple aspects.

Conclusion: The work highlights the importance of knowledge-driven multi-agent systems and human-agent collaboration in enhancing requirements development and proposes future research directions.

Abstract: Requirements development is a critical phase as it is responsible for
providing a clear understanding of what stakeholders need. It involves
collaboration among stakeholders to extract explicit requirements and address
potential conflicts, which is time-consuming and labor-intensive. Recently,
multi-agent systems for software development have attracted much attention.
However, existing research provides limited support for requirements
development and overlooks the injection of human knowledge into agents and the
human-agent collaboration. % To address these issues, this paper proposes a
knowledge-driven multi-agent framework for intelligent requirement development,
named iReDev. iReDev features: iReDev consists of six knowledge-driven agents
to support the entire requirements development. They collaboratively perform
various tasks to produce a software requirements specification. iReDev focuses
on integrating human knowledge for agents, enabling them to simulate real-world
stakeholders. iReDev uses an event-driven communication mechanism based on an
artifact pool. Agents continuously monitor the pool and autonomously trigger
the next action based on its changes, enabling iReDev to handle new
requirements quickly. iReDev introduces a human-in-the-loop mechanism to
support human-agent collaboration, ensuring that the generated artifacts align
with the expectations of stakeholders. We evaluated the generated artifacts and
results show that iReDev outperforms existing baselines in multiple aspects. We
further envision three key directions and hope this work can facilitate the
development of intelligent requirements development.

*Dongming Jin,Zhi Jin,Linyu Li,Xiaohong Chen*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper highlights the challenges pretrained models pose to traditional requirements engineering and proposes a tailored conceptual framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional software requirements engineering methods face limitations when applied to systems powered by pretrained models due to unpredictable and evolving behaviors.

Method: The authors present a conceptual framework and suggest research directions to address these challenges specific to pretrained model-enabled systems.

Result: The paper identifies gaps in requirements engineering methodologies for systems incorporating pretrained models and provides actionable insights.

Conclusion: Rethinking requirements engineering processes is essential to accommodate the unique characteristics of systems leveraging pretrained models.

Abstract: Recent advances in large pretrained models have led to their widespread
integration as core components in modern software systems. The trend is
expected to continue in the foreseeable future. Unlike traditional software
systems governed by deterministic logic, systems powered by pretrained models
exhibit distinctive and emergent characteristics, such as ambiguous capability
boundaries, context-dependent behavior, and continuous evolution. These
properties fundamentally challenge long-standing assumptions in requirements
engineering, including functional decomposability and behavioral
predictability. This paper investigates this problem and advocates for a
rethinking of existing requirements engineering methodologies. We propose a
conceptual framework tailored to requirements engineering of
pretrained-model-enabled software systems and outline several promising
research directions within this framework. This vision helps provide a guide
for researchers and practitioners to tackle the emerging challenges in
requirements engineering of pretrained-model-enabled systems.

*Andreas Pointner,Josef Pichler,Herbert Prähofer*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to infer semantic specifications of input handling from parser implementations, generating comprehensive attributed grammars.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Software systems often lack complete specifications for input processing, particularly input semantics, creating a need for better recovery methods.

Method: The approach dynamically analyzes recursive descent parsers during runtime, extracting semantic actions and embedding them into grammar rules to construct attributed grammars.

Result: Experimental evaluation on a set of programs shows that the method accurately reconstructs input processing semantics and reproduces program behavior using the inferred grammars.

Conclusion: The technique provides a robust solution for recovering both syntax and semantics of input handling, empowering full specification recovery for software systems.

Abstract: Software systems that process structured inputs often lack complete and
up-to-date specifications, which specify the input syntax and the semantics of
input processing. While grammar mining techniques have focused on recovering
syntactic structures, the semantics of input processing remains largely
unexplored. In this work, we introduce a novel approach for inferring
attributed grammars from parser implementations. Given an input grammar, our
technique dynamically analyzes the implementation of recursive descent parsers
to reconstruct the semantic aspects of input handling, resulting in
specifications in the form of attributed grammars. By observing program
executions and mapping the program's runtime behavior to the grammar, we
systematically extract and embed semantic actions into the grammar rules. This
enables comprehensive specification recovery. We demonstrate the feasibility of
our approach using an initial set of programs, showing that it can accurately
reproduce program behavior through the generated attributed grammars.

*Xin Yin,Xinrui Li,Chao Ni,Xiaodan Xu,Xiaohu Yang*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces CodeGPTSensor+, an upgraded model using adversarial training to enhance the detection of LLM-generated code, even after modifications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The proliferation of LLM-generated code raises concerns about provenance, copyright disputes, and code quality. Current detection methods struggle with robustness when handling manually modified code.

Method: CodeGPTSensor+ employs adversarial training and integrates a module (MIST) to systematically generate high-quality adversarial samples for robust detection.

Result: Experiments on the HMCorp dataset demonstrate improved detection accuracy of CodeGPTSensor+ on adversarially perturbed code while maintaining high accuracy on unmodified code.

Conclusion: CodeGPTSensor+ improves robustness in detecting LLM-generated code, addressing key challenges in handling modifications, and showing significant advancements over its predecessor.

Abstract: With the rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs), their powerful
code-generation capabilities have been widely applied in tasks like code
completion and automated development, demonstrating the value of improving
coding efficiency. However, the extensive use of LLM-generated code also raises
several new challenges. On the one hand, issues such as the regulation of code
provenance, copyright disputes, and code quality have become increasingly
concerning. How to effectively detect LLM-generated code and ensure its
compliant and responsible use has become a critical and urgent issue. On the
other hand, in practical applications, LLM-generated code is often subject to
manual modifications, such as variable renaming or structural adjustments.
Although some recent studies have proposed training-based and zero-shot methods
for detecting LLM-generated code, these approaches show insufficient robustness
when facing modified LLM-generated code, and there is a lack of an effective
solution. To address the real-world scenario where LLM-generated code may
undergo minor modifications, we propose CodeGPTSensor+, an enhanced version of
CodeGPTSensor, which employs adversarial training to improve robustness against
input perturbations. CodeGPTSensor+ integrates an adversarial sample generation
module, Multi-objective Identifier and Structure Transformation (MIST), which
systematically generates both high-quality and representative adversarial
samples. This module effectively enhances the model's resistance against
diverse adversarial attacks. Experimental results on the HMCorp dataset
demonstrate that CodeGPTSensor+ significantly improves detection accuracy on
the adversarial test set while maintaining high accuracy on the original test
set, showcasing superior robustness compared to CodeGPTSensor.

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: This review explores a brain-inspired AI architecture rooted in the minicolumn hypothesis, emphasizing repeated neural modules for robustness, adaptability, and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the gap in understanding and connecting brain-inspired architectures, specifically cortical columns, to modern AI neural module designs.

Method: The authors synthesize historical, theoretical, and methodological perspectives, distinguishing between architectural and parameter-shared module repetition, while highlighting collective intelligence (CI) attributes.

Result: The study suggests that repeated modules converge into simple, flexible generalist units, offering improved training efficiency, scalability, and robust generalization to out-of-distribution problems.

Conclusion: Brain-inspired architectures featuring module repetition present untapped potential for addressing modern AI challenges, such as scalability, energy efficiency, and robustness, while emulating principles of CI.

Abstract: While modern AI continues to advance, the biological brain remains the
pinnacle of neural networks in its robustness, adaptability, and efficiency.
This review explores an AI architectural path inspired by the brain's
structure, particularly the minicolumn hypothesis, which views the neocortex as
a distributed system of repeated modules - a structure we connect to collective
intelligence (CI). Despite existing work, there is a lack of comprehensive
reviews connecting the cortical column to the architectures of repeated neural
modules. This review aims to fill that gap by synthesizing historical,
theoretical, and methodological perspectives on neural module repetition. We
distinguish between architectural repetition - reusing structure - and
parameter-shared module repetition, where the same functional unit is repeated
across a network. The latter exhibits key CI properties such as robustness,
adaptability, and generalization. Evidence suggests that the repeated module
tends to converge toward a generalist module: simple, flexible problem solvers
capable of handling many roles in the ensemble. This generalist tendency may
offer solutions to longstanding challenges in modern AI: improved energy
efficiency during training through simplicity and scalability, and robust
embodied control via generalization. While empirical results suggest such
systems can generalize to out-of-distribution problems, theoretical results are
still lacking. Overall, architectures featuring module repetition remain an
emerging and unexplored architectural strategy, with significant untapped
potential for both efficiency, robustness, and adaptiveness. We believe that a
system that adopts the benefits of CI, while adhering to architectural and
functional principles of the minicolumns, could challenge the modern AI
problems of scalability, energy consumption, and democratization.

Motivation: Investigate the theoretical and applied validity of SOMs for modeling cognitive aspects of neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism and schizophrenia.

Method: Introduce a biologically plausible modified SOM incorporating oscillating topological neighborhood features, apply it alongside standard SOMs, and conduct simulations using revised IPSOM models.

Result: Both standard and modified SOMs show similar map formation, output, and structure, but the oscillating variant provides a more realistic computational representation of brain function.

Conclusion: The oscillating-TN SOM offers validated neuroscientific and computational benefits within cognitive modeling frameworks, improving biological plausibility in simulations.

Abstract: Background/Introduction: In this paper, the neural network class of
Self-Organising Maps (SOMs) is investigated in terms of its theoretical and
applied validity for cognitive modelling, particularly of neurodevelopmental
disorders.
  Methods: A modified SOM network type, with increased biological plausibility,
incorporating a type of cortical columnar oscillation in the form of an
oscillating Topological Neighbourhood (TN), is introduced and applied alongside
the standard SOM. Aspects of two neurodevelopmental disorders, autism and
schizophrenia, are modelled using SOM networks, based on existing
neurocomputational theories. Both standard and oscillating-TN SOM training is
employed with targeted modifications in the TN width function. Computer
simulations are conducted using revised versions of a previously introduced
model (IPSOM) based on a new modelling hypothesis.
  Results/Conclusions: The results demonstrate that there is strong similarity
between standard and oscillating-TN SOM modelling in terms of map formation
behaviour, output and structure, while the oscillating version offers a more
realistic computational analogue of brain function. Neuroscientific and
computational arguments are presented to validate the proposed SOM modification
within a cognitive modelling framework.

*David Freire-Obregón,Agnieszka Dubiel,Prasoon Kumar Vinodkumar,Gholamreza Anbarjafari,Dorota Kamińska,Modesto Castrillón-Santana*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: This paper proposes a post-hoc interpretability framework for dual-stream EEG classifiers using an adapted LIME approach to analyze hemispheric contributions in emotion recognition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Emotion recognition using EEG signals holds potential in fields like affective computing, but the lack of interpretability in models poses challenges for their usability in sensitive applications.

Method: The authors adapted the Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) framework to handle structured, bi-hemispheric EEG inputs, using it on a dual-branch recurrent neural network trained on EEG data from an emotion elicitation task.

Result: The framework successfully identified emotion-specific hemispheric activation patterns, consistent with known neurophysiological phenomena, and provided global channel importance profiles to interpret the model's decisions.

Conclusion: The proposed interpretability approach enhances the understanding of dual-stream EEG classifiers' functionality and aligns its insights with neurophysiological concepts, offering valuable interpretability for emotion recognition applications.

Abstract: Recent advances have shown promise in emotion recognition from
electroencephalogram (EEG) signals by employing bi-hemispheric neural
architectures that incorporate neuroscientific priors into deep learning
models. However, interpretability remains a significant limitation for their
application in sensitive fields such as affective computing and cognitive
modeling. In this work, we introduce a post-hoc interpretability framework
tailored to dual-stream EEG classifiers, extending the Local Interpretable
Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) approach to accommodate structured,
bi-hemispheric inputs. Our method adapts LIME to handle structured two-branch
inputs corresponding to left and right-hemisphere EEG channel groups. It
decomposes prediction relevance into per-channel contributions across
hemispheres and emotional classes. We apply this framework to a previously
validated dual-branch recurrent neural network trained on EmoNeuroDB, a dataset
of EEG recordings captured during a VR-based emotion elicitation task. The
resulting explanations reveal emotion-specific hemispheric activation patterns
consistent with known neurophysiological phenomena, such as frontal
lateralization in joy and posterior asymmetry in sadness. Furthermore, we
aggregate local explanations across samples to derive global channel importance
profiles, enabling a neurophysiologically grounded interpretation of the
model's decisions. Correlation analysis between symmetric electrodes further
highlights the model's emotion-dependent lateralization behavior, supporting
the functional asymmetries reported in affective neuroscience.

*Yuki Tomoda,Ichiro Tsuda,Yutaka Yamaguti*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: The study presents a new method to induce functional differentiation in artificial neural networks, showing that functional specialization occurs before structural modularity and may drive it.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how functional specialization and modular structures emerge in neural systems to better comprehend brain operations and develop improved artificial neural networks.

Method: The use of recurrent neural networks combined with mutual information neural estimation to minimize mutual information among neural subgroups, applied to tasks like 2-bit working memory and chaotic signal separation.

Result: Observed high task performance with clear functional modularity and moderate structural modularity, with functional differentiation preceding structural modularity.

Conclusion: Functional specialization in neural networks emerges earlier than structural modularity, suggesting it may drive structural reorganization, and revealing insights into brain development principles.

Abstract: Functional differentiation in the brain emerges as distinct regions
specialize and is key to understanding brain function as a complex system.
Previous research has modeled this process using artificial neural networks
with specific constraints. Here, we propose a novel approach that induces
functional differentiation in recurrent neural networks by minimizing mutual
information between neural subgroups via mutual information neural estimation.
We apply our method to a 2-bit working memory task and a chaotic signal
separation task involving Lorenz and R\"ossler time series. Analysis of network
performance, correlation patterns, and weight matrices reveals that mutual
information minimization yields high task performance alongside clear
functional modularity and moderate structural modularity. Importantly, our
results show that functional differentiation, which is measured through
correlation structures, emerges earlier than structural modularity defined by
synaptic weights. This suggests that functional specialization precedes and
probably drives structural reorganization within developing neural networks.
Our findings provide new insights into how information-theoretic principles may
govern the emergence of specialized functions and modular structures during
artificial and biological brain development.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: Accurate state estimation depends on understanding uncertainty in models, with errors in covariance matrices impacting accuracy. A new learning-based method with various loss functions is proposed for identifying noise characteristics in real-time vehicle state estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The problem lies in the challenging task of identifying noise characteristics, which are crucial for accurate state estimation but difficult to model systematically.

Method: The authors use a learning-based methodology coupled with different loss functions to estimate noise characteristics.

Result: The methodology's performance is tested in real-time for vehicle state estimation, highlighting its applicability.

Conclusion: The proposed approach demonstrates a novel pathway to improve noise identification, contributing to more robust state estimation in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Accurate state estimation requires careful consideration of uncertainty
surrounding the process and measurement models; these characteristics are
usually not well-known and need an experienced designer to select the
covariance matrices. An error in the selection of covariance matrices could
impact the accuracy of the estimation algorithm and may sometimes cause the
filter to diverge. Identifying noise characteristics has long been a
challenging problem due to uncertainty surrounding noise sources and
difficulties in systematic noise modeling. Most existing approaches try
identifying unknown covariance matrices through an optimization algorithm
involving innovation sequences. In recent years, learning approaches have been
utilized to determine the stochastic characteristics of process and measurement
models. We present a learning-based methodology with different loss functions
to identify noise characteristics and test these approaches' performance for
real-time vehicle state estimation

TL;DR: The paper investigates the finite-dimensional distributions (FDDs) of deep neural networks with randomly initialized weights, establishing Gaussian approximation bounds under certain conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to understand the behavior of deep neural networks with random weights using statistical tools like Gaussian approximations, providing insights into theoretical properties.

Method: The study uses Wasserstein-$1$ norm measurements and analysis of convergence rates while varying layer widths and applying Lipschitz activation functions.

Result: Gaussian approximation holds with convergence rates depending on network configurations, specifically scaling proportional layer widths and hidden layers.

Conclusion: The findings highlight that deep neural network FDDs converge to Gaussian limits under specific mathematical conditions, offering theoretical benchmarks for network design.

Abstract: We study the Finite-Dimensional Distributions (FDDs) of deep neural networks
with randomly initialized weights that have finite-order moments. Specifically,
we establish Gaussian approximation bounds in the Wasserstein-$1$ norm between
the FDDs and their Gaussian limit assuming a Lipschitz activation function and
allowing the layer widths to grow to infinity at arbitrary relative rates. In
the special case where all widths are proportional to a common scale parameter
$n$ and there are $L-1$ hidden layers, we obtain convergence rates of order
$n^{-({1}/{6})^{L-1} + \epsilon}$, for any $\epsilon > 0$.

### [268] [Self Balancing Neural Network: A Novel Method to Estimate Average Treatment Effect](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12818)
*Atomsa Gemechu Abdisa,Yingchun Zhou,Yuqi Qiu*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new method called the Self-balancing Neural Network (Sbnet), which estimates the average treatment effect (ATE) in one step by addressing issues related to confounding variables and misspecified propensity scores.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In observational studies, biases in estimating the average treatment effect (ATE) arise due to confounding variables and instrumental variables, making traditional methods suspect to errors, especially with misspecified propensity score models.

Method: The study proposes the Self-balancing Neural Network (Sbnet), which integrates a balancing net within a feedforward neural network to estimate pseudo propensity scores and calculate the ATE in a single step. It also introduces a multi-pseudo propensity score framework for robustness.

Result: The proposed Sbnet outperforms state-of-the-art methods in estimating the average treatment effect as demonstrated on three simulation setups and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: The Self-balancing Neural Network (Sbnet) is an effective and superior solution for addressing issues in ATE estimation, reducing bias and handling propensity score misspecification better than existing methods.

Abstract: In observational studies, confounding variables affect both treatment and
outcome. Moreover, instrumental variables also influence the treatment
assignment mechanism. This situation sets the study apart from a standard
randomized controlled trial, where the treatment assignment is random. Due to
this situation, the estimated average treatment effect becomes biased. To
address this issue, a standard approach is to incorporate the estimated
propensity score when estimating the average treatment effect. However, these
methods incur the risk of misspecification in propensity score models. To solve
this issue, a novel method called the "Self balancing neural network" (Sbnet),
which lets the model itself obtain its pseudo propensity score from the
balancing net, is proposed in this study. The proposed method estimates the
average treatment effect by using the balancing net as a key part of the
feedforward neural network. This formulation resolves the estimation of the
average treatment effect in one step. Moreover, the multi-pseudo propensity
score framework, which is estimated from the diversified balancing net and used
for the estimation of the average treatment effect, is presented. Finally, the
proposed methods are compared with state-of-the-art methods on three simulation
setups and real-world datasets. It has been shown that the proposed
self-balancing neural network shows better performance than state-of-the-art
methods.

*Yaniv Shulman*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Bayesian framework for identifying Linear Time-Variant (LTV) systems, using modern machine learning techniques to robustly infer system properties and model uncertainty.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenging problem of identifying Linear Time-Variant (LTV) systems from limited and noisy input-output data while quantifying uncertainty in the process.

Method: The authors model the system’s impulse response as a stochastic process, decompose it into a posterior mean and random fluctuation term, and use techniques like Bayesian neural networks and Gaussian Processes with scalable variational inference.

Result: The framework outperforms classical methods in data efficiency, successfully tracks varying LTV impulse responses, and robustly infers LTI system properties from noisy observations.

Conclusion: This Bayesian framework offers a flexible and effective methodology for system identification in dynamic, uncertain environments, introducing the new Linear Time-Invariant in Expectation (LTIE) system class.

Abstract: The identification of Linear Time-Variant (LTV) systems from input-output
data is a fundamental yet challenging ill-posed inverse problem. This work
introduces a unified Bayesian framework that models the system's impulse
response, $h(t, \tau)$, as a stochastic process. We decompose the response into
a posterior mean and a random fluctuation term, a formulation that provides a
principled approach for quantifying uncertainty and naturally defines a new,
useful system class we term Linear Time-Invariant in Expectation (LTIE). To
perform inference, we leverage modern machine learning techniques, including
Bayesian neural networks and Gaussian Processes, using scalable variational
inference. We demonstrate through a series of experiments that our framework
can robustly infer the properties of an LTI system from a single noisy
observation, show superior data efficiency compared to classical methods in a
simulated ambient noise tomography problem, and successfully track a
continuously varying LTV impulse response by using a structured Gaussian
Process prior. This work provides a flexible and robust methodology for
uncertainty-aware system identification in dynamic environments.

### [270] [When Pattern-by-Pattern Works: Theoretical and Empirical Insights for Logistic Models with Missing Values](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13024)
*Christophe Muller,Erwan Scornet,Julie Josse*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper tackles the challenge of predicting with partially missing inputs using logistic regression models. It introduces a Pattern-by-Pattern (PbP) strategy and compares methods for handling missing data across various scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need to address the difficulty of making predictions with partially missing inputs, specifically for logistic models in different missing data scenarios.

Method: The authors theoretically analyze the PbP strategy for logistic regression and empirically compare methods like imputations (constant and iterative), PbP, complete case analysis, and an EM algorithm.

Result: The study shows that mean imputation works well as a baseline for small sample sizes, while PbP and MICE.RF.Y deliver the best results for large samples and nonlinear features, respectively.

Conclusion: PbP is the optimal choice for Gaussian mixtures in large samples, while MICE.RF.Y is recommended when dealing with nonlinear features in missing data scenarios within logistic models.

Abstract: Predicting a response with partially missing inputs remains a challenging
task even in parametric models, since parameter estimation in itself is not
sufficient to predict on partially observed inputs. Several works study
prediction in linear models. In this paper, we focus on logistic models, which
present their own difficulties. From a theoretical perspective, we prove that a
Pattern-by-Pattern strategy (PbP), which learns one logistic model per
missingness pattern, accurately approximates Bayes probabilities in various
missing data scenarios (MCAR, MAR and MNAR). Empirically, we thoroughly compare
various methods (constant and iterative imputations, complete case analysis,
PbP, and an EM algorithm) across classification, probability estimation,
calibration, and parameter inference. Our analysis provides a comprehensive
view on the logistic regression with missing values. It reveals that mean
imputation can be used as baseline for low sample sizes, and improved
performance is obtained via nonlinear multiple iterative imputation techniques
with the labels (MICE.RF.Y). For large sample sizes, PbP is the best method for
Gaussian mixtures, and we recommend MICE.RF.Y in presence of nonlinear
features.

### [271] [Relation-Aware Slicing in Cross-Domain Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13194)
*Dhruv Sarkar,Aprameyo Chakrabartty,Anish Chakrabarty,Swagatam Das*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new slicing distribution, Relation-Aware Slicing Distribution (RASD), to improve the efficiency and representative power of the Sliced Gromov-Wasserstein (SGW) distance by utilizing Relation-Aware Projecting Directions (RAPD).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current SGW distance computations are hindered by the inefficiencies of uninformative projecting directions and the optimization costs of finding better slicing distributions.

Method: The authors propose RAPD as a mechanism to capture pairwise associations effectively, leading to the derivation of RASD for fast sampling. They also introduce RASGW and its variant, IWRASGW, for improved alignment tasks.

Result: Theoretical analyses demonstrate the properties of RASGW, and empirical evaluations showcase its superior performance across various alignment problems.

Conclusion: The optimization-free RASGW distance overcomes the computational and representational inefficiencies of SGW distances, offering practical improvements and broad applicability.

Abstract: The Sliced Gromov-Wasserstein (SGW) distance, aiming to relieve the
computational cost of solving a non-convex quadratic program that is the
Gromov-Wasserstein distance, utilizes projecting directions sampled uniformly
from unit hyperspheres. This slicing mechanism incurs unnecessary computational
costs due to uninformative directions, which also affects the representative
power of the distance. However, finding a more appropriate distribution over
the projecting directions (slicing distribution) is often an optimization
problem in itself that comes with its own computational cost. In addition, with
more intricate distributions, the sampling itself may be expensive. As a
remedy, we propose an optimization-free slicing distribution that provides fast
sampling for the Monte Carlo approximation. We do so by introducing the
Relation-Aware Projecting Direction (RAPD), effectively capturing the pairwise
association of each of two pairs of random vectors, each following their
ambient law. This enables us to derive the Relation-Aware Slicing Distribution
(RASD), a location-scale law corresponding to sampled RAPDs. Finally, we
introduce the RASGW distance and its variants, e.g., IWRASGW (Importance
Weighted RASGW), which overcome the shortcomings experienced by SGW. We
theoretically analyze its properties and substantiate its empirical prowess
using extensive experiments on various alignment tasks.

TL;DR: The paper presents a Transformer-based solution for simulating realistic hair dynamics in real-time, handling various hairstyles, body shapes, and motions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of generalizing hair dynamics simulation across diverse hairstyles and motions while maintaining high fidelity and efficiency.

Method: The method involves a two-stage neural architecture: a static Transformer-powered network for predicting static hair shapes, and a dynamic network with cross-attention for kinematic input and expressive hair motion.

Result: The approach achieves high-fidelity, generalizable dynamic hair simulation, resolves body penetrations for complex hairstyles, and works in real-time even for unseen scenarios.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that their method effectively generalizes across arbitrary hair styles and movements, offering efficient, physics-informed dynamic simulations.

Abstract: Simulating hair dynamics that generalize across arbitrary hairstyles, body
shapes, and motions is a critical challenge. Our novel two-stage neural
solution is the first to leverage Transformer-based architectures for such a
broad generalization. We propose a Transformer-powered static network that
predicts static draped shapes for any hairstyle, effectively resolving
hair-body penetrations and preserving hair fidelity. Subsequently, a dynamic
network with a novel cross-attention mechanism fuses static hair features with
kinematic input to generate expressive dynamics and complex secondary motions.
This dynamic network also allows for efficient fine-tuning of challenging
motion sequences, such as abrupt head movements. Our method offers real-time
inference for both static single-frame drapes and dynamic drapes over pose
sequences. Our method demonstrates high-fidelity and generalizable dynamic hair
across various styles, guided by physics-informed losses, and can resolve
penetrations even for complex, unseen long hairstyles, highlighting its broad
generalization.

*Yuxi Liu*

Main category: cs.CC

TL;DR: The paper investigates the computational complexity of diffusion-based language modeling, establishing a dichotomy based on the score-matching network's quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to understand the capabilities and limitations of diffusion models for sequential computation tasks.

Method: The authors analyze theoretical aspects of diffusion models, focusing on quality differences in score-matching networks and their computational implications.

Result: Diffusion models display vastly contrasting computational abilities based on their score-matching network precision, spanning $
TC^0$ to Turing machine simulation.

Conclusion: The findings highlight a dichotomy in diffusion model capabilities and suggest future architectures combining sequential and parallel computation might outperform current models.

Abstract: This paper explores the computational complexity of diffusion-based language
modeling. We prove a dichotomy based on the quality of the score-matching
network in a diffusion model. In one direction, a network that exactly computes
the score function of some initial distribution can only perform language
modeling within the $\mathsf{TC}^0$ complexity class, reflecting limitations
tied to rapid convergence. In the other direction, we show that if there is no
requirement for the network to match any score function, then diffusion
modeling can simulate any Turing machine in a certain sense. This dichotomy
provides a theoretical lens on the capabilities and limitations of diffusion
models, particularly concerning tasks requiring sequential computation. We
conjecture extensions of our theoretical results, including for the case where
the diffusion model is not perfect, but merely good. We also discuss the wider
context and practical implications, and hypothesize that a machine learning
architecture that can interpolate between sequential and parallel modes of
operation would be superior to both Transformers and diffusion models.

*Guy Blanc,Caleb Koch,Carmen Strassle,Li-Yang Tan*

Main category: cs.CC

TL;DR: The paper explores computational-statistical tradeoffs in PAC learning based on NP-hardness, presenting results on sample complexity and implications for RP vs. NP equivalence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether efficient algorithms can achieve information-theoretic limits in statistical problems and establish computational-statistical tradeoffs under standard worst-case assumptions.

Method: The research introduces sharply-defined computational-statistical tradeoffs and characterizations of RP vs. NP in the PAC learning framework, with lower bounds holding against improper learners.

Result: The study demonstrates NP-hardness of improperly learning subclasses of polynomial-size circuits and provides a new reverse implication characterization of RP = NP in terms of sample complexity in learning.

Conclusion: This work bridges computational and statistical perspectives in PAC learning, showing that computational efficiency can lead to significantly higher sample complexity under NP-hardness assumptions.

Abstract: A central question in computer science and statistics is whether efficient
algorithms can achieve the information-theoretic limits of statistical
problems. Many computational-statistical tradeoffs have been shown under
average-case assumptions, but since statistical problems are average-case in
nature, it has been a challenge to base them on standard worst-case
assumptions.
  In PAC learning where such tradeoffs were first studied, the question is
whether computational efficiency can come at the cost of using more samples
than information-theoretically necessary. We base such tradeoffs on
$\mathsf{NP}$-hardness and obtain:
  $\circ$ Sharp computational-statistical tradeoffs assuming $\mathsf{NP}$
requires exponential time: For every polynomial $p(n)$, there is an $n$-variate
class $C$ with VC dimension $1$ such that the sample complexity of
time-efficiently learning $C$ is $\Theta(p(n))$.
  $\circ$ A characterization of $\mathsf{RP}$ vs. $\mathsf{NP}$ in terms of
learning: $\mathsf{RP} = \mathsf{NP}$ iff every $\mathsf{NP}$-enumerable class
is learnable with $O(\mathrm{VCdim}(C))$ samples in polynomial time. The
forward implication has been known since (Pitt and Valiant, 1988); we prove the
reverse implication.
  Notably, all our lower bounds hold against improper learners. These are the
first $\mathsf{NP}$-hardness results for improperly learning a subclass of
polynomial-size circuits, circumventing formal barriers of Applebaum, Barak,
and Xiao (2008).

Motivation: There is a need to improve the analysis and clustering of directed graph structures using advanced graph representation matrices.

Method: The paper integrates properties of the Hermitian adjacency matrix and the non-backtracking matrix to propose the complex non-backtracking matrix and establishes its connection with existing metrics.

Result: The complex non-backtracking matrix retains cluster information and has beneficial properties similar to the non-backtracking matrix for undirected graphs, especially for sparse directed graphs.

Abstract: Graph representation matrices are essential tools in graph data analysis.
Recently, Hermitian adjacency matrices have been proposed to investigate
directed graph structures. Previous studies have demonstrated that these
matrices can extract valuable information for clustering. In this paper, we
propose the complex non-backtracking matrix that integrates the properties of
the Hermitian adjacency matrix and the non-backtracking matrix. The proposed
matrix has similar properties with the non-backtracking matrix of undirected
graphs. We reveal relationships between the complex non-backtracking matrix and
the Hermitian adjacency matrix. Also, we provide intriguing insights that this
matrix representation holds cluster information, particularly for sparse
directed graphs.

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: The paper presents rel-HNN, a hypergraph-based framework that improves the representation learning of relational databases for deep learning applications, addressing limitations of graph neural networks for this type of data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods like GNNs simplify relational structures of databases, ignoring intricate intra-tuple relationships, which reduces their effectiveness in capturing detailed relational semantics.

Method: Proposed rel-HNN, a hypergraph framework modeling attribute-value pairs as nodes and tuples as hyperedges. It learns multi-level representations and incorporates a split-parallel training algorithm for scalability and efficiency.

Result: Rel-HNN outperforms other methods in classification and regression tasks on real-world and benchmark datasets. The split-parallel training achieves speedups up to 3.18x for relational data processing and up to 2.94x for hypergraph learning.

Conclusion: Rel-HNN effectively captures fine-grained relationships in relational databases and demonstrates significant computational advantages, positioning it as a strong alternative to traditional GNN approaches.

Abstract: Relational databases (RDBs) are ubiquitous in enterprise and real-world
applications. Flattening the database poses challenges for deep learning models
that rely on fixed-size input representations to capture relational semantics
from the structured nature of relational data. Graph neural networks (GNNs)
have been proposed to address this, but they often oversimplify relational
structures by modeling all the tuples as monolithic nodes and ignoring
intra-tuple associations. In this work, we propose a novel hypergraph-based
framework, that we call rel-HNN, which models each unique attribute-value pair
as a node and each tuple as a hyperedge, enabling the capture of fine-grained
intra-tuple relationships. Our approach learns explicit multi-level
representations across attribute-value, tuple, and table levels. To address the
scalability challenges posed by large RDBs, we further introduce a
split-parallel training algorithm that leverages multi-GPU execution for
efficient hypergraph learning. Extensive experiments on real-world and
benchmark datasets demonstrate that rel-HNN significantly outperforms existing
methods in both classification and regression tasks. Moreover, our
split-parallel training achieves substantial speedups -- up to 3.18x for
learning on relational data and up to 2.94x for hypergraph learning -- compared
to conventional single-GPU execution.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To test the usefulness of object-centric event logs in analyzing more complex and realistic processes, leveraging real-world data like team sports for new use cases.

Method: The authors developed a framework to transform football data into object-centric event logs with a spatial dimension and demonstrated its application using real-world data.

Result: The framework successfully generated object-centric event logs from football data, showcasing its effectiveness for different process representations.

Conclusion: Object-centric event logs can be effectively applied in football analytics, emphasizing future work on variant analysis and filtering techniques to better manage data variability.

Abstract: Object-centric event logs expand the conventional single-case notion event
log by considering multiple objects, allowing for the analysis of more complex
and realistic process behavior. However, the number of real-world
object-centric event logs remains limited, and further studies are needed to
test their usefulness. The increasing availability of data from team sports can
facilitate object-centric process mining, leveraging both real-world data and
suitable use cases. In this paper, we present a framework for transforming
football (soccer) data into an object-centric event log, further enhanced with
a spatial dimension. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework by
generating object-centric event logs based on real-world football data and
discuss the results for varying process representations. With our paper, we
provide the first example for object-centric event logs in football analytics.
Future work should consider variant analysis and filtering techniques to better
handle variability

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The feasibility of Randomized Hamiltonian Monte Carlo achieving critical acceleration in convergence motivated the need for automated solutions, particularly examining the performance of the No-U-turn Sampler.

Method: The study combines a concentration of measure approach to assess the tuning mechanism and a coupling-based mixing analysis in Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, focusing on Gaussian target distributions.

Result: The investigation provides a precise analysis of the sampler's behavior and rigorous mixing guarantees, highlighting both its capabilities and limitations in achieving acceleration.

Conclusion: While the No-U-turn Sampler exemplifies automated tuning, its ability to enhance convergence is rigorously quantifiable but comes with defined constraints in Gaussian settings.

Abstract: Recent progress on the theory of variational hypocoercivity established that
Randomized Hamiltonian Monte Carlo -- at criticality -- can achieve pronounced
acceleration in its convergence and hence sampling performance over diffusive
dynamics. Manual critical tuning being unfeasible in practice has motivated
automated algorithmic solutions, notably the No-U-turn Sampler. Beyond its
empirical success, a rigorous study of this method's ability to achieve
accelerated convergence has been missing. We initiate this investigation
combining a concentration of measure approach to examine the automatic tuning
mechanism with a coupling based mixing analysis for Hamiltonian Monte Carlo. In
certain Gaussian target distributions, this yields a precise characterization
of the sampler's behavior resulting, in particular, in rigorous mixing
guarantees describing the algorithm's ability and limitations in achieving
accelerated convergence.

TL;DR: This paper develops a deep Koopman-based neural network for autonomous vehicle dynamics modeling and control, achieving improved tracking accuracy and real-time suitability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges in accurately modeling and controlling nonlinear and coupled vehicle dynamics using more effective control techniques.

Method: A deep neural network is utilized to learn the Koopman operator and invariant subspace while integrating convexity-preserving bilinear interactions. It also employs a cumulative error regulator for enhanced trajectory tracking.

Result: The framework successfully reduces tracking errors compared to baseline controllers, demonstrating long-horizon prediction capability and real-time application suitability.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively integrates Koopman theory and deep learning for vehicle dynamics, enabling robust real-time performance in autonomous systems like MPC.

Abstract: Accurate modeling and control of autonomous vehicles remain a fundamental
challenge due to the nonlinear and coupled nature of vehicle dynamics. While
Koopman operator theory offers a framework for deploying powerful linear
control techniques, learning a finite-dimensional invariant subspace for
high-fidelity modeling continues to be an open problem. This paper presents a
deep Koopman approach for modeling and control of vehicle dynamics within the
curvilinear Frenet frame. The proposed framework uses a deep neural network
architecture to simultaneously learn the Koopman operator and its associated
invariant subspace from the data. Input-state bilinear interactions are
captured by the algorithm while preserving convexity, which makes it suitable
for real-time model predictive control (MPC) application. A multi-step
prediction loss is utilized during training to ensure long-horizon prediction
capability. To further enhance real-time trajectory tracking performance, the
model is integrated with a cumulative error regulator (CER) module, which
compensates for model mismatch by mitigating accumulated prediction errors.
Closed-loop performance is evaluated through hardware-in-the-loop (HIL)
experiments using a CarSim RT model as the target plant, with real-time
validation conducted on a dSPACE SCALEXIO system. The proposed controller
achieved significant reductions in tracking error relative to baseline
controllers, confirming its suitability for real-time implementation in
embedded autonomous vehicle systems.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome inaccuracies in traditional and camera-based TMC methods under poor conditions and explore the capability of LiDAR for better intersection traffic analysis.

Method: The authors developed, deployed, and evaluated a dual-LiDAR system that uses 3D bounding box detections to classify vehicles by direction, movement, and class.

Result: The dual-LiDAR system successfully estimated TMC results and provided valuable insights into traffic trends and irregularities.

Conclusion: LiDAR technology shows promise for reliable TMC estimation and has the potential to support other applications like trajectory forecasting and intent prediction at intersections.

Abstract: Traffic Movement Count (TMC) at intersections is crucial for optimizing
signal timings, assessing the performance of existing traffic control measures,
and proposing efficient lane configurations to minimize delays, reduce
congestion, and promote safety. Traditionally, methods such as manual counting,
loop detectors, pneumatic road tubes, and camera-based recognition have been
used for TMC estimation. Although generally reliable, camera-based TMC
estimation is prone to inaccuracies under poor lighting conditions during harsh
weather and nighttime. In contrast, Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR)
technology is gaining popularity in recent times due to reduced costs and its
expanding use in 3D object detection, tracking, and related applications. This
paper presents the authors' endeavor to develop, deploy and evaluate a
dual-LiDAR system at an intersection in the city of Rialto, California, for TMC
estimation. The 3D bounding box detections from the two LiDARs are used to
classify vehicle counts based on traffic directions, vehicle movements, and
vehicle classes. This work discusses the estimated TMC results and provides
insights into the observed trends and irregularities. Potential improvements
are also discussed that could enhance not only TMC estimation, but also
trajectory forecasting and intent prediction at intersections.

Motivation: The motivation is to ensure the correctness and liveness of mutual exclusion algorithms, addressing practical issues in concurrent systems using shared resources.

Method: Model checking is applied to verify various mutual exclusion algorithms, incorporating the justness criterion and analyzing different concurrency relations based on shared register behaviors.

Result: The study identifies violations of correctness properties in several algorithms and provides suggestions for improvements.

Conclusion: By leveraging model checking and the justness criterion, the paper contributes to understanding and refining mutual exclusion algorithms for enhanced reliability in concurrent systems.

Abstract: We verify the correctness of a variety of mutual exclusion algorithms through
model checking. We look at algorithms where communication is via shared
read/write registers, where those registers can be atomic or non-atomic. For
the verification of liveness properties, it is necessary to assume a
completeness criterion to eliminate spurious counterexamples. We use justness
as completeness criterion. Justness depends on a concurrency relation; we
consider several such relations, modelling different assumptions on the working
of the shared registers. We present executions demonstrating the violation of
correctness properties by several algorithms, and in some cases suggest
improvements.

Motivation: The motivation for this study is to leverage data collected during the COVID-19 pandemic to improve forecasting models and enhance preparedness for future outbreaks.

Method: The authors utilized a two-year dataset from Cyprus, incorporating epidemiological data, vaccination records, policy measures, and weather conditions to analyze and forecast COVID-19 trends.

Result: The study successfully identified infection trends, assessed the forecasting model's performance, and evaluated the effects of external factors on disease dynamics.

Conclusion: Insights from this paper aid in crafting better public health strategies and preparedness for future health emergencies by improving disease forecasting and understanding external influences.

Abstract: Emerging in December 2019, the COVID-19 pandemic caused widespread health,
economic, and social disruptions. Rapid global transmission overwhelmed
healthcare systems, resulting in high infection rates, hospitalisations, and
fatalities. To minimise the spread, governments implemented several
non-pharmaceutical interventions like lockdowns and travel restrictions. While
effective in controlling transmission, these measures also posed significant
economic and societal challenges. Although the WHO declared COVID-19 no longer
a global health emergency in May 2023, its impact persists, shaping public
health strategies. The vast amount of data collected during the pandemic offers
valuable insights into disease dynamics, transmission, and intervention
effectiveness. Leveraging these insights can improve forecasting models,
enhancing preparedness and response to future outbreaks while mitigating their
social and economic impact. This paper presents a large-scale case study on
COVID-19 forecasting in Cyprus, utilising a two-year dataset that integrates
epidemiological data, vaccination records, policy measures, and weather
conditions. We analyse infection trends, assess forecasting performance, and
examine the influence of external factors on disease dynamics. The insights

Motivation: To develop neural networks capable of robustly handling diverse wireless communication channels without the need for prior channel information or real-time parameter updates, addressing a gap in current data-driven methods.

Method: The authors establish design criteria for generating synthetic training datasets that ensure robust generalization of neural networks to new wireless channels. They validate this approach using neural networks across different levels of complexity in simulations.

Result: Simulations show that neural networks trained using the proposed synthetic datasets generalize well across fixed and variable wireless channel profiles, achieving reliable performance.

Conclusion: Offline-trained neural networks guided by the proposed criteria enable intelligent and adaptive communication in cognitive systems while eliminating the need for real-time fine-tuning or specific channel knowledge.

Abstract: Channel estimation is crucial in cognitive communications, as it enables
intelligent spectrum sensing and adaptive transmission by providing accurate
information about the current channel state. However, in many papers neural
networks are frequently tested by training and testing on one example channel
or similar channels. This is because data-driven methods often degrade on new
data which they are not trained on, as they cannot extrapolate their training
knowledge. This is despite the fact physical channels are often assumed to be
time-variant. However, due to the low latency requirements and limited
computing resources, neural networks may not have enough time and computing
resources to execute online training to fine-tune the parameters. This
motivates us to design offline-trained neural networks that can perform
robustly over wireless channels, but without any actual channel information
being known at design time. In this paper, we propose design criteria to
generate synthetic training datasets for neural networks, which guarantee that
after training the resulting networks achieve a certain mean squared error
(MSE) on new and previously unseen channels. Therefore, neural network
solutions require no prior channel information or parameters update for
real-world implementations. Based on the proposed design criteria, we further
propose a benchmark design which ensures intelligent operation for different
channel profiles. To demonstrate general applicability, we use neural networks
with different levels of complexity to show that the generalization achieved
appears to be independent of neural network architecture. From simulations,
neural networks achieve robust generalization to wireless channels with both
fixed channel profiles and variable delay spreads.

### [284] [A Novel Data Augmentation Strategy for Robust Deep Learning Classification of Biomedical Time-Series Data: Application to ECG and EEG Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12645)
*Mohammed Guhdar,Ramadhan J. Mstafa,Abdulhakeem O. Mohammed*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: This paper proposes a unified and novel deep learning framework for analyzing diverse biological signals, addressing challenges like signal variability and class imbalance, achieving state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to overcome limitations in processing diverse physiological signals and address class imbalances in biomedical datasets, which hinder traditional analysis methods.

Method: The framework combines ResNet-based CNN with attention mechanisms and employs novel time-domain signal augmentation, preprocessing steps like wavelet denoising, and Focal Loss to handle class imbalance.

Result: The method achieved accuracies of 99.96%, 99.78%, and 100% on UCI Seizure EEG, MIT-BIH Arrhythmia, and PTB Diagnostic ECG datasets, demonstrating robust performance.

Conclusion: The proposed framework is accurate, resource-efficient, and deployable on low-end devices, making it promising for universal monitoring in clinical and wearable applications.

Abstract: The increasing need for accurate and unified analysis of diverse biological
signals, such as ECG and EEG, is paramount for comprehensive patient
assessment, especially in synchronous monitoring. Despite advances in
multi-sensor fusion, a critical gap remains in developing unified architectures
that effectively process and extract features from fundamentally different
physiological signals. Another challenge is the inherent class imbalance in
many biomedical datasets, often causing biased performance in traditional
methods. This study addresses these issues by proposing a novel and unified
deep learning framework that achieves state-of-the-art performance across
different signal types. Our method integrates a ResNet-based CNN with an
attention mechanism, enhanced by a novel data augmentation strategy:
time-domain concatenation of multiple augmented variants of each signal to
generate richer representations. Unlike prior work, we scientifically increase
signal complexity to achieve future-reaching capabilities, which resulted in
the best predictions compared to the state of the art. Preprocessing steps
included wavelet denoising, baseline removal, and standardization. Class
imbalance was effectively managed through the combined use of this advanced
data augmentation and the Focal Loss function. Regularization techniques were
applied during training to ensure generalization. We rigorously evaluated the
proposed architecture on three benchmark datasets: UCI Seizure EEG, MIT-BIH
Arrhythmia, and PTB Diagnostic ECG. It achieved accuracies of 99.96%, 99.78%,
and 100%, respectively, demonstrating robustness across diverse signal types
and clinical contexts. Finally, the architecture requires ~130 MB of memory and
processes each sample in ~10 ms, suggesting suitability for deployment on
low-end or wearable devices.

### [285] [Differentially Private Conformal Prediction via Quantile Binary Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12497)
*Ogonnaya M. Romanus,Roberto Molinari*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Differentially Private (DP) approach called Private Conformity via Quantile Search (P-COQS) for Conformal Prediction (CP), addressing privacy concerns in calibration datasets. It balances privacy guarantees with empirical accuracy, outperforming current DP alternatives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the gap in privacy-preserving methods for Conformal Prediction (CP) related to calibration datasets, which is less explored compared to DP approaches focused on training data.

Method: The authors adapt a randomized binary search algorithm to compute DP quantiles during the calibration phase of CP. This method safeguards privacy at the cost of slight under-coverage in finite-sample settings.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate the robustness of P-COQS against privacy noise, sample size, and significance level variations. It produces smaller prediction sets while maintaining desired coverage and privacy guarantees when benchmarked against datasets like CIFAR-10, ImageNet, and CoronaHack.

Conclusion: P-COQS offers a promising DP approach for CP calibration datasets, showing superior empirical coverage, efficiency, and informativeness compared to existing DP methods.

Abstract: Most Differentially Private (DP) approaches focus on limiting privacy leakage
from learners based on the data that they are trained on, there are fewer
approaches that consider leakage when procedures involve a calibration dataset
which is common in uncertainty quantification methods such as Conformal
Prediction (CP). Since there is a limited amount of approaches in this
direction, in this work we deliver a general DP approach for CP that we call
Private Conformity via Quantile Search (P-COQS). The proposed approach adapts
an existing randomized binary search algorithm for computing DP quantiles in
the calibration phase of CP thereby guaranteeing privacy of the consequent
prediction sets. This however comes at a price of slightly under-covering with
respect to the desired $(1 - \alpha)$-level when using finite-sample
calibration sets (although broad empirical results show that the P-COQS
generally targets the required level in the considered cases). Confirming
properties of the adapted algorithm and quantifying the approximate coverage
guarantees of the consequent CP, we conduct extensive experiments to examine
the effects of privacy noise, sample size and significance level on the
performance of our approach compared to existing alternatives. In addition, we
empirically evaluate our approach on several benchmark datasets, including
CIFAR-10, ImageNet and CoronaHack. Our results suggest that the proposed method
is robust to privacy noise and performs favorably with respect to the current
DP alternative in terms of empirical coverage, efficiency, and informativeness.
Specifically, the results indicate that P-COQS produces smaller conformal
prediction sets while simultaneously targeting the desired coverage and privacy
guarantees in all these experimental settings.

### [286] [Cross-World Assumption and Refining Prediction Intervals for Individual Treatment Effects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12581)
*Juraj Bodik,Yaxuan Huang,Bin Yu*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of estimating uncertainty in individual treatment effect (ITE) predictions, introducing intervals based on bounds informed by a cross-world correlation parameter, which improve prediction accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to improve individual treatment effect (ITE) estimation, which is crucial for high-stakes decision-making but lacks reliable uncertainty quantification due to the fundamental unidentifiability of individual outcomes.

Method: The authors propose bounding the cross-world correlation parameter $\rho(x)$ using domain knowledge, then designing prediction intervals for ITE that achieve stable coverage and shorter widths through statistical techniques.

Result: Their intervals substantially outperform competing methods by producing more stable uncertainty measures that are less wide (often under 1/3 the width of other methods) while still satisfying statistical coverage guarantees.

Conclusion: Incorporating cross-world assumptions into ITE uncertainty quantification enhances statistical validity and practical informativeness, showing promise for real-world applications.

Abstract: While average treatment effects (ATE) and conditional average treatment
effects (CATE) provide valuable population- and subgroup-level summaries, they
fail to capture uncertainty at the individual level. For high-stakes
decision-making, individual treatment effect (ITE) estimates must be
accompanied by valid prediction intervals that reflect heterogeneity and
unit-specific uncertainty. However, the fundamental unidentifiability of ITEs
limits the ability to derive precise and reliable individual-level uncertainty
estimates. To address this challenge, we investigate the role of a cross-world
correlation parameter, $ \rho(x) = cor(Y(1), Y(0) | X = x) $, which describes
the dependence between potential outcomes, given covariates, in the
Neyman-Rubin super-population model with i.i.d. units. Although $ \rho $ is
fundamentally unidentifiable, we argue that in most real-world applications, it
is possible to impose reasonable and interpretable bounds informed by
domain-expert knowledge. Given $\rho$, we design prediction intervals for ITE,
achieving more stable and accurate coverage with substantially shorter widths;
often less than 1/3 of those from competing methods. The resulting intervals
satisfy coverage guarantees $P\big(Y(1) - Y(0) \in C_{ITE}(X)\big) \geq 1 -
\alpha$ and are asymptotically optimal under Gaussian assumptions. We provide
strong theoretical and empirical arguments that cross-world assumptions can
make individual uncertainty quantification both practically informative and
statistically valid.

TL;DR: This paper introduces RIDER, a method optimizing empirical risk minimization under temporal distribution shifts, demonstrating its improved predictive performance across several real-world tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of temporal distribution shifts affecting machine learning models in dynamic environments.

Method: Develop RIDER—a theoretically grounded framework optimizing weighted empirical risk minimization under distribution shifts, with special cases aligning with existing weighting schemes.

Result: RIDER consistently improves predictive performance in various benchmarks, including the Yearbook dataset, stock volatility prediction, and NYC taxi ride forecasting.

Conclusion: RIDER offers a robust solution for handling dynamically evolving data distributions, outperforming conventional strategies in diverse real-world applications.

Abstract: Temporal distribution shifts pose a key challenge for machine learning models
trained and deployed in dynamically evolving environments. This paper
introduces RIDER (RIsk minimization under Dynamically Evolving Regimes) which
derives optimally-weighted empirical risk minimization procedures under
temporal distribution shifts. Our approach is theoretically grounded in the
random distribution shift model, where random shifts arise as a superposition
of numerous unpredictable changes in the data-generating process. We show that
common weighting schemes, such as pooling all data, exponentially weighting
data, and using only the most recent data, emerge naturally as special cases in
our framework. We demonstrate that RIDER consistently improves out-of-sample
predictive performance when applied as a fine-tuning step on the Yearbook
dataset, across a range of benchmark methods in Wild-Time. Moreover, we show
that RIDER outperforms standard weighting strategies in two other real-world
tasks: predicting stock market volatility and forecasting ride durations in NYC
taxi data.

*Gabriel Istrate,Cosmin Bonchis,Victor Bogdan*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: The paper explores algorithms with predictions in a multiagent setting and introduces a two-predictor framework. It applies the framework to a collaborative version of the ski-rental problem, identifying optimal strategies under varying predictor qualities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the efficiency of algorithms with predictions in competitive multiagent scenarios and improve decision-making in the presence of imperfect information.

Method: A two predictor framework is developed for agents, differentiating between predictions of their own behavior and that of others. The approach is illustrated through the multiagent ski-rental problem.

Result: The optimal algorithm under perfect predictions for others was identified, though it is not robust to prediction errors. A more robust alternative algorithm was developed and evaluated.

Conclusion: The study highlights the importance of robust algorithms in multiagent predictive frameworks where prediction inaccuracies are inevitable.

Abstract: We study the power of (competitive) algorithms with predictions in a
multiagent setting. We introduce a two predictor framework, that assumes that
agents use one predictor for their future (self) behavior, and one for the
behavior of the other players. The main problem we are concerned with is
understanding what are the best competitive ratios that can be achieved by
employing such predictors, under various assumptions on predictor quality.
  As an illustration of our framework, we introduce and analyze a multiagent
version of the ski-rental problem. In this problem agents can collaborate by
pooling resources to get a group license for some asset. If the license price
is not met then agents have to rent the asset individually for the day at a
unit price. Otherwise the license becomes available forever to everyone at no
extra cost.
  In the particular case of perfect other predictions the algorithm that
follows the self predictor is optimal but not robust to mispredictions of
agent's future behavior; we give an algorithm with better robustness properties
and benchmark it.

*S. Schär,S. Marelli,B. Sudret*

Main category: stat.CO

TL;DR: The paper introduces mNARX+, an automated approach for modeling nonlinear systems using a recursive algorithm that reduces reliance on domain expertise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitation of mNARX models which heavily depend on domain expertise for identifying relevant features.

Method: Proposed a recursive algorithm that sequentially selects temporal features based on their correlation with model prediction residuals.

Result: Tested on two case studies—a Bouc-Wen oscillator and a wind turbine simulator—showing accurate and stable surrogate models.

Conclusion: mNARX+ offers a systematic, data-driven solution for modeling complex dynamical systems, minimizing the need for extensive prior system knowledge.

Abstract: We propose an automatic approach for manifold nonlinear autoregressive with
exogenous inputs (mNARX) modeling that leverages the feature-based structure of
functional-NARX (F-NARX) modeling. This novel approach, termed mNARX+,
preserves the key strength of the mNARX framework, which is its expressivity
allowing it to model complex dynamical systems, while simultaneously addressing
a key limitation: the heavy reliance on domain expertise to identify relevant
auxiliary quantities and their causal ordering. Our method employs a
data-driven, recursive algorithm that automates the construction of the mNARX
model sequence. It operates by sequentially selecting temporal features based
on their correlation with the model prediction residuals, thereby automatically
identifying the most critical auxiliary quantities and the order in which they
should be modeled. This procedure significantly reduces the need for prior
system knowledge. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the mNARX+ algorithm on
two case studies: a Bouc-Wen oscillator with strong hysteresis and a complex
aero-servo-elastic wind turbine simulator. The results show that the algorithm
provides a systematic, data-driven method for creating accurate and stable
surrogate models for complex dynamical systems.

*Zachary James,Joseph Guinness*

Main category: stat.CO

TL;DR: The paper explores GPU-based implementations of Vecchia Approximation, a method for efficient Gaussian Process modeling, and introduces optimized software that outperforms existing tools, achieving faster runtimes and improved predictive accuracy for large datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Gaussian Processes are computationally intensive for large datasets, necessitating scalable approximations. Despite GPU advancements in related areas, Vecchia Approximation lacked GPU-based software, prompting this research to bridge the gap.

Method: Three implementations of Vecchia Approximation on GPUs were compared, with optimization focusing on memory management. The best-performing method was integrated into the GpGpU R package.

Result: The new GPU-based method provided superior runtime and predictive accuracy compared to other methods and existing software tools, validated across multiple datasets including a challenging spatial-temporal dataset.

Conclusion: GpGpU offers an efficient solution for Gaussian Process modeling on large datasets, leveraging GPU capabilities to improve computational performance and accuracy.

Abstract: Gaussian Processes have become an indispensable part of the spatial
statistician's toolbox but are unsuitable for analyzing large dataset because
of the significant time and memory needed to fit the associated model exactly.
Vecchia Approximation is widely used to reduce the computational complexity and
can be calculated with embarrassingly parallel algorithms. While multi-core
software has been developed for Vecchia Approximation, such as the GpGp R
package, software designed to run on graphics processing units (GPU) is
lacking, despite the tremendous success GPUs have had in statistics and machine
learning. We compare three different ways to implement Vecchia Approximation on
a GPU: two of which are similar to methods used for other Gaussian Process
approximations and one that is new. The impact of memory type on performance is
investigated and the final method is optimized accordingly. We show that our
new method outperforms the other two and then present it in the GpGpU R
package. We compare GpGpU to existing multi-core and GPU-accelerated software
by fitting Gaussian Process models on various datasets, including a large
spatial-temporal dataset of $n>10^6$ points collected from an earth-observing
satellite. Our results show that GpGpU achieves faster runtimes and better
predictive accuracy.

TL;DR: UniSLU is a unified framework for multiple SLU tasks, combining ASR, NER, and SA into a single architecture using a unified representation and generative method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current SLU methods often rely on separate architectures for individual tasks, leading to system complexity, limited cross-task interactions, and underutilized heterogeneous datasets.

Method: UniSLU introduces a unified representation and generative framework for joint modeling of ASR, NER, and SA tasks, improving interactions and leveraging large language models.

Result: Experiments demonstrate UniSLU's superior performance in SLU tasks compared to benchmark methods on public datasets.

Conclusion: UniSLU simplifies SLU systems, enhances task interactions, leverages heterogeneous datasets, and proves effective for real-world speech-based applications.

Abstract: Spoken Language Understanding (SLU) plays a crucial role in speech-centric
multimedia applications, enabling machines to comprehend spoken language in
scenarios such as meetings, interviews, and customer service interactions. SLU
encompasses multiple tasks, including Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR),
spoken Named Entity Recognition (NER), and spoken Sentiment Analysis (SA).
However, existing methods often rely on separate model architectures for
individual tasks such as spoken NER and SA, which increases system complexity,
limits cross-task interaction, and fails to fully exploit heterogeneous
datasets available across tasks. To address these limitations, we propose
UniSLU, a unified framework that jointly models multiple SLU tasks within a
single architecture. Specifically, we propose a unified representation for
diverse SLU tasks, enabling full utilization of heterogeneous datasets across
multiple tasks. Built upon this representation, we propose a unified generative
method that jointly models ASR, spoken NER, and SA tasks, enhancing task
interactions and enabling seamless integration with large language models to
harness their powerful generative capabilities. Extensive experiments on public
SLU datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving superior
SLU performance compared to several benchmark methods, making it well-suited
for real-world speech-based multimedia scenarios. We will release all code and
models at github to facilitate future research.

Main category: astro-ph.EP

TL;DR: The paper introduces a passive method leveraging Earth's J2 perturbation to optimize CubeSat orbit insertion and minimize fuel use.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CubeSats face challenges in precise orbital insertion due to limited propulsion and fuel, necessitating more efficient maneuvering techniques.

Method: The method utilizes Earth's J2 perturbation effects to adjust orbital parameters passively, reducing reliance on fuel-intensive propulsion.

Result: Numerical simulations and case studies validate the method, revealing significant fuel savings and precise orbital insertion compared to standard techniques.

Conclusion: The proposed strategy enhances CubeSat mission efficiency and longevity, making it viable for future low-Earth orbit missions.

Abstract: The precise insertion of CubeSats into designated orbits is a complex task,
primarily due to the limited propulsion capabilities and constrained fuel
reserves onboard, which severely restrict the scope for large orbital
corrections. This limitation necessitates the development of more efficient
maneuvering techniques to ensure mission success. In this paper, we propose a
maneuvering sequence that exploits the natural J2 perturbation caused by the
Earth's oblateness. By utilizing the secular effects of this perturbation, it
is possible to passively influence key orbital parameters such as the argument
of perigee and the right ascension of the ascending node, thereby reducing the
need for extensive propulsion-based corrections. The approach is designed to
optimize the CubeSat's orbital insertion and minimize the total fuel required
for trajectory adjustments, making it particularly suitable for
fuel-constrained missions. The proposed methodology is validated through
comprehensive numerical simulations that examine different initial orbital
conditions and perturbation environments. Case studies are presented to
demonstrate the effectiveness of the J2-augmented strategy in achieving
accurate orbital insertion, showing a major reduction in fuel consumption
compared to traditional methods. The results underscore the potential of this
approach to extend the operational life and capabilities of CubeSats, offering
a viable solution for future low-Earth orbit missions.

dementia is critical for timely intervention and improved patient outcomes.
While classical machine learning and deep learning approaches have been
explored extensively for dementia prediction, these solutions often struggle

Result: SpoQFL shows enhanced training robustness, convergence stability, and efficiency, outperforming standard QFL in extensive real-world dataset experiments.

Conclusion: SpoQFL offers a practical solution for overcoming quantum noise limitations in QFL, ensuring better and more stable decentralized model training in quantum networks.

Abstract: Quantum Federated Learning (QFL) is an emerging paradigm that combines
quantum computing and federated learning (FL) to enable decentralized model
training while maintaining data privacy over quantum networks. However, quantum
noise remains a significant barrier in QFL, since modern quantum devices

performance. To address this issue, we propose SpoQFL, a novel QFL framework
that leverages sporadic learning to mitigate quantum noise heterogeneity in
distributed quantum systems. SpoQFL dynamically adjusts training strategies
based on noise fluctuations, enhancing model robustness, convergence stability,

and (c) Multitask model to simultaneously predict 5 diseases. We make use of
BRSET (lab-captured images) and mBRSET (smartphone-captured images) datasets,
both of which also contain clinical metadata for model training/evaluation.
  Results: Trained on a dataset of BRSET and mBRSET images, the image quality
checker achieves near-100% accuracy in filtering out low-quality fundus images.
The multimodal pretrained disease diagnosis model outperforms models using only

  Conclusions: The InSight pipeline demonstrates robustness across varied image
conditions and has high diagnostic accuracy across all five diseases,
generalizing to both smartphone and lab captured images. The multitask model
contributes to the lightweight nature of the pipeline, making it five times
computationally efficient compared to having five individual models

TL;DR: The paper introduces PaPIS, a pathology-aware image quality assessment metric for evaluating virtual staining techniques, showing its effectiveness in capturing histology-relevant details and improving virtual staining models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluation methods for virtual staining rely on metrics like SSIM or subjective expert reviews, which are unsuitable for capturing pathology-relevant features accurately.

Method: The study presents PaPIS, a full-reference image quality assessment metric that uses deep learning-based features focused on cell morphology segmentation and Retinex-like feature decomposition.

Result: PaPIS demonstrates better alignment with pathology-relevant features, outperforms traditional metrics in recognizing subtle histological structures, and enhances the fidelity of virtual staining models when used as a loss function.

Conclusion: PaPIS addresses the limitations of current evaluation methods, offering a specialized and effective solution for the pathology-specific assessment of virtual staining technologies towards clinical application.

Abstract: Virtual staining has emerged as a powerful alternative to traditional
histopathological staining techniques, enabling rapid, reagent-free image
transformations. However, existing evaluation methods predominantly rely on
full-reference image quality assessment (FR-IQA) metrics such as structural
similarity, which are originally designed for natural images and often fail to
capture pathology-relevant features. Expert pathology reviews have also been
used, but they are inherently subjective and time-consuming.
  In this study, we introduce PaPIS (Pathology-Aware Perceptual Image
Similarity), a novel FR-IQA metric specifically tailored for virtual staining
evaluation. PaPIS leverages deep learning-based features trained on cell
morphology segmentation and incorporates Retinex-inspired feature decomposition
to better reflect histological perceptual quality. Comparative experiments
demonstrate that PaPIS more accurately aligns with pathology-relevant visual
cues and distinguishes subtle cellular structures that traditional and existing
perceptual metrics tend to overlook. Furthermore, integrating PaPIS as a
guiding loss function in a virtual staining model leads to improved
histological fidelity.

*Rajesh Sureddi,Saman Zadtootaghaj,Nabajeet Barman,Alan C. Bovik*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper presents a novel no-reference image quality assessment (NR-IQA) model using a custom dataset and contrastive triplet-based learning for efficient and generalized perceptual quality prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The limited availability of subjectively labeled data for NR-IQA tasks and reliance on pre-training necessitated the exploration of more efficient approaches.

Method: The approach uses a custom dataset with reference content images and training with contrastive triplet-based learning, combining both content and quality features.

Result: The proposed model showed strong generalization performance across publicly available datasets, despite using fewer training samples.

Conclusion: Contrastive triplet-based learning is effective for NR-IQA models, allowing efficient training and high performance without large-scale datasets.

Abstract: Image Quality Assessment (IQA) models aim to predict perceptual image quality
in alignment with human judgments. No-Reference (NR) IQA remains particularly
challenging due to the absence of a reference image. While deep learning has
significantly advanced this field, a major hurdle in developing NR-IQA models
is the limited availability of subjectively labeled data. Most existing deep
learning-based NR-IQA approaches rely on pre-training on large-scale datasets
before fine-tuning for IQA tasks. To further advance progress in this area, we
propose a novel approach that constructs a custom dataset using a limited
number of reference content images and introduces a no-reference IQA model that
incorporates both content and quality features for perceptual quality
prediction. Specifically, we train a quality-aware model using contrastive
triplet-based learning, enabling efficient training with fewer samples while
achieving strong generalization performance across publicly available datasets.

TL;DR: The paper presents Pixel Perfect MegaMed, a vision-language model for generating ultra-high-resolution medical images (1024x1024), designed to preserve clinical details.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing generative models like GANs and VAEs struggle to maintain the fine-grained details essential for accurate medical diagnosis in image synthesis.

Method: The proposed model employs a multi-scale transformer architecture and vision-language alignment techniques tailored to medical terminology to generate clinically faithful high-resolution medical images.

Result: Pixel Perfect MegaMed successfully generates detailed medical images from text prompts using the CheXpert dataset, improving downstream tasks like classification and data augmentation in low-data scenarios.

Conclusion: Pixel Perfect MegaMed sets a new benchmark for medical image synthesis by combining ultra-high resolution, clinical faithfulness, and utility for tasks like data augmentation.

Abstract: Medical image synthesis presents unique challenges due to the inherent
complexity and high-resolution details required in clinical contexts.
Traditional generative architectures such as Generative Adversarial Networks
(GANs) or Variational Auto Encoder (VAEs) have shown great promise for
high-resolution image generation but struggle with preserving fine-grained
details that are key for accurate diagnosis. To address this issue, we
introduce Pixel Perfect MegaMed, the first vision-language foundation model to
synthesize images at resolutions of 1024x1024. Our method deploys a multi-scale
transformer architecture designed specifically for ultra-high resolution
medical image generation, enabling the preservation of both global anatomical
context and local image-level details. By leveraging vision-language alignment
techniques tailored to medical terminology and imaging modalities, Pixel
Perfect MegaMed bridges the gap between textual descriptions and visual
representations at unprecedented resolution levels. We apply our model to the
CheXpert dataset and demonstrate its ability to generate clinically faithful
chest X-rays from text prompts. Beyond visual quality, these high-resolution
synthetic images prove valuable for downstream tasks such as classification,
showing measurable performance gains when used for data augmentation,
particularly in low-data regimes. Our code is accessible through the project

*Caixia Dong,Duwei Dai,Xinyi Han,Fan Liu,Xu Yang,Zongfang Li,Songhua Xu*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel coronary artery segmentation framework that combines vision transformer (ViT) and convolutional neural network (CNN) encoders with advanced feature fusion and uncertainty refinement modules, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate segmentation of coronary arteries is essential for improving diagnosis of coronary artery disease (CAD), but challenges exist due to arteries' small size, complex shapes, and low contrast with surrounding tissues.

Method: The framework leverages a vision foundation model with a dual encoding setup: ViT for global structure features enhanced with an attention-guided module and CNN for local details. Features are fused using cross-branch variational fusion (CVF). An evidential-learning uncertainty refinement (EUR) module refines uncertain areas using evidence theory, multi-scale aggregation, and attention mechanisms.

Result: The proposed model demonstrates significantly improved segmentation accuracy over state-of-the-art methods across one in-house and two public datasets, showing strong generalization abilities.

Conclusion: The novel framework effectively tackles challenges in coronary artery segmentation with its multi-modality encoding, advanced fusion, and uncertainty refinement techniques, proving to be a promising tool for CAD diagnosis.

Abstract: Accurate coronary artery segmentation is critical for computeraided diagnosis
of coronary artery disease (CAD), yet it remains challenging due to the small
size, complex morphology, and low contrast with surrounding tissues. To address
these challenges, we propose a novel segmentation framework that leverages the
power of vision foundation models (VFMs) through a parallel encoding
architecture. Specifically, a vision transformer (ViT) encoder within the VFM
captures global structural features, enhanced by the activation of the final
two ViT blocks and the integration of an attention-guided enhancement (AGE)
module, while a convolutional neural network (CNN) encoder extracts local
details. These complementary features are adaptively fused using a cross-branch
variational fusion (CVF) module, which models latent distributions and applies
variational attention to assign modality-specific weights. Additionally, we
introduce an evidential-learning uncertainty refinement (EUR) module, which
quantifies uncertainty using evidence theory and refines uncertain regions by
incorporating multi-scale feature aggregation and attention mechanisms, further
enhancing segmentation accuracy. Extensive evaluations on one in-house and two
public datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving superior performance in
accurate coronary artery segmentation and showcasing strong generalization
across multiple datasets. The code is available at

*Jinseo An,Min Jin Lee,Kyu Won Shim,Helen Hong*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new framework using a conditional Bernoulli diffusion model for accurate segmentation of orbital bones in facial CT images, overcoming challenges such as ambiguous boundaries and thin structures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Creating accurate orbital bone segmentations is crucial for custom implant design in reconstruction surgeries, a highly challenging task due to ambiguous boundaries and delicate structures.

Method: A conditional Bernoulli diffusion model is trained with diverse annotations to generate multiple segmentations, which are corrected using a consensus-based approach considering positioning, consensus, and gradient similarity.

Result: The method significantly improves recall in ambiguous regions, maintains the continuity of thin structures, and outperforms existing segmentation frameworks.

Conclusion: This approach automates segmentation corrections, offers better accuracy, and can be used in image-guided surgical planning and surgeries for orbital bones.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of orbital bones in facial computed tomography (CT)
images is essential for the creation of customized implants for reconstruction
of defected orbital bones, particularly challenging due to the ambiguous
boundaries and thin structures such as the orbital medial wall and orbital
floor. In these ambiguous regions, existing segmentation approaches often
output disconnected or under-segmented results. We propose a novel framework
that corrects segmentation results by leveraging consensus from multiple
diffusion model outputs. Our approach employs a conditional Bernoulli diffusion
model trained on diverse annotation patterns per image to generate multiple
plausible segmentations, followed by a consensus-driven correction that
incorporates position proximity, consensus level, and gradient direction
similarity to correct challenging regions. Experimental results demonstrate
that our method outperforms existing methods, significantly improving recall in
ambiguous regions while preserving the continuity of thin structures.
Furthermore, our method automates the manual process of segmentation result
correction and can be applied to image-guided surgical planning and surgery.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper introduces fastWDM3D, a model for fast and accurate 3D healthy tissue inpainting using a wavelet diffusion model. It's 800x faster than comparable methods while achieving high performance metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for efficient and accurate healthy tissue inpainting for applications like tumor growth modeling and image registration.

Method: Adaptation of denoising diffusion probabilistic models with a variance-preserving noise schedule for 3D image generation, without adversarial training. They applied these findings to the 3D wavelet diffusion model architecture.

Result: The fastWDM3D model achieved a SSIM of 0.8571, MSE of 0.0079, and PSNR of 22.26 on a test set, completing inpainting in 1.81s per image using two time steps.

Conclusion: fastWDM3D is a highly efficient and accurate alternative for 3D healthy tissue inpainting, overcoming sampling speed limitations from prior models while maintaining superior results.

Abstract: Healthy tissue inpainting has significant applications, including the
generation of pseudo-healthy baselines for tumor growth models and the
facilitation of image registration. In previous editions of the BraTS Local
Synthesis of Healthy Brain Tissue via Inpainting Challenge, denoising diffusion
probabilistic models (DDPMs) demonstrated qualitatively convincing results but
suffered from low sampling speed. To mitigate this limitation, we adapted a 2D
image generation approach, combining DDPMs with generative adversarial networks
(GANs) and employing a variance-preserving noise schedule, for the task of 3D
inpainting. Our experiments showed that the variance-preserving noise schedule
and the selected reconstruction losses can be effectively utilized for
high-quality 3D inpainting in a few time steps without requiring adversarial
training. We applied our findings to a different architecture, a 3D wavelet
diffusion model (WDM3D) that does not include a GAN component. The resulting
model, denoted as fastWDM3D, obtained a SSIM of 0.8571, a MSE of 0.0079, and a
PSNR of 22.26 on the BraTS inpainting test set. Remarkably, it achieved these
scores using only two time steps, completing the 3D inpainting process in 1.81
s per image. When compared to other DDPMs used for healthy brain tissue
inpainting, our model is up to 800 x faster while still achieving superior
performance metrics. Our proposed method, fastWDM3D, represents a promising
approach for fast and accurate healthy tissue inpainting. Our code is available

### [303] [SpectraLift: Physics-Guided Spectral-Inversion Network for Self-Supervised Hyperspectral Image Super-Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13339)
*Ritik Shah,Marco F. Duarte*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SpectraLift, a fully self-supervised framework for fusing low-resolution hyperspectral (LR-HSI) with high-resolution multispectral (HR-MSI) images without requiring impractical calibrations like PSF or HR-HSI ground truth.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to obtain high-spatial-resolution hyperspectral images (HSI) in applications like remote sensing is hindered by the inherent trade-off between spatial detail and spectral richness in HSI sensors. Existing methods require impractical PSF calibrations or HR-HSI ground truth.

Method: SpectraLift is a self-supervised learning approach that combines LR-HSI and HR-MSI data using the spectral response function (SRF). It trains a lightweight per-pixel MLP network by generating synthetic data and optimizing spectral reconstruction through an ℓ1 loss.

Result: The proposed method, SpectraLift, achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art techniques in PSNR, SAM, SSIM, and RMSE benchmarks, while being independent of spatial resolution and blur.

Conclusion: SpectraLift is a fast, efficient, and practical solution for HSI-MSI fusion, providing high-resolution hyperspectral images without requiring extensive calibration or ground truth data.

Abstract: High-spatial-resolution hyperspectral images (HSI) are essential for
applications such as remote sensing and medical imaging, yet HSI sensors
inherently trade spatial detail for spectral richness. Fusing
high-spatial-resolution multispectral images (HR-MSI) with
low-spatial-resolution hyperspectral images (LR-HSI) is a promising route to
recover fine spatial structures without sacrificing spectral fidelity. Most
state-of-the-art methods for HSI-MSI fusion demand point spread function (PSF)
calibration or ground truth high resolution HSI (HR-HSI), both of which are
impractical to obtain in real world settings. We present SpectraLift, a fully
self-supervised framework that fuses LR-HSI and HR-MSI inputs using only the
MSI's Spectral Response Function (SRF). SpectraLift trains a lightweight
per-pixel multi-layer perceptron (MLP) network using ($i$)~a synthetic
low-spatial-resolution multispectral image (LR-MSI) obtained by applying the
SRF to the LR-HSI as input, ($ii$)~the LR-HSI as the output, and ($iii$)~an
$\ell_1$ spectral reconstruction loss between the estimated and true LR-HSI as
the optimization objective. At inference, SpectraLift uses the trained network
to map the HR-MSI pixel-wise into a HR-HSI estimate. SpectraLift converges in
minutes, is agnostic to spatial blur and resolution, and outperforms
state-of-the-art methods on PSNR, SAM, SSIM, and RMSE benchmarks.

*Yufeng Luo,Adam D. Myers,Alex Drlica-Wagner,Dario Dematties,Salma Borchani,Frank Valdes,Arjun Dey,David Schlegel,Rongpu Zhou,DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys Team*

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: The paper presents an automated method using machine learning to detect poor-quality exposures in astronomical imaging surveys.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional visual inspection methods are impractical due to the increasing data volume in astronomical imaging surveys.

Method: The paper uses a semi-supervised pipeline with a vision transformer trained via self-supervised learning and a k-Nearest Neighbor classifier.

Result: The pipeline successfully identifies 780 problematic exposures in DECaLS Data Release 11, verified through visual inspection.

Conclusion: The developed method is efficient, accurate, and scalable for quality control in large imaging surveys.

Abstract: As the data volume of astronomical imaging surveys rapidly increases,
traditional methods for image anomaly detection, such as visual inspection by
human experts, are becoming impractical. We introduce a machine-learning-based
approach to detect poor-quality exposures in large imaging surveys, with a
focus on the DECam Legacy Survey (DECaLS) in regions of low extinction (i.e.,
$E(B-V)<0.04$). Our semi-supervised pipeline integrates a vision transformer
(ViT), trained via self-supervised learning (SSL), with a k-Nearest Neighbor
(kNN) classifier. We train and validate our pipeline using a small set of
labeled exposures observed by surveys with the Dark Energy Camera (DECam). A
clustering-space analysis of where our pipeline places images labeled in
``good'' and ``bad'' categories suggests that our approach can efficiently and
accurately determine the quality of exposures. Applied to new imaging being
reduced for DECaLS Data Release 11, our pipeline identifies 780 problematic
exposures, which we subsequently verify through visual inspection. Being highly
efficient and adaptable, our method offers a scalable solution for quality
control in other large imaging surveys.

TL;DR: The paper proposes an advanced symbolic regression technique using exhaustive search and the minimum description length principle to resolve issues in finding reliable and well-justified functions, showcasing success in astrophysics applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome challenges in traditional symbolic regression algorithms, which include unreliable function discovery and poorly-justified assumptions in function selection.

Method: Introduced an exhaustive search combining accuracy and complexity evaluation via the minimum description length principle, integrating both metrics in units of information.

Result: Demonstrated success on three astrophysics problems, discovering functions that outperform existing literature standards for the universe's expansion history, galaxy gravity behaviour, and inflaton field potential.

Conclusion: The proposed methodology is robust, general-purpose, and has potential for widespread application in various scientific fields and beyond, outperforming traditional approaches.

Abstract: Symbolic regression is the machine learning method for learning functions
from data. After a brief overview of the symbolic regression landscape, I will
describe the two main challenges that traditional algorithms face: they have an
unknown (and likely significant) probability of failing to find any given good
function, and they suffer from ambiguity and poorly-justified assumptions in
their function-selection procedure. To address these I propose an exhaustive
search and model selection by the minimum description length principle, which
allows accuracy and complexity to be directly traded off by measuring each in
units of information. I showcase the resulting publicly available Exhaustive
Symbolic Regression algorithm on three open problems in astrophysics: the
expansion history of the universe, the effective behaviour of gravity in
galaxies and the potential of the inflaton field. In each case the algorithm
identifies many functions superior to the literature standards. This general
purpose methodology should find widespread utility in science and beyond.

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: This paper analyzes software quality issues in intermediate-level object-oriented programming projects developed by students and provides insights for improving Software Engineering curricula.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of focus on software quality in programming and software engineering courses and provide educators with guidance on prioritizing quality aspects for intermediate-level students.

Method: The authors analyze 83 object-oriented team projects from 172 university students in an Object-Oriented Programming course, using static analysis tools (SonarQube and ArchUnit) to identify code smells and architectural anti-patterns.

Result: The analysis reveals recurring software quality issues and challenges faced by students at the intermediate level, offering concrete insights for improving education practices.

Conclusion: The paper highlights the importance of focusing on software quality in Software Engineering courses and provides educators with evidence-based recommendations to enhance curricula.

Abstract: When teaching Programming and Software Engineering in Bachelor's Degree
programs, the emphasis on creating functional software projects often
overshadows the focus on software quality, a trend that aligns with ACM
curricula recommendations. Software Engineering courses are typically
introduced later in the curriculum, and can generally allocate only limited
time to quality-related topics, leaving educators with the challenge of
deciding which quality aspects to prioritize. In this decision, the literature
offers limited guidance, as most existing studies focus on code written by
novice students and small code units, making it unclear whether those findings
extend to intermediate-level students with foundational object-oriented
programming skills working on more complex software projects. To address this
gap, we analyze 83 object-oriented team projects developed by 172 university
students across 4 different editions of the Object-Oriented Programming course.
We apply a static analysis pipeline used in prior research to assess software
quality, combining SonarQube and ArchUnit to detect code smells and
architectural anti-patterns. Our findings highlight recurring quality issues
and offer concrete evidence of the challenges students face at this stage,
providing valuable guidance for educators aiming to continuously improve
Software Engineering curricula and promote quality-oriented development
practices.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore if LLMs can realistically simulate student code as observed in introductory programming courses.

Method: By fine-tuning LLMs using timestamped student submissions and evaluating generated code semantically, functionally, and stylistically.

Result: Fine-tuned models better replicate student trajectories, errors, progress, and style variations.

Conclusion: Capturing realistic student code generation requires temporal modeling, context-awareness, and multi-dimensional evaluation.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong performance on programming
tasks, but can they generate student-like code like real students - imperfect,
iterative, and stylistically diverse? We present ParaStudent, a systematic
study of LLM-based "student-like" code generation in an introductory
programming course setting. Using a dataset of timestamped student submissions
across multiple semesters, we design low- and high-resolution experiments to
model student progress and evaluate code outputs along semantic, functional,
and stylistic dimensions. Our results show that fine-tuning significantly
improves alignment with real student trajectories and captures error patterns,
incremental improvements, and stylistic variations more faithfully. This study
shows that modeling realistic student code requires capturing learning dynamics
through context-aware generation, temporal modeling, and multi-dimensional
evaluation. Code for experiments and evaluation is available at

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Contextual Copyleft AI (CCAI) license to extend traditional copyleft principles in the FOSS community to generative AI systems, evaluating its legal, policy, and practical implications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in the FOSS community regarding the application of copyleft principles to AI models trained on open source code.

Method: A three-part evaluation framework assesses the CCAI license's legal feasibility, policy justification, and cross-contextual benefits and risks.

Result: The CCAI license enhances developer control, incentivizes open source AI development, and mitigates openwashing practices while highlighting risks like potential misuse.

Conclusion: The CCAI license can effectively preserve FOSS principles in generative AI development when paired with complementary regulatory measures.

Abstract: The proliferation of generative AI systems has created new challenges for the
Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) community, particularly regarding how
traditional copyleft principles should apply when open source code is used to
train AI models. This article introduces the Contextual Copyleft AI (CCAI)
license, a novel licensing mechanism that extends copyleft requirements from
training data to the resulting generative AI models. The CCAI license offers
significant advantages, including enhanced developer control, incentivization
of open source AI development, and mitigation of openwashing practices. This is
demonstrated through a structured three-part evaluation framework that examines
(1) legal feasibility under current copyright law, (2) policy justification
comparing traditional software and AI contexts, and (3) synthesis of
cross-contextual benefits and risks. However, the increased risk profile of
open source AI, particularly the potential for direct misuse, necessitates
complementary regulatory approaches to achieve an appropriate risk-benefit
balance. The paper concludes that when implemented within a robust regulatory
environment focused on responsible AI usage, the CCAI license provides a viable
mechanism for preserving and adapting core FOSS principles to the evolving
landscape of generative AI development.

TL;DR: The paper proposes an efficient method for audio coding tailored for machines, emphasizing ultra-low bitrates and maintaining downstream model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard neural audio codecs prioritize human perception, but machine tasks require efficient compression with strong task performance despite perceptual compromises.

Method: The authors integrate task-specific loss guidance with residual vector quantization (RVQ) to compress and quantize intermediate features of pretrained downstream audio models.

Result: The method achieves ultra-low bitrates (sub-200 bps) while maintaining minimal loss in model performance, demonstrating adaptability across tasks and bitrates.

Conclusion: The approach offers a novel ACoM method suitable for diverse tasks, architectures, and deployment scenarios, paving the way for efficient machine-centric audio compression.

Abstract: Neural audio codecs, leveraging quantization algorithms, have significantly
impacted various speech/audio tasks. While high-fidelity reconstruction is
paramount for human perception, audio coding for machines (ACoM) prioritizes
efficient compression and downstream task performance, disregarding perceptual
nuances. This work introduces an efficient ACoM method that can compress and
quantize any chosen intermediate feature representation of an already trained
speech/audio downstream model. Our approach employs task-specific loss guidance
alongside residual vector quantization (RVQ) losses, providing ultra-low
bitrates (i.e., less than 200 bps) with a minimal loss of the downstream model
performance. The resulting tokenizer is adaptable to various bitrates and model
sizes for flexible deployment. Evaluated on automatic speech recognition and
audio classification, our method demonstrates its efficacy and potential for
broader task and architectural applicability through appropriate

Motivation: To address the computational demands of traditional methods like finite differences and finite elements in real-time audio applications by exploring neural network alternatives.

Method: Comparative analysis of state-of-the-art neural network models, trained on short sequences, to predict long sequences in an autoregressive manner.

Result: The analysis highlights limitations of current models and emphasizes why prediction error in the time domain is insufficient.

Conclusion: Neural network methods have potential but require further improvement for practical use in nonlinear vibration modeling and real-time audio synthesis.

Abstract: Physical modelling synthesis aims to generate audio from physical simulations

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper introduces SHIELD, a method to counteract anti-forensic (AF) attacks on deepfake audio, achieving robust detection results despite generative attack methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the vulnerability of existing deepfake audio detection systems to anti-forensic (AF) attacks, which threaten the integrity of audio-based applications by enabling the spread of misinformation.

Method: The method integrates an auxiliary defense generative model for collaborative learning and implements a triplet model to uncover correlations between real, AF-attacked, and generated audio. This approach reinforces the detection capabilities against generative AF attacks.

Result: SHIELD significantly improves resilience, maintaining detection accuracy even under AF attack scenarios: 98.13%–99.57% in match and 98.62%–98.85% in mismatch settings across three datasets, outperforming other frameworks whose accuracy dropped dramatically under AF attacks.

Conclusion: SHIELD effectively mitigates the impact of AF attacks on deepfake audio detection, demonstrating robust performance against a variety of generative models and environmental settings.

Abstract: Audio plays a crucial role in applications like speaker verification,
voice-enabled smart devices, and audio conferencing. However, audio
manipulations, such as deepfakes, pose significant risks by enabling the spread
of misinformation. Our empirical analysis reveals that existing methods for
detecting deepfake audio are often vulnerable to anti-forensic (AF) attacks,
particularly those attacked using generative adversarial networks. In this
article, we propose a novel collaborative learning method called SHIELD to
defend against generative AF attacks. To expose AF signatures, we integrate an
auxiliary generative model, called the defense (DF) generative model, which
facilitates collaborative learning by combining input and output. Furthermore,
we design a triplet model to capture correlations for real and AF attacked
audios with real-generated and attacked-generated audios using auxiliary
generative models. The proposed SHIELD strengthens the defense against
generative AF attacks and achieves robust performance across various generative
models. The proposed AF significantly reduces the average detection accuracy
from 95.49% to 59.77% for ASVspoof2019, from 99.44% to 38.45% for In-the-Wild,
and from 98.41% to 51.18% for HalfTruth for three different generative models.
The proposed SHIELD mechanism is robust against AF attacks and achieves an
average accuracy of 98.13%, 98.58%, and 99.57% in match, and 98.78%, 98.62%,
and 98.85% in mismatch settings for the ASVspoof2019, In-the-Wild, and
HalfTruth datasets, respectively.

Result: The proposed hybrid method performs better than single querying methods in simulations and real-world experiments with volunteers evaluating music and speech audio.

Conclusion: Hybrid querying is a promising approach in black-box optimization, offering broader applicability beyond audio personalization.

Abstract: We consider the problem of personalizing audio to maximize user experience.
Briefly, we aim to find a filter $h^*$, which applied to any music or speech,
will maximize the user's satisfaction. This is a black-box optimization problem
since the user's satisfaction function is unknown. Substantive work has been
done on this topic where the key idea is to play audio samples to the user,
each shaped by a different filter $h_i$, and query the user for their
satisfaction scores $f(h_i)$. A family of ``surrogate" functions is then
designed to fit these scores and the optimization method gradually refines
these functions to arrive at the filter $\hat{h}^*$ that maximizes
satisfaction. In certain applications, we observe that a second type of
querying is possible where users can tell us the individual elements $h^*[j]$
of the optimal filter $h^*$. Consider an analogy from cooking where the goal is
to cook a recipe that maximizes user satisfaction. A user can be asked to score
various cooked recipes (e.g., tofu fried rice) or to score individual
ingredients (say, salt, sugar, rice, chicken, etc.). Given a budget of $B$
queries, where a query can be of either type, our goal is to find the recipe
that will maximize this user's satisfaction. Our proposal builds on Sparse
Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) and shows how a hybrid approach can
outperform any one type of querying. Our results are validated through
simulations and real world experiments, where volunteers gave feedback on
music/speech audio and were able to achieve high satisfaction levels. We
believe this idea of hybrid querying opens new problems in black-box
optimization and solutions can benefit other applications beyond audio
personalization.

### [313] [Autoregressive Speech Enhancement via Acoustic Tokens](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12825)
*Luca Della Libera,Cem Subakan,Mirco Ravanelli*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The study explores improving real-world speech enhancement using discrete acoustic tokens and introduces an autoregressive transducer model, showing advancements but points out limitations compared to continuous methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving the quality and intelligibility of speech while addressing limitations like loss of acoustic details and conditional independence assumptions in previous research.

Method: 1) Evaluate acoustic tokens performance in speech enhancement under varying conditions. 2) Develop a transducer-based autoregressive architecture.

Result: Acoustic tokens preserve speaker identity better than semantic tokens. Autoregressive modeling further enhances performance but discrete representations are inferior to continuous ones.

Conclusion: Discrete representations are promising for speech enhancement but require further development to match continuous methods, with autoregressive designs showing potential for improvement.

Abstract: In speech processing pipelines, improving the quality and intelligibility of
real-world recordings is crucial. While supervised regression is the primary
method for speech enhancement, audio tokenization is emerging as a promising
alternative for a smooth integration with other modalities. However, research
on speech enhancement using discrete representations is still limited. Previous
work has mainly focused on semantic tokens, which tend to discard key acoustic
details such as speaker identity. Additionally, these studies typically employ
non-autoregressive models, assuming conditional independence of outputs and
overlooking the potential improvements offered by autoregressive modeling. To
address these gaps we: 1) conduct a comprehensive study of the performance of
acoustic tokens for speech enhancement, including the effect of bitrate and
noise strength; 2) introduce a novel transducer-based autoregressive
architecture specifically designed for this task. Experiments on VoiceBank and
Libri1Mix datasets show that acoustic tokens outperform semantic tokens in
terms of preserving speaker identity, and that our autoregressive approach can
further improve performance. Nevertheless, we observe that discrete
representations still fall short compared to continuous ones, highlighting the
need for further research in this area.

### [315] [Stochastic Weakly Convex Optimization Under Heavy-Tailed Noises](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13283)
*Tianxi Zhu,Yi Xu,Xiangyang Ji*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: This study investigates stochastic first-order methods (SFOMs) under sub-Weibull and $p$-bounded central moment (BCM) gradient noises, focusing on weakly convex optimization, with analyses on convergence properties for stochastic subgradient descent.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning training often involves gradient noises, and better understanding their behavior under scenarios like heavy tails or weak convexity can enhance optimization processes.

Method: The authors analyze vanilla stochastic subgradient descent (SsGD) under sub-Weibull noises and clipped SsGD under $p$-BCM noises, providing theoretical insights in both high-probability and in-expectation convergence for weakly convex objectives.

Result: The study finds no degradation in vanilla SsGD's theoretical performance under sub-Weibull noise compared to smooth objectives, and clipped SGD performs consistently under $p$-BCM noise in weakly convex settings, though with worse sample complexity than expected for smooth optimization.

Conclusion: Both sub-Weibull and $p$-BCM noise scenarios are manageable in weakly convex settings, but challenges remain, such as sample complexity under $p$-BCM noise.

Abstract: An increasing number of studies have focused on stochastic first-order
methods (SFOMs) under heavy-tailed gradient noises, which have been observed in
the training of practical deep learning models. In this paper, we focus on two
types of gradient noises: one is sub-Weibull noise, and the other is noise
under the assumption that it has a bounded $p$-th central moment ($p$-BCM) with
$p\in (1, 2]$. The latter is more challenging due to the occurrence of infinite
variance when $p\in (1, 2)$. Under these two gradient noise assumptions, the
in-expectation and high-probability convergence of SFOMs have been extensively
studied in the contexts of convex optimization and standard smooth
optimization. However, for weakly convex objectives-a class that includes all
Lipschitz-continuous convex objectives and smooth objectives-our understanding
of the in-expectation and high-probability convergence of SFOMs under these two
types of noises remains incomplete. We investigate the high-probability
convergence of the vanilla stochastic subgradient descent (SsGD) method under
sub-Weibull noises, as well as the high-probability and in-expectation
convergence of clipped SsGD under the $p$-BCM noises. Both analyses are
conducted in the context of weakly convex optimization. For weakly convex
objectives that may be non-convex and non-smooth, our results demonstrate that
the theoretical dependence of vanilla SsGD on the failure probability and
number of iterations under sub-Weibull noises does not degrade compared to the
case of smooth objectives. Under $p$-BCM noises, our findings indicate that the
non-smoothness and non-convexity of weakly convex objectives do not impact the
theoretical dependence of clipped SGD on the failure probability relative to
the smooth case; however, the sample complexity we derived is worse than a
well-known lower bound for smooth optimization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to extend properties of linear algebra to third-order tensors to address semidefinite programming in a setting influenced by underlying group representations.

Method: They use the $\star_M$-family of tensor-tensor products and representation theory of group actions to construct invariant semidefinite programs.

Result: The framework characterizes certain nonnegative quadratic forms and provides solutions to low-rank tensor completion problems.

Conclusion: The $\star_M$-framework offers a structured approach to address semidefinite programming and tensor-related problems in a natural tensorial context informed by group actions.

Abstract: The $\star_M$-family of tensor-tensor products is a framework which
generalizes many properties from linear algebra to third order tensors. Here,
we investigate positive semidefiniteness and semidefinite programming under the
$\star_M$-product. Critical to our investigation is a connection between the
choice of matrix M in the $\star_M$-product and the representation theory of an
underlying group action. Using this framework, third order tensors equipped
with the $\star_M$-product are a natural setting for the study of invariant
semidefinite programs. As applications of the M-SDP framework, we provide a
characterization of certain nonnegative quadratic forms and solve low-rank
tensor completion problems.

*Janis Auffenberg,Jonas Bresch,Oleh Melnyk,Gabriele Steidl*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: The paper investigates unsupervised metric learning through optimal transport (OT) cost matrices, proposing new algorithms and exploring alternative distance measures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in unsupervised data classification without labeled samples by improving metric learning techniques.

Method: Study convergence algorithms like stochastic random function iteration and introduce Mahalanobis-like distances and graph Laplacians.

Result: Proposed algorithms showed linear convergence, and new approaches simplified computations by leveraging linear algebra.

Conclusion: The findings enhance unsupervised metric learning, establishing novel methods with practical computational benefits.

Abstract: Data classification without access to labeled samples remains a challenging
problem. It usually depends on an appropriately chosen distance between
features, a topic addressed in metric learning. Recently, Huizing, Cantini and
Peyr\'e proposed to simultaneously learn optimal transport (OT) cost matrices
between samples and features of the dataset. This leads to the task of finding
positive eigenvectors of a certain nonlinear function that maps cost matrices
to OT distances. Having this basic idea in mind, we consider both the
algorithmic and the modeling part of unsupervised metric learning. First, we
examine appropriate algorithms and their convergence. In particular, we propose
to use the stochastic random function iteration algorithm and prove that it
converges linearly for our setting, although our operators are not
paracontractive as it was required for convergence so far. Second, we ask the
natural question if the OT distance can be replaced by other distances. We show
how Mahalanobis-like distances fit into our considerations. Further, we examine
an approach via graph Laplacians. In contrast to the previous settings, we have
just to deal with linear functions in the wanted matrices here, so that simple
algorithms from linear algebra can be applied.

*Sheng Liu,Panos Papadimitratos*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: Federated Learning (FL) in autonomous driving faces vulnerabilities such as Targeted Label Flipping Attacks (TLFAs), which compromise safety; the paper proposes FLARE as a defense.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the safety and robustness of FL-based Road Condition Classification (RCC) systems against new adversarial vulnerabilities like TLFAs.

Method: The approach involves revealing system vulnerabilities, quantifying safety risks using a label-distance metric, and introducing FLARE, a defense mechanism leveraging neuron-wise output layer analysis.

Result: Experiments demonstrate the severe impact of TLFAs on FL-RCC systems and validate that FLARE effectively mitigates attack consequences across multiple setups.

Conclusion: FL systems for RCC are vulnerable to TLFAs, but FLARE successfully mitigates these threats, improving safety and system reliability.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a promising solution for
privacy-preserving autonomous driving, specifically camera-based Road Condition
Classification (RCC) systems, harnessing distributed sensing, computing, and
communication resources on board vehicles without sharing sensitive image data.
However, the collaborative nature of FL-RCC frameworks introduces new
vulnerabilities: Targeted Label Flipping Attacks (TLFAs), in which malicious
clients (vehicles) deliberately alter their training data labels to compromise
the learned model inference performance. Such attacks can, e.g., cause a
vehicle to mis-classify slippery, dangerous road conditions as pristine and
exceed recommended speed. However, TLFAs for FL-based RCC systems are largely
missing. We address this challenge with a threefold contribution: 1) we
disclose the vulnerability of existing FL-RCC systems to TLFAs; 2) we introduce
a novel label-distance-based metric to precisely quantify the safety risks
posed by TLFAs; and 3) we propose FLARE, a defensive mechanism leveraging
neuron-wise analysis of the output layer to mitigate TLFA effects. Extensive
experiments across three RCC tasks, four evaluation metrics, six baselines, and
three deep learning models demonstrate both the severity of TLFAs on FL-RCC
systems and the effectiveness of FLARE in mitigating the attack impact.

*Jeremy McHugh,Kristina Šekrst,Jon Cefalu*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper discusses advanced prompt injection attacks (Prompt Injection 2.0) combining with traditional vulnerabilities, posing significant security threats to AI-integrated systems, highlighting new mitigation strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the growing security vulnerabilities posed by advanced prompt injection attacks, especially in the context of agentic AI systems that interact with traditional security frameworks.

Method: The paper presents an analysis of how modern prompt injection attacks integrate with web vulnerabilities like XSS and CSRF. It evaluates Preamble's prior mitigation technologies against emerging hybrid threats and benchmarks the failure of traditional web security measures against these AI-enhanced attacks.

Result: The study highlights that traditional security tools such as web application firewalls and XSS/CSRF protections are ineffective against advanced, AI-enhanced attacks. It identifies gaps in current security provisions and proposes novel architectural solutions.

Conclusion: Prompt Injection 2.0 represents a significant evolution in AI security risks. Effective risk mitigation requires combining architectural strategies like prompt isolation, runtime security, privilege separation, and advanced threat detection mechanisms.

Abstract: Prompt injection attacks, where malicious input is designed to manipulate AI
systems into ignoring their original instructions and following unauthorized
commands instead, were first discovered by Preamble, Inc. in May 2022 and
responsibly disclosed to OpenAI. Over the last three years, these attacks have
continued to pose a critical security threat to LLM-integrated systems. The
emergence of agentic AI systems, where LLMs autonomously perform multistep
tasks through tools and coordination with other agents, has fundamentally
transformed the threat landscape. Modern prompt injection attacks can now
combine with traditional cybersecurity exploits to create hybrid threats that
systematically evade traditional security controls. This paper presents a
comprehensive analysis of Prompt Injection 2.0, examining how prompt injections
integrate with Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF),
and other web security vulnerabilities to bypass traditional security measures.
We build upon Preamble's foundational research and mitigation technologies,
evaluating them against contemporary threats, including AI worms, multi-agent
infections, and hybrid cyber-AI attacks. Our analysis incorporates recent
benchmarks that demonstrate how traditional web application firewalls, XSS
filters, and CSRF tokens fail against AI-enhanced attacks. We also present
architectural solutions that combine prompt isolation, runtime security, and
privilege separation with novel threat detection capabilities.

Main category: cond-mat.mtrl-sci

TL;DR: This paper explores integrating machine learning (ML) models into a traditional density functional theory (DFT) workflow to screen photovoltaic materials, reducing computational costs and associated CO2 emissions while maintaining high accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Density functional theory (DFT) is a standard tool for estimating electronic and optical properties relevant to photovoltaic materials but is computationally expensive and environmentally costly. The paper seeks to address these issues using machine learning as a more efficient alternative.

Method: The study recreates a canonical DFT workflow for estimating photovoltaic efficiency and systematically substitutes parts of it with machine learning surrogates. CO2 emissions and predictive accuracy are evaluated for different hybrid ML/DFT strategies.

Result: The authors identify multiple ML/DFT hybrid methods that balance predictive accuracy and reduced emissions. Direct prediction of scalar quantities by ML models is highlighted as more efficient than using intermediate predictions like absorption spectra. ML models trained on DFT data even outperform DFT workflows using alternative functionals in some cases.

Conclusion: This research demonstrates that ML models can effectively enhance high-throughput, low-emission computational pipelines for the discovery of photovoltaic materials, offering a promising direction for sustainable material screening.

Abstract: Computational screening has become a powerful complement to experimental
efforts in the discovery of high-performance photovoltaic (PV) materials. Most
workflows rely on density functional theory (DFT) to estimate electronic and
optical properties relevant to solar energy conversion. Although more efficient
than laboratory-based methods, DFT calculations still entail substantial
computational and environmental costs. Machine learning (ML) models have
recently gained attention as surrogates for DFT, offering drastic reductions in
resource use with competitive predictive performance. In this study, we
reproduce a canonical DFT-based workflow to estimate the maximum efficiency
limit and progressively replace its components with ML surrogates. By
quantifying the CO$_2$ emissions associated with each computational strategy,
we evaluate the trade-offs between predictive efficacy and environmental cost.
Our results reveal multiple hybrid ML/DFT strategies that optimize different
points along the accuracy--emissions front. We find that direct prediction of
scalar quantities, such as maximum efficiency, is significantly more tractable
than using predicted absorption spectra as an intermediate step. Interestingly,
ML models trained on DFT data can outperform DFT workflows using alternative
exchange--correlation functionals in screening applications, highlighting the
consistency and utility of data-driven approaches. We also assess strategies to
improve ML-driven screening through expanded datasets and improved model
architectures tailored to PV-relevant features. This work provides a
quantitative framework for building low-emission, high-throughput discovery
pipelines.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper introduces GMC, a generative model for multi-target cross-domain recommendation that uses semantically quantized item identifiers for integrating knowledge across domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of improving recommendation performance across multiple, non-overlapping domains where traditional methods relying on shared entities or auxiliary data fall short.

Method: The approach uses a generative model (GMC) that employs an item tokenizer to convert items into domain-shared semantic identifiers, formulates recommendations as a sequential prediction task, and enhances performance with domain-aware contrastive loss and domain-specific fine-tuning.

Result: Experiments on five public datasets show that GMC outperforms existing baseline methods in multi-target cross-domain recommendation scenarios.

Conclusion: GMC effectively leverages generative modeling and cross-domain integration, providing a promising solution to improve MTCDR without heavy reliance on auxiliary data or overlapping domains.

Abstract: Recently, there has been a surge of interest in Multi-Target Cross-Domain
Recommendation (MTCDR), which aims to enhance recommendation performance across
multiple domains simultaneously. Existing MTCDR methods primarily rely on
domain-shared entities (\eg users or items) to fuse and transfer cross-domain
knowledge, which may be unavailable in non-overlapped recommendation scenarios.
Some studies model user preferences and item features as domain-sharable
semantic representations, which can be utilized to tackle the MTCDR task.
Nevertheless, they often require extensive auxiliary data for pre-training.
Developing more effective solutions for MTCDR remains an important area for
further exploration.
  Inspired by recent advancements in generative recommendation, this paper
introduces GMC, a generative paradigm-based approach for multi-target
cross-domain recommendation. The core idea of GMC is to leverage semantically
quantized discrete item identifiers as a medium for integrating multi-domain
knowledge within a unified generative model. GMC first employs an item
tokenizer to generate domain-shared semantic identifiers for each item, and
then formulates item recommendation as a next-token generation task by training
a domain-unified sequence-to-sequence model. To further leverage the domain
information to enhance performance, we incorporate a domain-aware contrastive
loss into the semantic identifier learning, and perform domain-specific
fine-tuning on the unified recommender. Extensive experiments on five public
datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of GMC compared to a range of baseline
methods.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of capturing nuanced public concerns about vaccines on social media, where traditional methods and LLMs fall short.

Method: The paper introduces VaxPulse Query Corner built with the Retrieval-Augmented Generation technique for analyzing vaccine-related discussions from various online platforms.

Result: Tested on 35,103 Shingrix social media posts, the tool demonstrated high effectiveness, with answer faithfulness of 0.96 and relevance of 0.94.

Conclusion: VaxPulse Query Corner offers a valuable approach for public health to monitor vaccine hesitancy, aiding understanding and interventions to boost vaccine confidence.

Abstract: Vaccine hesitancy threatens public health, leading to delayed or rejected
vaccines. Social media is a vital source for understanding public concerns, and
traditional methods like topic modelling often struggle to capture nuanced
opinions. Though trained for query answering, large Language Models (LLMs)
often miss current events and community concerns. Additionally, hallucinations
in LLMs can compromise public health communication. To address these
limitations, we developed a tool (VaxPulse Query Corner) using the Retrieval
Augmented Generation technique. It addresses complex queries about public
vaccine concerns on various online platforms, aiding public health
administrators and stakeholders in understanding public concerns and
implementing targeted interventions to boost vaccine confidence. Analysing
35,103 Shingrix social media posts, it achieved answer faithfulness (0.96) and
relevance (0.94).

Result: The study successfully identified Z/2 eigenfunctions for three scenarios: fixed branch points at tetrahedron and cube vertices, and AI-optimized branch points at vertices of a squashed tetrahedron.

Conclusion: AI, specifically neural networks, can effectively discover and optimize Z/2 eigenfunctions on the 2-sphere, providing new insights into their behavior and configurations.

eigenfunctions for three cases: In the first two cases we fixed the branch
points at the vertices of a tetrahedron and at a cube respectively. In a third
case, we allowed the AI to move the branch points around and, in the end, it
positioned the branch points at the vertices of a squashed tetrahedron.

Motivation: The study aims to explore the viability and societal acceptance of fully autonomous cybernetic avatars as tools to overcome physical limitations.

Method: Researchers conducted a public demonstration and survey involving fully autonomous and semi-autonomous robotic CAs during a public event, analyzing feedback from 2,285 visitors.

Result: Survey participants showed interest in physical support via cybernetic avatars, noting reliability as the main concern, while issues like cost and human-like interaction were less significant.

Conclusion: The study identifies reliability in task execution as a significant hurdle for deploying fully autonomous CAs, highlighting public interest in their potential applications.

Abstract: Cybernetic avatars (CAs) are key components of an avatar-symbiotic society,
enabling individuals to overcome physical limitations through virtual agents
and robotic assistants. While semi-autonomous CAs intermittently require human
teleoperation and supervision, the deployment of fully autonomous CAs remains a
challenge. This study evaluates public perception and potential social impacts
of fully autonomous CAs for physical support in daily life. To this end, we
conducted a large-scale demonstration and survey during Avatar Land, a 19-day
public event in Osaka, Japan, where fully autonomous robotic CAs, alongside
semi-autonomous CAs, performed daily object retrieval tasks. Specifically, we
analyzed responses from 2,285 visitors who engaged with various CAs, including
a subset of 333 participants who interacted with fully autonomous CAs and
shared their perceptions and concerns through a survey questionnaire. The
survey results indicate interest in CAs for physical support in daily life and

Method: The study develops an IVS agent powered by large language models, speech-to-text, text-to-speech, and robotic control, facilitating real-time dialogue in Extended Reality.

Result: The IVS improves operational efficiency, communication clarity, and patient acceptance of robotic ultrasound technology by enabling empathetic and professional interactions.

Conclusion: Integrating IVS into robotic ultrasound systems addresses communication gaps and enhances physician control, patient trust, and acceptance of the technology, marking an important first step towards improved interactions in the field.

Abstract: The advancement and maturity of large language models (LLMs) and robotics
have unlocked vast potential for human-computer interaction, particularly in
the field of robotic ultrasound. While existing research primarily focuses on
either patient-robot or physician-robot interaction, the role of an intelligent
virtual sonographer (IVS) bridging physician-robot-patient communication
remains underexplored. This work introduces a conversational virtual agent in
Extended Reality (XR) that facilitates real-time interaction between
physicians, a robotic ultrasound system(RUS), and patients. The IVS agent
communicates with physicians in a professional manner while offering empathetic
explanations and reassurance to patients. Furthermore, it actively controls the
RUS by executing physician commands and transparently relays these actions to
the patient. By integrating LLM-powered dialogue with speech-to-text,
text-to-speech, and robotic control, our system enhances the efficiency,
clarity, and accessibility of robotic ultrasound acquisition. This work
constitutes a first step toward understanding how IVS can bridge communication
gaps in physician-robot-patient interaction, providing more control and
therefore trust into physician-robot interaction while improving patient
experience and acceptance of robotic ultrasound.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the mismatch between AI agents and the autonomy preferences of older adults, given the increasing reliance on AI in caregiving.

Method: The paper identifies four dimensions of autonomy (decision-making, goal-oriented, control, and social responsibility) by analyzing interdisciplinary research. It proposes future research to enhance agent functionality and ethical adoption.

Result: No experimental results were presented, as the paper focuses on conceptual foundations and directions for future studies.

Conclusion: Aligning AI agents with older adults' autonomy preferences involves ethical integration, task operationalization, and effective measurement strategies, paving the way for responsible AI caregiving solutions.

Abstract: As the global population ages, artificial intelligence (AI)-powered agents
have emerged as potential tools to support older adults' caregiving. Prior
research has explored agent autonomy by identifying key interaction stages in
task processes and defining the agent's role at each stage. However, ensuring
that agents align with older adults' autonomy preferences remains a critical
challenge. Drawing on interdisciplinary conceptualizations of autonomy, this
paper examines four key dimensions of autonomy for older adults:
decision-making autonomy, goal-oriented autonomy, control autonomy, and social
responsibility autonomy. This paper then proposes the following research
directions: (1) Addressing social responsibility autonomy, which concerns the
ethical and social implications of agent use in communal settings; (2)
Operationalizing agent autonomy from the task perspective; and (3) Developing
autonomy measures.

### [328] [Coarse Addition and the St. Petersburg Paradox: A Heuristic Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12475)
*Takashi Izumo*

Main category: econ.TH

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel approach to addressing the St. Petersburg paradox using coarse partitions and a modified addition operation, emphasizing limited cognitive precision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The St. Petersburg paradox has challenged decision theory for centuries, as it highlights a conflict between infinite expected value and finite rational stakes, while traditional solutions invoke assumptions disconnected from actual human perception.

Method: This study introduces a modified method of addition, grouping numerical values into perceptual categories and replacing them with representative elements before adding, which leads to a phenomenon called inertial stabilization.

Result: The authors demonstrate that, under this new framework and suitably constructed partitions, the St. Petersburg series becomes inert, resolving the paradox in this context.

Conclusion: This framework offers a way to model how agents with limited cognitive precision might address divergent reward structures, with potential implications for behavioral modeling and machine reasoning.

Abstract: The St. Petersburg paradox presents a longstanding challenge in decision
theory. It describes a game whose expected value is infinite, yet for which no
rational finite stake can be determined. Traditional solutions introduce
auxiliary assumptions, such as diminishing marginal utility, temporal
discounting, or extended number systems. These methods often involve
mathematical refinements that may not correspond to how people actually
perceive or process numerical information. This paper explores an alternative
approach based on a modified operation of addition defined over coarse
partitions of the outcome space. In this model, exact numerical values are
grouped into perceptual categories, and each value is replaced by a
representative element of its group before being added. This method allows for
a phenomenon where repeated additions eventually cease to affect the outcome, a
behavior described as inertial stabilization. Although this is not intended as
a definitive resolution of the paradox, the proposed framework offers a
plausible way to represent how agents with limited cognitive precision might
handle divergent reward structures. We demonstrate that the St. Petersburg
series can become inert under this coarse addition for a suitably constructed
partition. The approach may also have broader applications in behavioral
modeling and the study of machine reasoning under perceptual limitations.

### [329] [Refining Coarse-Grained Molecular Topologies: A Bayesian Optimization Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02707)
*Pranoy Ray,Adam P. Generale,Nikhith Vankireddy,Yuichiro Asoma,Masataka Nakauchi,Haein Lee,Katsuhisa Yoshida,Yoshishige Okuno,Surya R. Kalidindi*

Main category: physics.chem-ph

TL;DR: The work improves the efficiency and accuracy of Coarse-Grained Molecular Dynamics (CGMD) simulations by refining parameters within the Martini3 framework using Bayesian Optimization, achieving near-All-Atom accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses limitations of Coarse-Grained Molecular Dynamics (CGMD) methods, which lack domain-specific accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency.

Method: The authors refine general-purpose Martini3 topologies, specifically targeting bonded interaction parameters, using Bayesian Optimization to adapt them for domain-specific applications.

Result: The refinement leads to a validated coarse-grained potential that generalizes for any degree of polymerization, achieving a balance between speed and accuracy.

Conclusion: The method bridges the gap between computational efficiency of CGMD and accuracy of All-Atom Molecular Dynamics, enabling faster and more accurate molecular simulations for diverse applications.

Abstract: Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations are essential for accurately predicting
the physical and chemical properties of large molecular systems across various
pressure and temperature ensembles. However, the high computational costs
associated with All-Atom (AA) MD simulations have led to the development of
Coarse-Grained Molecular Dynamics (CGMD), providing a lower-dimensional
compression of the AA structure into representative CG beads, offering reduced
computational expense at the cost of predictive accuracy. Existing CGMD
methods, such as CG-Martini (calibrated against experimental data), aim to
generate an embedding of a topology that sufficiently generalizes across a
range of structures. Detrimentally, in attempting to specify parameterization
with applicability across molecular classes, it is unable to specialize to
domain-specific applications, where sufficient accuracy and computational speed
are critical. This work presents a novel approach to optimize derived results
from CGMD simulations by refining the general-purpose Martini3 topologies
specifically the bonded interaction parameters within a given coarse-grained
mapping - for domain-specific applications using Bayesian Optimization
methodologies. We have developed and validated a CG potential applicable to any
degree of polymerization, representing a significant advancement in the field.
Our optimized CG potential, based on the Martini3 framework, aims to achieve
accuracy comparable to AAMD while maintaining the computational efficiency of
CGMD. This approach bridges the gap between efficiency and accuracy in
multiscale molecular simulations, potentially enabling more rapid and
cost-effective molecular discovery across various scientific and technological
domains.
