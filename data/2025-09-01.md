### [1] [Fuzzy, Symbolic, and Contextual: Enhancing LLM Instruction via Cognitive Scaffolding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21204)
*Vanessa Figueiredo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores how certain architectural additions to large language models, like symbolic scaffolding and short-term memory mechanisms, influence their reasoning and instructional dialogue capabilities. Their system consistently demonstrates improved cognitive behaviors compared to alternatives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how architectural changes in LLMs can contribute to better instructional dialogue capabilities, specifically in Socratic tutoring settings.

Method: The authors introduced symbolic scaffolding mechanisms and short-term memory schemas. They evaluated five model variants using expert-designed rubrics, which assess reasoning, responsiveness, memory, and scaffolding effectiveness.

Result: Their full system outperformed baseline variants. Analysis showed degrading performance in reasoning and conversational behaviors when memory or symbolic scaffolding is removed.

Conclusion: Architectural scaffolding mechanisms reliably enhance reasoning, continuity, and adaptive tutoring strategies in LLMs.

Abstract: We study how architectural inductive biases influence the cognitive behavior
of large language models (LLMs) in instructional dialogue. We introduce a
symbolic scaffolding mechanism paired with a short-term memory schema designed
to promote adaptive, structured reasoning in Socratic tutoring. Using
controlled ablation across five system variants, we evaluate model outputs via
expert-designed rubrics covering scaffolding, responsiveness, symbolic
reasoning, and conversational memory. We present preliminary results using an
LLM-based evaluation framework aligned to a cognitively grounded rubric. This
enables scalable, systematic comparisons across architectural variants in
early-stage experimentation. The preliminary results show that our full system
consistently outperforms baseline variants. Analysis reveals that removing
memory or symbolic structure degrades key cognitive behaviors, including
abstraction, adaptive probing, and conceptual continuity. These findings
support a processing-level account in which architectural scaffolds can
reliably shape emergent instructional strategies in LLMs.

### [2] [Addressing accuracy and hallucination of LLMs in Alzheimer's disease research through knowledge graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21238)
*Tingxuan Xu,Jiarui Feng,Justin Melendez,Kaleigh Roberts,Donghong Cai,Mingfang Zhu,Donald Elbert,Yixin Chen,Randall J. Bateman*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The study evaluates Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (GraphRAG) in aiding chatbots for Alzheimer's disease research, addressing challenges like hallucinations and traceability, and providing a pre-built knowledge base for testing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT excel in task completion and question answering but have limitations in scientific research due to issues like hallucinations and lack of domain-specific accuracy. GraphRAG is proposed to address these challenges by integrating domain-specific information before response generation, but its effectiveness in highly specialized fields like Alzheimer's research remains underexplored.

Method: The researchers used a database of 50 Alzheimer's-related papers and 70 expert queries to build a GraphRAG knowledge base. They employed GPT-4o for response generation, comparing its outputs with standard GPT-4o responses in terms of quality and traceability. Additionally, several Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and GraphRAG systems were evaluated and discussed.

Result: The study found differences in response quality and traceability between the GraphRAG systems and standard GPT-4o. The research highlights the promise of GraphRAG in providing reliable, domain-specific information.

Conclusion: GraphRAG shows potential in addressing some of the limitations of LLMs in scientific research, particularly in specialized domains like Alzheimer's disease. The study introduces a helpful tool and database for researchers to explore the effectiveness of GraphRAG and standard RAG systems.

Abstract: In the past two years, large language model (LLM)-based chatbots, such as
ChatGPT, have revolutionized various domains by enabling diverse task
completion and question-answering capabilities. However, their application in
scientific research remains constrained by challenges such as hallucinations,
limited domain-specific knowledge, and lack of explainability or traceability
for the response. Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (GraphRAG) has
emerged as a promising approach to improving chatbot reliability by integrating
domain-specific contextual information before response generation, addressing
some limitations of standard LLMs. Despite its potential, there are only
limited studies that evaluate GraphRAG on specific domains that require
intensive knowledge, like Alzheimer's disease or other biomedical domains. In
this paper, we assess the quality and traceability of two popular GraphRAG
systems. We compile a database of 50 papers and 70 expert questions related to
Alzheimer's disease, construct a GraphRAG knowledge base, and employ GPT-4o as
the LLM for answering queries. We then compare the quality of responses
generated by GraphRAG with those from a standard GPT-4o model. Additionally, we
discuss and evaluate the traceability of several Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) and GraphRAG systems. Finally, we provide an easy-to-use interface with a
pre-built Alzheimer's disease database for researchers to test the performance
of both standard RAG and GraphRAG.

### [4] [Multi-Ontology Integration with Dual-Axis Propagation for Medical Concept Representation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21320)
*Mohsen Nayebi Kerdabadi,Arya Hadizadeh Moghaddam,Dongjie Wang,Zijun Yao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LINKO introduces a framework for improved medical concept representation by utilizing large language models and dual-axis propagation in ontology graphs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitation of existing methods that focus on isolated ontology systems or intra-ontology relationships, thereby overlooking the richer context provided by cross-ontology connections.

Method: LINKO employs LLMs for graph-retrieval-augmented initialization and leverages dual-axis knowledge propagation both within and across ontology systems.

Result: Extensive experiments validate LINKO's superior performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines, showcasing robustness and efficacy in limited data scenarios and rare disease prediction.

Conclusion: LINKO effectively integrates multiple ontology systems to enhance EHR predictive models, offering a robust approach to medical concept representation even under challenging conditions.

Abstract: Medical ontology graphs map external knowledge to medical codes in electronic
health records via structured relationships. By leveraging domain-approved
connections (e.g., parent-child), predictive models can generate richer medical
concept representations by incorporating contextual information from related
concepts. However, existing literature primarily focuses on incorporating
domain knowledge from a single ontology system, or from multiple ontology
systems (e.g., diseases, drugs, and procedures) in isolation, without
integrating them into a unified learning structure. Consequently, concept
representation learning often remains limited to intra-ontology relationships,
overlooking cross-ontology connections. In this paper, we propose LINKO, a
large language model (LLM)-augmented integrative ontology learning framework
that leverages multiple ontology graphs simultaneously by enabling dual-axis
knowledge propagation both within and across heterogeneous ontology systems to
enhance medical concept representation learning. Specifically, LINKO first
employs LLMs to provide a graph-retrieval-augmented initialization for ontology
concept embedding, through an engineered prompt that includes concept
descriptions, and is further augmented with ontology context. Second, our
method jointly learns the medical concepts in diverse ontology graphs by
performing knowledge propagation in two axes: (1) intra-ontology vertical
propagation across hierarchical ontology levels and (2) inter-ontology
horizontal propagation within every level in parallel. Last, through extensive
experiments on two public datasets, we validate the superior performance of
LINKO over state-of-the-art baselines. As a plug-in encoder compatible with
existing EHR predictive models, LINKO further demonstrates enhanced robustness
in scenarios involving limited data availability and rare disease prediction.

### [5] [Think in Games: Learning to Reason in Games via Reinforcement Learning with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21365)
*Yi Liao,Yu Gu,Yuan Sui,Zining Zhu,Yifan Lu,Guohua Tang,Zhongqian Sun,Wei Yang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Think in Games (TiG), a framework enabling LLMs to acquire procedural knowledge through game-based interaction, combining declarative knowledge with effective decision-making.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in reasoning but struggle with interactive tasks requiring procedural knowledge, highlighting the need to bridge gaps in knowledge application.

Method: TiG leverages LLMs' abilities by reformulating reinforcement learning tasks into language modeling, enabling policy generation through interaction and iterative refinement with environmental feedback.

Result: TiG achieves competitive performance in interactive tasks with reduced data and computational needs compared to traditional RL approaches, while providing transparent step-by-step explanations.

Conclusion: Think in Games effectively merges declarative and procedural knowledge in LLMs, enhancing their capabilities in complex interactive settings and improving task interpretability.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at complex reasoning tasks such as
mathematics and coding, yet they frequently struggle with simple interactive
tasks that young children perform effortlessly. This discrepancy highlights a
critical gap between declarative knowledge (knowing about something) and
procedural knowledge (knowing how to do something). Although traditional
reinforcement learning (RL) agents can acquire procedural knowledge through
environmental interaction, they often operate as black boxes and require
substantial training data. In contrast, LLMs possess extensive world knowledge
and reasoning capabilities, but are unable to effectively convert this static
knowledge into dynamic decision-making in interactive settings. To address this
challenge, we propose Think in Games (TiG), a novel framework that empowers
LLMs to develop procedural understanding through direct interaction with game
environments, while retaining their inherent reasoning and explanatory
abilities. Specifically, TiG reformulates RL-based decision-making as a
language modeling task: LLMs generate language-guided policies, which are
refined iteratively through online reinforcement learning based on
environmental feedback. Our experimental results show that TiG successfully
bridges the gap between declarative and procedural knowledge, achieving
competitive performance with dramatically lower data and computational demands
compared to conventional RL methods. Moreover, TiG provides step-by-step
natural language explanations for its decisions, greatly improving transparency
and interpretability in complex interactive tasks.

### [6] [AHELM: A Holistic Evaluation of Audio-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21376)
*Tony Lee,Haoqin Tu,Chi Heem Wong,Zijun Wang,Siwei Yang,Yifan Mai,Yuyin Zhou,Cihang Xie,Percy Liang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces AHELM, a standardized benchmark for evaluating audio-language models across 10 critical aspects, addressing shortcomings in existing evaluation methods. It provides a holistic comparison of 14 ALMs and establishes transparency with publicly accessible results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluations for audio-language models are fragmented and lack standardization, making it difficult to compare capabilities, fairness, and safety across different models.

Method: The authors aggregate various datasets, including two new synthetic datasets, and evaluate 14 ALMs using standardized prompts, inference parameters, and metrics across 10 identified aspects.

Result: The benchmark results reveal strengths and weaknesses among models, such as Gemini 2.5 Pro excelling in 5 aspects but showing group unfairness. Baseline systems also performed competitively in overall rankings.

Conclusion: AHELM provides a standardized framework to holistically evaluate ALMs, enabling equitable comparison and improvements in fairness and safety. It is designed to evolve by integrating new models and datasets over time.

Abstract: Evaluations of audio-language models (ALMs) -- multimodal models that take
interleaved audio and text as input and output text -- are hindered by the lack
of standardized benchmarks; most benchmarks measure only one or two
capabilities and omit evaluative aspects such as fairness or safety.
Furthermore, comparison across models is difficult as separate evaluations test
a limited number of models and use different prompting methods and inference
parameters. To address these shortfalls, we introduce AHELM, a benchmark that
aggregates various datasets -- including 2 new synthetic audio-text datasets
called PARADE, which evaluates the ALMs on avoiding stereotypes, and
CoRe-Bench, which measures reasoning over conversational audio through
inferential multi-turn question answering -- to holistically measure the
performance of ALMs across 10 aspects we have identified as important to the
development and usage of ALMs: audio perception, knowledge, reasoning, emotion
detection, bias, fairness, multilinguality, robustness, toxicity, and safety.
We also standardize the prompts, inference parameters, and evaluation metrics
to ensure equitable comparisons across models. We test 14 open-weight and
closed-API ALMs from 3 developers and 3 additional simple baseline systems each
consisting of an automatic speech recognizer and a language model. Our results
show that while Gemini 2.5 Pro ranks top in 5 out of 10 aspects, it exhibits
group unfairness ($p=0.01$) on ASR tasks whereas most of the other models do
not. We also find that the baseline systems perform reasonably well on AHELM,
with one ranking 5th overall despite having only speech-to-text capabilities.
For transparency, all raw prompts, model generations, and outputs are available
on our website at https://crfm.stanford.edu/helm/audio/v1.0.0. AHELM is
intended to be a living benchmark and new datasets and models will be added
over time.

### [9] [A General Framework of Epistemic Forgetting and its Instantiation by Ranking Functions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21441)
*Christoph Beierle,Alexander Hahn,Diana Howey,Gabriele Kern-Isberner,Kai Sauerwald*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores various types and operations of epistemic forgetting, extending classical methods used in logic programming and belief revision to richer semantic structures such as Spohn's ranking functions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and leverage deliberate forgetting operations on epistemic states, enhancing and broadening traditional approaches in knowledge management.

Method: The authors propose five epistemic types of forgetting, define seven operations grounded in Spohn’s ranking functions, and evaluate these against established postulates borrowed from logic programming and AGM theory.

Result: They provide a comprehensive breakdown of forgetting operations, showcasing how each operation adheres to specific axioms, highlighting their distinctions and similarities.

Conclusion: Epistemic forgetting is vital for managing knowledge and beliefs, and the paper proposes detailed frameworks and evaluations that pave the way for rich applications and theoretical insights into knowledge operations.

Abstract: Forgetting as a knowledge management operation deliberately ignores parts of
the knowledge and beliefs of an agent, for various reasons. Forgetting has many
facets, one may want to forget parts of the syntax, a proposition, or a
conditional. In the literature, two main operators suitable for performing
forgetting have been proposed and investigated in depth: First, variable
elimination is a syntactical method that blends out certain atomic variables to
focus on the rest of the language. It has been mainly used in the area of logic
programming and answer set programming. Second, contraction in AGM belief
revision theory effectively removes propositions from belief sets under logical
deduction. Both operations rely mainly on classical logics. In this article, we
take an epistemic perspective and study forgetting operations in epistemic
states with richer semantic structures, but with clear links to propositional
logic. This allows us to investigate what forgetting in the epistemic
background means, thereby lifting well-known and novel forgetting operations to
the epistemic level. We present five general types of epistemic forgetting and
instantiate them with seven concrete forgetting operations for Spohn's ranking
functions. We take inspiration from postulates of forgetting both from logic
programming and AGM theory to propose a rich landscape of axioms for evaluating
forgetting operations. Finally, we evaluate all concrete forgetting operations
according to all postulates, leading to a novel comprehensive overview
highlighting differences and commonalities among the forgetting operators.

### [10] [Learning Lifted Action Models From Traces of Incomplete Actions and States](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21449)
*Niklas Jansen,Jonas Gösgens,Hector Geffner*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper tackles the problem of learning a more realistic model of lifted STRIPS (STRIPS+) from incomplete state-action traces, proposing a learning algorithm (SYNTH) to address this.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the learning framework for STRIPS models by addressing realistic scenarios where states and actions lack full observability of predicates and arguments, respectively.

Method: The paper introduces a variant called STRIPS+, where certain action arguments are implicit, and uses a learning algorithm (SYNTH) that creates precondition expressions for grounding arguments in state-action traces.

Result: The SYNTH algorithm was demonstrated to be correct, complete, and scalable, using STRIPS+ models derived from existing STRIPS domains.

Conclusion: This approach allows learning STRIPS+ models even when the observed information is partial, making it more applicable in real-world scenarios compared to traditional methods.

Abstract: Consider the problem of learning a lifted STRIPS model of the sliding-tile
puzzle from random state-action traces where the states represent the location
of the tiles only, and the actions are the labels up, down, left, and right,
with no arguments. Two challenges are involved in this problem. First, the
states are not full STRIPS states, as some predicates are missing, like the
atoms representing the position of the ``blank''. Second, the actions are not
full STRIPS either, as they do not reveal all the objects involved in the
actions effects and preconditions. Previous approaches have addressed different
versions of this model learning problem, but most assume that actions in the
traces are full STRIPS actions or that the domain predicates are all
observable. The new setting considered in this work is more ``realistic'', as
the atoms observed convey the state of the world but not full STRIPS states,
and the actions reveal the arguments needed for selecting the action but not
the ones needed for modeling it in STRIPS. For formulating and addressing the
learning problem, we introduce a variant of STRIPS, which we call STRIPS+,
where certain STRIPS action arguments can be left implicit in preconditions
which can also involve a limited form of existential quantification. The
learning problem becomes the problem of learning STRIPS+ models from STRIPS+
state-action traces. For this, the proposed learning algorithm, called SYNTH,
constructs a stratified sequence (conjunction) of precondition expressions or
``queries'' for each action, that denote unique objects in the state and ground
the implicit action arguments in STRIPS+. The correctness and completeness of
SYNTH is established, and its scalability is tested on state-action traces
obtained from STRIPS+ models derived from existing STRIPS domains.

### [11] [MMSearch-Plus: A Simple Yet Challenging Benchmark for Multimodal Browsing Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21475)
*Xijia Tao,Yihua Teng,Xinxing Su,Xinyu Fu,Jihao Wu,Chaofan Tao,Ziru Liu,Haoli Bai,Rui Liu,Lingpeng Kong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MMSearch-Plus introduces a benchmark for evaluating multimodal language models on tasks requiring integration of both fine-grained visual and contextual reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in current multimodal benchmarks, which fail to focus on complex challenges like fine-grained visual reasoning, provenance verification, and long-horizon tool usage.

Method: The authors created MMSearch-Plus, a benchmark with 311 tasks that rely on extracting weak visual signals, iterative text-image searches, and cross-validation. They used a curation procedure called Spatial-Temporal Extrapolation to design the tasks.

Result: The best closed-access model achieved 36.0% accuracy with search capabilities, while a strong open-source model obtained 6.9% accuracy after 20 search iterations. Key failures were identified in reasoning and planning.

Conclusion: MMSearch-Plus highlights the significant challenges and limitations of current multimodal language models when dealing with tasks that require nuanced multimodal understanding and reasoning.

Abstract: Large multimodal language models (MLLMs) are increasingly deployed as web
agents, yet many multimodal browsing benchmarks can be solved by shallow, fixed
workflows that lean on high-recall image search and nearby text-masking the
genuinely multimodal challenges of fine-grained visual reasoning, provenance
verification, and long-horizon tool use. We introduce MMSearch-Plus, a
benchmark of 311 tasks that highly demand multimodal understanding while
preserving the difficulty profile of strong text-only browsing suites. Each
item is constructed to contain multiple weak, localized visual signals that
must be extracted, propagated through iterative text-image search, and
cross-validated under retrieval noise before answering. Our curation procedure,
Spatial-Temporal Extrapolation, seeds questions whose answers require
extrapolating from spatial cues (micro-text, part-level appearance, layouts,
signage) and temporal traces (broadcast overlays, seasonal context) to
out-of-image facts such as events, dates, and venues. We provide a
model-agnostic agent framework with browsing tools and evaluate a range of
closed and open MLLMs. The strongest agent (o3) attains 15.1% without search
and 36.0% accuracy with rollout under our framework, while a strong open-source
model (Qwen-2.5-VL-72B-Instruct) achieves 0.0% without search and 6.9% after 20
rounds of search. Beyond answer accuracy, we assess bounding-box production and
cropped-image search, and conduct an error analysis that surfaces failures in
source verification, part-based reasoning, and long-horizon planning.

### [12] [Modeling Wise Decision Making: A Z-Number Fuzzy Framework Inspired by Phronesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21517)
*Sweta Kaman,Ankita Sharma,Romi Banerjee*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new computational framework for measuring wisdom by incorporating multidimensionality and confidence using fuzzy Z-numbers, shown through a proof-of-concept correlating with existing scales.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current self-report measures of wisdom do not adequately capture the humility and uncertainty intertwined with wise reasoning.

Method: The study used a fuzzy inference system with Z-numbers to evaluate responses to culturally neutral pictorial moral dilemmas, mapping them to five theoretical wisdom components and combining scores with Gaussian kernel density estimation.

Result: The system created wisdom representations that correlated significantly with established measures while maintaining distinctions from unrelated traits, supporting validity.

Conclusion: The paper advances psychological measurement by defining wisdom as a multidimensional and uncertainty-conscious concept, enabling progress in both psychology and AI reasoning frameworks.

Abstract: Background: Wisdom is a superordinate construct that embraces perspective
taking, reflectiveness, prosocial orientation, reflective empathetic action,
and intellectual humility. Unlike conventional models of reasoning that are
rigidly bound by binary thinking, wisdom unfolds in shades of ambiguity,
requiring both graded evaluation and self-reflective humility. Current measures
depend on self-reports and seldom reflect the humility and uncertainty inherent
in wise reasoning. A computational framework that takes into account both
multidimensionality and confidence has the potential to improve psychological
science and allow humane AI. Method: We present a fuzzy inference system with Z
numbers, each of the decisions being expressed in terms of a wisdom score
(restriction) and confidence score (certainty). As part of this study,
participants (N = 100) were exposed to culturally neutral pictorial moral
dilemma tasks to which they generated think-aloud linguistic responses, which
were mapped into five theoretically based components of wisdom. The scores of
each individual component were combined using a base of 21 rules, with
membership functions tuned via Gaussian kernel density estimation. Results: In
a proof of concept study, the system produced dual attribute wisdom
representations that correlated modestly but significantly with established
scales while showing negligible relations with unrelated traits, supporting
convergent and divergent validity. Contribution: The contribution is to
formalize wisdom as a multidimensional, uncertainty-conscious construct,
operationalized in the form of Z-numbers. In addition to progressing
measurement in psychology, it calculates how fuzzy Z numbers can provide AI
systems with interpretable, confidence-sensitive reasoning that affords a safe,
middle ground between rigorous computation and human-like judgment.

### [13] [Counterfactual Scenarios for Automated Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21521)
*Nicola Gigante,Francesco Leofante,Andrea Micheli*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel explanation paradigm for Automated Planning, focusing on counterfactual scenarios that involve minimal changes to a planning problem.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing counterfactual explanations in planning fail to address higher-level properties of the problem, limiting their effectiveness in models.

Method: Counterfactual scenarios are defined as minimal modifications to a planning problem to align plans with desired properties, characterized computationally.

Result: The study finds that generating counterfactual scenarios is computationally efficient, comparable to generating a plan.

Conclusion: The proposed framework is viable for practical use, enabling the construction of algorithms for advanced problem-solving in planning.

Abstract: Counterfactual Explanations (CEs) are a powerful technique used to explain
Machine Learning models by showing how the input to a model should be minimally
changed for the model to produce a different output. Similar proposals have
been made in the context of Automated Planning, where CEs have been
characterised in terms of minimal modifications to an existing plan that would
result in the satisfaction of a different goal. While such explanations may
help diagnose faults and reason about the characteristics of a plan, they fail
to capture higher-level properties of the problem being solved. To address this
limitation, we propose a novel explanation paradigm that is based on
counterfactual scenarios. In particular, given a planning problem $P$ and an
\ltlf formula $\psi$ defining desired properties of a plan, counterfactual
scenarios identify minimal modifications to $P$ such that it admits plans that
comply with $\psi$. In this paper, we present two qualitative instantiations of
counterfactual scenarios based on an explicit quantification over plans that
must satisfy $\psi$. We then characterise the computational complexity of
generating such counterfactual scenarios when different types of changes are
allowed on $P$. We show that producing counterfactual scenarios is often only
as expensive as computing a plan for $P$, thus demonstrating the practical
viability of our proposal and ultimately providing a framework to construct
practical algorithms in this area.

*Eduardo Illueca-Fernandez,Kaile Chen,Fernando Seoane,Farhad Abtahi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces HealthProcessAI, a framework leveraging large language models to simplify and enhance process mining in healthcare, validated using sepsis data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome barriers like technical complexity, lack of standardization, and limited resources in applying process mining in healthcare workflows.

Method: HealthProcessAI integrates Python (PM4PY) and R (bupaR) libraries, along with multiple LLMs for automated interpretation and report generation, validated using sepsis progression data and compared for performance.

Result: The framework processed sepsis data across four scenarios successfully and evaluated five LLMs, with Claude Sonnet-4 and Gemini 2.5-Pro achieving the highest consistency scores.

Conclusion: HealthProcessAI represents a significant advance by integrating structured analytics and AI-driven interpretation, making process mining more accessible and actionable for healthcare professionals.

Abstract: Process mining has emerged as a powerful analytical technique for
understanding complex healthcare workflows. However, its application faces
significant barriers, including technical complexity, a lack of standardized
approaches, and limited access to practical training resources. We introduce
HealthProcessAI, a GenAI framework designed to simplify process mining
applications in healthcare and epidemiology by providing a comprehensive
wrapper around existing Python (PM4PY) and R (bupaR) libraries. To address
unfamiliarity and improve accessibility, the framework integrates multiple
Large Language Models (LLMs) for automated process map interpretation and
report generation, helping translate technical analyses into outputs that
diverse users can readily understand. We validated the framework using sepsis
progression data as a proof-of-concept example and compared the outputs of five
state-of-the-art LLM models through the OpenRouter platform. To test its
functionality, the framework successfully processed sepsis data across four
proof-of-concept scenarios, demonstrating robust technical performance and its
capability to generate reports through automated LLM analysis. LLM evaluation
using five independent LLMs as automated evaluators revealed distinct model
strengths: Claude Sonnet-4 and Gemini 2.5-Pro achieved the highest consistency
scores (3.79/4.0 and 3.65/4.0) when evaluated by automated LLM assessors. By
integrating multiple Large Language Models (LLMs) for automated interpretation
and report generation, the framework addresses widespread unfamiliarity with
process mining outputs, making them more accessible to clinicians, data
scientists, and researchers. This structured analytics and AI-driven
interpretation combination represents a novel methodological advance in
translating complex process mining results into potentially actionable insights
for healthcare applications.

*Issa Hanou,Sebastijan Dumančić,Mathijs de Weerdt*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The authors propose a framework to discover generalized landmarks for domain-wide planning problems, showing their effectiveness in solving larger instances.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional landmark extraction algorithms struggle to generalize across domains, necessitating a method to create intermediate goals that are broadly applicable.

Method: Using state functions independent of specific objects, they construct generalized landmark graphs to represent progression and repetitive subplans.

Result: Generalized landmark graphs were effective for solving larger instances, with significant heuristic improvements in cases involving repetition.

Conclusion: Generalized landmarks provide interpretable domain information, enhancing planning in automation and demonstrating scalability with minimal input.

Abstract: We propose a new framework for discovering landmarks that automatically
generalize across a domain. These generalized landmarks are learned from a set
of solved instances and describe intermediate goals for planning problems where
traditional landmark extraction algorithms fall short. Our generalized
landmarks extend beyond the predicates of a domain by using state functions
that are independent of the objects of a specific problem and apply to all
similar objects, thus capturing repetition. Based on these functions, we
construct a directed generalized landmark graph that defines the landmark
progression, including loop possibilities for repetitive subplans. We show how
to use this graph in a heuristic to solve new problem instances of the same
domain. Our results show that the generalized landmark graphs learned from a
few small instances are also effective for larger instances in the same domain.
If a loop that indicates repetition is identified, we see a significant
improvement in heuristic performance over the baseline. Generalized landmarks
capture domain information that is interpretable and useful to an automated
planner. This information can be discovered from a small set of plans for the
same domain.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Deterministic Decentralized POMDPs (Det-Dec-POMDPs) and proposes the Iterative Deterministic POMDP Planning (IDPP) as a practical solver.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of efficiently solving complex multi-agent planning problems in domains with deterministic transitions and observations.

Method: A new solver, Iterative Deterministic POMDP Planning (IDPP), optimized to handle large-scale Det-Dec-POMDPs based on the Joint Equilibrium Search for Policies framework.

Result: IDPP is a scalable solution for solving Det-Dec-POMDPs, overcoming limitations of current Dec-POMDP solvers for large-scale problems.

Conclusion: The work expands the capability of Dec-POMDP solvers, enabling effective planning for deterministic domains in multi-agent systems like multi-robot navigation.

Abstract: Many high-level multi-agent planning problems, including multi-robot
navigation and path planning, can be effectively modeled using deterministic
actions and observations.
  In this work, we focus on such domains and introduce the class of
Deterministic Decentralized POMDPs (Det-Dec-POMDPs). This is a subclass of
Dec-POMDPs characterized by deterministic transitions and observations
conditioned on the state and joint actions.
  We then propose a practical solver called Iterative Deterministic POMDP
Planning (IDPP). This method builds on the classic Joint Equilibrium Search for
Policies framework and is specifically optimized to handle large-scale
Det-Dec-POMDPs that current Dec-POMDP solvers are unable to address
efficiently.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes a framework that integrates traditional supply chain optimization with LLMs for better decision-making and explainability, validated via a case study.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between complex operations research outputs and stakeholder understanding in supply chain planning.

Method: Combines mixed-integer optimization for inventory redistribution with AI-based summarizations, visualizations, and KPI generation, supported by AI agents and dynamic interfaces.

Result: The system, demonstrated in a case study, improves supply chain planning by preventing stockouts, reducing costs, and ensuring service levels.

Conclusion: The framework enhances decision-making by integrating AI for interactivity and explainability, and proposes future improvements using advanced machine learning techniques.

Abstract: This paper presents an integrated framework that combines traditional network
optimization models with large language models (LLMs) to deliver interactive,
explainable, and role-aware decision support for supply chain planning. The
proposed system bridges the gap between complex operations research outputs and
business stakeholder understanding by generating natural language summaries,
contextual visualizations, and tailored key performance indicators (KPIs). The
core optimization model addresses tactical inventory redistribution across a
network of distribution centers for multi-period and multi-item, using a
mixed-integer formulation. The technical architecture incorporates AI agents,
RESTful APIs, and a dynamic user interface to support real-time interaction,
configuration updates, and simulation-based insights. A case study demonstrates
how the system improves planning outcomes by preventing stockouts, reducing
costs, and maintaining service levels. Future extensions include integrating
private LLMs, transfer learning, reinforcement learning, and Bayesian neural
networks to enhance explainability, adaptability, and real-time
decision-making.

### [18] [A-MHA*: Anytime Multi-Heuristic A*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21637)
*Ramkumar Natarajan,Muhammad Suhail Saleem,William Xiao,Sandip Aine,Howie Choset,Maxim Likhachev*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper extends Multi-Heuristic A* (MHA*) into an anytime algorithm, enabling it to continually improve solutions over time while maintaining suboptimality and completeness guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of MHA* as a one-shot algorithm and enable it to provide refined solutions progressively.

Method: The authors modify MHA* by incorporating concepts from Anytime Repairing A* (ARA*), creating an algorithm called Anytime MHA* (A-MHA*) that progressively improves suboptimal solutions until time runs out.

Result: A-MHA* was tested in 3D path planning and sliding tile puzzle domains, showing competitive performance compared to MHA* and other anytime algorithms.

Conclusion: A-MHA* successfully extends MHA* into an anytime framework, retaining its guarantees while improving practical applicability in dynamic computational scenarios.

Abstract: Designing good heuristic functions for graph search requires adequate domain
knowledge. It is often easy to design heuristics that perform well and
correlate with the underlying true cost-to-go values in certain parts of the
search space but these may not be admissible throughout the domain thereby
affecting the optimality guarantees of the search. Bounded suboptimal search
using several such partially good but inadmissible heuristics was developed in
Multi-Heuristic A* (MHA*). Although MHA* leverages multiple inadmissible
heuristics to potentially generate a faster suboptimal solution, the original
version does not improve the solution over time. It is a one shot algorithm
that requires careful setting of inflation factors to obtain a desired one time
solution. In this work, we tackle this issue by extending MHA* to an anytime
version that finds a feasible suboptimal solution quickly and continually
improves it until time runs out. Our work is inspired from the Anytime
Repairing A* (ARA*) algorithm. We prove that our precise adaptation of ARA*
concepts in the MHA* framework preserves the original suboptimal and
completeness guarantees and enhances MHA* to perform in an anytime fashion.
Furthermore, we report the performance of A-MHA* in 3-D path planning domain
and sliding tiles puzzle and compare against MHA* and other anytime algorithms.

### [19] [Leveraging Imperfection with MEDLEY A Multi-Model Approach Harnessing Bias in Medical AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21648)
*Farhad Abtahi,Mehdi Astaraki,Fernando Seoane*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MEDLEY leverages diverse outputs from multiple AI models to utilize biases constructively in medical diagnosis, proposing a paradigm shift in AI's role.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Biases in medical AI are often viewed as flaws, but human reasoning also employs biases shaped by external factors, hinting that such biases could be valuable rather than eliminated.

Method: MEDLEY uses an ensemble of over 30 AI models that preserve diverse outputs, including biases and hallucinations, as a framework to intentionally document and present minority views for clinician verification.

Result: The proof-of-concept demonstrator successfully preserved consensus and minority views in synthetic diagnostic cases, promoting transparency about diagnostic uncertainty and biases.

Conclusion: Structured diversity of AI models can enhance medical reasoning under clinician oversight, reframing imperfections as valuable resources for trustworthy medical AI development.

Abstract: Bias in medical artificial intelligence is conventionally viewed as a defect
requiring elimination. However, human reasoning inherently incorporates biases
shaped by education, culture, and experience, suggesting their presence may be
inevitable and potentially valuable. We propose MEDLEY (Medical Ensemble
Diagnostic system with Leveraged diversitY), a conceptual framework that
orchestrates multiple AI models while preserving their diverse outputs rather
than collapsing them into a consensus. Unlike traditional approaches that
suppress disagreement, MEDLEY documents model-specific biases as potential
strengths and treats hallucinations as provisional hypotheses for clinician
verification. A proof-of-concept demonstrator was developed using over 30 large
language models, creating a minimum viable product that preserved both
consensus and minority views in synthetic cases, making diagnostic uncertainty
and latent biases transparent for clinical oversight. While not yet a validated
clinical tool, the demonstration illustrates how structured diversity can
enhance medical reasoning under clinician supervision. By reframing AI
imperfection as a resource, MEDLEY offers a paradigm shift that opens new
regulatory, ethical, and innovation pathways for developing trustworthy medical
AI systems.

*Jiho Choi,Seojeong Park,Seongjong Song,Hyunjung Shim*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces PosterForest, a training-free framework for scientific poster generation using a hierarchical structure called Poster Tree and multi-agent collaboration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of previous methods that fail to utilize hierarchical document structures and neglect effective integration of textual and visual elements.

Method: A training-free framework employing a Poster Tree for hierarchical representation and a multi-agent strategy for collaborative poster generation.

Result: PosterForest outperforms existing baselines in various evaluations, producing high-quality automated scientific posters comparable to expert-designed ones.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively preserves information, ensures structural clarity, and enhances user preference for scientific poster generation.

Abstract: We present a novel training-free framework, \textit{PosterForest}, for
automated scientific poster generation. Unlike prior approaches, which largely
neglect the hierarchical structure of scientific documents and the semantic
integration of textual and visual elements, our method addresses both
challenges directly. We introduce the \textit{Poster Tree}, a hierarchical
intermediate representation that jointly encodes document structure and
visual-textual relationships at multiple levels. Our framework employs a
multi-agent collaboration strategy, where agents specializing in content
summarization and layout planning iteratively coordinate and provide mutual
feedback. This approach enables the joint optimization of logical consistency,
content fidelity, and visual coherence. Extensive experiments on multiple
academic domains show that our method outperforms existing baselines in both
qualitative and quantitative evaluations. The resulting posters achieve quality
closest to expert-designed ground truth and deliver superior information
preservation, structural clarity, and user preference.

*Fabrizio Fagiolo,Nicolo' Vescera*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper presents a variational algorithm for solving the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) using a compact permutation encoding and an optimize-freeze-reuse strategy tailored for NISQ hardware.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to address the computational challenges of solving TSP in quantum systems, focusing on efficient encoding and reducing computational cost for reusability.

Method: The approach combines a compact encoding of permutations with an optimize-freeze-reuse pipeline optimized via Simulated Annealing (SA) and re-applies the circuit topology for new instances, maintaining time efficiency.

Result: The proposed method achieves high success rates (up to 100% for 4 cities, but declining to ~20% for 7 cities), emphasizing its robustness at moderate scales but showcasing scalability limitations.

Conclusion: The method demonstrates robust performance for small to moderate-sized problems and highlights the potential of freezing Ansatz to reduce computation time; it suggests the method's scalability to larger problems like Vehicle Routing and Job-Shop Scheduling despite observed limitations.

Abstract: In this paper we present a variational algorithm for the Traveling Salesman
Problem (TSP) that combines (i) a compact encoding of permutations, which
reduces the qubit requirement too, (ii) an optimize-freeze-reuse strategy:
where the circuit topology (``Ansatz'') is first optimized on a training
instance by Simulated Annealing (SA), then ``frozen'' and re-used on novel
instances, limited to a rapid re-optimization of only the circuit parameters.
This pipeline eliminates costly structural research in testing, making the
procedure immediately implementable on NISQ hardware.
  On a set of $40$ randomly generated symmetric instances that span $4 - 7$
cities, the resulting Ansatz achieves an average optimal trip sampling
probability of $100\%$ for 4 city cases, $90\%$ for 5 city cases and $80\%$ for
6 city cases. With 7 cities the success rate drops markedly to an average of
$\sim 20\%$, revealing the onset of scalability limitations of the proposed
method.
  The results show robust generalization ability for moderate problem sizes and
indicate how freezing the Ansatz can dramatically reduce time-to-solution
without degrading solution quality. The paper also discusses scalability
limitations, the impact of ``warm-start'' initialization of parameters, and
prospects for extension to more complex problems, such as Vehicle Routing and
Job-Shop Scheduling.

*Timothée Loranchet,Charles K. Assaad*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper discusses how summary causal graphs (SCGs) can be used to orient micro-level causal edges in temporal systems, offering theoretical guarantees even with complex structures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The main motivation is addressing the challenge of identifying causal relationships between temporal variables, especially when the complete causal structure is unknown, by leveraging high-level abstract causal graphs created by experts.

Method: The authors present conditions under which micro-level edges between temporal variables can be oriented using summary causal graphs, with assumptions like access to a faithful and causally sufficient distribution.

Result: The paper guarantees edge orientation at the micro-level, including cases with cycles or bidirected edges at the macro-level, showcasing the use of SCGs for causal inference.

Conclusion: These findings demonstrate the utility of expert knowledge and SCGs in improving causal discovery in complex temporal systems, providing practical guidance for observational time series data analysis.

Abstract: Understanding causal relations between temporal variables is a central
challenge in time series analysis, particularly when the full causal structure
is unknown. Even when the full causal structure cannot be fully specified,
experts often succeed in providing a high-level abstraction of the causal
graph, known as a summary causal graph, which captures the main causal
relations between different time series while abstracting away micro-level
details. In this work, we present conditions that guarantee the orientability
of micro-level edges between temporal variables given the background knowledge
encoded in a summary causal graph and assuming having access to a faithful and
causally sufficient distribution with respect to the true unknown graph. Our
results provide theoretical guarantees for edge orientation at the micro-level,
even in the presence of cycles or bidirected edges at the macro-level. These
findings offer practical guidance for leveraging SCGs to inform causal
discovery in complex temporal systems and highlight the value of incorporating
expert knowledge to improve causal inference from observational time series
data.

### [23] [Tree-Guided Diffusion Planner](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21800)
*Hyeonseong Jeon,Cheolhong Min,Jaesik Park*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Tree-guided Diffusion Planner (TDP) balances exploration and exploitation for zero-shot test-time planning using pretrained diffusion models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard gradient guidance struggles with non-convex, non-differentiable, and multi-reward problems, while supervised planning lacks flexibility and generalization.

Method: TDP uses a two-level tree search: diverse trajectory exploration via training-free particle guidance and task-objective-oriented refinement via fast conditional denoising.

Result: TDP outperformed state-of-the-art methods across maze gold-picking, robot arm block manipulation, and AntMaze tasks.

Conclusion: TDP successfully mitigates limitations of prior methods by combining diverse sampling and gradient-based refinement, achieving superior test-time planning performance.

Abstract: Planning with pretrained diffusion models has emerged as a promising approach
for solving test-time guided control problems. However, standard gradient
guidance typically performs optimally under convex and differentiable reward
landscapes, showing substantially reduced effectiveness in real-world scenarios
involving non-convex objectives, non-differentiable constraints, and
multi-reward structures. Furthermore, recent supervised planning approaches
require task-specific training or value estimators, which limits test-time
flexibility and zero-shot generalization. We propose a Tree-guided Diffusion
Planner (TDP), a zero-shot test-time planning framework that balances
exploration and exploitation through structured trajectory generation. We frame
test-time planning as a tree search problem using a bi-level sampling process:
(1) diverse parent trajectories are produced via training-free particle
guidance to encourage broad exploration, and (2) sub-trajectories are refined
through fast conditional denoising guided by task objectives. TDP addresses the
limitations of gradient guidance by exploring diverse trajectory regions and
harnessing gradient information across this expanded solution space using only
pretrained models and test-time reward signals. We evaluate TDP on three
diverse tasks: maze gold-picking, robot arm block manipulation, and AntMaze
multi-goal exploration. TDP consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
approaches on all tasks. The project page can be found at:

*Yeawon Lee,Xiaoyang Wang,Christopher C. Yang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces a multi-agent system (MAS) to improve clinical decision-making using SOAP notes data analysis, outperforming single-agent models on key diagnoses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clinical notes are complex and require accurate interpretation for effective patient care, but automation is challenging in high-stakes environments.

Method: The authors developed a collaborative multi-agent system that uses specialist agents and a Manager agent in a debate-like process to analyze clinical SOAP notes.

Result: The MAS consistently outperformed single-agent models in identifying congestive heart failure, acute kidney injury, and sepsis on a 420-note dataset.

Conclusion: The MAS offers a promising framework for more accurate and interpretable clinical decision support by simulating a clinical team’s reasoning.

Abstract: Accurate interpretation of clinical narratives is critical for patient care,
but the complexity of these notes makes automation challenging. While Large
Language Models (LLMs) show promise, single-model approaches can lack the
robustness required for high-stakes clinical tasks. We introduce a
collaborative multi-agent system (MAS) that models a clinical consultation team
to address this gap. The system is tasked with identifying clinical problems by
analyzing only the Subjective (S) and Objective (O) sections of SOAP notes,
simulating the diagnostic reasoning process of synthesizing raw data into an
assessment. A Manager agent orchestrates a dynamically assigned team of
specialist agents who engage in a hierarchical, iterative debate to reach a
consensus. We evaluated our MAS against a single-agent baseline on a curated
dataset of 420 MIMIC-III notes. The dynamic multi-agent configuration
demonstrated consistently improved performance in identifying congestive heart
failure, acute kidney injury, and sepsis. Qualitative analysis of the agent
debates reveals that this structure effectively surfaces and weighs conflicting
evidence, though it can occasionally be susceptible to groupthink. By modeling
a clinical team's reasoning process, our system offers a promising path toward
more accurate, robust, and interpretable clinical decision support tools.

*Devon Lister,Prabhu Vellaisamy,John Paul Shen,Di Wu*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: The paper proposes a more hardware-efficient neuron implementation for Temporal Neural Networks by leveraging sparsity in spike volleys to improve area and power efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address inefficiencies in hardware implementations of neurons, particularly focusing on the sparsity present in the input spike volleys, which is not utilized effectively in current methods.

Method: The authors introduce the Catwalk neuron, which employs unary top-k sorting to cluster spikes and optimize the parallel counter for accumulating response functions, improving hardware efficiency.

Result: Place-and-route experiments demonstrate the Catwalk neuron achieves 1.39x area reduction and 1.86x power reduction compared to traditional SRM0-RNL neurons.

Conclusion: The Catwalk neuron offers significant hardware efficiency improvements, making it a viable option for future neuromorphic computing projects.

Abstract: Temporal neural networks (TNNs) are neuromorphic neural networks that utilize
bit-serial temporal coding. TNNs are composed of columns, which in turn employ
neurons as their building blocks. Each neuron processes volleys of input
spikes, modulated by associated synaptic weights, on its dendritic inputs.
Recently proposed neuron implementation in CMOS employs a Spike Response Model
(SRM) with a ramp-no-leak (RNL) response function and assumes all the inputs
can carry spikes. However, in actual spike volleys, only a small subset of the
dendritic inputs actually carry spikes in each compute cycle. This form of
sparsity can be exploited to achieve better hardware efficiency. In this paper,
we propose a Catwalk neuron implementation by relocating spikes in a spike
volley as a sorted subset cluster via unary top-k. Such relocation can
significantly reduce the cost of the subsequent parallel counter (PC) for
accumulating the response functions from the spiking inputs. This can lead to
improvements on area and power efficiency in RNL neuron implementation.
Place-and-route results show Catwalk is 1.39x and 1.86x better in area and
power, respectively, as compared to existing SRM0-RNL neurons.

TL;DR: This paper introduces SCE-NTT, a superconductive SFQ-based hardware accelerator targeting faster and more energy-efficient homomorphic encryption schemes, achieving superior performance compared to CMOS.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome computational bottlenecks in fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) schemes, specifically within the Number-Theoretic Transform (NTT), by utilizing superconductor electronics (SCE).

Method: The paper proposes a pipelined architecture called NTT-128, leveraging SFQ logic and SRM, along with a new RSFQ cell library for implementation. Functional correctness was validated using simulations and Verilog modeling.

Result: The implemented design achieves 531 million NTT/sec at 34 GHz, 100x faster than CMOS counterparts, with scalability demonstrated up to larger NTT sizes and improved throughput for key-switch operations.

Conclusion: The findings highlight SCE-based accelerators as promising for scalable, energy-efficient post-quantum computation, with further optimization expected through advances in superconductive device fabrication.

Abstract: This research explores the use of superconductor electronics (SCE) for
accelerating fully homomorphic encryption (FHE), focusing on the
Number-Theoretic Transform (NTT), a key computational bottleneck in FHE
schemes. We present SCE-NTT, a dedicated hardware accelerator based on
superconductive single flux quantum (SFQ) logic and memory, targeting high
performance and energy efficiency beyond the limits of conventional CMOS. To
address SFQ constraints such as limited dense RAM and restricted fanin/fanout,
we propose a deeply pipelined NTT-128 architecture using shift register memory
(SRM). Designed for N=128 32-bit coefficients, NTT-128 comprises log2(N)=7
processing elements (PEs), each featuring a butterfly unit (BU), dual
coefficient memories operating in ping-pong mode via FIFO-based SRM queues, and
twiddle factor buffers. The BU integrates a Shoup modular multiplier optimized
for a small area, leveraging precomputed twiddle factors. A new RSFQ cell
library with over 50 parameterized cells, including compound logic units, was
developed for implementation. Functional and timing correctness were validated
using JoSIM analog simulations and Verilog models. A multiphase clocking scheme
was employed to enhance robustness and reduce path-balancing overhead,
improving circuit reliability. Fabricated results show the NTT-128 unit
achieves 531 million NTT/sec at 34 GHz, over 100x faster than state-of-the-art
CMOS equivalents. We also project that the architecture can scale to larger
sizes, such as a 2^14-point NTT in approximately 482 ns. Key-switch throughput
is estimated at 1.63 million operations/sec, significantly exceeding existing
hardware. These results demonstrate the strong potential of SCE-based
accelerators for scalable, energy-efficient secure computation in the
post-quantum era, with further gains anticipated through advances in
fabrication.

TL;DR: The paper introduces scaled-integer range analysis (SIRA), a technique to optimize quantized neural network inference computations by tailoring precision, particularly in non-matrix-multiply operations on embedded systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural network quantization reduces computational costs but highlights bottlenecks in non-matrix-multiply operations on embedded systems. Addressing this issue is critical for optimizing performance and resource usage.

Method: The paper employs interval arithmetic in SIRA for static analysis, extracting range, scale, and bias information for quantized tensors. It integrates these analyses into the FINN framework to adapt resource footprints using tailored bitwidth adjustments and optimization techniques for neural network accelerators.

Result: With SIRA optimizations, reductions of 17% in LUTs, 66% in DSPs, and 22% in accumulator bitwidths were achieved across tested workloads, demonstrating significant resource savings.

Conclusion: SIRA significantly optimizes non-matrix-multiply operations in quantized neural networks, making them more resource-efficient on hardware platforms. SIRA is open-sourced for broader adoption and exploration.

Abstract: While neural network quantization effectively reduces the cost of matrix
multiplications, aggressive quantization can expose non-matrix-multiply
operations as significant performance and resource bottlenecks on embedded
systems. Addressing such bottlenecks requires a comprehensive approach to
tailoring the precision across operations in the inference computation. To this
end, we introduce scaled-integer range analysis (SIRA), a static analysis
technique employing interval arithmetic to determine the range, scale, and bias
for tensors in quantized neural networks. We show how this information can be
exploited to reduce the resource footprint of FPGA dataflow neural network
accelerators via tailored bitwidth adaptation for accumulators and downstream
operations, aggregation of scales and biases, and conversion of consecutive
elementwise operations to thresholding operations. We integrate SIRA-driven
optimizations into the open-source FINN framework, then evaluate their
effectiveness across a range of quantized neural network workloads and compare
implementation alternatives for non-matrix-multiply operations. We demonstrate
an average reduction of 17% for LUTs, 66% for DSPs, and 22% for accumulator
bitwidths with SIRA optimizations, providing detailed benchmark analysis and
analytical models to guide the implementation style for non-matrix layers.
Finally, we open-source SIRA to facilitate community exploration of its
benefits across various applications and hardware platforms.

Motivation: Enhance the energy efficiency of CNNs deployed on CIM platforms while addressing the limitations of existing approaches that sacrifice accuracy for efficiency or vice versa.

Method: Introduces BWMA with closed-form solutions for binary weight quantization and differentiable functions for multi-bit activation quantization.

Result: BWMA outperforms existing methods in accuracy on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets, achieving up to 5.46% improvement. Hardware simulations indicate 4-bit activation provides the best balance of cost and performance.

Conclusion: BWMA is a pioneering method that effectively balances hardware efficiency and model accuracy, showcasing a viable pathway for future CIM-based CNN accelerators.

Abstract: Compute-in-memory (CIM) accelerators have emerged as a promising way for
enhancing the energy efficiency of convolutional neural networks (CNNs).
Deploying CNNs on CIM platforms generally requires quantization of network
weights and activations to meet hardware constraints. However, existing
approaches either prioritize hardware efficiency with binary weight and
activation quantization at the cost of accuracy, or utilize multi-bit weights
and activations for greater accuracy but limited efficiency. In this paper, we
introduce a novel binary weight multi-bit activation (BWMA) method for CNNs on
CIM-based accelerators. Our contributions include: deriving closed-form
solutions for weight quantization in each layer, significantly improving the
representational capabilities of binarized weights; and developing a
differentiable function for activation quantization, approximating the ideal
multi-bit function while bypassing the extensive search for optimal settings.
Through comprehensive experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets, we show
that BWMA achieves notable accuracy improvements over existing methods,
registering gains of 1.44\%-5.46\% and 0.35\%-5.37\% on respective datasets.
Moreover, hardware simulation results indicate that 4-bit activation
quantization strikes the optimal balance between hardware cost and model
performance.

### [29] [CoBA: Counterbias Text Augmentation for Mitigating Various Spurious Correlations via Semantic Triples](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21083)
*Kyohoon Jin,Juhwan Choi,Jungmin Yun,Junho Lee,Soojin Jang,Youngbin Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces CoBA (CounterBias Augmentation), a framework to mitigate multiple biases in deep learning models by counterfactual data augmentation, improving performance and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models often rely on spurious correlations in training data, degrading performance and generalization on unseen data.

Method: CoBA involves decomposing text into semantic triples (subject-predicate-object), selectively modifying these to break spurious correlations, and reconstructing adjusted text for counterbias data generation.

Result: Experiments show CoBA improves task performance, reduces biases, and enhances out-of-distribution robustness.

Conclusion: CoBA is a versatile solution to address biases and spurious correlations in deep learning, improving generalization and resilience.

Abstract: Deep learning models often learn and exploit spurious correlations in
training data, using these non-target features to inform their predictions.
Such reliance leads to performance degradation and poor generalization on
unseen data. To address these limitations, we introduce a more general form of
counterfactual data augmentation, termed counterbias data augmentation, which
simultaneously tackles multiple biases (e.g., gender bias, simplicity bias) and
enhances out-of-distribution robustness. We present CoBA: CounterBias
Augmentation, a unified framework that operates at the semantic triple level:
first decomposing text into subject-predicate-object triples, then selectively
modifying these triples to disrupt spurious correlations. By reconstructing the
text from these adjusted triples, CoBA generates counterbias data that
mitigates spurious patterns. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that
CoBA not only improves downstream task performance, but also effectively
reduces biases and strengthens out-of-distribution resilience, offering a
versatile and robust solution to the challenges posed by spurious correlations.

*Jan Fillies,Michael Peter Hoffmann,Rebecca Reichel,Roman Salzwedel,Sven Bodemer,Adrian Paschke*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This work introduces a German dataset that combines toxicity annotations with age demographic contexts to study online communication patterns and aid in building better moderation systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing toxic speech datasets lack age demographic data, which limits insights into how different age groups interact online.

Method: The dataset includes human and LLM-annotated comments sourced from Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube, consolidated using toxic keywords and categorized by type of toxic speech.

Result: Analysis showed differing patterns in toxic speech: younger users utilize expressive language while older users engage more in disinformation and devaluation.

Conclusion: This dataset enables age-aware insights into toxicity and supports better content moderation systems that account for demographic variations.

Abstract: A lack of demographic context in existing toxic speech datasets limits our
understanding of how different age groups communicate online. In collaboration
with funk, a German public service content network, this research introduces
the first large-scale German dataset annotated for toxicity and enriched with
platform-provided age estimates. The dataset includes 3,024 human-annotated and
30,024 LLM-annotated anonymized comments from Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube.
To ensure relevance, comments were consolidated using predefined toxic
keywords, resulting in 16.7\% labeled as problematic. The annotation pipeline
combined human expertise with state-of-the-art language models, identifying key
categories such as insults, disinformation, and criticism of broadcasting fees.
The dataset reveals age-based differences in toxic speech patterns, with
younger users favoring expressive language and older users more often engaging
in disinformation and devaluation. This resource provides new opportunities for
studying linguistic variation across demographics and supports the development
of more equitable and age-aware content moderation systems.

### [33] [How Does Cognitive Bias Affect Large Language Models? A Case Study on the Anchoring Effect in Price Negotiation Simulations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21137)
*Yoshiki Takenami,Yin Jou Huang,Yugo Murawaki,Chenhui Chu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper examines how cognitive biases, specifically the anchoring effect, influence large language models (LLMs) in price negotiations. Results show that LLMs can exhibit this bias, but reasoning models are less affected.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to understand how cognitive biases, like the anchoring effect, impact LLMs, as these biases can reduce the reliability of LLMs in practical applications.

Method: LLM-based seller agents were instructed to apply the anchoring effect. Negotiation performance was analyzed using both objective and subjective metrics. Relationships between anchoring, reasoning, and personality traits were also evaluated.

Result: LLMs showed susceptibility to the anchoring effect. Reasoning-based models demonstrated reduced vulnerability, indicating that extended reasoning mitigates this bias. Personality traits had no notable influence on anchoring susceptibility.

Conclusion: The paper highlights the need to address cognitive biases in LLMs. It demonstrates that reasoning capability can decrease susceptibility to certain biases, contributing to safer and more responsible deployment of LLMs in society.

Abstract: Cognitive biases, well-studied in humans, can also be observed in LLMs,
affecting their reliability in real-world applications. This paper investigates
the anchoring effect in LLM-driven price negotiations. To this end, we
instructed seller LLM agents to apply the anchoring effect and evaluated
negotiations using not only an objective metric but also a subjective metric.
Experimental results show that LLMs are influenced by the anchoring effect like
humans. Additionally, we investigated the relationship between the anchoring
effect and factors such as reasoning and personality. It was shown that
reasoning models are less prone to the anchoring effect, suggesting that the
long chain of thought mitigates the effect. However, we found no significant
correlation between personality traits and susceptibility to the anchoring
effect. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of cognitive biases
in LLMs and to the realization of safe and responsible application of LLMs in
society.

*Deepro Choudhury,Sinead Williamson,Adam Goliński,Ning Miao,Freddie Bickford Smith,Michael Kirchhof,Yizhe Zhang,Tom Rainforth*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces BED-LLM, a method for enhancing Large Language Models (LLMs) to adaptively gather information using Bayesian Experimental Design (BED). This enables LLMs to better interact with users and external environments in multi-turn scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the ability of Large Language Models to interact coherently and adaptively in multi-turn conversations by enhancing their information-gathering capabilities.

Method: The BED-LLM method iteratively selects questions or queries that maximize the Expected Information Gain (EIG) based on previous responses. It combines a probabilistic model, an innovative EIG estimator, and a targeted query strategy.

Result: BED-LLM demonstrated substantial performance improvements in tasks like the 20-questions game and inferring user preferences, outperforming direct prompting and other adaptive design methods.

Conclusion: BED-LLM significantly enhances LLM adaptability and information-gathering capabilities, making them more effective conversational agents and useful for tasks requiring interactive inference.

Abstract: We propose a general-purpose approach for improving the ability of Large
Language Models (LLMs) to intelligently and adaptively gather information from
a user or other external source using the framework of sequential Bayesian
experimental design (BED). This enables LLMs to act as effective multi-turn
conversational agents and interactively interface with external environments.
Our approach, which we call BED-LLM (Bayesian Experimental Design with Large
Language Models), is based on iteratively choosing questions or queries that
maximize the expected information gain (EIG) about the task of interest given
the responses gathered previously. We show how this EIG can be formulated in a
principled way using a probabilistic model derived from the LLM's belief
distribution and provide detailed insights into key decisions in its
construction. Further key to the success of BED-LLM are a number of specific
innovations, such as a carefully designed estimator for the EIG, not solely
relying on in-context updates for conditioning on previous responses, and a
targeted strategy for proposing candidate queries. We find that BED-LLM
achieves substantial gains in performance across a wide range of tests based on
the 20-questions game and using the LLM to actively infer user preferences,
compared to direct prompting of the LLM and other adaptive design strategies.

### [35] [Can Multimodal LLMs Solve the Basic Perception Problems of Percept-V?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21143)
*Samrajnee Ghosh,Naman Agarwal,Hemanshu Garg,Chinmay Mittal,Mausam,Parag Singla*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Percept-V, a dataset for testing basic visual perception tasks on MLLMs, revealing their performance declines with increasing problem complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate the foundational visual perception skills of Multimodal Large Language Models, which have not been extensively analyzed with basic generated images.

Method: Creation of the Percept-V dataset with 7200 program-generated images across 30 categories, assessing varied visual perception capabilities. Testing was conducted on cutting-edge MLLMs and reasoning models.

Result: MLLMs showed declining accuracy as task complexity increased, with distinct trends in cognitive skill challenges across models.

Conclusion: Despite excelling in complex tasks, MLLMs struggle with progressively complicated basic visual perception tasks, highlighting cognitive skill limitations.

Abstract: The reasoning abilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have
garnered a lot of attention in recent times, with advances made in frontiers
like coding, mathematics, and science. However, very limited experiments have
been done to assess their performance in simple perception tasks performed over
uncontaminated, generated images containing basic shapes and structures. To
address this issue, the paper introduces a dataset, Percept-V, containing a
total of 7200 program-generated images equally divided into 30 categories, each
testing a combination of visual perception skills. Unlike previously proposed
datasets, Percept-V comprises very basic tasks of varying complexity that test
the perception abilities of MLLMs. This dataset is then tested on
state-of-the-art MLLMs like GPT-4o, Gemini, and Claude as well as Large
Reasoning Models (LRMs) like OpenAI o4-mini and DeepSeek R1 to gauge their
performance. Contrary to the evidence that MLLMs excel in many complex tasks,
our experiments show a significant drop in the models' performance with
increasing problem complexity across all categories. An analysis of the
performances also reveals that the tested MLLMs exhibit a similar trend in
accuracy across categories, testing a particular cognitive skill and find some
skills to be more difficult than others.

TL;DR: This survey examines the development of Scientific Large Language Models (Sci-LLMs) with a focus on their data-centric evolution, emphasizing challenges in multimodal and domain-specific scientific data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to understand and guide the development of trustworthy Sci-LLMs to better integrate scientific data and accelerate scientific discovery.

Method: The authors conduct a systematic review, analyzing Sci-LLMs, pre/post-training datasets, benchmark evaluations, and highlight data-specific challenges and solutions.

Result: They provide a unified taxonomy of scientific data, show distinct demands on Sci-LLMs, review benchmark trends, and discuss emerging data handling techniques.

Conclusion: The paper envisions the shift toward autonomous, AI-driven research systems capable of experimentation and continual evolution of scientific knowledge bases.

Abstract: Scientific Large Language Models (Sci-LLMs) are transforming how knowledge is
represented, integrated, and applied in scientific research, yet their progress
is shaped by the complex nature of scientific data. This survey presents a
comprehensive, data-centric synthesis that reframes the development of Sci-LLMs
as a co-evolution between models and their underlying data substrate. We
formulate a unified taxonomy of scientific data and a hierarchical model of
scientific knowledge, emphasizing the multimodal, cross-scale, and
domain-specific challenges that differentiate scientific corpora from general
natural language processing datasets. We systematically review recent Sci-LLMs,
from general-purpose foundations to specialized models across diverse
scientific disciplines, alongside an extensive analysis of over 270
pre-/post-training datasets, showing why Sci-LLMs pose distinct demands --
heterogeneous, multi-scale, uncertainty-laden corpora that require
representations preserving domain invariance and enabling cross-modal
reasoning. On evaluation, we examine over 190 benchmark datasets and trace a
shift from static exams toward process- and discovery-oriented assessments with
advanced evaluation protocols. These data-centric analyses highlight persistent
issues in scientific data development and discuss emerging solutions involving
semi-automated annotation pipelines and expert validation. Finally, we outline
a paradigm shift toward closed-loop systems where autonomous agents based on
Sci-LLMs actively experiment, validate, and contribute to a living, evolving
knowledge base. Collectively, this work provides a roadmap for building
trustworthy, continually evolving artificial intelligence (AI) systems that
function as a true partner in accelerating scientific discovery.

*Muskan Saraf,Sajjad Rezvani Boroujeni,Justin Beaudry,Hossein Abedi,Tom Bush*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study explores biases in how large language models (LLMs) assess outputs, highlighting that labels (true or false) can heavily skew preference votes and quality ratings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand biases in self- and cross-model evaluations among ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude, and investigate how labels impact judgment fairness.

Method: The study tested four label conditions (no labels, true labels, two false-label scenarios) using blog posts scored by all three LLMs via preference voting and quality ratings across dimensions like coherence, informativeness, and conciseness.

Result: Labeling influenced evaluations significantly: the Claude label boosted scores, the Gemini label depressed them, and false labels reversed rankings by substantial margins, showing identity-related distortions.

Conclusion: Blind or multimodel evaluation approaches are necessary to mitigate biases in LLM assessments and ensure fairness in model benchmarking.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to evaluate outputs, yet
their judgments may be influenced. This study examines bias in self- and
cross-model evaluations by ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude under four conditions:
no labels, true labels, and two false-label scenarios. Blog posts authored by
each model were evaluated by all three using both overall preference voting and
quality ratings for Coherence, Informativeness, and Conciseness, with all
scores expressed as percentages for direct comparison. Results reveal striking
asymmetries: the "Claude" label consistently boosts scores, while the "Gemini"
label consistently depresses them, regardless of actual content. False labels
frequently reversed rankings, producing shifts of up to 50 percentage points in
preference votes and up to 12 percentage points in converted quality ratings.
Gemini's self-scores collapsed under true labels, while Claude's
self-preference intensified. These findings show that perceived model identity
can heavily distort high-level judgments and subtly influence detailed quality
ratings, underscoring the need for blind or multimodel evaluation protocols to
ensure fairness in LLM benchmarking.

TL;DR: The paper introduces an automated framework optimizing HFACS classification for aviation safety analysis using Reinforcement Learning with GRPO applied to a smaller language model, improving both accuracy and computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study seeks to overcome limitations in scalability and consistency with traditional HFACS methods in aviation accident analysis.

Method: Using GRPO reinforcement learning to fine-tune the Llama-3.1 8B language model, incorporating a multi-component reward system and synthetic data to address class imbalance.

Result: A 350% improvement in exact match accuracy and improved partial match accuracy, outperforming state-of-the-art LLMs.

Conclusion: Domain-optimized smaller models are proven to be computationally efficient and effective for aviation safety analysis, enabling deployment on low-resource edge devices.

Abstract: Analyzing the human factors behind aviation accidents is crucial for
preventing future incidents, yet traditional methods using the Human Factors
Analysis and Classification System (HFACS) are limited by scalability and
consistency. To address this, we introduce an automated HFACS classification
framework for aviation safety analysis that utilizes Reinforcement Learning
with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to fine-tune a Llama-3.1 8B
language model. Our approach incorporates a multi-component reward system
tailored for aviation safety analysis and integrates synthetic data generation
to overcome class imbalance in accident datasets. The resulting GRPO-optimized
model achieved noticeable performance gains, including a 350% increase in exact
match accuracy (from 0.0400 to 0.1800) and an improved partial match accuracy
of 0.8800. Significantly, our specialized model outperforms state-of-the-art
LLMs (Large Language Models), including GPT-5-mini and Gemini-2.5-fiash, on key
metrics. This research also proposes exact match accuracy in multi-label HFACS
classification problem as a new benchmarking methodology to evaluate the
advanced reasoning capabilities of language models. Ultimately, our work
validates that smaller, domain-optimized models can provide a computationally
efficient and better solution for critical safety analysis. This approach makes
powerful, low-latency deployment on resource-constrained edge devices feasible.

*Han Yang,Jian Lan,Yihong Liu,Hinrich Schütze,Thomas Seidl*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses the vulnerability of autoregressive language models to orthographic attacks and proposes a pixel-based generative model to enhance robustness and multilingual compatibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autoregressive language models struggle with orthographic attacks, where slight alterations in text characters can degrade their performance, highlighting the limitations of subword tokenizers.

Method: The proposed method involves replacing text-based embeddings with pixel-based representations by converting words into rendered images, which are resilient to noisy inputs and support multilingual text.

Result: Experiments on datasets such as LAMBADA, WMT24, and SST-2 show the model's resilience against orthographic noise and improved performance in multilingual scenarios.

Conclusion: Pixel-based generative language models have the potential to enhance robustness against noise and support diverse writing systems effectively.

Abstract: Autoregressive language models are vulnerable to orthographic attacks, where
input text is perturbed with characters from multilingual alphabets, leading to
substantial performance degradation. This vulnerability primarily stems from
the out-of-vocabulary issue inherent in subword tokenizers and their
embeddings. To address this limitation, we propose a pixel-based generative
language model that replaces the text-based embeddings with pixel-based
representations by rendering words as individual images. This design provides
stronger robustness to noisy inputs, while an extension of compatibility to
multilingual text across diverse writing systems. We evaluate the proposed
method on the multilingual LAMBADA dataset, WMT24 dataset and the SST-2
benchmark, demonstrating both its resilience to orthographic noise and its
effectiveness in multilingual settings.

### [40] [Do Self-Supervised Speech Models Exhibit the Critical Period Effects in Language Acquisition?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21210)
*Yurie Koga,Shunsuke Kando,Yusuke Miyao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study examines Critical Period (CP) effects in self-supervised speech models (S3Ms), finding no clear CP effects but observing improved performance with delayed L2 exposure and L1 forgetting with delayed L1 exposure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understand whether human-like CP effects observed in language acquisition apply to S3Ms, particularly in the context of speech rather than text.

Method: Experiments conducted on S3Ms with varying L2 training onsets and L1 training offsets; models trained on child-directed speech and assessed on phone discrimination performance.

Result: No clear evidence of CP effects found, though delayed L2 exposure onset improved performance on L2 and delayed L1 exposure offset led to L1 forgetting.

Conclusion: S3Ms do not replicate human CP effects in phonological acquisition, suggesting differences in how speech models acquire and retain language compared to humans.

Abstract: This paper investigates whether the Critical Period (CP) effects in human
language acquisition are observed in self-supervised speech models (S3Ms). CP
effects refer to greater difficulty in acquiring a second language (L2) with
delayed L2 exposure onset, and greater retention of their first language (L1)
with delayed L1 exposure offset. While previous work has studied these effects
using textual language models, their presence in speech models remains
underexplored despite the central role of spoken language in human language
acquisition. We train S3Ms with varying L2 training onsets and L1 training
offsets on child-directed speech and evaluate their phone discrimination
performance. We find that S3Ms do not exhibit clear evidence of either CP
effects in terms of phonological acquisition. Notably, models with delayed L2
exposure onset tend to perform better on L2 and delayed L1 exposure offset
leads to L1 forgetting.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Decoding Memory Pipeline (DMP) to improve efficiency in detecting hallucinations in large language models, achieving a 3x speedup without reducing performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing hallucination detection methods lack efficiency and often depend heavily on domain-specific knowledge, necessitating a more effective solution.

Method: The authors propose DMP, leveraging redundancy in self-consistency approaches and using selective inference and annealed decoding to enhance generation speed.

Result: DMP accelerates generation by up to 3x without sacrificing domain-specific detection performance like AUROC, making it highly efficient.

Conclusion: The DMP method boosts efficiency in multi-response generation and shows potential for broader applications in alignment and reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance in both
research and real-world applications, but they still struggle with
hallucination. Existing hallucination detection methods often perform poorly on
sentence-level generation or rely heavily on domain-specific knowledge. While
self-consistency approaches help address these limitations, they incur high
computational costs due to repeated generation. In this paper, we conduct the
first study on identifying redundancy in self-consistency methods, manifested
as shared prefix tokens across generations, and observe that non-exact-answer
tokens contribute minimally to the semantic content. Based on these insights,
we propose a novel Decoding Memory Pipeline (DMP) that accelerates generation
through selective inference and annealed decoding. Being orthogonal to the
model, dataset, decoding strategy, and self-consistency baseline, our DMP
consistently improves the efficiency of multi-response generation and holds
promise for extension to alignment and reasoning tasks. Extensive experiments
show that our method achieves up to a 3x speedup without sacrificing AUROC
performance.

### [45] [Normality and the Turing Test](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21382)
*Alexandre Kabbach*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper reinterprets the Turing test using the concept of normality, arguing that it assesses normal/average intelligence, not exceptional intelligence, and critiques the applicability of large language models like ChatGPT in this context.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to provide a deeper understanding of the Turing test by analyzing it through the lens of normality, exploring its statistical and normative implications on the evaluation of human-like intelligence in machines.

Method: The paper applies a conceptual exploration of normality in the context of the Turing test, analyzing statistical and observational frameworks to reinterpret the standard of judgment in such tests.

Result: The analysis concludes that the Turing test evaluates normal intelligence via averaged human judgment, revealing that models like ChatGPT align with "artificial smartness" rather than mastering true human-like intelligence.

Conclusion: The paper asserts that large language models are unlikely to pass the Turing test under its original intent and raises a broader philosophical question regarding the nature of human cognition and its reducibility to average characteristics.

Abstract: This paper proposes to revisit the Turing test through the concept of
normality. Its core argument is that the statistical interpretation of the
normal--understood as the average both in the normative and mathematical sense
of the term--proves useful for understanding the Turing test in at least two
ways. First, in the sense that the Turing test targets normal/average rather
than exceptional human intelligence, so that successfully passing the test
requires building machines that "make mistakes" and display imperfect behavior
just like normal/average humans. Second, in the sense that the Turing test is a
statistical test where judgments of intelligence are never carried out by a
single "average" judge (understood as non-expert) but always by a full jury. As
such, the notion of "average human interrogator" that Turing talks about in his
original paper should be understood primarily as referring to a mathematical
abstraction made of the normalized aggregate of individual judgments of
multiple judges. In short, this paper argues that the Turing test is a test of
normal intelligence as assessed by a normal judge characterizing the average
judgment of a pool of human interrogators. Its conclusions are twofold. First,
it argues that large language models such as ChatGPT are unlikely to pass the
Turing test as those models precisely target exceptional rather than
normal/average human intelligence. As such, they constitute models of what it
proposes to call artificial smartness rather than artificial intelligence per
se. Second, it argues that the core question of whether the Turing test can
contribute anything to the understanding of human cognition is that of whether
the human mind is really reducible to the normal/average mind--a question which
largely extends beyond the Turing test itself and questions the conceptual
underpinnings of the normalist paradigm it belongs to.

*Tanguy Herserant,Vincent Guigue*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper studies reproducibility challenges in automated text summarization evaluation and finds discrepancies in metric performances. It introduces an open-source framework for improved comparison.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenges of reliably evaluating text summarization metrics and the necessity for standardized and reproducible protocols.

Method: The authors conducted experiments with six different metrics, ranging from classical ones like ROUGE to LLM-based methods, using a unified open-source framework applied to the SummEval dataset.

Result: The study reveals that metrics highly aligned with human judgments are computationally intensive and inconsistent across runs. It also highlights concerns regarding the randomness and technical dependencies of LLM-based evaluations.

Conclusion: The paper stresses the need for robust evaluation protocols and standardization to improve reliability in summarization assessment practices.

Abstract: This paper investigates reproducibility challenges in automatic text
summarization evaluation. Based on experiments conducted across six
representative metrics ranging from classical approaches like ROUGE to recent
LLM-based methods (G-Eval, SEval-Ex), we highlight significant discrepancies
between reported performances in the literature and those observed in our
experimental setting. We introduce a unified, open-source framework, applied to
the SummEval dataset and designed to support fair and transparent comparison of
evaluation metrics. Our results reveal a structural trade-off: metrics with the
highest alignment with human judgments tend to be computationally intensive and
less stable across runs. Beyond comparative analysis, this study highlights key
concerns about relying on LLMs for evaluation, stressing their randomness,
technical dependencies, and limited reproducibility. We advocate for more
robust evaluation protocols including exhaustive documentation and
methodological standardization to ensure greater reliability in automatic
summarization assessment.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study assesses Automated Review Generators (ARGs) for their ability to detect faulty research logic in peer reviews, revealing limitations and suggesting improvement strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the capabilities and risks linked to the use of LLMs as ARGs in detecting faults in research logic during peer reviews.

Method: A counterfactual evaluation framework was developed to test ARGs under controlled conditions, focusing on their ability to evaluate research logic consistency.

Result: Reviews generated by ARGs did not significantly reflect flaws in research logic, demonstrating limitations in critical evaluation ability.

Conclusion: ARGs lack proficiency in assessing faulty research logic, motivating actionable recommendations and public release of evaluation tools and datasets to advance future developments.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have great potential to accelerate and support
scholarly peer review and are increasingly used as fully automatic review
generators (ARGs). However, potential biases and systematic errors may pose
significant risks to scientific integrity; understanding the specific
capabilities and limitations of state-of-the-art ARGs is essential. We focus on
a core reviewing skill that underpins high-quality peer review: detecting
faulty research logic. This involves evaluating the internal consistency
between a paper's results, interpretations, and claims. We present a fully
automated counterfactual evaluation framework that isolates and tests this
skill under controlled conditions. Testing a range of ARG approaches, we find
that, contrary to expectation, flaws in research logic have no significant
effect on their output reviews. Based on our findings, we derive three
actionable recommendations for future work and release our counterfactual
dataset and evaluation framework publicly.

TL;DR: This paper introduces Med-RewardBench, the first dedicated benchmark for evaluating medical reward models and judges in medical scenarios with a multimodal dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical applications of multimodal large language models require highly accurate, context-specific, and professional-level responses. Current benchmarks fail to address clinical evaluation dimensions such as diagnostic accuracy and clinical relevance.

Method: The authors created Med-RewardBench, a benchmark dataset across 13 organ systems and 8 clinical departments with 1,026 expert-annotated cases. They used a three-step process for quality assurance and evaluated 32 state-of-the-art MLLMs, including fine-tuning baseline models for improvement.

Result: The evaluation revealed substantial performance challenges in aligning MLLM outputs with expert judgments. Fine-tuned baseline models demonstrated significant performance enhancements.

Conclusion: Med-RewardBench fills a critical gap by offering a specialized benchmark for assessing medical reward models and judges. This can advance the development of MLLMs for medical applications.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) hold significant potential in
medical applications, including disease diagnosis and clinical decision-making.
However, these tasks require highly accurate, context-sensitive, and
professionally aligned responses, making reliable reward models and judges
critical. Despite their importance, medical reward models (MRMs) and judges
remain underexplored, with no dedicated benchmarks addressing clinical
requirements. Existing benchmarks focus on general MLLM capabilities or
evaluate models as solvers, neglecting essential evaluation dimensions like
diagnostic accuracy and clinical relevance. To address this, we introduce
Med-RewardBench, the first benchmark specifically designed to evaluate MRMs and
judges in medical scenarios. Med-RewardBench features a multimodal dataset
spanning 13 organ systems and 8 clinical departments, with 1,026
expert-annotated cases. A rigorous three-step process ensures high-quality
evaluation data across six clinically critical dimensions. We evaluate 32
state-of-the-art MLLMs, including open-source, proprietary, and
medical-specific models, revealing substantial challenges in aligning outputs
with expert judgment. Additionally, we develop baseline models that demonstrate
substantial performance improvements through fine-tuning.

*Yunhao Zhang,Shaonan Wang,Nan Lin,Xinyi Dong,Chong Li,Chengqing Zong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a model to decompose semantic representations into fine-grained subdimensions with interpretable links to both language and brain activity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods rely on broad semantic dimensions, ignoring finer conceptual distinctions within language and brain activity.

Method: The authors propose a Disentangled Continuous Semantic Representation Model (DCSRM) to split word embeddings into sub-embeddings, identify semantic subdimensions, and validate neural plausibility with encoding models.

Result: The study found interpretable semantic subdimensions structured around distinct principles (e.g., polarity), supported by neural activation patterns.

Conclusion: Semantic dimensions are composed of finer substructures with cognitive and neuroscientific relevance, offering deeper insights into meaning organization.

Abstract: Understanding the core dimensions of conceptual semantics is fundamental to
uncovering how meaning is organized in language and the brain. Existing
approaches often rely on predefined semantic dimensions that offer only broad
representations, overlooking finer conceptual distinctions. This paper proposes
a novel framework to investigate the subdimensions underlying coarse-grained
semantic dimensions. Specifically, we introduce a Disentangled Continuous
Semantic Representation Model (DCSRM) that decomposes word embeddings from
large language models into multiple sub-embeddings, each encoding specific
semantic information. Using these sub-embeddings, we identify a set of
interpretable semantic subdimensions. To assess their neural plausibility, we
apply voxel-wise encoding models to map these subdimensions to brain
activation. Our work offers more fine-grained interpretable semantic
subdimensions of conceptual meaning. Further analyses reveal that semantic
dimensions are structured according to distinct principles, with polarity
emerging as a key factor driving their decomposition into subdimensions. The
neural correlates of the identified subdimensions support their cognitive and
neuroscientific plausibility.

### [50] [Beyond the Surface: Probing the Ideological Depth of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21448)
*Shariar Kabir,Kevin Esterling,Yue Dong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores how deeply held political ideologies are expressed in large language models (LLMs), highlighting that some models have more robust and abstract ideological structures than others and can represent political positions with varying degrees of flexibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to understand the robustness, complexity, and stability of the ideological representations in LLMs, especially given that surface-level political opinions can be easily influenced by prompting techniques.

Method: The study uses two main strategies: 1) measuring political steerability through instruction prompting and activation steering, and 2) probing the models’ internal mechanisms with Sparse Autoencoders to quantify ideological representations.

Result: Some LLMs are more resilient to switching viewpoints, having deeper ideological structures, while others demonstrate malleability. Quantitative analysis showed up to 7.3x more political features in one model compared to another of comparable size.

Conclusion: Ideological depth is a measurable attribute of LLMs, and steerability tests provide insights into their underlying political logic and robustness.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated pronounced ideological
leanings, yet the stability and depth of these positions remain poorly
understood. Surface-level responses can often be manipulated through simple
prompt engineering, calling into question whether they reflect a coherent
underlying ideology. This paper investigates the concept of "ideological depth"
in LLMs, defined as the robustness and complexity of their internal political
representations. We employ a dual approach: first, we measure the
"steerability" of two well-known open-source LLMs using instruction prompting
and activation steering. We find that while some models can easily switch
between liberal and conservative viewpoints, others exhibit resistance or an
increased rate of refusal, suggesting a more entrenched ideological structure.
Second, we probe the internal mechanisms of these models using Sparse
Autoencoders (SAEs). Preliminary analysis reveals that models with lower
steerability possess more distinct and abstract ideological features. Our
evaluations reveal that one model can contain 7.3x more political features than
another model of similar size. This allows targeted ablation of a core
political feature in an ideologically "deep" model, leading to consistent,
logical shifts in its reasoning across related topics, whereas the same
intervention in a "shallow" model results in an increase in refusal outputs.
Our findings suggest that ideological depth is a quantifiable property of LLMs
and that steerability serves as a valuable window into their latent political
architecture.

### [51] [Igniting Creative Writing in Small Language Models: LLM-as-a-Judge versus Multi-Agent Refined Rewards](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21476)
*Xiaolong Wei,Bo Lu,Xingyu Zhang,Zhejun Zhao,Dongdong Shen,Long Xia,Dawei Yin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces strategies to enhance creative writing in Small Language Models (SLMs), focusing on Chinese greetings using RLAIF. Key methods include a reward model and an LLM-as-a-Judge framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite the remarkable abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in creative writing, their high computational demands restrict broader applications. This motivates the exploration of enhancing SLMs as cost-effective alternatives.

Method: The paper employs two reward strategies under a RLAIF framework: one using a reward model trained on preference data via multi-agent rejection sampling, and another leveraging a principle-guided LLM-as-a-Judge optimized through adversarial training and reflection mechanisms.

Result: Both methods significantly improve creative writing quality compared to baselines. Notably, the principle-guided LLM-as-a-Judge approach delivers better performance, higher training efficiency, and reduces reliance on human annotations.

Conclusion: The principle-guided LLM-as-a-Judge provides a scalable, effective solution for fostering creativity in SLMs, aligning well with human judgments, and minimizing costs associated with human feedback.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable creative writing
capabilities, yet their substantial computational demands hinder widespread
use. Enhancing Small Language Models (SLMs) offers a promising alternative, but
current methods like Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) struggle with novelty, and
Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is costly. This paper
explores two distinct AI-driven reward strategies within a Reinforcement
Learning from AI Feedback (RLAIF) framework to ignite the creative writing of a
7B-parameter SLM, specifically for generating Chinese greetings. The first
strategy employs a RM trained on high-quality preference data curated by a
novel multi-agent rejection sampling framework designed for creative tasks. The
second, more novel strategy utilizes a principle-guided LLM-as-a-Judge, whose
reward function is optimized via an adversarial training scheme with a
reflection mechanism, to directly provide reward signals. Comprehensive
experiments reveal that while both approaches significantly enhance creative
output over baselines, the principle-guided LLM-as-a-Judge demonstrably yields
superior generation quality. Furthermore, it offers notable advantages in
training efficiency and reduced dependency on human-annotated data, presenting
a more scalable and effective path towards creative SLMs. Our automated
evaluation methods also exhibit strong alignment with human judgments. Our code

*Sara B. Coutinho,Rafael M. O. Cruz,Francimaria R. S. Nascimento,George D. C. Cavalcanti*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses the issue of fake news spread related to psychological biases and proposes a method for improving machine learning-based fact-checking by prioritizing diverse classifiers in ensemble methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to tackle the vulnerability of individuals to fake news on social media, exacerbated by psychological biases, and to address the limitations of current ensemble methods that struggle with diversity in classifiers.

Method: The method involves a novel classifier selection technique using diversity metrics and hierarchical clustering to create pools of diverse classifiers. The most diverse pool is selected based on classifier diversity and performance metrics for ensemble creation.

Result: Experiments conducted with 40 classifiers on six datasets show that the proposed method achieves the highest accuracy on two of the datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness.

Conclusion: The proposed diversity-driven classifier selection method improves ensemble robustness and addresses redundancy in patterns learned by classifiers. The approach strikes a balance between diversity and performance to enhance fact-checking systems.

Abstract: Psychological biases, such as confirmation bias, make individuals
particularly vulnerable to believing and spreading fake news on social media,
leading to significant consequences in domains such as public health and
politics. Machine learning-based fact-checking systems have been widely studied
to mitigate this problem. Among them, ensemble methods are particularly
effective in combining multiple classifiers to improve robustness. However,
their performance heavily depends on the diversity of the constituent
classifiers-selecting genuinely diverse models remains a key challenge,
especially when models tend to learn redundant patterns. In this work, we
propose a novel automatic classifier selection approach that prioritizes
diversity, also extended by performance. The method first computes pairwise
diversity between classifiers and applies hierarchical clustering to organize
them into groups at different levels of granularity. A HierarchySelect then
explores these hierarchical levels to select one pool of classifiers per level,
each representing a distinct intra-pool diversity. The most diverse pool is
identified and selected for ensemble construction from these. The selection
process incorporates an evaluation metric reflecting each classifiers's
performance to ensure the ensemble also generalises well. We conduct
experiments with 40 heterogeneous classifiers across six datasets from
different application domains and with varying numbers of classes. Our method
is compared against the Elbow heuristic and state-of-the-art baselines. Results
show that our approach achieves the highest accuracy on two of six datasets.

range, thus reducing label bias and enhancing model stability. We fine-tune the
MahaSBERT model on this dataset and benchmark its performance against other
alternatives like MahaBERT, MuRIL, IndicBERT, and IndicSBERT. Our experiments
demonstrate that MahaSTS enables effective training for sentence similarity
tasks in Marathi, highlighting the impact of human-curated annotations,
targeted fine-tuning, and structured supervision in low-resource settings. The

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a dynamic optimization framework called Middo for improving training data quality for LLMs using continuous self-evolving processes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing strategies for improving LLM training data quality face limitations in adapting to evolving model capabilities, leading to suboptimal results.

Method: The presented framework, Middo, employs model-aware data selection and dynamic optimization. It involves a closed-loop system using diagnostic signals and adaptive transformations.

Result: Experiments showed that Middo improves data quality and enhances LLM accuracy by an average of 7.15% without increasing the dataset size.

Conclusion: Middo sets a new sustainable paradigm for training LLMs through an evolving collaboration between data and AI. The datasets, models, and code will be publicly available soon.

Abstract: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) Large Language Models (LLM) fundamentally rely
on high-quality training data. While data selection and data synthesis are two
common strategies to improve data quality, existing approaches often face
limitations in static dataset curation that fail to adapt to evolving model
capabilities. In this paper, we introduce Middo, a self-evolving Model-informed
dynamic data optimization framework that uses model-aware data selection and
context-preserving data refinement. Unlike conventional one-off
filtering/synthesis methods, our framework establishes a closed-loop
optimization system: (1) A self-referential diagnostic module proactively
identifies suboptimal samples through tri-axial model signals - loss patterns
(complexity), embedding cluster dynamics (diversity), and self-alignment scores
(quality); (2) An adaptive optimization engine then transforms suboptimal
samples into pedagogically valuable training points while preserving semantic
integrity; (3) This optimization process continuously evolves with model
capability through dynamic learning principles. Experiments on multiple
benchmarks demonstrate that our \method consistently enhances the quality of
seed data and boosts LLM's performance with improving accuracy by 7.15% on
average while maintaining the original dataset scale. This work establishes a
new paradigm for sustainable LLM training through dynamic human-AI co-evolution
of data and models. Our datasets, models, and code are coming soon.

TL;DR: A study was conducted with 32 participants using GPT-4 and Claude 3.5 across tasks to understand personality-driven preferences for LLMs. Results showed Rationals preferred GPT-4, while Idealists favored Claude 3.5, with task-dependent patterns observed for other personality types.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore whether users with different personality traits have systematic preferences for specific large language models during collaborative tasks.

Method: 32 participants representing four Keirsey personality types interacted with GPT-4 and Claude 3.5 across four collaborative tasks—data analysis, creative writing, information retrieval, and writing assistance. Sentiment analysis was applied to qualitative feedback.

Result: Rationals preferred GPT-4 for goal-oriented tasks, whereas Idealists favored Claude 3.5, especially for creative and analytical activities. Other personality types exhibited varied preferences based on the nature of the task.

Conclusion: Personality traits influence preferences for LLMs, with Rationals and Idealists showing distinct tendencies for different models. Personality-based analysis provides a nuanced perspective that traditional evaluations may overlook.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly integrate into everyday
workflows, where users shape outcomes through multi-turn collaboration, a
critical question emerges: do users with different personality traits
systematically prefer certain LLMs over others? We conducted a study with 32
participants evenly distributed across four Keirsey personality types,
evaluating their interactions with GPT-4 and Claude 3.5 across four
collaborative tasks: data analysis, creative writing, information retrieval,
and writing assistance. Results revealed significant personality-driven
preferences: Rationals strongly preferred GPT-4, particularly for goal-oriented
tasks, while idealists favored Claude 3.5, especially for creative and
analytical tasks. Other personality types showed task-dependent preferences.
Sentiment analysis of qualitative feedback confirmed these patterns. Notably,
aggregate helpfulness ratings were similar across models, showing how
personality-based analysis reveals LLM differences that traditional evaluations
miss.

negative example generation to improve the semantic richness and sample
difficulty of the training set. Additionally, we employ a two-stage training
strategy, comprising initial retrieval-focused pretraining followed by
full-task fine-tuning, enabling the embedding model to extend its capabilities

*Jonathan Tonglet,Jan Zimny,Tinne Tuytelaars,Iryna Gurevych*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Misviz, a benchmark dataset for detecting misleading visualizations, and Misviz-synth, a synthetic supplement. It evaluates tools for identifying chart design violations misleading readers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To combat misinformation caused by misleading visualizations on social media and the web by providing datasets and tools for automatic detection of misleading chart designs.

Method: Creation of two datasets: Misviz with annotated real-world visualizations and Misviz-synth, a synthetic dataset. Evaluations conducted using MLLMs, rule-based systems, and classifiers.

Result: Evaluation highlights the task's difficulty, showing current models struggle significantly in identifying misleading visualizations effectively.

Conclusion: Misviz and Misviz-synth are valuable resources to train and evaluate AI models, addressing an urgent need to mitigate misinformation caused by poor visualization practices.

Abstract: Misleading visualizations are a potent driver of misinformation on social
media and the web. By violating chart design principles, they distort data and
lead readers to draw inaccurate conclusions. Prior work has shown that both
humans and multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are frequently deceived by
such visualizations. Automatically detecting misleading visualizations and
identifying the specific design rules they violate could help protect readers
and reduce the spread of misinformation. However, the training and evaluation
of AI models has been limited by the absence of large, diverse, and openly
available datasets. In this work, we introduce Misviz, a benchmark of 2,604
real-world visualizations annotated with 12 types of misleaders. To support
model training, we also release Misviz-synth, a synthetic dataset of 81,814
visualizations generated using Matplotlib and based on real-world data tables.
We perform a comprehensive evaluation on both datasets using state-of-the-art
MLLMs, rule-based systems, and fine-tuned classifiers. Our results reveal that
the task remains highly challenging. We release Misviz, Misviz-synth, and the
accompanying code.

### [59] [Not All Parameters Are Created Equal: Smart Isolation Boosts Fine-Tuning Performance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21741)
*Yao Wang,Di Liang,Minlong Peng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Core Parameter Isolation Fine-Tuning (CPI-FT) to address task interference and forgetting during supervised fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study is motivated by the challenges in supervised fine-tuning of LLMs, specifically the "seesaw phenomenon," where indiscriminate parameter updates enhance certain tasks but degrade others.

Method: The proposed CPI-FT framework involves: identifying core parameter regions through independent task-specific fine-tuning, clustering tasks based on core region overlap, and combining core and non-core parameters with techniques like Spherical Linear Interpolation (SLERP). A lightweight pipelined fine-tuning phase is introduced to prevent catastrophic forgetting.

Result: Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks validate the approach, showcasing reduced task interference and forgetting. It outperforms standard multi-task and multi-stage fine-tuning methods.

Conclusion: CPI-FT effectively addresses the seesaw phenomenon in LLM fine-tuning, demonstrating its superior performance in multi-task learning scenarios.

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is a pivotal approach to adapting large language
models (LLMs) for downstream tasks; however, performance often suffers from the
``seesaw phenomenon'', where indiscriminate parameter updates yield progress on
certain tasks at the expense of others. To address this challenge, we propose a
novel \emph{Core Parameter Isolation Fine-Tuning} (CPI-FT) framework.
Specifically, we first independently fine-tune the LLM on each task to identify
its core parameter regions by quantifying parameter update magnitudes. Tasks
with similar core regions are then grouped based on region overlap, forming
clusters for joint modeling. We further introduce a parameter fusion technique:
for each task, core parameters from its individually fine-tuned model are
directly transplanted into a unified backbone, while non-core parameters from
different tasks are smoothly integrated via Spherical Linear Interpolation
(SLERP), mitigating destructive interference. A lightweight, pipelined SFT
training phase using mixed-task data is subsequently employed, while freezing
core regions from prior tasks to prevent catastrophic forgetting. Extensive
experiments on multiple public benchmarks demonstrate that our approach
significantly alleviates task interference and forgetting, consistently
outperforming vanilla multi-task and multi-stage fine-tuning baselines.

*Diane Tchuindjo,Omar Khattab*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses challenges in reasoning-intensive regression (RiR) and proposes a method, MENTAT, which improves performance by 65% over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how large language models (LLMs) perform in complex reasoning tasks involving numerical properties from text, especially in scenarios with limited task-specific data and compute resources.

Method: Benchmarking three realistic RiR problems and introducing MENTAT, a model combining batch-reflective prompt optimization and neural ensemble learning.

Result: MENTAT demonstrated up to a 65% improvement compared to traditional approaches like prompting frozen LLMs and finetuning Transformer encoders.

Conclusion: While MENTAT significantly enhances RiR performance, challenges remain, and further advancements in the field are necessary.

Abstract: AI researchers and practitioners increasingly apply large language models
(LLMs) to what we call reasoning-intensive regression (RiR), i.e. deducing
subtle numerical properties from text. Unlike standard language regression
tasks, e.g. for sentiment or similarity, RiR often appears instead in ad-hoc
problems like rubric-based scoring or domain-specific retrieval, where much
deeper analysis of text is required while only limited task-specific training
data and computation are available. We cast three realistic problems as RiR
tasks to establish an initial benchmark, and use that to test our hypothesis
that prompting frozen LLMs and finetuning Transformer encoders via gradient
descent will both often struggle in RiR. We then propose MENTAT, a simple and
lightweight method that combines batch-reflective prompt optimization with
neural ensemble learning. MENTAT achieves up to 65% improvement over both
baselines, though substantial room remains for future advances in RiR.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study proposes PiCSAR, a training-free method to enhance the accuracy of large reasoning models by selecting candidate solutions with high log-likelihood scores of reasoning and answers, achieving substantial performance improvements on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge in reasoning tasks is to design a scoring function capable of identifying correct reasoning sequences without having direct access to ground-truth answers.

Method: PiCSAR, a training-free system, scores solution candidates based on the joint log-likelihood of their reasoning chains and final answers, which is further decomposed into reasoning and answer confidence.

Result: PiCSAR delivers significant accuracy improvements (+10.18 on MATH500, +9.81 on AIME2025), outperforming baselines with fewer samples in most comparisons.

Conclusion: Correct reasoning chains are associated with higher reasoning and answer confidence, validating the effectiveness of the PiCSAR scoring method.

Abstract: Best-of-n sampling improves the accuracy of large language models (LLMs) and
large reasoning models (LRMs) by generating multiple candidate solutions and
selecting the one with the highest reward. The key challenge for reasoning
tasks is designing a scoring function that can identify correct reasoning
chains without access to ground-truth answers. We propose Probabilistic
Confidence Selection And Ranking (PiCSAR): a simple, training-free method that
scores each candidate generation using the joint log-likelihood of the
reasoning and final answer. The joint log-likelihood of the reasoning and final
answer naturally decomposes into reasoning confidence and answer confidence.
PiCSAR achieves substantial gains across diverse benchmarks (+10.18 on MATH500,
+9.81 on AIME2025), outperforming baselines with at least 2x fewer samples in
16 out of 20 comparisons. Our analysis reveals that correct reasoning chains
exhibit significantly higher reasoning and answer confidence, justifying the
effectiveness of PiCSAR.

Result: Queries were performed in milliseconds to under 2 seconds, showcasing the framework's capability for fast dataset indexing and searching.

Conclusion: The study underscores the importance of real-time dataset analysis for improving AI systems' safety and accountability.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) rely heavily on web-scale datasets like Common
Crawl, which provides over 80\% of training data for some modern models.
However, the indiscriminate nature of web crawling raises challenges in data
quality, safety, and ethics. Despite the critical importance of training data
quality, prior research on harmful content has been limited to small samples
due to computational constraints. This project presents a framework for

pipeline. We apply it to SwissAI's FineWeb-2 corpus (1.5TB, four languages),
achieving fast query performance--most searches in milliseconds, all under 2
seconds. Our work demonstrates real-time dataset analysis, offering practical
tools for safer, more accountable AI systems.

*Alireza Golkarieh,Kiana Kiashemshaki,Sajjad Rezvani Boroujeni*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study explores deep learning for classifying dental conditions in panoramic X-ray images, finding hybrid CNN-Random Forest models perform best.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop automated methods for identifying dental conditions in X-ray images and improve diagnostic support.

Method: The study used a dataset of 1,512 annotated dental X-rays and evaluated custom CNNs, hybrid CNN-classifiers, and fine-tuned pre-trained models through 5-fold cross-validation.

Result: The hybrid CNN-Random Forest model achieved the highest accuracy at 85.4%, outperforming pre-trained models and custom CNNs.

Conclusion: Hybrid models combining CNN feature extraction with ensemble classifiers are effective for dental diagnostics but require larger datasets and clinical validation.

Abstract: This study investigates deep learning methods for automated classification of
dental conditions in panoramic X-ray images. A dataset of 1,512 radiographs
with 11,137 expert-verified annotations across four conditions fillings,
cavities, implants, and impacted teeth was used. After preprocessing and class
balancing, three approaches were evaluated: a custom convolutional neural
network (CNN), hybrid models combining CNN feature extraction with traditional
classifiers, and fine-tuned pre-trained architectures. Experiments employed 5
fold cross validation with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score as
evaluation metrics. The hybrid CNN Random Forest model achieved the highest
performance with 85.4% accuracy, surpassing the custom CNN baseline of 74.3%.
Among pre-trained models, VGG16 performed best at 82.3% accuracy, followed by
Xception and ResNet50. Results show that hybrid models improve discrimination
of morphologically similar conditions and provide efficient, reliable
performance. These findings suggest that combining CNN-based feature extraction
with ensemble classifiers offers a practical path toward automated dental
diagnostic support, while also highlighting the need for larger datasets and
further clinical validation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Identify and tackle the issue of Attention Leakage in large-scale image generation for zero-shot appearance transfer.

Method: Introduces Q-Align, which employs Query-Query alignment, Key-Value rearrangement, and Attention refinement.

Result: Q-Align significantly improves appearance fidelity and maintains competitive structure preservation in experiments.

Conclusion: Q-Align successfully enhances semantic alignment and mitigates Attention Leakage in image transfer tasks.

Abstract: We observe that zero-shot appearance transfer with large-scale image
generation models faces a significant challenge: Attention Leakage. This
challenge arises when the semantic mapping between two images is captured by
the Query-Key alignment. To tackle this issue, we introduce Q-Align, utilizing
Query-Query alignment to mitigate attention leakage and improve the semantic
alignment in zero-shot appearance transfer. Q-Align incorporates three core
contributions: (1) Query-Query alignment, facilitating the sophisticated
spatial semantic mapping between two images; (2) Key-Value rearrangement,
enhancing feature correspondence through realignment; and (3) Attention
refinement using rearranged keys and values to maintain semantic consistency.
We validate the effectiveness of Q-Align through extensive experiments and
analysis, and Q-Align outperforms state-of-the-art methods in appearance
fidelity while maintaining competitive structure preservation.

*Xurui Peng,Hong Liu,Chenqian Yan,Rui Ma,Fangmin Chen,Xing Wang,Zhihua Wu,Songwei Liu,Mingbao Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces ERTACache, a caching framework for diffusion models that speeds up inference by 2x while maintaining or improving visual quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models require iterative processes for inference, making computation costly. The motivation is to develop a caching solution that accelerates this process without degrading output quality.

Method: ERTACache addresses caching errors through residual profiling to select reusable steps, dynamic adjustment of integration intervals, and a closed-form residual linearization model to approximate errors.

Result: ERTACache enables up to 2x speedup in inference while maintaining or improving output quality across various benchmarks, including video generation with the state-of-the-art Wan2.1 model.

Conclusion: ERTACache demonstrates that principled caching can significantly enhance efficiency in diffusion models without compromising quality. The open-source code offers practical utility for the research community.

Abstract: Diffusion models suffer from substantial computational overhead due to their
inherently iterative inference process. While feature caching offers a
promising acceleration strategy by reusing intermediate outputs across
timesteps, naive reuse often incurs noticeable quality degradation. In this
work, we formally analyze the cumulative error introduced by caching and
decompose it into two principal components: feature shift error, caused by
inaccuracies in cached outputs, and step amplification error, which arises from
error propagation under fixed timestep schedules. To address these issues, we
propose ERTACache, a principled caching framework that jointly rectifies both
error types. Our method employs an offline residual profiling stage to identify
reusable steps, dynamically adjusts integration intervals via a
trajectory-aware correction coefficient, and analytically approximates
cache-induced errors through a closed-form residual linearization model.
Together, these components enable accurate and efficient sampling under
aggressive cache reuse. Extensive experiments across standard image and video
generation benchmarks show that ERTACache achieves up to 2x inference speedup
while consistently preserving or even improving visual quality. Notably, on the
state-of-the-art Wan2.1 video diffusion model, ERTACache delivers 2x
acceleration with minimal VBench degradation, effectively maintaining baseline
fidelity while significantly improving efficiency. The code is available at

### [67] [Video-LLMs with Temporal Visual Screening](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21094)
*Zheyu Fan,Jiateng Liu,Yuji Zhang,Zihan Wang,Yi R.,Fung,Manling Li,Heng Ji*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Current Video Large Language Models (Video-LLMs) struggle with fine-grained temporal reasoning. The authors propose Temporal Visual Screening (TVS), a task to better align queries and video segments. They introduce TVS benchmarks and show it greatly improves performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video-LLMs face challenges in processing fine-grained temporal segments due to sparse frame sampling and inadequate inter-frame reasoning during training.

Method: The authors propose TVS, a modular preprocessing task that aligns video queries with key segments by filtering focus-critical segments, reconstructing queries to their essential form, and ensuring answer consistency. It is adaptable for both training and inference pipelines.

Result: They demonstrate TVS's effectiveness through experimental results, achieving a 0.47 F-1 score improvement on video trimming and relative gains of 7.33% in training and 34.6% in inference.

Conclusion: TVS optimizes temporal reasoning in Video-LLMs, showing significant improvements on tasks that benefit from better alignment between video content and queries.

Abstract: Humans naturally perform temporal screening by dragging the progress bar and
focusing on salient temporal segments, but current Video Large Language Models
(Video-LLMs) struggle to capture fine-grained temporal semantics due to sparse
frame sampling and insufficient inter-frame reasoning supervision during their
training. To address this, Inspired by well-established cognitive science
principles, we propose Temporal Visual Screening (TVS), a new task that
universally pre-processes video question answering and instruction tuning data
by: (1) retaining focus-critical video segments, (2) synchronously
reconstructing queries to their most direct form while preserving answer
consistency, and (3) keeping the invariance and consistency for any possible
answer. TVS is formulated as a modular front-end adapter task that can be
seamlessly integrated into both Video Instruction Tuning (training) and Video
Question Answering (inference) pipelines. TVS optimizes distribution of
reasoning burden and cognitive load; during training, it aligns queries with
focus-critical visual information; at inference, it enables query-aware segment
focus and streamlined query representations. In particular, we curate the first
benchmark for TVS and propose ReSimplifyIt, a baseline outperforming prior
approaches on seemingly similar tasks by 0.47 in F-1 score on video trimming
while achieving competitive query rewriting performance. Experiments
demonstrate that incorporating TVS yields relative gains of 7.33% (training)
and 34.6% (inference), demonstrating the effectiveness of temporal information
screening for improving video-language understanding.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces ROBUST-MIPS, a surgical tool dataset focusing on skeletal pose annotations to improve tool localisation performance, which includes segmentation tasks and benchmark models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Limited availability of annotated datasets hinders deep learning advancements in tool localisation for surgeries. This paper proposes skeletal pose annotations as a more efficient solution compared to traditional segmentation.

Method: The authors enrich the existing ROBUST-MIS dataset to include tool poses and instance segmentation data, allowing comparison and joint exploration of annotation styles. They also provide benchmark models and annotation software.

Result: Skeletal pose annotations demonstrated high-quality results for surgical tool localisation when tested with pose estimation methods.

Conclusion: Skeletal pose annotations strike a better balance between semantic detail and ease of annotation, making them a promising approach to improving surgical tool localisation workflows.

Abstract: Localisation of surgical tools constitutes a foundational building block for
computer-assisted interventional technologies. Works in this field typically
focus on training deep learning models to perform segmentation tasks.
Performance of learning-based approaches is limited by the availability of
diverse annotated data. We argue that skeletal pose annotations are a more
efficient annotation approach for surgical tools, striking a balance between
richness of semantic information and ease of annotation, thus allowing for
accelerated growth of available annotated data. To encourage adoption of this
annotation style, we present, ROBUST-MIPS, a combined tool pose and tool
instance segmentation dataset derived from the existing ROBUST-MIS dataset. Our
enriched dataset facilitates the joint study of these two annotation styles and
allow head-to-head comparison on various downstream tasks. To demonstrate the
adequacy of pose annotations for surgical tool localisation, we set up a simple
benchmark using popular pose estimation methods and observe high-quality
results. To ease adoption, together with the dataset, we release our benchmark
models and custom tool pose annotation software.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Safe-Control, a plug-and-play safety mechanism designed to mitigate unsafe content generation in Text-to-Image (T2I) models, outperforming existing safety measures while maintaining content quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address safety concerns stemming from the misuse or abuse of T2I generation models despite their technological advancements.

Method: Introduced Safe-Control, a plug-and-play safety patch that uses data-driven strategies and safety-aware conditions for injecting safety control signals into pre-existing T2I models without requiring extensive modifications.

Result: Extensive evaluations on six diverse T2I models showed that Safe-Control notably reduced unsafe content generation to 7% compared to ~20% for existing methods, while preserving image quality and text alignment.

Conclusion: Safe-Control effectively addresses safety concerns in T2I models, outperforming seven state-of-the-art mechanisms in reducing unsafe content generation, and its plug-and-play nature ensures adaptability and broader applicability.

Abstract: Despite the advancements in Text-to-Image (T2I) generation models, their
potential for misuse or even abuse raises serious safety concerns. Model
developers have made tremendous efforts to introduce safety mechanisms that can
address these concerns in T2I models. However, the existing safety mechanisms,
whether external or internal, either remain susceptible to evasion under
distribution shifts or require extensive model-specific adjustments. To address
these limitations, we introduce Safe-Control, an innovative plug-and-play
safety patch designed to mitigate unsafe content generation in T2I models.
Using data-driven strategies and safety-aware conditions, Safe-Control injects
safety control signals into the locked T2I model, acting as an update in a
patch-like manner. Model developers can also construct various safety patches
to meet the evolving safety requirements, which can be flexibly merged into a
single, unified patch. Its plug-and-play design further ensures adaptability,
making it compatible with other T2I models of similar denoising architecture.
We conduct extensive evaluations on six diverse and public T2I models.
Empirical results highlight that Safe-Control is effective in reducing unsafe
content generation across six diverse T2I models with similar generative
architectures, yet it successfully maintains the quality and text alignment of
benign images. Compared to seven state-of-the-art safety mechanisms, including
both external and internal defenses, Safe-Control significantly outperforms all
baselines in reducing unsafe content generation. For example, it reduces the
probability of unsafe content generation to 7%, compared to approximately 20%
for most baseline methods, under both unsafe prompts and the latest adversarial
attacks.

TL;DR: GENNAV is a system designed to detect and segment target regions from language instructions and camera input in mobility scenarios, excelling in handling stuff-type regions and diverse target settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with detecting and segmenting ambiguous stuff-type target regions, especially when faced with situations including no-targets, single-targets, or multiple targets.

Method: Developed GENNAV, a system that predicts target existence and generates segmentation masks for multiple stuff-type target regions. Performance evaluation was done using the new GRiN-Drive benchmark and real-world testing.

Result: GENNAV outperformed baseline approaches in both controlled benchmark tests and real-world experiments across urban settings.

Conclusion: GENNAV is robust and effective for detecting and segmenting target regions, demonstrating strong zero-shot transfer capabilities in diverse environments.

Abstract: We focus on the task of identifying the location of target regions from a
natural language instruction and a front camera image captured by a mobility.
This task is challenging because it requires both existence prediction and
segmentation, particularly for stuff-type target regions with ambiguous
boundaries. Existing methods often underperform in handling stuff-type target
regions, in addition to absent or multiple targets. To overcome these
limitations, we propose GENNAV, which predicts target existence and generates
segmentation masks for multiple stuff-type target regions. To evaluate GENNAV,
we constructed a novel benchmark called GRiN-Drive, which includes three
distinct types of samples: no-target, single-target, and multi-target. GENNAV
achieved superior performance over baseline methods on standard evaluation
metrics. Furthermore, we conducted real-world experiments with four automobiles
operated in five geographically distinct urban areas to validate its zero-shot
transfer performance. In these experiments, GENNAV outperformed baseline
methods and demonstrated its robustness across diverse real-world environments.

TL;DR: The paper introduces R-4B, an auto-thinking Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) that adaptively decides when to engage complex reasoning, achieving strong performance across benchmarks with lower computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiency of redundant thinking processes in MLLMs for simple problems that do not require complex reasoning.

Method: R-4B incorporates Bi-mode Annealing to provide both thinking and non-thinking capabilities, combined with Bi-mode Policy Optimization (BPO) for accurate activation of the thinking mode.

Result: R-4B demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across 25 challenging benchmarks, outperforming existing MLLMs like Qwen2.5-VL-7B and rivaling larger models such as Kimi-VL-A3B-Thinking-2506 (16B) with reduced computational costs.

Conclusion: R-4B represents a significant advancement in MLLMs by efficiently adapting its reasoning process to problem complexity while maintaining high accuracy and lowering computational demands.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) equipped with step-by-step thinking
capabilities have demonstrated remarkable performance on complex reasoning
problems. However, this thinking process is redundant for simple problems
solvable without complex reasoning. To address this inefficiency, we propose
R-4B, an auto-thinking MLLM, which can adaptively decide when to think based on
problem complexity. The central idea of R-4B is to empower the model with both
thinking and non-thinking capabilities using bi-mode annealing, and apply
Bi-mode Policy Optimization~(BPO) to improve the model's accuracy in
determining whether to activate the thinking process. Specifically, we first
train the model on a carefully curated dataset spanning various topics, which
contains samples from both thinking and non-thinking modes. Then it undergoes a
second phase of training under an improved GRPO framework, where the policy
model is forced to generate responses from both modes for each input query.
Experimental results show that R-4B achieves state-of-the-art performance
across 25 challenging benchmarks. It outperforms Qwen2.5-VL-7B in most tasks
and achieves performance comparable to larger models such as
Kimi-VL-A3B-Thinking-2506 (16B) on reasoning-intensive benchmarks with lower
computational cost.

Conclusion: Mamba-based fusion architectures can significantly improve multimodal object detection in challenging, visually degraded environments.

Abstract: Detecting hidden or partially concealed objects remains a fundamental
challenge in multimodal environments, where factors like occlusion, camouflage,
and lighting variations significantly hinder performance. Traditional RGB-based
detection methods often fail under such adverse conditions, motivating the need
for more robust, modality-agnostic approaches. In this work, we present
HiddenObject, a fusion framework that integrates RGB, thermal, and depth data
using a Mamba-based fusion mechanism. Our method captures complementary signals
across modalities, enabling enhanced detection of obscured or camouflaged
targets. Specifically, the proposed approach identifies modality-specific
features and fuses them in a unified representation that generalizes well
across challenging scenarios. We validate HiddenObject across multiple
benchmark datasets, demonstrating state-of-the-art or competitive performance
compared to existing methods. These results highlight the efficacy of our
fusion design and expose key limitations in current unimodal and na\"ive fusion
strategies. More broadly, our findings suggest that Mamba-based fusion
architectures can significantly advance the field of multimodal object
detection, especially under visually degraded or complex conditions.

*Ao Shen,Xueming Fu,Junfeng Jiang,Qiang Zeng,Ye Tang,Zhengming Chen,Luming Nong,Feng Wang,S. Kevin Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents RadGS-Reg, a novel framework for CT/X-ray registration addressing accuracy and real-time performance challenges using novel reconstruction techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome challenges in CT/X-ray registration like spatial information loss, domain gap, and challenges posed by traditional methods when dealing with noisy X-rays.

Method: The approach involves RadGS-Reg, which integrates joint 3D Radiative Gaussian reconstruction and 3D/3D registration alongside mechanisms like Counterfactual Attention Learning (CAL) and patient-specific pre-training.

Result: Experiments using in-house datasets show state-of-the-art performance, surpassing current methods for these tasks.

Conclusion: RadGS-Reg offers a significant improvement in CT/X-ray registration through innovative techniques, and its success is showcased through experiments. The code is publicly available for further validation and integration.

Abstract: Computed Tomography (CT)/X-ray registration in image-guided navigation
remains challenging because of its stringent requirements for high accuracy and
real-time performance. Traditional "render and compare" methods, relying on
iterative projection and comparison, suffer from spatial information loss and
domain gap. 3D reconstruction from biplanar X-rays supplements spatial and
shape information for 2D/3D registration, but current methods are limited by
dense-view requirements and struggles with noisy X-rays. To address these
limitations, we introduce RadGS-Reg, a novel framework for vertebral-level
CT/X-ray registration through joint 3D Radiative Gaussians (RadGS)
reconstruction and 3D/3D registration. Specifically, our biplanar X-rays
vertebral RadGS reconstruction module explores learning-based RadGS
reconstruction method with a Counterfactual Attention Learning (CAL) mechanism,
focusing on vertebral regions in noisy X-rays. Additionally, a patient-specific
pre-training strategy progressively adapts the RadGS-Reg from simulated to real
data while simultaneously learning vertebral shape prior knowledge. Experiments
on in-house datasets demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance for both
tasks, surpassing existing methods. The code is available at:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SYNBUILD-3D, a dataset of 6.2 million synthetic 3D residential buildings at LoD4, designed for generating accurate 3D building models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of large-scale annotated datasets for generating accurate 3D building models for applications like architecture, energy simulation, and navigation.

Method: The authors created SYNBUILD-3D, a diverse dataset of synthetic 3D residential buildings represented through three modalities: semantically enriched 3D wireframes, floor plan images, and LiDAR-like roof point clouds.

Result: SYNBUILD-3D provides over 6.2 million synthetic 3D buildings with semantic annotations derived from floor plans, supporting the development of novel AI algorithms for semantic-geometric consistent 3D modeling.

Conclusion: The publicly released SYNBUILD-3D dataset paves the way for advancing automatic and semantically-enriched 3D building modeling through generative AI algorithms.

Abstract: 3D building models are critical for applications in architecture, energy
simulation, and navigation. Yet, generating accurate and semantically rich 3D
buildings automatically remains a major challenge due to the lack of
large-scale annotated datasets in the public domain. Inspired by the success of
synthetic data in computer vision, we introduce SYNBUILD-3D, a large, diverse,
and multi-modal dataset of over 6.2 million synthetic 3D residential buildings
at Level of Detail (LoD) 4. In the dataset, each building is represented
through three distinct modalities: a semantically enriched 3D wireframe graph
at LoD 4 (Modality I), the corresponding floor plan images (Modality II), and a
LiDAR-like roof point cloud (Modality III). The semantic annotations for each
building wireframe are derived from the corresponding floor plan images and
include information on rooms, doors, and windows. Through its tri-modal nature,
future work can use SYNBUILD-3D to develop novel generative AI algorithms that
automate the creation of 3D building models at LoD 4, subject to predefined
floor plan layouts and roof geometries, while enforcing semantic-geometric
consistency. Dataset and code samples are publicly available at

### [75] [Radially Distorted Homographies, Revisited](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21190)
*Mårten Wadenbäck,Marcus Valtonen Örnhag,Johan Edstedt*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a unified approach for solving radially distorted homographies in three distinct lens distortion configurations, offering faster and accurate minimal solvers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Homography estimation is crucial in computer vision, but real images often suffer from radial distortion caused by camera lenses. Current methods address the distortion cases separately, and there is a need for a unified solution.

Method: The paper proposes a novel unified method to handle three configurations of radial distortion (distortion in one image, identical distortion in two images, independent distortion in two images). The authors construct minimal solvers that efficiently address these cases.

Result: The proposed solvers outperform state-of-the-art solvers in speed while maintaining comparable accuracy, tested through benchmarks including fisheye camera images.

Conclusion: The unified approach to radially distorted homographies demonstrates improved computational efficiency and reliability across various distortion scenarios. Source code will be released upon paper acceptance.

Abstract: Homographies are among the most prevalent transformations occurring in
geometric computer vision and projective geometry, and homography estimation is
consequently a crucial step in a wide assortment of computer vision tasks. When
working with real images, which are often afflicted with geometric distortions
caused by the camera lens, it may be necessary to determine both the homography
and the lens distortion-particularly the radial component, called radial
distortion-simultaneously to obtain anything resembling useful estimates. When
considering a homography with radial distortion between two images, there are
three conceptually distinct configurations for the radial distortion; (i)
distortion in only one image, (ii) identical distortion in the two images, and
(iii) independent distortion in the two images. While these cases have been
addressed separately in the past, the present paper provides a novel and
unified approach to solve all three cases. We demonstrate how the proposed
approach can be used to construct new fast, stable, and accurate minimal
solvers for radially distorted homographies. In all three cases, our proposed
solvers are faster than the existing state-of-the-art solvers while maintaining
similar accuracy. The solvers are tested on well-established benchmarks
including images taken with fisheye cameras. The source code for our solvers
will be made available in the event our paper is accepted for publication.

*Zhenghao He,Sanchit Sinha,Guangzhi Xiong,Aidong Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Global Concept Activation Vector (GCAV) framework to unify Concept Activation Vectors (CAVs) into a consistent representation for cross-layer comparisons in deep neural networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CAVs help interpret deep neural networks by quantifying sensitivity to human-defined concepts but suffer from inconsistencies across layers, limiting cross-layer reliability.

Method: The authors use contrastive learning to align concept representations across layers and an attention-based fusion mechanism to create a globally integrated CAV.

Result: Experiments show reduced variance in TCAV scores, enhanced concept localization, and improved robustness against adversarial attacks using GCAV.

Conclusion: GCAV provides a stable, robust, and interpretable means of understanding how deep learning models encode human concepts, integrating cross-layer information effectively.

Abstract: Concept Activation Vectors (CAVs) provide a powerful approach for
interpreting deep neural networks by quantifying their sensitivity to
human-defined concepts. However, when computed independently at different
layers, CAVs often exhibit inconsistencies, making cross-layer comparisons
unreliable. To address this issue, we propose the Global Concept Activation
Vector (GCAV), a novel framework that unifies CAVs into a single, semantically
consistent representation. Our method leverages contrastive learning to align
concept representations across layers and employs an attention-based fusion
mechanism to construct a globally integrated CAV. By doing so, our method
significantly reduces the variance in TCAV scores while preserving concept
relevance, ensuring more stable and reliable concept attributions. To evaluate
the effectiveness of GCAV, we introduce Testing with Global Concept Activation
Vectors (TGCAV) as a method to apply TCAV to GCAV-based representations. We
conduct extensive experiments on multiple deep neural networks, demonstrating
that our method effectively mitigates concept inconsistency across layers,
enhances concept localization, and improves robustness against adversarial
perturbations. By integrating cross-layer information into a coherent
framework, our method offers a more comprehensive and interpretable
understanding of how deep learning models encode human-defined concepts. Code
and models are available at https://github.com/Zhenghao-He/GCAV.

### [77] [Generalizable Object Re-Identification via Visual In-Context Prompting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21222)
*Zhizhong Huang,Xiaoming Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Visual In-Context Prompting (VICP), a framework designed to generalize object re-identification (ReID) models to unseen categories using in-context prompts without model retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing ReID methods are domain-specific, lack generalization, and demand costly labeled data for new categories. Self-supervised learning methods are insufficient as they struggle to capture identity-sensitive features critical for ReID.

Method: VICP combines large language models (LLMs) with vision foundation models (VFMs) to infer semantic identity rules and extract ID-discriminative features via dynamic visual prompts. This approach uses in-context examples for generalization without requiring retraining.

Result: VICP achieves superior performance compared to baselines on unseen categories, backed by experiments on the new ShopID10K dataset and other diverse ReID benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed framework enables ReID models to generalize to novel object categories without parameter adaptation, offering a promising alternative to costly retraining and annotation efforts.

Abstract: Current object re-identification (ReID) methods train domain-specific models
(e.g., for persons or vehicles), which lack generalization and demand costly
labeled data for new categories. While self-supervised learning reduces
annotation needs by learning instance-wise invariance, it struggles to capture
\textit{identity-sensitive} features critical for ReID. This paper proposes
Visual In-Context Prompting~(VICP), a novel framework where models trained on
seen categories can directly generalize to unseen novel categories using only
\textit{in-context examples} as prompts, without requiring parameter
adaptation. VICP synergizes LLMs and vision foundation models~(VFM): LLMs infer
semantic identity rules from few-shot positive/negative pairs through
task-specific prompting, which then guides a VFM (\eg, DINO) to extract
ID-discriminative features via \textit{dynamic visual prompts}. By aligning
LLM-derived semantic concepts with the VFM's pre-trained prior, VICP enables
generalization to novel categories, eliminating the need for dataset-specific
retraining. To support evaluation, we introduce ShopID10K, a dataset of 10K
object instances from e-commerce platforms, featuring multi-view images and
cross-domain testing. Experiments on ShopID10K and diverse ReID benchmarks
demonstrate that VICP outperforms baselines by a clear margin on unseen
categories. Code is available at https://github.com/Hzzone/VICP.

### [78] [Lightweight MRI-Based Automated Segmentation of Pancreatic Cancer with Auto3DSeg](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21227)
*Keshav Jha,William Sharp,Dominic LaBella*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study explores the challenges of automated MRI-based pancreatic tumor segmentation due to dataset variability and size, using SegResNet models for analysis. Results showed moderate performance, with a Dice Similarity Coefficient of 0.56 for Task 1 and 0.33 for Task 2, pointing to the need for larger, standardized datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation lies in addressing the critical need to accurately automate the segmentation of pancreatic tumors for better diagnosis and treatment planning, amidst challenges posed by limited datasets and anatomical variability.

Method: The method utilized SegResNet models within the Auto3DSeg framework, employing a 5-fold cross-validation strategy with STAPLE ensembling over anatomically focused regions. Two MRI datasets (Task 1: 91 T1-weighted; Task 2: 50 T2-weighted) were used for evaluation.

Result: For Task 1, segmentation achieved a DSC of 0.56, and for Task 2, it achieved 0.33. Other metrics like Hausdorff Distance and RMSE indicated lower performance, particularly for Task 2. Performance differences were attributed to varying MRI sequences and dataset size.

Conclusion: The study underscores the technical challenges and moderate success of automated pancreatic tumor segmentation, emphasizing the necessity of larger, standardized datasets for improving outcomes and implementing reliable clinical applications.

Abstract: Accurate delineation of pancreatic tumors is critical for diagnosis,
treatment planning, and outcome assessment, yet automated segmentation remains
challenging due to anatomical variability and limited dataset availability. In
this study, SegResNet models, as part of the Auto3DSeg architecture, were
trained and evaluated on two MRI-based pancreatic tumor segmentation tasks as
part of the 2025 PANTHER Challenge. Algorithm methodology included 5-fold
cross-validation with STAPLE ensembling after focusing on an anatomically
relevant region-of-interest. The Pancreatic Tumor Segmentation on Diagnostic
MRI task 1 training set included 91 T1-weighted arterial contrast-enhanced MRI
with expert annotated pancreas and tumor labels. The Pancreatic Tumor
Segmentation on MR-Linac task 2 training set used 50 T2-weighted MR-Linac cases
with expert annotated pancreas and tumor labels. Algorithm-automated
segmentation performance of pancreatic tumor was assessed using Dice Similarity
Coefficient (DSC), 5 mm DSC, 95th percentile Hausdorff Distance (HD95), Mean
Average Surface Distance (MASD), and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). For Task 1,
the algorithm achieved a DSC of 0.56, 5 mm DSC of 0.73, HD95 of 41.1 mm, MASD
of 26.0 mm, and RMSE of 5164 mm. For Task 2, performance decreased, with a DSC
of 0.33, 5 mm DSC of 0.50, HD95 of 20.1 mm, MASD of 7.2 mm, and RMSE of 17,203
mm. These findings illustrate the challenges of MRI-based pancreatic tumor
segmentation with small datasets, highlighting variability introduced by
different MRI sequences. Despite modest performance, the results demonstrate
potential for automated delineation and emphasize the need for larger,
standardized MRI datasets to improve model robustness and clinical utility.

*Yidong Zhao,Peter Kellman,Hui Xue,Tongyun Yang,Yi Zhang,Yuchi Han,Orlando Simonetti,Qian Tao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Reverse Imaging leverages spin-property estimation via a diffusion model to enhance cardiac MRI segmentation generalization across different imaging protocols.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The struggle of pretrained models to generalize across diverse cardiac MRI imaging sequences due to contrast variations motivated this work.

Method: Using a physics-driven approach, the authors infer spin properties from MRI data, utilizing a diffusion-generative model trained on the mSASHA dataset for meaningful image augmentation.

Result: The proposed approach enables consistent and accurate segmentation of cardiac MRI data, even with diverse imaging protocols.

Conclusion: Reverse Imaging addresses generalization gaps in cardiac MRI by introducing a spin-property-based framework, offering interpretable and flexible solutions for segmentation tasks.

Abstract: Pretrained segmentation models for cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
struggle to generalize across different imaging sequences due to significant
variations in image contrast. These variations arise from changes in imaging
protocols, yet the same fundamental spin properties, including proton density,
T1, and T2 values, govern all acquired images. With this core principle, we
introduce Reverse Imaging, a novel physics-driven method for cardiac MRI data
augmentation and domain adaptation to fundamentally solve the generalization
problem. Our method reversely infers the underlying spin properties from
observed cardiac MRI images, by solving ill-posed nonlinear inverse problems
regularized by the prior distribution of spin properties. We acquire this "spin
prior" by learning a generative diffusion model from the multiparametric
SAturation-recovery single-SHot acquisition sequence (mSASHA) dataset, which
offers joint cardiac T1 and T2 maps. Our method enables approximate but
meaningful spin-property estimates from MR images, which provide an
interpretable "latent variable" that lead to highly flexible image synthesis of
arbitrary novel sequences. We show that Reverse Imaging enables highly accurate
segmentation across vastly different image contrasts and imaging protocols,
realizing wide-spectrum generalization of cardiac MRI segmentation.

*Hsuan-I Ho,Chen Guo,Po-Chen Wu,Ivan Shugurov,Chengcheng Tang,Abhay Mittal,Sizhe An,Manuel Kaufmann,Linguang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces PHD, a method for personalized 3D human pose recovery that calibrates user-specific body shapes for better pose estimation, using a novel Point Diffusion Transformer and data-efficient synthetic training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of user-agnostic 3D human pose recovery methods, which fail to incorporate individual body shapes and often misalign 2D and 3D constraints, reducing pose estimation accuracy.

Method: The proposed method calibrates a person's body shape first and then employs a personalized pose fitting process. It introduces a body shape-conditioned 3D pose prior modeled with a Point Diffusion Transformer, guided by a Point Distillation Sampling loss, and relies solely on synthetic data for training.

Result: The approach improves both pelvis-aligned pose accuracy and absolute pose accuracy while being data-efficient and integrating seamlessly with existing 3D pose estimators.

Conclusion: PHD offers an effective and data-efficient pipeline for personalized 3D human mesh recovery, significantly enhancing pose estimation accuracy by leveraging user-specific body shape information.

Abstract: We introduce PHD, a novel approach for personalized 3D human mesh recovery
(HMR) and body fitting that leverages user-specific shape information to
improve pose estimation accuracy from videos. Traditional HMR methods are
designed to be user-agnostic and optimized for generalization. While these
methods often refine poses using constraints derived from the 2D image to
improve alignment, this process compromises 3D accuracy by failing to jointly
account for person-specific body shapes and the plausibility of 3D poses. In
contrast, our pipeline decouples this process by first calibrating the user's
body shape and then employing a personalized pose fitting process conditioned
on that shape. To achieve this, we develop a body shape-conditioned 3D pose
prior, implemented as a Point Diffusion Transformer, which iteratively guides
the pose fitting via a Point Distillation Sampling loss. This learned 3D pose
prior effectively mitigates errors arising from an over-reliance on 2D
constraints. Consequently, our approach improves not only pelvis-aligned pose
accuracy but also absolute pose accuracy -- an important metric often
overlooked by prior work. Furthermore, our method is highly data-efficient,
requiring only synthetic data for training, and serves as a versatile
plug-and-play module that can be seamlessly integrated with existing 3D pose
estimators to enhance their performance. Project page:

*Yuquan Bi,Hongsong Wang,Xinli Shi,Zhipeng Gui,Jie Gui,Yuan Yan Tang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a framework to make 3D human pose estimation with diffusion models computationally efficient by employing hierarchical token pruning strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models excel at generating high-fidelity 3D human poses, but their iterative process and multi-hypothesis approach have significant computational costs.

Method: The proposed framework applies a Hierarchical Temporal Pruning strategy, including three stages: Temporal Correlation-Enhanced Pruning, Sparse-Focused Temporal MHSA, and Mask-Guided Pose Token Pruner.

Result: Compared to prior methods, the framework reduces training MACs by 38.5%, inference MACs by 56.8%, and improves inference speed by 81.1% while achieving state-of-the-art performance on datasets like Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP.

Conclusion: The study successfully balances computational efficiency and performance, offering a practical solution for improving 3D human pose estimation with diffusion models.

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated strong capabilities in generating
high-fidelity 3D human poses, yet their iterative nature and multi-hypothesis
requirements incur substantial computational cost. In this paper, we propose an
Efficient Diffusion-Based 3D Human Pose Estimation framework with a
Hierarchical Temporal Pruning (HTP) strategy, which dynamically prunes
redundant pose tokens across both frame and semantic levels while preserving
critical motion dynamics. HTP operates in a staged, top-down manner: (1)
Temporal Correlation-Enhanced Pruning (TCEP) identifies essential frames by
analyzing inter-frame motion correlations through adaptive temporal graph
construction; (2) Sparse-Focused Temporal MHSA (SFT MHSA) leverages the
resulting frame-level sparsity to reduce attention computation, focusing on
motion-relevant tokens; and (3) Mask-Guided Pose Token Pruner (MGPTP) performs
fine-grained semantic pruning via clustering, retaining only the most
informative pose tokens. Experiments on Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP show that
HTP reduces training MACs by 38.5\%, inference MACs by 56.8\%, and improves
inference speed by an average of 81.1\% compared to prior diffusion-based
methods, while achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Print2Volume, an innovative framework to synthesize realistic OCT-based 3D fingerprints from 2D images, addressing the scarcity of such datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to overcome the lack of large-scale public OCT fingerprint datasets, which impedes the development of advanced deep learning models.

Method: The method includes a three-stage process: 2D style transfer to mimic OCT scans, 3D structure expansion to create anatomical volumes, and realistic rendering using a 3D GAN.

Result: A synthetic dataset of 420,000 samples was created, demonstrating improved biometric recognition performance, with EER reduced from 15.62% to 2.50% after pre-training on synthetic data.

Conclusion: Print2Volume effectively addresses the issue of data scarcity, significantly improving recognition performance and accelerating biometric research.

Abstract: Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) enables the acquisition of
high-resolution, three-dimensional fingerprint data, capturing rich subsurface
structures for robust biometric recognition. However, the high cost and
time-consuming nature of OCT data acquisition have led to a scarcity of
large-scale public datasets, significantly hindering the development of
advanced algorithms, particularly data-hungry deep learning models. To address
this critical bottleneck, this paper introduces Print2Volume, a novel framework
for generating realistic, synthetic OCT-based 3D fingerprints from 2D
fingerprint image. Our framework operates in three sequential stages: (1) a 2D
style transfer module that converts a binary fingerprint into a grayscale
images mimicking the style of a Z-direction mean-projected OCT scan; (2) a 3D
Structure Expansion Network that extrapolates the 2D im-age into a plausible 3D
anatomical volume; and (3) an OCT Realism Refiner, based on a 3D GAN, that
renders the structural volume with authentic textures, speckle noise, and other
imaging characteristics. Using Print2Volume, we generated a large-scale
synthetic dataset of 420,000 samples. Quantitative experiments demonstrate the
high quality of our synthetic data and its significant impact on recognition
performance. By pre-training a recognition model on our synthetic data and
fine-tuning it on a small real-world dataset, we achieved a remarkable
reduction in the Equal Error Rate (EER) from 15.62% to 2.50% on the ZJUT-EIFD
benchmark, proving the effectiveness of our approach in overcoming data
scarcity.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This study introduces GLENDA, the first image dataset of its kind containing annotations of endometriosis for gynecologic laparoscopic surgery, aiding computer vision and machine learning advancements in medical image analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Analyzing surgical recordings post-surgery is currently time-consuming, and the lack of sufficient annotated sample data in the medical domain creates a bottleneck for advancing computer vision and machine learning techniques.

Method: The authors collaborated with leading medical experts to develop GLENDA, a high-quality image dataset with region-based annotations specific to endometriosis cases in gynecologic laparoscopic surgeries.

Result: GLENDA dataset was successfully created and made publicly available, providing a valuable resource for research in medical imaging and surgical video analysis.

Conclusion: The release of GLENDA enables significant improvements in automated analysis methods for gynecologic laparoscopy, potentially benefiting tasks like treatment planning, documentation, and medical education.

Abstract: Gynecologic laparoscopy as a type of minimally invasive surgery (MIS) is
performed via a live feed of a patient's abdomen surveying the insertion and
handling of various instruments for conducting treatment. Adopting this kind of
surgical intervention not only facilitates a great variety of treatments, the
possibility of recording said video streams is as well essential for numerous
post-surgical activities, such as treatment planning, case documentation and
education. Nonetheless, the process of manually analyzing surgical recordings,
as it is carried out in current practice, usually proves tediously
time-consuming. In order to improve upon this situation, more sophisticated
computer vision as well as machine learning approaches are actively developed.
Since most of such approaches heavily rely on sample data, which especially in
the medical field is only sparsely available, with this work we publish the
Gynecologic Laparoscopy ENdometriosis DAtaset (GLENDA) - an image dataset
containing region-based annotations of a common medical condition named
endometriosis, i.e. the dislocation of uterine-like tissue. The dataset is the
first of its kind and it has been created in collaboration with leading medical
experts in the field.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper evaluates the performance of a region-based fully convolutional network in segmenting and recognizing surgical instruments in laparoscopic gynecology videos.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of automatically indexing medical video archives for content-based search, given the complexity and specialized nature of surgical video content.

Method: Using a region-based fully convolutional network for (1) binary segmentation (distinguishing instruments from the background) and (2) multi-class recognition (identifying types of instruments).

Result: The model achieved high accuracy in segmenting surgical instruments but struggled to reliably recognize specific instruments due to their high visual similarity.

Conclusion: While segmentation of instruments is promising, recognizing specific types remains challenging, highlighting a need for further research on improving differentiation among visually similar surgical tools.

Abstract: Recorded videos from surgeries have become an increasingly important
information source for the field of medical endoscopy, since the recorded
footage shows every single detail of the surgery. However, while video
recording is straightforward these days, automatic content indexing - the basis
for content-based search in a medical video archive - is still a great
challenge due to the very special video content. In this work, we investigate
segmentation and recognition of surgical instruments in videos recorded from
laparoscopic gynecology. More precisely, we evaluate the achievable performance
of segmenting surgical instruments from their background by using a
region-based fully convolutional network for instance-aware (1) instrument
segmentation as well as (2) instrument recognition. While the first part
addresses only binary segmentation of instances (i.e., distinguishing between
instrument or background) we also investigate multi-class instrument
recognition (i.e., identifying the type of instrument). Our evaluation results
show that even with a moderately low number of training examples, we are able
to localize and segment instrument regions with a pretty high accuracy.
However, the results also reveal that determining the particular instrument is
still very challenging, due to the inherently high similarity of surgical
instruments.

Motivation: To improve self-supervised learning in remote sensing by leveraging large unlabeled datasets and addressing limitations of existing methods.

Method: Introduced SatDINO, a DINO-based contrastive self-supervised learning model tailored for satellite imagery. Enhancements include GSD encoding and adaptive view sampling.

Result: SatDINO outperformed state-of-the-art methods, demonstrated competitive performance across benchmarks, and an ablation study validated its components.

Conclusion: SatDINO advances representation learning for satellite imagery, offering robust performance and useful model enhancements.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning has emerged as a powerful tool for remote sensing,
where large amounts of unlabeled data are available. In this work, we
investigate the use of DINO, a contrastive self-supervised method, for
pretraining on remote sensing imagery. We introduce SatDINO, a model tailored
for representation learning in satellite imagery. Through extensive experiments
on multiple datasets in multiple testing setups, we demonstrate that SatDINO
outperforms other state-of-the-art methods based on much more common masked
autoencoders (MAE) and achieves competitive results in multiple benchmarks.
  We also provide a rigorous ablation study evaluating SatDINO's individual
components. Finally, we propose a few novel enhancements, such as a new way to
incorporate ground sample distance (GSD) encoding and adaptive view sampling.
These enhancements can be used independently on our SatDINO model. Our code and

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper discusses a new framework to generate standardized metadata for Whole Slide Images (WSIs) used in various fields, especially to assist AI-based analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of standardized metadata for WSI makes manual inspection impractical for large datasets, hindering efficient AI algorithm training and validation.

Method: The paper proposes generating a 2D index map and profiling mechanism for WSIs, with a tissue map organized into three layers: source, tissue type, and pathological alterations.

Result: The framework provides fine-grained, interoperable information about WSI content, improving cataloging and usability for tasks like ML and graph-based representations.

Conclusion: The approach enhances WSI collections with detailed, application-specific metadata, facilitating interoperability and broader applicability in pathology and related domains.

Abstract: A Whole Slide Image (WSI) is a high-resolution digital image created by
scanning an entire glass slide containing a biological specimen, such as tissue
sections or cell samples, at multiple magnifications. These images can be
viewed, analyzed, shared digitally, and are used today for Artificial
Intelligence (AI) algorithm development. WSIs are used in a variety of fields,
including pathology for diagnosing diseases and oncology for cancer research.
They are also utilized in neurology, veterinary medicine, hematology,
microbiology, dermatology, pharmacology, toxicology, immunology, and forensic
science.
  When assembling cohorts for the training or validation of an AI algorithm, it
is essential to know what is present on such a WSI. However, there is currently
no standard for this metadata, so such selection has mainly been done through
manual inspection, which is not suitable for large collections with several
million objects.
  We propose a general framework to generate a 2D index map for WSI and a
profiling mechanism for specific application domains. We demonstrate this
approach in the field of clinical pathology, using common syntax and semantics
to achieve interoperability between different catalogs.
  Our approach augments each WSI collection with a detailed tissue map that
provides fine-grained information about the WSI content. The tissue map is
organized into three layers: source, tissue type, and pathological alterations,
with each layer assigning segments of the WSI to specific classes.
  We illustrate the advantages and applicability of the proposed standard
through specific examples in WSI catalogs, Machine Learning (ML), and
graph-based WSI representations.

*Ziwei Liao,Mohamed Sayed,Steven L. Waslander,Sara Vicente,Daniyar Turmukhambetov,Michael Firman*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a latent diffusion model to reconstruct complete 3D scenes, including occluded parts, directly from a single image.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Gaussian splatting methods struggle with reconstructing occluded and unobserved areas in 3D scenes, often leading to implausible or blurry results.

Method: The approach involves a generative diffusion model conditioned on a single input image, using a Variational AutoReconstructor to learn a latent space from 2D images in a self-supervised way.

Result: The method produces faithful reconstructions and diverse samples, enabling high-quality 360-degree renderings of 3D scenes.

Conclusion: The proposed model overcomes challenges of ambiguity in unseen surfaces and outperforms conventional regression-based approaches by capturing plausible distributions of 3D representations.

Abstract: Gaussian splatting typically requires dense observations of the scene and can
fail to reconstruct occluded and unobserved areas. We propose a latent
diffusion model to reconstruct a complete 3D scene with Gaussian splats,
including the occluded parts, from only a single image during inference.
Completing the unobserved surfaces of a scene is challenging due to the
ambiguity of the plausible surfaces. Conventional methods use a
regression-based formulation to predict a single "mode" for occluded and
out-of-frustum surfaces, leading to blurriness, implausibility, and failure to
capture multiple possible explanations. Thus, they often address this problem
partially, focusing either on objects isolated from the background,
reconstructing only visible surfaces, or failing to extrapolate far from the
input views. In contrast, we propose a generative formulation to learn a
distribution of 3D representations of Gaussian splats conditioned on a single
input image. To address the lack of ground-truth training data, we propose a
Variational AutoReconstructor to learn a latent space only from 2D images in a
self-supervised manner, over which a diffusion model is trained. Our method
generates faithful reconstructions and diverse samples with the ability to
complete the occluded surfaces for high-quality 360-degree renderings.

*Lucas Rakotoarivony*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces ICPL, an unsupervised incremental learning approach leveraging confidence-based pseudo-labels, enabling models to learn from unlabeled datasets and outperforming state-of-the-art class-iNCD methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models struggle with novel classes appearing in real-world scenarios, highlighting the need for incremental learning methods that work without fully labeled datasets.

Method: The paper proposes ICPL, a method utilizing pseudo-labels with confidence-based selection integrated into various Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) frameworks. It compares ICPL with other methods on standard and fine-grained datasets.

Result: ICPL achieves competitive results relative to supervised methods and significantly exceeds state-of-the-art class-iNCD methods by more than 5% in final accuracy.

Conclusion: This work demonstrates the effectiveness of pseudo-labeling in unsupervised incremental learning, addressing real-world challenges with strong performance and practical applicability.

Abstract: Deep learning models have achieved state-of-the-art performance in many
computer vision tasks. However, in real-world scenarios, novel classes that
were unseen during training often emerge, requiring models to acquire new
knowledge incrementally. Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) methods enable a
model to learn novel classes while retaining knowledge of previous classes.
However, these methods make the strong assumption that the incremental dataset
is fully labeled, which is unrealistic in practice. In this work, we propose an
unsupervised Incremental Learning method using Confidence-based Pseudo-labels
(ICPL), which replaces human annotations with pseudo-labels, enabling
incremental learning from unlabeled datasets. We integrate these pseudo-labels
into various CIL methods with confidence-based selection and evaluate
performance degradation on CIFAR100 and ImageNet100. Then, we compare our
approach to popular Class Incremental Novel Category Discovery (class-iNCD)
methods addressing similar challenges. Additionally, we apply our method to
fine-grained datasets to demonstrate its real-world practicality and measure
its computational complexity to validate its suitability for
resource-constrained environments. ICPL achieves competitive results compared
to supervised methods and outperforms state-of-the-art class-iNCD methods by
more than 5% in final accuracy.

*Francisco Caetano,Christiaan Viviers,Peter H. H. de With,Fons van der Sommen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes MedShift, a generative model for translating synthetic X-rays to realistic ones, overcoming domain gaps in medical imaging.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of domain gaps preventing synthetic medical data from generalizing well to real-world clinical settings, particularly in X-ray imaging.

Method: The method is MedShift, a class-conditional generative model based on Flow Matching and Schrodinger Bridges, enabling unpaired image translation with a shared latent space that does not require domain-specific training.

Result: MedShift outperforms diffusion-based methods in performance with a smaller model size, offering flexibility in inference to balance perceptual fidelity and structural consistency.

Conclusion: MedShift is a scalable, generalizable solution for medical imaging domain adaptation, demonstrated with the introduction of the X-DigiSkull dataset.

Abstract: Synthetic medical data offers a scalable solution for training robust models,
but significant domain gaps limit its generalizability to real-world clinical
settings. This paper addresses the challenge of cross-domain translation
between synthetic and real X-ray images of the head, focusing on bridging
discrepancies in attenuation behavior, noise characteristics, and soft tissue
representation. We propose MedShift, a unified class-conditional generative
model based on Flow Matching and Schrodinger Bridges, which enables
high-fidelity, unpaired image translation across multiple domains. Unlike prior
approaches that require domain-specific training or rely on paired data,
MedShift learns a shared domain-agnostic latent space and supports seamless
translation between any pair of domains seen during training. We introduce
X-DigiSkull, a new dataset comprising aligned synthetic and real skull X-rays
under varying radiation doses, to benchmark domain translation models.
Experimental results demonstrate that, despite its smaller model size compared
to diffusion-based approaches, MedShift offers strong performance and remains
flexible at inference time, as it can be tuned to prioritize either perceptual
fidelity or structural consistency, making it a scalable and generalizable
solution for domain adaptation in medical imaging. The code and dataset are

*Dimitri Gominski,Martin Brandt,Xiaoye Tong,Siyu Liu,Maurice Mugabowindekwe,Sizhuo Li,Florian Reiner,Andrew Davies,Rasmus Fensholt*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents a deep learning model for detecting individual large trees globally using high-resolution satellite imagery, improving tree monitoring capabilities beyond existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of current global tree monitoring methods, which focus on binary tree cover or canopy height and fail to identify individual trees.

Method: The study employs a deep learning model trained on billions of data points from airborne lidar. Tree crowns are simulated with Gaussian kernels, enabling crown center extraction and the creation of binary tree cover maps.

Result: The method demonstrates high correlation (R$^2 = 0.81) with aerial lidar data, balanced detection across biomes, and improved accuracy through manual label fine-tuning.

Conclusion: This approach provides a scalable, adaptable framework for global, high-resolution monitoring of individual trees and shows potential for integration into future satellite missions.

Abstract: Trees are key components of the terrestrial biosphere, playing vital roles in
ecosystem function, climate regulation, and the bioeconomy. However,
large-scale monitoring of individual trees remains limited by inadequate
modelling. Available global products have focused on binary tree cover or
canopy height, which do not explicitely identify trees at individual level. In
this study, we present a deep learning approach for detecting large individual
trees in 3-m resolution PlanetScope imagery at a global scale. We simulate tree
crowns with Gaussian kernels of scalable size, allowing the extraction of crown
centers and the generation of binary tree cover maps. Training is based on
billions of points automatically extracted from airborne lidar data, enabling
the model to successfully identify trees both inside and outside forests. We
compare against existing tree cover maps and airborne lidar with
state-of-the-art performance (fractional cover R$^2 = 0.81$ against aerial
lidar), report balanced detection metrics across biomes, and demonstrate how
detection can be further improved through fine-tuning with manual labels. Our
method offers a scalable framework for global, high-resolution tree monitoring,
and is adaptable to future satellite missions offering improved imagery.

*Jiayu Yang,Weijian Su,Songqian Zhang,Yuqi Han,Jinli Suo,Qiang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes \M, an efficient framework for scalable 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) in dynamic scenes. It reduces training time and data requirements using hierarchically organized Gaussian spheres and adaptive mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in existing 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) techniques for dynamic scenes, particularly substantial data volume and prolonged training time requirements.

Method: The proposed framework organizes Gaussian spheres hierarchically with anchor-based structures, uses hybrid deformation and spawning for motion handling, and incorporates a bidirectional adaptive masking mechanism for efficiency.

Result: Experiments show that \M achieves superior visual rendering quality while significantly reducing training time compared to state-of-the-art techniques.

Conclusion: The paper introduces an efficient, scalable framework for 3D Gaussian Splatting in dynamic scenes, demonstrating improved performance and reduced computational demands.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enables high-fidelity real-time rendering, a key
requirement for immersive applications. However, the extension of 3DGS to
dynamic scenes remains limitations on the substantial data volume of dense
Gaussians and the prolonged training time required for each frame. This paper
presents \M, a scalable Gaussian Splatting framework designed for efficient
training in streaming tasks. Specifically, Gaussian spheres are hierarchically
organized by scale within an anchor-based structure. Coarser-level Gaussians
represent the low-resolution structure of the scene, while finer-level
Gaussians, responsible for detailed high-fidelity rendering, are selectively
activated by the coarser-level Gaussians. To further reduce computational
overhead, we introduce a hybrid deformation and spawning strategy that models
motion of inter-frame through Gaussian deformation and triggers Gaussian
spawning to characterize wide-range motion. Additionally, a bidirectional
adaptive masking mechanism enhances training efficiency by removing static
regions and prioritizing informative viewpoints. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that \M~ achieves superior visual quality while significantly
reducing training time compared to state-of-the-art methods.

### [92] [One More Glance with Sharp Eyes: Rethinking Lightweight Captioning as a Practical Visual Specialist](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21451)
*Junha Song,Yongsik Jo,So Yeon Min,Quanting Xie,Taehwan Kim,Yonatan Bisk,Jaegul Choo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a lightweight image captioning model based on a small language model, addressing computational challenges in deploying captioning models on local devices, and proposes a framework to improve visual grounding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deploying computationally demanding multimodal language models for image captioning on local devices faces challenges, necessitating lightweight and specialized solutions.

Method: The paper implements a lightweight captioning model based on a 125M-parameter language model and proposes the Sharp-Eyed Refinement framework to improve caption quality through enhanced visual grounding.

Result: The lightweight specialist model performs comparably to large multimodal generalists, and the Sharp-Eyed Refinement framework successfully enhances visual grounding and caption quality.

Conclusion: The proposed lightweight model is promising for on-device applications and, combined with the Sharp-Eyed Refinement framework, addresses visual blindness challenges effectively, outperforming prior approaches.

Abstract: Image captioning is fundamental for applications like video instruction
systems and exploration robots, yet deploying such models on local devices is
challenging due to the high computational demands of multimodal large language
models (MLLMs). To address this, we first explore lightweight captioning by
implementing a specialist based on a 125M-parameter language model, 56 times
smaller than LLaMA-7B, and evaluating its performance on both single-sentence
and detailed captioning tasks. Surprisingly, we find that our model can achieve
performance comparable to large multimodal generalists, suggesting its
potential to serve as a strong visual specialist for on-device applications.
While promising, our model also exhibits a limitation: like other MLLMs, it
suffers from visual blindness, occasionally resulting in semantic captioning
errors. We carry out toy experiments and investigate the underlying causes,
where we observe that the problems arise from ineffective attention mechanisms
and limited visual representations. To alleviate them, we develop a novel
captioning framework, Sharp-Eyed Refinement, which enhances caption quality
through improved visual grounding. At its core, our DeepLens extracts detailed
visual representations by concentrating on informative regions identified
during the initial glance. Our experiments confirm both the advantages of our
specialist over prior small captioning models and large generalists and the
effectiveness of our framework.

TL;DR: The study benchmarks the integration of foundation models (FMs) into federated learning (FL) for dementia diagnosis using brain MRI data, analyzing key elements such as classification head, fine-tuning strategies, and aggregation methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Foundation models are promising tools for AI-based medical diagnosis, but their adaptation within decentralized federated learning systems has not been adequately studied.

Method: Systematic evaluation of FMs on multi-cohort MRI data, testing different classification head architectures, fine-tuning strategies, and aggregation methods to assess performance and efficiency.

Result: Key findings include the impact of classification head architecture on results, comparable performance between freezing FM encoders versus full fine-tuning, and the superiority of advanced aggregation methods over standard federated averaging.

Conclusion: The study provides actionable insights for implementing FMs in federated clinical setups, addressing performance-efficiency trade-offs critical for method development in decentralized AI approaches.

Abstract: While foundation models (FMs) offer strong potential for AI-based dementia
diagnosis, their integration into federated learning (FL) systems remains
underexplored. In this benchmarking study, we systematically evaluate the
impact of key design choices: classification head architecture, fine-tuning
strategy, and aggregation method, on the performance and efficiency of
federated FM tuning using brain MRI data. Using a large multi-cohort dataset,
we find that the architecture of the classification head substantially
influences performance, freezing the FM encoder achieves comparable results to
full fine-tuning, and advanced aggregation methods outperform standard
federated averaging. Our results offer practical insights for deploying FMs in
decentralized clinical settings and highlight trade-offs that should guide
future method development.

### [94] [Multi-Method Ensemble for Out-of-Distribution Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21463)
*Lucas Rakotoarivony*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses out-of-distribution (OOD) detection by combining existing state-of-the-art techniques for feature truncation and scoring functions into a unified framework, proposing the Multi-Method Ensemble (MME) score.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve the robustness and effectiveness of OOD detection, which is crucial for neural networks operating in safety-critical, open-world scenarios.

Method: They combine feature truncation and multiple scoring functions to create a unified scoring mechanism called the Multi-Method Ensemble (MME) score.

Result: MME achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, notably improving OOD detection on benchmarks like ImageNet-1K by 6%.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that combining feature truncation and scoring functions into the MME framework is effective in enhancing OOD detection, offering significant improvements and robustness across various benchmarks.

Abstract: Detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) samples is essential for neural networks
operating in open-world settings, particularly in safety-critical applications.
Existing methods have improved OOD detection by leveraging two main techniques:
feature truncation, which increases the separation between in-distribution (ID)
and OOD samples, and scoring functions, which assign scores to distinguish
between ID and OOD data. However, most approaches either focus on a single
family of techniques or evaluate their effectiveness on a specific type of OOD
dataset, overlooking the potential of combining multiple existing solutions.
Motivated by this observation, we theoretically and empirically demonstrate
that state-of-the-art feature truncation and scoring functions can be
effectively combined. Moreover, we show that aggregating multiple scoring
functions enhances robustness against various types of OOD samples. Based on
these insights, we propose the Multi-Method Ensemble (MME) score, which unifies
state-of-the-art OOD detectors into a single, more effective scoring function.
Extensive experiments on both large-scale and small-scale benchmarks, covering
near-OOD and far-OOD scenarios, show that MME significantly outperforms recent
state-of-the-art methods across all benchmarks. Notably, using the BiT model,
our method achieves an average FPR95 of 27.57% on the challenging ImageNet-1K
benchmark, improving performance by 6% over the best existing baseline.

*Chun Liu,Panpan Ding,Zheng Zheng,Hailong Wang,Bingqian Zhu,Tao Xu,Zhigang Han,Jiayao Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents a targeted augmentation method for adversarial patch attacks to improve efficiency and transferability without impacting non-target areas.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing ship detection techniques using DNNs are vulnerable to adversarial patch attacks. Excessive augmentation of image backgrounds in existing methods can lead to false detections and hinder adversarial attack success rates.

Method: The authors propose a localized augmentation method that focuses only on target regions during adversarial patch attacks, minimizing interference in background and non-target areas.

Result: Experiments on the HRSC2016 dataset show improved success rates and transferability for adversarial patch attacks using the localized augmentation method.

Conclusion: The localized augmentation approach provides a significant improvement in the effectiveness and reliability of adversarial patch attacks in ship detection tasks.

Abstract: Current ship detection techniques based on remote sensing imagery primarily
rely on the object detection capabilities of deep neural networks (DNNs).
However, DNNs are vulnerable to adversarial patch attacks, which can lead to
misclassification by the detection model or complete evasion of the targets.
Numerous studies have demonstrated that data transformation-based methods can
improve the transferability of adversarial examples. However, excessive
augmentation of image backgrounds or irrelevant regions may introduce
unnecessary interference, resulting in false detections of the object detection
model. These errors are not caused by the adversarial patches themselves but
rather by the over-augmentation of background and non-target areas. This paper
proposes a localized augmentation method that applies augmentation only to the
target regions, avoiding any influence on non-target areas. By reducing
background interference, this approach enables the loss function to focus more
directly on the impact of the adversarial patch on the detection model, thereby
improving the attack success rate. Experiments conducted on the HRSC2016
dataset demonstrate that the proposed method effectively increases the success
rate of adversarial patch attacks and enhances their transferability.

*Hao Lu,Jiahao Wang,Yaolun Zhang,Ruohui Wang,Xuanyu Zheng,Yepeng Tang,Dahua Lin,Lewei Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses the issue of Semantic Aggregation Hallucination (SAH) in Video-Multimodal Large Language Models when dealing with long and complex videos, introducing the ELV-Halluc benchmark and discussing mitigation strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to investigate the specific type of hallucination known as Semantic Aggregation Hallucination (SAH), especially in long videos where semantic complexity increases.

Method: The authors propose ELV-Halluc, a benchmark designed to identify and analyze SAH in long videos. They use a dataset of 8K adversarial data pairs and evaluate strategies like positional encoding and DPO to reduce SAH.

Result: Experiments confirm SAH's existence and high occurrence in semantically complex scenarios, especially rapidly changing semantics. Their strategies result in a 27.7% reduction in SAH ratio.

Conclusion: SAH is a key challenge in Video-MLLMs for long videos. ELV-Halluc offers insights and tools to identify and address this issue, showing promise in reducing SAH through targeted strategies.

Abstract: Video multimodal large language models (Video-MLLMs) have achieved remarkable
progress in video understanding. However, they remain vulnerable to
hallucination-producing content inconsistent with or unrelated to video inputs.
Previous video hallucination benchmarks primarily focus on short-videos. They
attribute hallucinations to factors such as strong language priors, missing
frames, or vision-language biases introduced by the visual encoder. While these
causes indeed account for most hallucinations in short videos, they still
oversimplify the cause of hallucinations. Sometimes, models generate incorrect
outputs but with correct frame-level semantics. We refer to this type of
hallucination as Semantic Aggregation Hallucination (SAH), which arises during
the process of aggregating frame-level semantics into event-level semantic
groups. Given that SAH becomes particularly critical in long videos due to
increased semantic complexity across multiple events, it is essential to
separate and thoroughly investigate the causes of this type of hallucination.
To address the above issues, we introduce ELV-Halluc, the first benchmark
dedicated to long-video hallucination, enabling a systematic investigation of
SAH. Our experiments confirm the existence of SAH and show that it increases
with semantic complexity. Additionally, we find that models are more prone to
SAH on rapidly changing semantics. Moreover, we discuss potential approaches to
mitigate SAH. We demonstrate that positional encoding strategy contributes to
alleviating SAH, and further adopt DPO strategy to enhance the model's ability
to distinguish semantics within and across events. To support this, we curate a
dataset of 8K adversarial data pairs and achieve improvements on both
ELV-Halluc and Video-MME, including a substantial 27.7% reduction in SAH ratio.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a convolutional neural network to refine patch-based feature extraction for microscopy images, improving segmentation efficiency and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing feature foundation models struggle with fine features in micrographs and the computational challenges of large image sizes common in materials and biological imaging.

Method: A convolutional neural network is trained to upsample low-resolution foundation model features based on input images, and applied without further training for image segmentation.

Result: The proposed method successfully segments microscopy images, improving separation of hard-to-detect phases such as hairline cracks, with fewer labels and faster results.

Conclusion: Interactive segmentation using deep features from the upsampler network outperforms traditional methods, offering a more efficient and accurate approach to microscopy image analysis.

Abstract: Feature foundation models - usually vision transformers - offer rich semantic
descriptors of images, useful for downstream tasks such as (interactive)
segmentation and object detection. For computational efficiency these
descriptors are often patch-based, and so struggle to represent the fine
features often present in micrographs; they also struggle with the large image
sizes present in materials and biological image analysis. In this work, we
train a convolutional neural network to upsample low-resolution (i.e, large
patch size) foundation model features with reference to the input image. We
apply this upsampler network (without any further training) to efficiently
featurise and then segment a variety of microscopy images, including plant
cells, a lithium-ion battery cathode and organic crystals. The richness of
these upsampled features admits separation of hard to segment phases, like
hairline cracks. We demonstrate that interactive segmentation with these deep
features produces high-quality segmentations far faster and with far fewer
labels than training or finetuning a more traditional convolutional network.

*Hao Ruan,Jinliang Lin,Yingxin Lai,Zhiming Luo,Shaozi Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework (HCCM) to improve vision-language understanding for drones, addressing challenges like complex semantics and ambiguous text descriptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Drone scenarios require effective vision-language models to handle wide fields of view and compositional semantics, which current approaches struggle with.

Method: The HCCM framework integrates Region-Global Image-Text Contrastive Learning and Matching to capture hierarchical semantics without rigid constraints, along with a Momentum Contrast and Distillation mechanism for robust text alignment.

Result: Experiments show HCCM achieves state-of-the-art results in retrieval tasks and robust zero-shot generalization on unseen datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed HCCM framework significantly advances hierarchical compositional reasoning for drone applications using vision-language models.

Abstract: Natural Language-Guided Drones (NLGD) provide a novel paradigm for tasks such
as target matching and navigation. However, the wide field of view and complex
compositional semantics in drone scenarios pose challenges for vision-language
understanding. Mainstream Vision-Language Models (VLMs) emphasize global
alignment while lacking fine-grained semantics, and existing hierarchical
methods depend on precise entity partitioning and strict containment, limiting
effectiveness in dynamic environments. To address this, we propose the
Hierarchical Cross-Granularity Contrastive and Matching learning (HCCM)
framework with two components: (1) Region-Global Image-Text Contrastive
Learning (RG-ITC), which avoids precise scene partitioning and captures
hierarchical local-to-global semantics by contrasting local visual regions with
global text and vice versa; (2) Region-Global Image-Text Matching (RG-ITM),
which dispenses with rigid constraints and instead evaluates local semantic
consistency within global cross-modal representations, enhancing compositional
reasoning. Moreover, drone text descriptions are often incomplete or ambiguous,
destabilizing alignment. HCCM introduces a Momentum Contrast and Distillation
(MCD) mechanism to improve robustness. Experiments on GeoText-1652 show HCCM
achieves state-of-the-art Recall@1 of 28.8% (image retrieval) and 14.7% (text
retrieval). On the unseen ERA dataset, HCCM demonstrates strong zero-shot
generalization with 39.93% mean recall (mR), outperforming fine-tuned
baselines.

*Yujin Park,Haejun Chung,Ikbeom Jang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces EZ-Sort, a method combining CLIP-based pre-ordering and uncertainty-aware human annotations to improve the efficiency of pairwise ranking tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pairwise comparison is preferred in subjective annotation tasks for better reliability, but the exhaustive nature can be resource-intensive.

Method: The approach uses CLIP-based zero-shot pre-ordering, bucket-aware Elo scores, and uncertainty-guided human-in-the-loop MergeSort to optimize ranking processes.

Result: EZ-Sort reduced annotation costs by 90.5% compared to exhaustive pairwise methods and by 19.8% compared to recent advancements, while maintaining or improving inter-rater reliability.

Conclusion: Integrating CLIP priors with uncertainty-based human sampling enhances scalability and efficiency in pairwise ranking tasks.

Abstract: Pairwise comparison is often favored over absolute rating or ordinal
classification in subjective or difficult annotation tasks due to its improved
reliability. However, exhaustive comparisons require a massive number of
annotations (O(n^2)). Recent work has greatly reduced the annotation burden
(O(n log n)) by actively sampling pairwise comparisons using a sorting
algorithm. We further improve annotation efficiency by (1) roughly pre-ordering
items using the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) model
hierarchically without training, and (2) replacing easy, obvious human
comparisons with automated comparisons. The proposed EZ-Sort first produces a
CLIP-based zero-shot pre-ordering, then initializes bucket-aware Elo scores,
and finally runs an uncertainty-guided human-in-the-loop MergeSort. Validation
was conducted using various datasets: face-age estimation (FGNET), historical
image chronology (DHCI), and retinal image quality assessment (EyePACS). It
showed that EZ-Sort reduced human annotation cost by 90.5% compared to
exhaustive pairwise comparisons and by 19.8% compared to prior work (when n =
100), while improving or maintaining inter-rater reliability. These results
demonstrate that combining CLIP-based priors with uncertainty-aware sampling
yields an efficient and scalable solution for pairwise ranking.

TL;DR: The paper introduces ECHO, a unified framework for modeling human-object interactions using head and wrist tracking data, employing a unique diffusion transformer architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to explore egocentric human-object interactions using minimal data, driven by the increasing use of wearable devices like smart glasses and watches.

Method: The proposed method, ECHO, uses a Diffusion Transformer architecture and a three-variate diffusion process to model human motion, object trajectory, and contact sequence, operating within a head-centric canonical space and leveraging a conveyor-based inference for flexibility.

Result: ECHO outperforms existing methods in egocentric human-object interaction reconstruction, demonstrating its capability to process flexible input configurations.

Conclusion: The study establishes ECHO as a state-of-the-art framework for egocentric human-object interaction modeling, offering robust and flexible reconstruction using minimal sensor data.

Abstract: Modeling human-object interactions (HOI) from an egocentric perspective is a
largely unexplored yet important problem due to the increasing adoption of
wearable devices, such as smart glasses and watches. We investigate how much
information about interaction can be recovered from only head and wrists
tracking. Our answer is ECHO (Ego-Centric modeling of Human-Object
interactions), which, for the first time, proposes a unified framework to
recover three modalities: human pose, object motion, and contact from such
minimal observation. ECHO employs a Diffusion Transformer architecture and a
unique three-variate diffusion process, which jointly models human motion,
object trajectory, and contact sequence, allowing for flexible input
configurations. Our method operates in a head-centric canonical space,
enhancing robustness to global orientation. We propose a conveyor-based
inference, which progressively increases the diffusion timestamp with the frame
position, allowing us to process sequences of any length. Through extensive
evaluation, we demonstrate that ECHO outperforms existing methods that do not
offer the same flexibility, setting a state-of-the-art in egocentric HOI
reconstruction.

### [101] [How Well Do Vision--Language Models Understand Cities? A Comparative Study on Spatial Reasoning from Street-View Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21565)
*Juneyoung Ro,Namwoo Kim,Yoonjin Yoon*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This study evaluates how vision-language models (VLMs) perform in spatial reasoning for urban scenes, examining their zero-shot capabilities and improvement after fine-tuning with a synthetic dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to explore how well general-purpose vision-language models can transfer their spatial reasoning abilities to the specific and complex domain of urban scenes.

Method: Three off-the-shelf VLMs were tested for zero-shot performance and fine-tuned using a synthetic VQA dataset. The dataset was created from street-view images and contained Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning for step-by-step supervision.

Result: Fine-tuning significantly improved the models' performance, particularly for challenging question types like negation and counterfactuals, beyond zero-shot capabilities.

Conclusion: Urban spatial reasoning poses a challenge for existing VLMs, but synthetic datasets with CoT reasoning suggest a promising path for domain adaptation.

Abstract: Effectively understanding urban scenes requires fine-grained spatial
reasoning about objects, layouts, and depth cues. However, how well current
vision-language models (VLMs), pretrained on general scenes, transfer these
abilities to urban domain remains underexplored. To address this gap, we
conduct a comparative study of three off-the-shelf VLMs-BLIP-2, InstructBLIP,
and LLaVA-1.5-evaluating both zero-shot performance and the effects of
fine-tuning with a synthetic VQA dataset specific to urban scenes. We construct
such dataset from segmentation, depth, and object detection predictions of
street-view images, pairing each question with LLM-generated Chain-of-Thought
(CoT) answers for step-by-step reasoning supervision. Results show that while
VLMs perform reasonably well in zero-shot settings, fine-tuning with our
synthetic CoT-supervised dataset substantially boosts performance, especially
for challenging question types such as negation and counterfactuals. This study
introduces urban spatial reasoning as a new challenge for VLMs and demonstrates
synthetic dataset construction as a practical path for adapting general-purpose
models to specialized domains.

*Nico Albert Disch,Yannick Kirchhoff,Robin Peretzke,Maximilian Rokuss,Saikat Roy,Constantin Ulrich,David Zimmerer,Klaus Maier-Hein*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Temporal Flow Matching (TFM), a novel method for predicting 4D medical imaging trajectories, overcoming limitations in single temporal contexts and offering state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning approaches for medical imaging struggle with fine-grained spatial predictions across multiple timepoints, limiting their potential to model medical temporal dynamics.

Method: The authors propose Temporal Flow Matching, a generative approach designed to learn temporal distributions and handle irregular $4D$ data, incorporating features like nearest image predictors and multi-scan support.

Result: Experiments on three public datasets demonstrate that TFM outperforms existing spatio-temporal methods for predicting $4D$ medical images, setting a new benchmark.

Conclusion: TFM addresses fundamental gaps in temporal modeling for medical imaging and establishes a robust baseline for future advancements in medical image prediction.

Abstract: Understanding temporal dynamics in medical imaging is crucial for
applications such as disease progression modeling, treatment planning and
anatomical development tracking. However, most deep learning methods either
consider only single temporal contexts, or focus on tasks like classification
or regression, limiting their ability for fine-grained spatial predictions.
While some approaches have been explored, they are often limited to single
timepoints, specific diseases or have other technical restrictions. To address
this fundamental gap, we introduce Temporal Flow Matching (TFM), a unified
generative trajectory method that (i) aims to learn the underlying temporal
distribution, (ii) by design can fall back to a nearest image predictor, i.e.
predicting the last context image (LCI), as a special case, and (iii) supports
$3D$ volumes, multiple prior scans, and irregular sampling. Extensive
benchmarks on three public longitudinal datasets show that TFM consistently
surpasses spatio-temporal methods from natural imaging, establishing a new
state-of-the-art and robust baseline for $4D$ medical image prediction.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study integrates preoperative CT imaging with postoperative histopathology slides using deep learning for improved recurrence risk prediction in ccRCC. Intermediate fusion achieved the best performance, demonstrating multimodal integration's feasibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recurrence risk estimation in ccRCC is crucial for guiding postoperative care. Existing methods, like the Leibovich score, lack detailed patient-level resolution and omit imaging data.

Method: A deep learning framework with pretrained encoders and Cox-based survival modeling evaluated unimodal, late fusion, and intermediate fusion setups for recurrence prediction.

Result: WSI-based models were more effective than CT-only models, and intermediate fusion improved performance further, closely aligning with the adjusted Leibovich score. Radiology added value primarily through fusion.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the potential of multimodal integration using foundation models for personalized ccRCC risk prediction, suggesting future directions for improvement in fusion strategies and dataset expansion.

Abstract: Recurrence risk estimation in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is
essential for guiding postoperative surveillance and treatment. The Leibovich
score remains widely used for stratifying distant recurrence risk but offers
limited patient-level resolution and excludes imaging information. This study
evaluates multimodal recurrence prediction by integrating preoperative computed
tomography (CT) and postoperative histopathology whole-slide images (WSIs). A
modular deep learning framework with pretrained encoders and Cox-based survival
modeling was tested across unimodal, late fusion, and intermediate fusion
setups. In a real-world ccRCC cohort, WSI-based models consistently
outperformed CT-only models, underscoring the prognostic strength of pathology.
Intermediate fusion further improved performance, with the best model
(TITAN-CONCH with ResNet-18) approaching the adjusted Leibovich score. Random
tie-breaking narrowed the gap between the clinical baseline and learned models,
suggesting discretization may overstate individualized performance. Using
simple embedding concatenation, radiology added value primarily through fusion.
These findings demonstrate the feasibility of foundation model-based multimodal
integration for personalized ccRCC risk prediction. Future work should explore
more expressive fusion strategies, larger multimodal datasets, and
general-purpose CT encoders to better match pathology modeling capacity.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a Deep Unfolding Network (DUN) to tackle challenges in computer-generated holography (CGH) by leveraging adaptive bandwidth-preserving and phase-domain complex-valued denoising models for enhanced accuracy and flexibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to improve the reconstruction accuracy of CGH while addressing issues like lack of interpretability, limited global feature understanding, and constraints tied to finite near-fields in existing methods.

Method: A Deep Unfolding Network (DUN) is designed to integrate two essential modules: adaptive bandwidth-preserving model (ABPM) for extended working distances and phase-domain complex-valued denoiser (PCD) employing deformable self-attention for capturing global features.

Result: The proposed approach achieves a PSNR above 35 dB and demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in both simulated and real-world holographic data.

Conclusion: The method effectively enhances CGH reconstruction by combining physical model-based flexibility with improved global context capturing and adaptability, offering superior results compared to previous methods.

Abstract: Computer-generated holography (CGH) has gained wide attention with deep
learning-based algorithms. However, due to its nonlinear and ill-posed nature,
challenges remain in achieving accurate and stable reconstruction.
Specifically, ($i$) the widely used end-to-end networks treat the
reconstruction model as a black box, ignoring underlying physical
relationships, which reduces interpretability and flexibility. ($ii$) CNN-based
CGH algorithms have limited receptive fields, hindering their ability to
capture long-range dependencies and global context. ($iii$) Angular spectrum
method (ASM)-based models are constrained to finite near-fields.In this paper,
we propose a Deep Unfolding Network (DUN) that decomposes gradient descent into
two modules: an adaptive bandwidth-preserving model (ABPM) and a phase-domain
complex-valued denoiser (PCD), providing more flexibility. ABPM allows for
wider working distances compared to ASM-based methods. At the same time, PCD
leverages its complex-valued deformable self-attention module to capture global
features and enhance performance, achieving a PSNR over 35 dB. Experiments on
simulated and real data show state-of-the-art results.

*Maximilian Rokuss,Yannick Kirchhoff,Fabian Isensee,Klaus H. Maier-Hein*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study introduces an interactive lesion segmentation method for PET/CT imaging using user prompts. It employs an enhanced nnU-Net model with spatial prompt encodings and improves segmentation accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate lesion segmentation in PET/CT imaging remains a challenge due to issues like tracer heterogeneity and multi-center variability. Interactive methods can refine automations to benefit clinical practice.

Method: The nnU-Net pipeline was augmented by integrating user-provided foreground and background clicks. Euclidean Distance Transform (EDT) encoding was utilized for spatial prompts. Online user interaction simulation and a point-sampling strategy were incorporated to refine robustness.

Result: Models with EDT encoding outperformed baseline in both false-positive and false-negative rates, delivering enhanced segmentation accuracy under realistic prompt conditions.

Conclusion: Promptable segmentation models demonstrate the potential to optimize lesion identification in PET/CT imaging. The work underscores the value of human-aided workflows in evolving imaging methodologies.

Abstract: Whole-body PET/CT is a cornerstone of oncological imaging, yet accurate
lesion segmentation remains challenging due to tracer heterogeneity,
physiological uptake, and multi-center variability. While fully automated
methods have advanced substantially, clinical practice benefits from approaches
that keep humans in the loop to efficiently refine predicted masks. The
autoPET/CT IV challenge addresses this need by introducing interactive
segmentation tasks based on simulated user prompts. In this work, we present
our submission to Task 1. Building on the winning autoPET III nnU-Net pipeline,
we extend the framework with promptable capabilities by encoding user-provided
foreground and background clicks as additional input channels. We
systematically investigate representations for spatial prompts and demonstrate
that Euclidean Distance Transform (EDT) encodings consistently outperform
Gaussian kernels. Furthermore, we propose online simulation of user
interactions and a custom point sampling strategy to improve robustness under
realistic prompting conditions. Our ensemble of EDT-based models, trained with
and without external data, achieves the strongest cross-validation performance,
reducing both false positives and false negatives compared to baseline models.
These results highlight the potential of promptable models to enable efficient,
user-guided segmentation workflows in multi-tracer, multi-center PET/CT. Code

### [106] [Mapping like a Skeptic: Probabilistic BEV Projection for Online HD Mapping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21689)
*Fatih Erdoğan,Merve Rabia Barın,Fatma Güney*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel probabilistic projection method to refine the mapping of road elements for constructing high-definition maps, improving accuracy and temporal consistency compared to existing techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing HD mapping methods, which suffer from generalization problems and inaccuracies in projecting road elements from image space to Bird's Eye View (BEV) space.

Method: The paper proposes a geometric-based probabilistic projection mechanism with confidence scores that refine the mapping, filter out irrelevant elements, and enhance temporal processing using selective accumulation over time.

Result: Experiments on new splits of nuScenes and Argoverse2 datasets showed improved mapping accuracy, particularly in challenging long perception ranges, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The proposed approach enhances HD map construction quality with better generalization and long-range perception, making it a viable improvement to existing mapping techniques.

Abstract: Constructing high-definition (HD) maps from sensory input requires accurately
mapping the road elements in image space to the Bird's Eye View (BEV) space.
The precision of this mapping directly impacts the quality of the final
vectorized HD map. Existing HD mapping approaches outsource the projection to
standard mapping techniques, such as attention-based ones. However, these
methods struggle with accuracy due to generalization problems, often
hallucinating non-existent road elements. Our key idea is to start with a
geometric mapping based on camera parameters and adapt it to the scene to
extract relevant map information from camera images. To implement this, we
propose a novel probabilistic projection mechanism with confidence scores to
(i) refine the mapping to better align with the scene and (ii) filter out
irrelevant elements that should not influence HD map generation. In addition,
we improve temporal processing by using confidence scores to selectively
accumulate reliable information over time. Experiments on new splits of the
nuScenes and Argoverse2 datasets demonstrate improved performance over
state-of-the-art approaches, indicating better generalization. The improvements
are particularly pronounced on nuScenes and in the challenging long perception
range. Our code and model checkpoints are available at

*Shashank Vempati,Nishit Anand,Gaurav Talebailkar,Arpan Garai,Chetan Arora*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper identifies word segmentation as a bottleneck in OCR processes, proposing a shift from word-level to line-level OCR for improved accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing OCR techniques face challenges in character and word segmentation, limiting the utilization of language models effectively.

Method: The researchers introduced a line-level OCR technique that bypasses word detection errors and leverages larger sentence contexts with the aid of language models.

Result: The proposed line-level OCR showed an improvement in end-to-end accuracy by 5.4% and a fourfold efficiency boost compared to word-based pipelines.

Conclusion: The transition to line-level OCR offers significant accuracy and efficiency benefits, while being poised to leverage advancements in large language models.

Abstract: Conventional optical character recognition (OCR) techniques segmented each
character and then recognized. This made them prone to error in character
segmentation, and devoid of context to exploit language models. Advances in
sequence to sequence translation in last decade led to modern techniques first
detecting words and then inputting one word at a time to a model to directly
output full words as sequence of characters. This allowed better utilization of
language models and bypass error-prone character segmentation step. We observe
that the above transition in style has moved the bottleneck in accuracy to word
segmentation. Hence, in this paper, we propose a natural and logical
progression from word level OCR to line-level OCR. The proposal allows to
bypass errors in word detection, and provides larger sentence context for
better utilization of language models. We show that the proposed technique not
only improves the accuracy but also efficiency of OCR. Despite our thorough
literature survey, we did not find any public dataset to train and benchmark
such shift from word to line-level OCR. Hence, we also contribute a
meticulously curated dataset of 251 English page images with line-level
annotations. Our experimentation revealed a notable end-to-end accuracy
improvement of 5.4%, underscoring the potential benefits of transitioning
towards line-level OCR, especially for document images. We also report a 4
times improvement in efficiency compared to word-based pipelines. With
continuous improvements in large language models, our methodology also holds
potential to exploit such advances. Project Website:

*Alvaro Patricio,Atabak Dehban,Rodrigo Ventura*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces FLORA, a lightweight synthetic data generation pipeline for object detection tasks, achieving superior performance with fewer images and reduced computational requirements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most diffusion-based generative models for augmenting object detection datasets are computationally expensive, requiring enterprise-grade GPUs and large-scale synthetic datasets, which are not practical for many users.

Method: The authors proposed FLORA, which leverages the Flux 1.1 Dev diffusion model fine-tuned using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) for significant reductions in computational demands. It allows synthetic dataset generation with affordable, consumer-grade GPUs.

Result: FLORA achieved up to 21.3% improvement in mAP@.50:.95 using only 10% of the data (500 synthetic images) compared to a baseline (ODGEN) requiring 5000 images, proving its effectiveness in detection tasks.

Conclusion: FLORA makes synthetic data generation more practical and accessible, maintaining state-of-the-art performance at a fraction of the computational and data costs, offering a more efficient alternative for real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion-based generative models have demonstrated
significant potential in augmenting scarce datasets for object detection tasks.
Nevertheless, most recent models rely on resource-intensive full fine-tuning of
large-scale diffusion models, requiring enterprise-grade GPUs (e.g., NVIDIA
V100) and thousands of synthetic images. To address these limitations, we
propose Flux LoRA Augmentation (FLORA), a lightweight synthetic data generation
pipeline. Our approach uses the Flux 1.1 Dev diffusion model, fine-tuned
exclusively through Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). This dramatically reduces
computational requirements, enabling synthetic dataset generation with a
consumer-grade GPU (e.g., NVIDIA RTX 4090). We empirically evaluate our
approach on seven diverse object detection datasets. Our results demonstrate
that training object detectors with just 500 synthetic images generated by our
approach yields superior detection performance compared to models trained on
5000 synthetic images from the ODGEN baseline, achieving improvements of up to
21.3% in mAP@.50:.95. This work demonstrates that it is possible to surpass
state-of-the-art performance with far greater efficiency, as FLORA achieves
superior results using only 10% of the data and a fraction of the computational
cost. This work demonstrates that a quality and efficiency-focused approach is
more effective than brute-force generation, making advanced synthetic data
creation more practical and accessible for real-world scenarios.

*Amirhossein Nazeri,Wael Hafez*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes monitoring CNN activation entropy to detect adversarial inputs without altering the original model, achieving 90% detection accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current CNNs, while powerful in image recognition, are vulnerable to adversarial perturbations, and existing detection methods compromise performance or require major changes.

Method: The authors monitor entropy changes in CNN activation patterns (specifically VGG-16) and identify entropy shifts in early layers as indicators of adversarial input.

Result: Adversarial inputs shifted activation entropy by 7% in early convolutional layers, enabling detection with 90% accuracy and low error rates.

Conclusion: CNNs inherently encode detectable shifts in entropy patterns due to adversarial inputs, allowing non-intrusive real-time reliability checks without degrading original performance.

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have become the foundation of modern
computer vision, achieving unprecedented accuracy across diverse image
recognition tasks. While these networks excel on in-distribution data, they
remain vulnerable to adversarial perturbations imperceptible input
modifications that cause misclassification with high confidence. However,
existing detection methods either require expensive retraining, modify network
architecture, or degrade performance on clean inputs. Here we show that
adversarial perturbations create immediate, detectable entropy signatures in
CNN activations that can be monitored without any model modification. Using
parallel entropy monitoring on VGG-16, we demonstrate that adversarial inputs
consistently shift activation entropy by 7% in early convolutional layers,
enabling 90% detection accuracy with false positives and false negative rates
below 20%. The complete separation between clean and adversarial entropy
distributions reveals that CNNs inherently encode distribution shifts in their
activation patterns. This work establishes that CNN reliability can be assessed
through activation entropy alone, enabling practical deployment of
self-diagnostic vision systems that detect adversarial inputs in real-time
without compromising original model performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study develops CAD2DMD-SET, a tool that generates synthetic datasets for fine-tuning LVLMs on visual question answering tasks related to Digital Measurement Devices, and validates its effectiveness with a curated benchmark, showing performance improvement under challenging conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LVLMs underperform in reading Digital Measurement Devices in real-world conditions with clutter, occlusions, extreme angles, and motion blur. This hinders their utility in applications like AR or head-mounted devices.

Method: The paper introduces CAD2DMD-SET, a tool that uses 3D CAD models, advanced rendering, and image composition to create diverse, labeled synthetic datasets for training LVLMs. Additionally, DMDBench, a 1,000-image real-world validation set, is designed to test practical constraints.

Result: Benchmarking with three state-of-the-art LVLMs showed that fine-tuning with CAD2DMD-SET datasets significantly improved performance, increasing InternVL's ANLS score by 200%, while preserving task accuracy on other benchmarks.

Conclusion: The CAD2DMD-SET tool enhances LVLM robustness and performance in handling DMDs under challenging scenarios. Once released as open-source, it will allow customization and broader dataset generation for extended research use.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated
impressive capabilities across various multimodal tasks. They continue,
however, to struggle with trivial scenarios such as reading values from Digital
Measurement Devices (DMDs), particularly in real-world conditions involving
clutter, occlusions, extreme viewpoints, and motion blur; common in
head-mounted cameras and Augmented Reality (AR) applications. Motivated by
these limitations, this work introduces CAD2DMD-SET, a synthetic data
generation tool designed to support visual question answering (VQA) tasks
involving DMDs. By leveraging 3D CAD models, advanced rendering, and
high-fidelity image composition, our tool produces diverse, VQA-labelled
synthetic DMD datasets suitable for fine-tuning LVLMs. Additionally, we present
DMDBench, a curated validation set of 1,000 annotated real-world images
designed to evaluate model performance under practical constraints.
Benchmarking three state-of-the-art LVLMs using Average Normalised Levenshtein
Similarity (ANLS) and further fine-tuning LoRA's of these models with
CAD2DMD-SET's generated dataset yielded substantial improvements, with InternVL
showcasing a score increase of 200% without degrading on other tasks. This
demonstrates that the CAD2DMD-SET training dataset substantially improves the
robustness and performance of LVLMs when operating under the previously stated
challenging conditions. The CAD2DMD-SET tool is expected to be released as
open-source once the final version of this manuscript is prepared, allowing the
community to add different measurement devices and generate their own datasets.

*Xavier Juanola,Giovana Morais,Magdalena Fuentes,Gloria Haro*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses shortcomings in visual sound source localization tasks, particularly in scenarios involving negative audio (silence, noise, offscreen sounds), by introducing a novel model and evaluation framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for visual sound source localization struggle with low audio-visual semantic correspondence (e.g., silence, noise, offscreen sounds) and are often evaluated only on positive cases with visible sound sources.

Method: The proposed SSL-SaN model is trained using a new strategy that incorporates both silence and noise, improves performance in positive cases, and is robust to negative sounds. Additionally, the authors introduce a new metric for audio-visual feature alignment and an extended synthetic dataset (IS3+) with negative audio.

Result: SSL-SaN achieves state-of-the-art performance in self-supervised sound localization and cross-modal retrieval. The new metric better captures the trade-off between alignment and separability of features in positive and negative pairs.

Conclusion: The paper improves capabilities in handling challenging audio-visual cases and enhances evaluation frameworks, making visual sound source localization more robust and comprehensively measurable.

Abstract: Visual sound source localization is a fundamental perception task that aims
to detect the location of sounding sources in a video given its audio. Despite
recent progress, we identify two shortcomings in current methods: 1) most
approaches perform poorly in cases with low audio-visual semantic
correspondence such as silence, noise, and offscreen sounds, i.e. in the
presence of negative audio; and 2) most prior evaluations are limited to
positive cases, where both datasets and metrics convey scenarios with a single
visible sound source in the scene. To address this, we introduce three key
contributions. First, we propose a new training strategy that incorporates
silence and noise, which improves performance in positive cases, while being
more robust against negative sounds. Our resulting self-supervised model,
SSL-SaN, achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to other
self-supervised models, both in sound localization and cross-modal retrieval.
Second, we propose a new metric that quantifies the trade-off between alignment
and separability of auditory and visual features across positive and negative
audio-visual pairs. Third, we present IS3+, an extended and improved version of
the IS3 synthetic dataset with negative audio.

TL;DR: UItron is an open-source foundational model designed to automate GUI operations on Mobile and PC devices, leveraging data engineering and interactive environments for superior performance in perception, grounding, and planning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address challenges in building advanced GUI agents, such as the scarcity of operation trajectories, lack of interactive infrastructure, and initial limitations in foundation models.

Method: UItron combines supervised finetuning for perception and planning tasks with curriculum reinforcement learning to enhance reasoning and exploration. Data engineering strategies and interactive environments are also employed.

Result: UItron showcases remarkable performance improvements in benchmarks, especially excelling in Chinese app scenarios. The dataset includes over one million operation trajectories and an evaluation platform for testing.

Conclusion: UItron demonstrates the feasibility of advanced GUI agents with enhanced handling of Chinese app scenarios, thereby advancing real-world applications and showcasing the importance of data and infrastructure in GUI agent development.

Abstract: GUI agent aims to enable automated operations on Mobile/PC devices, which is
an important task toward achieving artificial general intelligence. The rapid
advancement of VLMs accelerates the development of GUI agents, owing to their
powerful capabilities in visual understanding and task planning. However,
building a GUI agent remains a challenging task due to the scarcity of
operation trajectories, the availability of interactive infrastructure, and the
limitation of initial capabilities in foundation models. In this work, we
introduce UItron, an open-source foundational model for automatic GUI agents,
featuring advanced GUI perception, grounding, and planning capabilities. UItron
highlights the necessity of systemic data engineering and interactive
infrastructure as foundational components for advancing GUI agent development.
It not only systematically studies a series of data engineering strategies to
enhance training effects, but also establishes an interactive environment
connecting both Mobile and PC devices. In training, UItron adopts supervised
finetuning over perception and planning tasks in various GUI scenarios, and
then develop a curriculum reinforcement learning framework to enable complex
reasoning and exploration for online environments. As a result, UItron achieves
superior performance in benchmarks of GUI perception, grounding, and planning.
In particular, UItron highlights the interaction proficiency with top-tier
Chinese mobile APPs, as we identified a general lack of Chinese capabilities
even in state-of-the-art solutions. To this end, we manually collect over one
million steps of operation trajectories across the top 100 most popular apps,
and build the offline and online agent evaluation environments. Experimental
results demonstrate that UItron achieves significant progress in Chinese app
scenarios, propelling GUI agents one step closer to real-world application.

*Ha Min Son,Zhe Zhao,Shahbaz Rezaei,Xin Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes CLIP-DCA to enhance domain generalization (DG) for CLIP by boosting domain-aware representation rather than enforcing domain invariance, showing improved performance on unseen out-of-distribution datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current DG evaluations for CLIP face limitations since web-scale pretraining data might already cover benchmarks, making them insufficiently challenging for assessing genuinely unseen scenarios.

Method: The authors introduce CLIP-DCA, which uses a separate domain head and synthetically generated diverse domain data to enhance domain-awareness within CLIP, while promoting domain-invariant classification via disentanglement.

Result: CLIP-DCA showed significant improvements over existing methods, particularly on out-of-distribution datasets that challenge CLIP's generalization capabilities.

Conclusion: Enhancing domain awareness rather than discarding domain-specific representations improves foundation models' ability to generalize across unseen domains.

Abstract: Evaluating domain generalization (DG) for foundational models like CLIP is
challenging, as web-scale pretraining data potentially covers many existing
benchmarks. Consequently, current DG evaluation may neither be sufficiently
challenging nor adequately test genuinely unseen data scenarios. To better
assess the performance of CLIP on DG in-the-wild, a scenario where CLIP
encounters challenging unseen data, we consider two approaches: (1) evaluating
on 33 diverse datasets with quantified out-of-distribution (OOD) scores after
fine-tuning CLIP on ImageNet, and (2) using unlearning to make CLIP `forget'
some domains as an approximation. We observe that CLIP's performance
deteriorates significantly on more OOD datasets. To address this, we present
CLIP-DCA (Disentangling Classification from enhanced domain Aware
representations). Our approach is motivated by the observation that while
standard domain invariance losses aim to make representations domain-invariant,
this can be harmful to foundation models by forcing the discarding of
domain-aware representations beneficial for generalization. We instead
hypothesize that enhancing domain awareness is a prerequisite for effective
domain-invariant classification in foundation models. CLIP-DCA identifies and
enhances domain awareness within CLIP's encoders using a separate domain head
and synthetically generated diverse domain data. Simultaneously, it encourages
domain-invariant classification through disentanglement from the domain
features. CLIP-DCA shows significant improvements within this challenging
evaluation compared to existing methods, particularly on datasets that are more
OOD.

### [114] [What Can We Learn from Harry Potter? An Exploratory Study of Visual Representation Learning from Atypical Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21770)
*Qiyue Sun,Qiming Huang,Yang Yang,Hongjun Wang,Jianbo Jiao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces the use of atypical and unusual video data to improve open-world learning tasks like out-of-distribution detection, novel category discovery, and zero-shot action recognition, showing that semantic diversity in atypical samples enhances model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to explore whether atypical, unusual videos can enhance generalization and discovery abilities in open-world scenarios, as most prior works focus on typical, closed-set data.

Method: A new video dataset with atypical content (e.g., sci-fi, animation) was created and utilized for representation learning to assess its impact on three open-world learning tasks: OOD detection, NCD, and ZSAR. Various experimental setups evaluated the effects of diversity and semantic richness in the atypical data.

Result: The study found that incorporating atypical videos consistently improves task performance. Specifically, greater categorical diversity enhances OOD detection, smaller but semantically richer datasets outperform larger typical datasets in NCD, and diverse atypical samples better generalize to unseen classes in ZSAR.

Conclusion: Atypical and semantically diverse videos can significantly benefit open-world learning tasks, encouraging further research into leveraging such unconventional data for visual representation learning.

Abstract: Humans usually show exceptional generalisation and discovery ability in the
open world, when being shown uncommon new concepts. Whereas most existing
studies in the literature focus on common typical data from closed sets,
open-world novel discovery is under-explored in videos. In this paper, we are
interested in asking: \textit{What if atypical unusual videos are exposed in
the learning process?} To this end, we collect a new video dataset consisting
of various types of unusual atypical data (\eg sci-fi, animation, \etc). To
study how such atypical data may benefit open-world learning, we feed them into
the model training process for representation learning. Focusing on three key
tasks in open-world learning: out-of-distribution (OOD) detection, novel
category discovery (NCD), and zero-shot action recognition (ZSAR), we found
that even straightforward learning approaches with atypical data consistently
improve performance across various settings. Furthermore, we found that
increasing the categorical diversity of the atypical samples further boosts OOD
detection performance. Additionally, in the NCD task, using a smaller yet more
semantically diverse set of atypical samples leads to better performance
compared to using a larger but more typical dataset. In the ZSAR setting, the
semantic diversity of atypical videos helps the model generalise better to
unseen action classes. These observations in our extensive experimental
evaluations reveal the benefits of atypical videos for visual representation
learning in the open world, together with the newly proposed dataset,
encouraging further studies in this direction.

### [115] [Unsupervised Video Continual Learning via Non-Parametric Deep Embedded Clustering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21773)
*Nattapong Kurpukdee,Adrian G. Bors*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper addresses unsupervised video continual learning (uVCL), proposing a non-parametric solution leveraging Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) of video features extracted through unsupervised video transformers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the gap in unsupervised continual learning for videos, where task boundaries or labels are unavailable, unlike supervised approaches.

Method: The proposed method uses KDE representations of deep embedded video features for probabilistic modeling and novelty detection, enabling dynamic memory expansion for learning successive tasks.

Result: The methodology improves performance across multiple tasks and architectures, validated through experiments on three standard video action recognition datasets without labels.

Conclusion: The study advances uVCL research by providing a robust and efficient solution for learning task successions without supervision, leveraging video representations dynamically.

Abstract: We propose a realistic scenario for the unsupervised video learning where
neither task boundaries nor labels are provided when learning a succession of
tasks. We also provide a non-parametric learning solution for the
under-explored problem of unsupervised video continual learning. Videos
represent a complex and rich spatio-temporal media information, widely used in
many applications, but which have not been sufficiently explored in
unsupervised continual learning. Prior studies have only focused on supervised
continual learning, relying on the knowledge of labels and task boundaries,
while having labeled data is costly and not practical. To address this gap, we
study the unsupervised video continual learning (uVCL). uVCL raises more
challenges due to the additional computational and memory requirements of
processing videos when compared to images. We introduce a general benchmark
experimental protocol for uVCL by considering the learning of unstructured
video data categories during each task. We propose to use the Kernel Density
Estimation (KDE) of deep embedded video features extracted by unsupervised
video transformer networks as a non-parametric probabilistic representation of
the data. We introduce a novelty detection criterion for the incoming new task
data, dynamically enabling the expansion of memory clusters, aiming to capture
new knowledge when learning a succession of tasks. We leverage the use of
transfer learning from the previous tasks as an initial state for the knowledge
transfer to the current learning task. We found that the proposed methodology
substantially enhances the performance of the model when successively learning
many tasks. We perform in-depth evaluations on three standard video action
recognition datasets, including UCF101, HMDB51, and Something-to-Something V2,
without using any labels or class boundaries.

*Omer Faruk Durugol,Maximilian Rokuss,Yannick Kirchhoff,Klaus H. Maier-Hein*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper details a segmentation method for PDAC in MRI using a multi-stage, cascaded nnU-Net framework with a focus on limited data and high accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address poor tumor-tissue contrast and limited annotated data for automated PDAC segmentation in MRI, essential for clinical workflows.

Method: The approach involves using nnU-Net with cascaded pre-training, fine-tuning on CT and MRI datasets, cross-validation, optimized data augmentation, and metric-aware ensembling.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art performance with a Tumor Dice score of 0.661 for Task 1 and 0.523 for Task 2, and metrics like MASD of 5.46 mm and HD95 of 17.33 mm.

Conclusion: The proposed robust methodology demonstrates effectiveness for specialized, high-performance PDAC segmentation with limited data in medical imaging.

Abstract: Automated segmentation of Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma (PDAC) from MRI is
critical for clinical workflows but is hindered by poor tumor-tissue contrast
and a scarcity of annotated data. This paper details our submission to the
PANTHER challenge, addressing both diagnostic T1-weighted (Task 1) and
therapeutic T2-weighted (Task 2) segmentation. Our approach is built upon the
nnU-Net framework and leverages a deep, multi-stage cascaded pre-training
strategy, starting from a general anatomical foundation model and sequentially
fine-tuning on CT pancreatic lesion datasets and the target MRI modalities.
Through extensive five-fold cross-validation, we systematically evaluated data
augmentation schemes and training schedules. Our analysis revealed a critical
trade-off, where aggressive data augmentation produced the highest volumetric
accuracy, while default augmentations yielded superior boundary precision
(achieving a state-of-the-art MASD of 5.46 mm and HD95 of 17.33 mm for Task 1).
For our final submission, we exploited this finding by constructing custom,
heterogeneous ensembles of specialist models, essentially creating a mix of
experts. This metric-aware ensembling strategy proved highly effective,
achieving a top cross-validation Tumor Dice score of 0.661 for Task 1 and 0.523
for Task 2. Our work presents a robust methodology for developing specialized,
high-performance models in the context of limited data and complex medical
imaging tasks (Team MIC-DKFZ).

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GPT-5 demonstrates strong performance in clinical decision support, particularly in oncology, surpassing prior LLM versions but requires expert oversight.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation was to evaluate and assess the performance of GPT-5, a novel large language model, in clinical decision-making within radiation oncology.

Method: Performance was evaluated using two benchmarks: the ACR Radiation Oncology In-Training Examination (300 multiple-choice questions) and 60 authentic oncologic vignettes, which were rated by board-certified oncologists on correctness, comprehensiveness, and hallucinations.

Result: GPT-5 reached 92.8% accuracy on the TXIT benchmark, markedly outperforming GPT-4 and GPT-3.5. In vignette evaluations, its treatment plans scored high on correctness and comprehensiveness, with minimal hallucinations.

Conclusion: GPT-5 significantly improves on prior models in radiation oncology but still requires stringent clinical validation and oversight due to errors in complex scenarios.

Abstract: Introduction: Large language models (LLM) have shown great potential in
clinical decision support. GPT-5 is a novel LLM system that has been
specifically marketed towards oncology use.
  Methods: Performance was assessed using two complementary benchmarks: (i) the
ACR Radiation Oncology In-Training Examination (TXIT, 2021), comprising 300
multiple-choice items, and (ii) a curated set of 60 authentic radiation
oncologic vignettes representing diverse disease sites and treatment
indications. For the vignette evaluation, GPT-5 was instructed to generate
concise therapeutic plans. Four board-certified radiation oncologists rated
correctness, comprehensiveness, and hallucinations. Inter-rater reliability was
quantified using Fleiss' \k{appa}.
  Results: On the TXIT benchmark, GPT-5 achieved a mean accuracy of 92.8%,
outperforming GPT-4 (78.8%) and GPT-3.5 (62.1%). Domain-specific gains were
most pronounced in Dose and Diagnosis. In the vignette evaluation, GPT-5's
treatment recommendations were rated highly for correctness (mean 3.24/4, 95%
CI: 3.11-3.38) and comprehensiveness (3.59/4, 95% CI: 3.49-3.69).
Hallucinations were rare with no case reaching majority consensus for their
presence. Inter-rater agreement was low (Fleiss' \k{appa} 0.083 for
correctness), reflecting inherent variability in clinical judgment. Errors
clustered in complex scenarios requiring precise trial knowledge or detailed
clinical adaptation.
  Discussion: GPT-5 clearly outperformed prior model variants on the radiation
oncology multiple-choice benchmark. Although GPT-5 exhibited favorable
performance in generating real-world radiation oncology treatment
recommendations, correctness ratings indicate room for further improvement.
While hallucinations were infrequent, the presence of substantive errors
underscores that GPT-5-generated recommendations require rigorous expert
oversight before clinical implementation.

### [118] [TMUAD: Enhancing Logical Capabilities in Unified Anomaly Detection Models with a Text Memory Bank](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21795)
*Jiawei Liu,Jiahe Hou,Wei Wang,Jinsong Du,Yang Cong,Huijie Fan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes TMUAD, a novel framework for anomaly detection using three complementary memory banks (text, image, and patch-level) to identify both structural and logical anomalies, outperforming previous approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenges in anomaly detection due to limited normal data by enhancing logical anomaly detection using text-based representation.

Method: TMUAD employs three memory banks: logical text descriptions (class-level), object contours (image-level), and patch-level image features. These memory banks collaboratively compute and fuse anomaly scores to detect anomalies.

Result: TMUAD achieves state-of-the-art results in structural and logical anomaly detection across seven datasets spanning industrial and medical domains.

Conclusion: The approach effectively unifies logical and structural anomaly detection, offering improved detection accuracy compared to prior models, making it suitable for diverse applications.

Abstract: Anomaly detection, which aims to identify anomalies deviating from normal
patterns, is challenging due to the limited amount of normal data available.
Unlike most existing unified methods that rely on carefully designed image
feature extractors and memory banks to capture logical relationships between
objects, we introduce a text memory bank to enhance the detection of logical
anomalies. Specifically, we propose a Three-Memory framework for Unified
structural and logical Anomaly Detection (TMUAD). First, we build a class-level
text memory bank for logical anomaly detection by the proposed logic-aware text
extractor, which can capture rich logical descriptions of objects from input
images. Second, we construct an object-level image memory bank that preserves
complete object contours by extracting features from segmented objects. Third,
we employ visual encoders to extract patch-level image features for
constructing a patch-level memory bank for structural anomaly detection. These
three complementary memory banks are used to retrieve and compare normal images
that are most similar to the query image, compute anomaly scores at multiple
levels, and fuse them into a final anomaly score. By unifying structural and
logical anomaly detection through collaborative memory banks, TMUAD achieves
state-of-the-art performance across seven publicly available datasets involving
industrial and medical domains. The model and code are available at
https://github.com/SIA-IDE/TMUAD.

*Jasper Uijlings,Xingyi Zhou,Xiuye Gu,Arsha Nagrani,Anurag Arnab,Alireza Fathi,David Ross,Cordelia Schmid*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces VoCap, a video model capable of generating spatio-temporal masks and object-specific captions based on multi-modal prompts (text, box, or mask). They benchmark VoCap with SAV-Caption, a pseudo-captioned dataset and achieve state-of-the-art results across various video object segmentation and captioning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding objects in videos through fine-grained localization and semantic properties is essential for advancing video understanding tasks.

Method: The authors propose VoCap, a model trained with SAV-Caption, an annotated video dataset using pseudo captions generated by a Vision Language Model. It integrates tasks like segmentation and captioning, and is evaluated on other video/image datasets for robustness.

Result: VoCap achieves state-of-the-art performance in referring expression video object segmentation, shows competitiveness in semi-supervised setups, and sets new benchmarks for video object captioning.

Conclusion: VoCap effectively unifies video object segmentation and captioning tasks, proving its adaptability across modalities. The annotated SAV-Caption dataset facilitates better scalability and accuracy in these tasks.

Abstract: Understanding objects in videos in terms of fine-grained localization masks
and detailed semantic properties is a fundamental task in video understanding.
In this paper, we propose VoCap, a flexible video model that consumes a video
and a prompt of various modalities (text, box or mask), and produces a
spatio-temporal masklet with a corresponding object-centric caption. As such
our model addresses simultaneously the tasks of promptable video object
segmentation, referring expression segmentation, and object captioning. Since
obtaining data for this task is tedious and expensive, we propose to annotate
an existing large-scale segmentation dataset (SAV) with pseudo object captions.
We do so by preprocessing videos with their ground-truth masks to highlight the
object of interest and feed this to a large Vision Language Model (VLM). For an
unbiased evaluation, we collect manual annotations on the validation set. We
call the resulting dataset SAV-Caption. We train our VoCap model at scale on a
SAV-Caption together with a mix of other image and video datasets. Our model
yields state-of-the-art results on referring expression video object
segmentation, is competitive on semi-supervised video object segmentation, and
establishes a benchmark for video object captioning. Our dataset will be made
available at https://github.com/google-deepmind/vocap.

*Yiming Lin,Yuchen Niu,Shang Wang,Kaizhu Huang,Qiufeng Wang,Xiao-Bo Jin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses the inherent multi-label nature of visual event classification in computer vision and proposes a novel single-positive multi-label learning approach with a Graph Enhanced Verb Multilayer Perceptron.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods treat visual verb classification as single-label tasks, which fails to capture the semantic ambiguity present in many images where multiple verbs may accurately describe the same event.

Method: The proposed method involves reformulating verb classification as a single-positive multi-label learning problem, leveraging graph neural networks for label correlations, and incorporating adversarial training for improving decision boundaries.

Result: Experiments demonstrate over 3% improvement in mean average precision compared to benchmarks and competitive performance on top-1 and top-5 accuracy metrics.

Conclusion: Reformulating verb classification as a multi-label problem leads to better semantic understanding in image recognition, addressing ambiguities and improving overall task performance.

Abstract: Context recognition (SR) is a fundamental task in computer vision that aims
to extract structured semantic summaries from images by identifying key events
and their associated entities. Specifically, given an input image, the model
must first classify the main visual events (verb classification), then identify
the participating entities and their semantic roles (semantic role labeling),
and finally localize these entities in the image (semantic role localization).
Existing methods treat verb classification as a single-label problem, but we
show through a comprehensive analysis that this formulation fails to address
the inherent ambiguity in visual event recognition, as multiple verb categories
may reasonably describe the same image. This paper makes three key
contributions: First, we reveal through empirical analysis that verb
classification is inherently a multi-label problem due to the ubiquitous
semantic overlap between verb categories. Second, given the impracticality of
fully annotating large-scale datasets with multiple labels, we propose to
reformulate verb classification as a single positive multi-label learning
(SPMLL) problem - a novel perspective in SR research. Third, we design a
comprehensive multi-label evaluation benchmark for SR that is carefully
designed to fairly evaluate model performance in a multi-label setting. To
address the challenges of SPMLL, we futher develop the Graph Enhanced Verb
Multilayer Perceptron (GE-VerbMLP), which combines graph neural networks to
capture label correlations and adversarial training to optimize decision
boundaries. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show that our approach
achieves more than 3\% MAP improvement while remaining competitive on
traditional top-1 and top-5 accuracy metrics.

TL;DR: The paper introduces DriveQA, a benchmark for testing driving knowledge in LLMs/MLLMs, revealing potential improvements through fine-tuning and pretraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Evaluate whether large language models (LLMs) can effectively understand and apply driving knowledge, including rare edge cases not present in real-world datasets.

Method: Developed DriveQA, a text- and vision-based benchmark, conducted experiments to evaluate LLMs' and MLLMs' capabilities in traffic rule understanding and decision-making. Used DriveQA-V for insights on environmental factor sensitivity.

Result: LLMs perform well on basic traffic rules but struggle with complex scenarios. Fine-tuning and pretraining on DriveQA improve performance both on the benchmark and real-world datasets like nuScenes and BDD.

Conclusion: DriveQA provides a comprehensive tool for assessing and enhancing the ability of AI models to generalize driving knowledge to real-world and synthetic scenarios.

Abstract: If a Large Language Model (LLM) were to take a driving knowledge test today,
would it pass? Beyond standard spatial and visual question-answering (QA) tasks
on current autonomous driving benchmarks, driving knowledge tests require a
complete understanding of all traffic rules, signage, and right-of-way
principles. To pass this test, human drivers must discern various edge cases
that rarely appear in real-world datasets. In this work, we present DriveQA, an
extensive open-source text and vision-based benchmark that exhaustively covers
traffic regulations and scenarios. Through our experiments using DriveQA, we
show that (1) state-of-the-art LLMs and Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) perform well on
basic traffic rules but exhibit significant weaknesses in numerical reasoning
and complex right-of-way scenarios, traffic sign variations, and spatial
layouts, (2) fine-tuning on DriveQA improves accuracy across multiple
categories, particularly in regulatory sign recognition and intersection
decision-making, (3) controlled variations in DriveQA-V provide insights into
model sensitivity to environmental factors such as lighting, perspective,
distance, and weather conditions, and (4) pretraining on DriveQA enhances
downstream driving task performance, leading to improved results on real-world
datasets such as nuScenes and BDD, while also demonstrating that models can
internalize text and synthetic traffic knowledge to generalize effectively
across downstream QA tasks.

*Brian Curless,Michael Gowanlock*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper introduces FaSTED, an algorithm for Euclidean distance calculations that leverages tensor cores with mixed precision (FP16-32) for higher throughput.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Exploiting tensor core high computational throughput for applications beyond matrix multiplication, focusing on Euclidean distance calculations critical in data analytics.

Method: FaSTED maximizes hierarchical memory use (global, shared, and registers) to sustain tensor core throughput and applies the algorithm for similarity searches with index-based data structures.

Result: FaSTED provides a speedup of 2.5–51x compared to state-of-the-art algorithms while maintaining accuracy losses below 0.06% across high-dimensional datasets.

Conclusion: Mixed precision tensor cores, when efficiently used with strategies like FaSTED, can significantly accelerate computations with minimal accuracy trade-offs, broadening their applicability in data analytics.

Abstract: Modern GPUs are equipped with tensor cores (TCs) that are commonly used for
matrix multiplication in artificial intelligence workloads. However, because
they have high computational throughput, they can lead to significant
performance gains in other algorithms if they can be successfully exploited. We
examine using TCs to compute Euclidean distance calculations, which are used in
many data analytics applications. Prior work has only investigated using 64 bit
floating point (FP64) data for computation; however, TCs can operate on lower
precision floating point data (i.e., 16 bit matrix multiplication and 32 bit
accumulation), which we refer to as FP16-32. FP16-32 TC peak throughput is so
high that TCs are easily starved of data. We propose a Fast and Scalable Tensor
core Euclidean Distance (FaSTED) algorithm. To achieve high computational
throughput, we design FaSTED for significant hierarchical reuse of data and
maximize memory utilization at every level (global memory, shared memory, and
registers). We apply FaSTED to the application of similarity searches, which
typically employ an indexing data structure to eliminate superfluous Euclidean
distance calculations. We compare to the state-of-the-art (SOTA) TC Euclidean
distance algorithm in the literature that employs FP64, as well as to two
single precision (FP32) CUDA core algorithms that both employ an index. We find
that across four real-world high-dimensional datasets spanning 128-960
dimensions, the mixed-precision brute force approach achieves a speedup over
the SOTA algorithms of 2.5-51x. We also quantify the accuracy loss of our mixed
precision algorithm to be less than <0.06% when compared to the FP64 baseline.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper introduces decentralized federated averaging via random walk (DFedRW) to address slow convergence in federated learning, proposing a quantized version to enhance efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing federated learning methods have challenges like slow convergence, data heterogeneity, and straggler effects, especially in decentralized setups.

Method: DFedRW utilizes random walk updates instead of multiple local updates and includes quantization for communication efficiency. Partial random walk updates are aggregated to include all computations.

Result: DFedRW and its quantized version outperform decentralized FedAvg, achieving up to 38.3% higher test accuracy under heterogeneous conditions.

Conclusion: DFedRW enhances convergence and accuracy in decentralized federated learning, while quantization balances communication and model performance.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a communication-efficient distributed machine
learning method that allows multiple devices to collaboratively train models
without sharing raw data. FL can be categorized into centralized and
decentralized paradigms. The centralized paradigm relies on a central server to
aggregate local models, potentially resulting in single points of failure,
communication bottlenecks, and exposure of model parameters. In contrast, the
decentralized paradigm, which does not require a central server, provides
improved robustness and privacy. The essence of federated learning lies in
leveraging multiple local updates for efficient communication. However, this
approach may result in slower convergence or even convergence to suboptimal
models in the presence of heterogeneous and imbalanced data. To address this
challenge, we study decentralized federated averaging via random walk (DFedRW),
which replaces multiple local update steps on a single device with random walk
updates. Traditional Federated Averaging (FedAvg) and its decentralized
versions commonly ignore stragglers, which reduces the amount of training data
and introduces sampling bias. Therefore, we allow DFedRW to aggregate partial
random walk updates, ensuring that each computation contributes to the model
update. To further improve communication efficiency, we also propose a
quantized version of DFedRW. We demonstrate that (quantized) DFedRW achieves
convergence upper bound of order $\mathcal{O}(\frac{1}{k^{1-q}})$ under convex
conditions. Furthermore, we propose a sufficient condition that reveals when
quantization balances communication and convergence. Numerical analysis
indicates that our proposed algorithms outperform (decentralized) FedAvg in
both convergence rate and accuracy, achieving a 38.3\% and 37.5\% increase in
test accuracy under high levels of heterogeneities.

TL;DR: The paper discusses hurdles in achieving reproducibility in high-performance computing (HPC) research and proposes CORRECT, a tool leveraging GitHub Actions to securely test and document reproducibility evaluations on remote HPC resources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation arises from the growing initiative in the HPC community to support reproducibility, as barriers such as unique infrastructures and strict access restrictions hinder widespread adoption of reproducibility practices.

Method: The authors conduct a survey of reproducibility trends and challenges in HPC, design CORRECT (a GitHub Action), and evaluate its usability across three diverse HPC applications.

Result: CORRECT is proven effective in automating secure execution and documentation of reproducibility tests on remote HPC systems.

Conclusion: Enhancing HPC-specific CI solutions like CORRECT can significantly reduce reproducibility barriers, improving research reliability in HPC.

Abstract: The high-performance computing (HPC) community has adopted incentive
structures to motivate reproducible research, with major conferences awarding
badges to papers that meet reproducibility requirements. Yet, many papers do
not meet such requirements. The uniqueness of HPC infrastructure and software,
coupled with strict access requirements, may limit opportunities for
reproducibility. In the absence of resource access, we believe that regular
documented testing, through continuous integration (CI), coupled with complete
provenance information, can be used as a substitute. Here, we argue that better
HPC-compliant CI solutions will improve reproducibility of applications. We
present a survey of reproducibility initiatives and describe the barriers to
reproducibility in HPC. To address existing limitations, we present a GitHub
Action, CORRECT, that enables secure execution of tests on remote HPC
resources. We evaluate CORRECT's usability across three different types of HPC
applications, demonstrating the effectiveness of using CORRECT for automating
and documenting reproducibility evaluations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Optimize IoT application scheduling in Cloud-Edge-IoT environments by addressing challenges such as computational heterogeneity, non-IID data distributions, and inadequate cross-domain collaboration.

Method: Development of KD-AFRL with resource-aware neural architectures, privacy-preserving federated learning using differential privacy and clustering, and cross-architecture knowledge distillation mechanisms.

Result: KD-AFRL demonstrates 21% faster convergence and over 10% improvements in metrics like completion time, energy usage, and cost. Scalability tests show 3-5 times better performance retention in multi-domain setups.

Conclusion: KD-AFRL effectively enhances IoT scheduling performance while maintaining scalability and addressing key domain-specific challenges.

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) applications across
heterogeneous Cloud-Edge-IoT environments presents significant challenges in
distributed scheduling optimization. Existing approaches face issues, including
fixed neural network architectures that are incompatible with computational
heterogeneity, non-Independent and Identically Distributed (non-IID) data
distributions across IoT scheduling domains, and insufficient cross-domain
collaboration mechanisms. This paper proposes KD-AFRL, a Knowledge
Distillation-empowered Adaptive Federated Reinforcement Learning framework that
addresses multi-domain IoT application scheduling through three core
innovations. First, we develop a resource-aware hybrid architecture generation
mechanism that creates dual-zone neural networks enabling heterogeneous devices
to participate in collaborative learning while maintaining optimal resource
utilization. Second, we propose a privacy-preserving environment-clustered
federated learning approach that utilizes differential privacy and K-means
clustering to address non-IID challenges and facilitate effective collaboration
among compatible domains. Third, we introduce an environment-oriented
cross-architecture knowledge distillation mechanism that enables efficient
knowledge transfer between heterogeneous models through temperature-regulated
soft targets. Comprehensive experiments with real Cloud-Edge-IoT infrastructure
demonstrate KD-AFRL's effectiveness using diverse IoT applications. Results
show significant improvements over the best baseline, with 21% faster
convergence and 15.7%, 10.8%, and 13.9% performance gains in completion time,
energy consumption, and weighted cost, respectively. Scalability experiments
reveal that KD-AFRL achieves 3-5 times better performance retention compared to
existing solutions as the number of domains increases.

Abstract: The evolution of blockchain technology, from its origins as a decentralized
ledger for cryptocurrencies to its broader applications in areas like
decentralized finance (DeFi), has significantly transformed financial
ecosystems while introducing new challenges such as Maximum Extractable Value
(MEV). This paper explores MEV on the Polygon blockchain, with a particular
focus on Atomic Arbitrage (AA) transactions. We establish criteria for
identifying AA transactions and analyze key factors such as searcher behavior,
bidding dynamics, and token usage. Utilizing a dataset spanning 22 months and
covering 23 million blocks, we examine MEV dynamics with a focus on Spam-based
and Auction-based backrunning strategies. Our findings reveal that while
Spam-based transactions are more prevalent, Auction-based transactions
demonstrate greater profitability. Through detailed examples and analysis, we
investigate the interactions between network architecture, transaction
sequencing, and MEV extraction, offering comprehensive insights into the
evolution and challenges of MEV in decentralized ecosystems. These results
emphasize the need for robust transaction ordering mechanisms and highlight the
implications of emerging MEV strategies for blockchain networks.

TL;DR: Odyssey is an adaptive fault-tolerant system for large language model training that optimizes recovery strategies to minimize performance gaps after failures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Frequent interruptions due to faults in large language model training require an efficient and robust fault-tolerance system.

Method: Odyssey uses a unified performance model, fast execution plan search, precise performance estimation, and communication optimizations to select optimal recovery strategies dynamically.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that Odyssey has a performance gap of within 11% post-recovery and outperforms state-of-the-art methods with higher throughput.

Conclusion: Odyssey provides an effective solution for fault-tolerant large language model training, ensuring performance, convergence, and memory efficiency.

Abstract: Training large language models faces frequent interruptions due to various
faults, demanding robust fault-tolerance. Existing backup-free methods, such as
redundant computation, dynamic parallelism, and data rerouting, each incur
performance penalties, whether from ongoing overhead, lengthy reconfigurations,
or post-recovery inefficiencies. We propose Odyssey, an adaptive fault-tolerant
system that intelligently selects optimal recovery strategies when a failure
occurs. Odyssey achieves this through a unified performance model, expedient
execution plan search, accurate performance estimation, and efficient
communication optimizations. Experiments on a 32-card cluster show that Odyssey
maintains a performance gap of within 11.00% between post-recovery and
failure-free training, while preserving model convergence and efficient memory
usage. Compared to state-of-the-art methods, Odyssey achieves up to 1.229x and
1.355x higher average throughput than Oobleck and Recycle, respectively.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: SpecMoEOff improves Mixture of Experts (MoE) models' inference efficiency by speculatively decoding workloads and integrating hardware-optimized operations, achieving up to 2.5x faster throughput than existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Limitations in GPU memory and inefficiencies caused by I/O bottlenecks and sparse computation in MoE models reduce hardware utilization.

Method: SpecMoEOff uses speculative decoding to better allocate workloads among experts and integrates a CPU chunked attention verification kernel to minimize overhead. Additionally, it incorporates an optimizer for hyperparameter tuning based on hardware and workload.

Result: The approach improved decoding throughput by up to 2.5x compared to the current state-of-the-art offloading solutions.

Conclusion: SpecMoEOff effectively addresses utilization inefficiencies in MoE models, particularly focusing on balancing GPU and CPU tasks, making it a robust solution for overcoming hardware bottlenecks.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Mixture of Experts (MoE) models have significantly
increased their parameter scale as well as model performance. Extensive
offloading techniques have been proposed to address the GPU memory limitations
of MoE inference. However, due to the I/O bottleneck and sparse computation of
MoE models, existing offloading techniques still suffer from low hardware
utilization. To fully utilize the hardware resources, we propose SpecMoEOff,
which employs the speculative decoding technique to enlarge the workload of
each expert. SpecMoEOff orchestrates the GPU and CPU by both theoretical and
empirical roofline analysis. In addition, we develop a dedicated CPU chunked
attention verification kernel to fit the speculative decoding in offloading
scenarios as well as minimizing the additional overhead led by draft models.
SpecMoEOff further integrates an optimizer to automatically tune the
hyperparameters of speculative decoding under given hardware and workload.
Experimental results show that SpecMoEOff achieves up to 2.5x decode throughput
improvement over the state-of-the-art MoE offloading techniques.

### [129] [Normalisation of SWIFT Message Counterparties with Feature Extraction and Clustering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21081)
*Thanasis Schoinas,Benjamin Guinard,Diba Esbati,Richard Chalk*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a hybrid methodology combining string similarity, topic modeling, hierarchical clustering, and rule-based pipelines to cluster transaction counterparties while addressing practical challenges like noisy manual entries and unknown cluster numbers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clustering transaction counterparties, especially in banking systems like SWIFT, is challenging due to the lack of sentence structure and manual entry noise in the data. This creates a gap for professionals trying to trace funds and assets.

Method: A hybrid pipeline integrating string similarity techniques, topic modeling, hierarchical clustering, and rule-based systems was developed. Custom metrics based on precision and recall were introduced for evaluation.

Result: On real-life labeled datasets, the proposed approach significantly outperformed a baseline rule-based keyword clustering system. It improved cluster refinement while retaining system interpretability.

Conclusion: The pipeline facilitates clustering and reduces the need for manual review in applications like sanctions investigations. It offers improved performance, better risk control, and addresses variations in transaction entity names.

Abstract: Short text clustering is a known use case in the text analytics community.
When the structure and content falls in the natural language domain e.g.
Twitter posts or instant messages, then natural language techniques can be
used, provided texts are of sufficient length to allow for use of (pre)trained
models to extract meaningful information, such as part-of-speech or topic
annotations. However, natural language models are not suitable for clustering
transaction counterparties, as they are found in bank payment messaging
systems, such as SWIFT. The manually typed tags are typically physical or legal
entity details, which lack sentence structure, while containing all the
variations and noise that manual entry introduces. This leaves a gap in an
investigator or counter-fraud professional's toolset when looking to augment
their knowledge of payment flow originator and beneficiary entities and trace
funds and assets. A gap that vendors traditionally try to close with fuzzy
matching tools. With these considerations in mind, we are proposing a hybrid
string similarity, topic modelling, hierarchical clustering and rule-based
pipeline to facilitate clustering of transaction counterparties, also catering
for unknown number of expected clusters. We are also devising metrics to
supplement the evaluation of the approach, based on the well-known measures of
precision and recall. Testing on a real-life labelled dataset demonstrates
significantly improved performance over a baseline rule-based ('keyword')
approach. The approach retains most of the interpretability found in rule-based
systems, as the former adds an additional level of cluster refinement to the
latter. The resulting workflow reduces the need for manual review. When only a
subset of the population needs to be investigated, such as in sanctions
investigations, the approach allows for better control of the risks of missing
entity variations.

TL;DR: This paper explores reinforcement learning (RL) advancements in healthcare, highlighting its transformative role in decision-making rather than prediction, while addressing technical, ethical, and deployment challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the need for advanced AI systems that move beyond mere predictions to actively decide interventions for long-term clinical goals.

Method: The survey structures RL techniques, analyzes applications across healthcare domains, and critically evaluates ethical, deployment, and reward design challenges.

Result: The paper identifies trends, gaps, and translational bottlenecks in RL applications and synthesizes lessons for safe and human-aligned policy learning.

Conclusion: RL has the potential to redefine healthcare AI by shifting it toward agentive intelligence, but requires careful handling of ethical, technical, and deployment issues.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) marks a fundamental shift in how artificial
intelligence is applied in healthcare. Instead of merely predicting outcomes,
RL actively decides interventions with long term goals. Unlike traditional
models that operate on fixed associations, RL systems learn through trial,
feedback, and long-term reward optimization, introducing transformative
possibilities and new risks. From an information fusion lens, healthcare RL
typically integrates multi-source signals such as vitals, labs clinical notes,
imaging and device telemetry using temporal and decision-level mechanisms.
These systems can operate within centralized, federated, or edge architectures
to meet real-time clinical constraints, and naturally span data, features and
decision fusion levels. This survey explore RL's rise in healthcare as more
than a set of tools, rather a shift toward agentive intelligence in clinical
environments. We first structure the landscape of RL techniques including
model-based and model-free methods, offline and batch-constrained approaches,
and emerging strategies for reward specification and uncertainty calibration
through the lens of healthcare constraints. We then comprehensively analyze RL
applications spanning critical care, chronic disease, mental health,
diagnostics, and robotic assistance, identifying their trends, gaps, and
translational bottlenecks. In contrast to prior reviews, we critically analyze
RL's ethical, deployment, and reward design challenges, and synthesize lessons
for safe, human-aligned policy learning. This paper serves as both a a
technical roadmap and a critical reflection of RL's emerging transformative
role in healthcare AI not as prediction machinery, but as agentive clinical
intelligence.

*Abdul Rehman,Ilona Heldal,Jerry Chun-Wei Lin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a multigranularity EEG emotion classification framework using the GAMEEMO dataset and demonstrates the superior performance of the LSTM-GRU model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitations of existing EEG emotion recognition studies that focus narrowly on binary valence prediction or subject-specific classification, hindering generalizability and real-world deployment.

Method: Developed a unified framework using structured preprocessing (temporal segmentation, feature extraction, z-score normalization) and emotion label encoding across binary, multi-class, and multi-label axes. Evaluated classical machine learning models and deep neural architectures.

Result: The LSTM-GRU model achieved superior results across tasks: F1-score of 0.932 for binary valence classification, and 94.5% and 90.6% accuracy for multi-class and multi-label classification, respectively.

Conclusion: The proposed framework demonstrates robust performance across multiple emotion classification tasks, showcasing its potential for generalizability and application in real-world affective computing systems.

Abstract: Recent advancements in EEG-based emotion recognition have shown promising
outcomes using both deep learning and classical machine learning approaches;
however, most existing studies focus narrowly on binary valence prediction or
subject-specific classification, which limits generalizability and deployment
in real-world affective computing systems. To address this gap, this paper
presents a unified, multigranularity EEG emotion classification framework built
on the GAMEEMO dataset, which consists of 14-channel EEG recordings and
continuous self-reported emotion ratings (boring, horrible, calm, and funny)
from 28 subjects across four emotion-inducing gameplay scenarios. Our pipeline
employs a structured preprocessing strategy that comprises temporal window
segmentation, hybrid statistical and frequency-domain feature extraction, and
z-score normalization to convert raw EEG signals into robust, discriminative
input vectors. Emotion labels are derived and encoded across three
complementary axes: (i) binary valence classification based on the averaged
polarity of positive and negative emotion ratings, and (ii) Multi-class emotion
classification, where the presence of the most affective state is predicted.
(iii) Fine-grained multi-label representation via binning each emotion into 10
ordinal classes. We evaluate a broad spectrum of models, including Random
Forest, XGBoost, and SVM, alongside deep neural architectures such as LSTM,
LSTM-GRU, and CNN-LSTM. Among these, the LSTM-GRU model consistently
outperforms the others, achieving an F1-score of 0.932 in the binary valence
task and 94.5% and 90.6% in both multi-class and Multi-Label emotion
classification.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Gen-LRA, a new and efficient privacy attack for auditing synthetic data, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of current privacy auditing frameworks for synthetic data, which rely on heuristics and fail to provide robust detection methods for privacy exposure.

Method: The paper proposes Gen-LRA, a No-Box Membership Inference Attack that uses a surrogate model to evaluate the influence of test observations on local likelihood ratios over synthetic data without assumptions about the original model.

Result: Gen-LRA consistently outperforms existing MIAs when tested across diverse datasets, model architectures, and attack parameters.

Conclusion: Gen-LRA is an effective tool for auditing synthetic data privacy by revealing privacy risks caused by generative model overfitting.

Abstract: Auditing the privacy leakage of synthetic data is an important but unresolved
problem. Most existing privacy auditing frameworks for synthetic data rely on
heuristics and unreasonable assumptions to attack the failure modes of
generative models, exhibiting limited capability to describe and detect the
privacy exposure of training data through synthetic data release. In this
paper, we study designing Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) that specifically
exploit the observation that tabular generative models tend to significantly
overfit to certain regions of the training distribution. Here, we propose
Generative Likelihood Ratio Attack (Gen-LRA), a novel, computationally
efficient No-Box MIA that, with no assumption of model knowledge or access,
formulates its attack by evaluating the influence a test observation has in a
surrogate model's estimation of a local likelihood ratio over the synthetic
data. Assessed over a comprehensive benchmark spanning diverse datasets, model
architectures, and attack parameters, we find that Gen-LRA consistently
dominates other MIAs for generative models across multiple performance metrics.
These results underscore Gen-LRA's effectiveness as a privacy auditing tool for
the release of synthetic data, highlighting the significant privacy risks posed
by generative model overfitting in real-world applications.

*Wenfeng Feng,Penghong Zhao,Guochao Jiang,Chuzhan Hao,Yuewei Zhang,Hao Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PVPO is a novel reinforcement learning method addressing limitations of group policy approaches by introducing a reference model for advantage estimation and data pre-sampling, achieving SOTA performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing critic-free reinforcement methods face challenges with local optima and high computational costs due to reliance on multiple sampling within policies.

Method: PVPO integrates an advantage reference anchor from a reference model along with data pre-sampling to reduce rollouts and bias while improving selection of training data.

Result: Experiments across nine datasets and two domains confirmed PVPO's SOTA performance and scalability across various scales of models.

Conclusion: PVPO improves generalization, efficiency, and scalability, offering a significant advancement in critic-free reinforcement learning methods.

Abstract: Critic-free reinforcement learning methods, particularly group policies, have
attracted considerable attention for their efficiency in complex tasks.
However, these methods rely heavily on multiple sampling and comparisons within
the policy to estimate advantage, which may cause the policy to fall into local
optimum and increase computational cost. To address these issues, we propose
PVPO, an efficient reinforcement learning method enhanced by an advantage
reference anchor and data pre-sampling. Specifically, we use the reference
model to rollout in advance and employ the calculated reward score as a
reference anchor. Our approach effectively corrects the cumulative bias
introduced by intra-group comparisons and significantly reduces reliance on the
number of rollouts. Meanwhile, the reference model can assess sample difficulty
during data pre-sampling, enabling effective selection of high-gain data to
improve training efficiency. Experiments conducted on nine datasets across two
domains demonstrate that PVPO achieves State-Of-The-Art (SOTA) performance. Our
approach not only demonstrates robust generalization across multiple tasks, but
also exhibits scalable performance across models of varying scales.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces SLAC Neural Network Library (SNL) and its Python extension Auto-SNL to handle massive data challenges in high-speed experiments using FPGA-optimized machine learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the challenge of handling massive data streams (exceeding 1 TB/s) in high-speed experimental environments, where conventional ML implementations introduce latency unsuitable for real-time data reduction.

Method: The authors developed SNL, a framework for deploying real-time ML on FPGAs, allowing dynamic model weight updates. They also created Auto-SNL to simplify the conversion of Python-based models into SNL-compatible FPGA synthesis code.

Result: SNL achieved competitive or superior latency compared to hls4ml in most neural network architectures, with additional savings in FPGA resources for specific cases.

Conclusion: SNL provides a flexible and efficient solution for real-time ML in high-speed experiments and is versatile for applications in various domains, such as physics, medical imaging, and robotics.

Abstract: The LCLS-II Free Electron Laser (FEL) will generate X-ray pulses for beamline
experiments at rates of up to 1~MHz, with detectors producing data throughputs
exceeding 1 TB/s. Managing such massive data streams presents significant
challenges, as transmission and storage infrastructures become prohibitively
expensive. Machine learning (ML) offers a promising solution for real-time data
reduction, but conventional implementations introduce excessive latency, making
them unsuitable for high-speed experimental environments. To address these
challenges, SLAC developed the SLAC Neural Network Library (SNL), a specialized
framework designed to deploy real-time ML inference models on
Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA). SNL's key feature is the ability to
dynamically update model weights without requiring FPGA resynthesis, enhancing
flexibility for adaptive learning applications. To further enhance usability
and accessibility, we introduce Auto-SNL, a Python extension that streamlines
the process of converting Python-based neural network models into
SNL-compatible high-level synthesis code. This paper presents a benchmark
comparison against hls4ml, the current state-of-the-art tool, across multiple
neural network architectures, fixed-point precisions, and synthesis
configurations targeting a Xilinx ZCU102 FPGA. The results showed that SNL
achieves competitive or superior latency in most tested architectures, while in
some cases also offering FPGA resource savings. This adaptation demonstrates
SNL's versatility, opening new opportunities for researchers and academics in
fields such as high-energy physics, medical imaging, robotics, and many more.

*Tatyana Matveeva,Aleksandr Katrutsa,Evgeny Frolov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces AdaGram, an optimizer designed for efficient full-matrix adaptive gradient updates, addressing limitations of current large-scale optimization methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most widely used adaptive gradient methods rely on diagonal preconditioning, which fails to capture parameter correlations. Full-matrix methods could address this but are computationally expensive.

Method: AdaGram employs fast symmetric factorization and matrix integrator methods to efficiently handle full-matrix adaptive gradient updates while maintaining a low-rank structure.

Result: Numerical experiments indicate that AdaGram achieves faster convergence or matches the performance of diagonal adaptive optimizers, even with low-rank approximations (e.g., rank 5).

Conclusion: AdaGram serves as a scalable and efficient solution for large-scale optimization, balancing performance improvement with manageable computational costs.

Abstract: Adaptive gradient methods like Adagrad and its variants are widespread in
large-scale optimization. However, their use of diagonal preconditioning
matrices limits the ability to capture parameter correlations. Full-matrix
adaptive methods, approximating the exact Hessian, can model these correlations
and may enable faster convergence. At the same time, their computational and
memory costs are often prohibitive for large-scale models. To address this
limitation, we propose AdaGram, an optimizer that enables efficient full-matrix
adaptive gradient updates. To reduce memory and computational overhead, we
utilize fast symmetric factorization for computing the preconditioned update
direction at each iteration. Additionally, we maintain the low-rank structure
of a preconditioner along the optimization trajectory using matrix integrator
methods. Numerical experiments on standard machine learning tasks show that
AdaGram converges faster or matches the performance of diagonal adaptive
optimizers when using rank five and smaller rank approximations. This
demonstrates AdaGram's potential as a scalable solution for adaptive
optimization in large models.

Motivation: To ensure reliable application of PINNs for solving partial differential equations by analyzing convergence guarantees of stochastic optimization methods.

Method: The paper provides a theoretical analysis of stochastic gradient descent/flow for over-parameterized two-layer PINNs using positive definiteness of Gram matrices.

Result: Linear convergence of stochastic gradient descent for PINNs is established with high probability for a general class of activation functions.

Conclusion: The findings extend previous results and offer insights and guarantees for training PINNs with stochastic methods, improving understanding of optimization dynamics.

Abstract: Physics informed neural networks (PINNs) represent a very popular class of
neural solvers for partial differential equations. In practice, one often
employs stochastic gradient descent type algorithms to train the neural
network. Therefore, the convergence guarantee of stochastic gradient descent is
of fundamental importance. In this work, we establish the linear convergence of
stochastic gradient descent / flow in training over-parameterized two layer
PINNs for a general class of activation functions in the sense of high
probability. These results extend the existing result [18] in which gradient
descent was analyzed. The challenge of the analysis lies in handling the
dynamic randomness introduced by stochastic optimization methods. The key of
the analysis lies in ensuring the positive definiteness of suitable Gram
matrices during the training. The analysis sheds insight into the dynamics of
the optimization process, and provides guarantees on the neural networks
trained by stochastic algorithms.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper explores the development of artificial intelligence (AI)-powered solutions for anomaly detection in NASA's Deep Space Network (DSN) operations using machine learning models, reinforcement learning, and large language models. A data pipeline was also developed for streamlining data extraction, parsing, and processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of detecting and managing equipment degradation and anomalies in NASA's Deep Space Network, which ensures uninterrupted communication with spacecraft. Disruptions in DSN can lead to costly downtime and potential loss of data.

Method: The authors employed machine learning techniques for predictive data analysis, a reinforcement learning subsystem for classifying anomalies by severity, and a large language model for explaining anomalies. Additionally, they developed a data pipeline to integrate and preprocess datasets, closing the gap in workflow coherence for DSN anomaly detection.

Result: The system successfully integrated machine learning, reinforcement learning, and language models into a data pipeline, which allowed for actionable anomaly detection. This agentic AI system achieves sophisticated classification and prediction of anomalies in real-time datasets.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that this AI-centric approach to anomaly detection enhances the operational reliability and maintenance of the DSN, ultimately benefitting future space missions that depend on continuous and dependable communication networks.

Abstract: The Deep Space Network (DSN) is NASA's largest network of antenna facilities
that generate a large volume of multivariate time-series data. These facilities
contain DSN antennas and transmitters that undergo degradation over long
periods of time, which may cause costly disruptions to the data flow and
threaten the earth-connection of dozens of spacecraft that rely on the Deep
Space Network for their lifeline. The purpose of this study was to experiment
with different methods that would be able to assist JPL engineers with directly
pinpointing anomalies and equipment degradation through collected data, and
continue conducting maintenance and operations of the DSN for future space
missions around our universe. As such, we have researched various machine
learning techniques that can fully reconstruct data through predictive
analysis, and determine anomalous data entries within real-time datasets
through statistical computations and thresholds. On top of the fully trained
and tested machine learning models, we have also integrated the use of a
reinforcement learning subsystem that classifies identified anomalies based on
severity level and a Large Language Model that labels an explanation for each
anomalous data entry, all of which can be improved and fine-tuned over time
through human feedback/input. Specifically, for the DSN transmitters, we have
also implemented a full data pipeline system that connects the data extraction,
parsing, and processing workflow all together as there was no coherent program
or script for performing these tasks before. Using this data pipeline system,
we were able to then also connect the models trained from DSN antenna data,
completing the data workflow for DSN anomaly detection. This was all wrapped
around and further connected by an agentic AI system, where complex reasoning
was utilized to determine the classifications and predictions of anomalous
data.

*Pranoy Panda,Raghav Magazine,Chaitanya Devaguptapu,Sho Takemori,Vishal Sharma*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses the challenge of selecting the most suitable Large Language Model (LLM) for queries/tasks dynamically by framing it as a contextual bandit problem. Instead of exhaustive supervised learning, the authors propose adaptive decision-making using online bandit feedback, leveraging a shared embedding space and a cost-efficient routing policy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in practical LLM applications arise due to varying capabilities and costs of models, as well as the lack of comprehensive mappings for optimal query-LLM pairings in real-world settings.

Method: The paper introduces PILOT, an extension of LinUCB, to develop a shared embedding space that aligns query and LLM embeddings using offline human preference data and online bandit feedback. Additionally, it includes a cost policy based on the multi-choice knapsack problem to address resource constraints.

Result: The proposed model establishes an adaptive routing mechanism that dynamically selects the most suitable LLM for user queries while optimizing for performance and resource efficiency.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates that contextual bandit frameworks enable practical, adaptive routing of LLMs by learning from user preferences and real-time feedback, offering scalability and cost efficiency.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing,
but their varying capabilities and costs pose challenges in practical
applications. LLM routing addresses this by dynamically selecting the most
suitable LLM for each query/task. Previous approaches treat this as a
supervised learning problem, assuming complete knowledge of optimal query-LLM
pairings. However, real-world scenarios lack such comprehensive mappings and
face evolving user queries. We thus propose to study LLM routing as a
contextual bandit problem, enabling adaptive decision-making using bandit
feedback without requiring exhaustive inference across all LLMs for all queries
(in contrast to supervised routing). To address this problem, we develop a
shared embedding space for queries and LLMs, where query and LLM embeddings are
aligned to reflect their affinity. This space is initially learned from offline
human preference data and refined through online bandit feedback. We
instantiate this idea through Preference-prior Informed Linucb fOr adaptive
rouTing (PILOT), a novel extension of LinUCB. To handle diverse user budgets
for model routing, we introduce an online cost policy modeled as a multi-choice
knapsack problem, ensuring resource-efficient routing.

Result: DeepResESNs demonstrated superior performance in memory capacity and long-term temporal modeling tasks compared to shallow and deep Reservoir Computing frameworks.

Conclusion: DeepResESNs provide a robust solution to the limitations of traditional ESNs, showing promise for advanced long-term time series tasks.

Abstract: Echo State Networks (ESNs) are a particular type of untrained Recurrent
Neural Networks (RNNs) within the Reservoir Computing (RC) framework, popular
for their fast and efficient learning. However, traditional ESNs often struggle
with long-term information processing. In this paper, we introduce a novel
class of deep untrained RNNs based on temporal residual connections, called
Deep Residual Echo State Networks (DeepResESNs). We show that leveraging a
hierarchy of untrained residual recurrent layers significantly boosts memory
capacity and long-term temporal modeling. For the temporal residual
connections, we consider different orthogonal configurations, including
randomly generated and fixed-structure configurations, and we study their
effect on network dynamics. A thorough mathematical analysis outlines necessary
and sufficient conditions to ensure stable dynamics within DeepResESN. Our
experiments on a variety of time series tasks showcase the advantages of the
proposed approach over traditional shallow and deep RC.

*Ziheng Chen,Jin Huang,Jiali Cheng,Yuchan Guo,Mengjie Wang,Lalitesh Morishetti,Kaushiki Nag,Hadi Amiri*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces FUTURE, a gradient-based optimization unlearning algorithm for tree ensembles, improving unlearning efficiency and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tree ensembles excel in diverse classification tasks, but advancements in unlearning sensitive data are needed, especially with privacy requirements.

Method: The authors present a gradient optimization framework using probabilistic model approximations to handle non-differentiability in tree ensembles.

Result: FUTURE demonstrates efficient and effective unlearning capabilities in experiments with real-world datasets.

Conclusion: FUTURE addresses limitations in generalization and scalability of traditional unlearning approaches, offering a practical and successful solution for sensitive data removal from tree ensembles.

Abstract: Tree ensembles are widely recognized for their effectiveness in
classification tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance across diverse
domains, including bioinformatics, finance, and medical diagnosis. With
increasing emphasis on data privacy and the \textit{right to be forgotten},
several unlearning algorithms have been proposed to enable tree ensembles to
forget sensitive information. However, existing methods are often tailored to a
particular model or rely on the discrete tree structure, making them difficult
to generalize to complex ensembles and inefficient for large-scale datasets. To
address these limitations, we propose FUTURE, a novel unlearning algorithm for
tree ensembles. Specifically, we formulate the problem of forgetting samples as
a gradient-based optimization task. In order to accommodate
non-differentiability of tree ensembles, we adopt the probabilistic model
approximations within the optimization framework. This enables end-to-end
unlearning in an effective and efficient manner. Extensive experiments on
real-world datasets show that FUTURE yields significant and successful
unlearning performance.

### [142] [Manifold Trajectories in Next-Token Prediction: From Replicator Dynamics to Softmax Equilibrium](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21186)
*Christopher R. Lee-Jenkins*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents a mathematical framework for token distribution in decoding large language models, showing convergence to softmax equilibrium.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To better understand the principles governing next-token selection in large language models and provide practice-relevant insights into sampling methods.

Method: The paper formalizes decoding as a constrained variational principle on the probability simplex, analyzing discrete and continuous-time dynamics (multiplicative-weights updates and replicator flows).

Result: It demonstrates that next-token distributions follow smooth trajectories in the simplex, converging to the softmax equilibrium while accounting for temperature variations and sampling constraints.

Conclusion: The work provides a concise mathematical understanding of decoding processes, offering new perspectives on temperature scaling, sampling methods, and path-dependent behaviors in language models.

Abstract: Decoding in large language models is often described as scoring tokens and
normalizing with softmax. We give a minimal, self-contained account of this
step as a constrained variational principle on the probability simplex. The
discrete, normalization-respecting ascent is the classical
multiplicative-weights (entropic mirror) update; its continuous-time limit is
the replicator flow. From these ingredients we prove that, for a fixed context
and temperature, the next-token distribution follows a smooth trajectory inside
the simplex and converges to the softmax equilibrium. This formalizes the
common ``manifold traversal'' intuition at the output-distribution level. The
analysis yields precise, practice-facing consequences: temperature acts as an
exact rescaling of time along the same trajectory, while top-k and nucleus
sampling restrict the flow to a face with identical guarantees. We also outline
a controlled account of path-dependent score adjustments and their connection
to loop-like, hallucination-style behavior. We make no claims about training
dynamics or internal representations; those are deferred to future work.

*Haoze Wu,Cheng Wang,Wenshuo Zhao,Junxian He*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper investigates counterintuitive reinforcement learning (RL) phenomena in large language models (LLMs) and examines how model-task alignment affects the outcomes of RL training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to clarify the conditions under which recent counterintuitive claims about RL in LLMs hold true and to identify limitations to these claims.

Method: The study systematically evaluates claims about RL phenomena in LLMs through rigorous experimental validation, comparing different model architectures and task domains.

Result: Findings reveal that counterintuitive RL results occur only when LLMs already exhibit strong model-task alignment, while standard RL methods perform better in challenging scenarios.

Conclusion: The results highlight the importance of model-task alignment in explaining counterintuitive RL results and reinforce the robustness of standard RL training in difficult settings.

Abstract: Recent advances in applying reinforcement learning (RL) to large language
models (LLMs) have led to substantial progress. In particular, a series of
remarkable yet often counterintuitive phenomena have been reported in LLMs,
exhibiting patterns not typically observed in traditional RL settings. For
example, notable claims include that a single training example can match the
performance achieved with an entire dataset, that the reward signal does not
need to be very accurate, and that training solely with negative samples can
match or even surpass sophisticated reward-based methods. However, the precise
conditions under which these observations hold - and, critically, when they
fail - remain unclear. In this work, we identify a key factor that
differentiates RL observations: whether the pretrained model already exhibits
strong Model-Task Alignment, as measured by pass@k accuracy on the evaluated
task. Through a systematic and comprehensive examination of a series of
counterintuitive claims, supported by rigorous experimental validation across
different model architectures and task domains, our findings show that while
standard RL training remains consistently robust across settings, many of these
counterintuitive results arise only when the model and task already exhibit
strong model-task alignment. In contrast, these techniques fail to drive
substantial learning in more challenging regimes, where standard RL methods
remain effective.

*Pujan Thapa,Alexander Ororbia,Travis Desell*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a generative continual learning framework utilizing self-organizing maps (SOMs) and variational autoencoders (VAEs) for memory-efficient replay without storing raw data samples or task labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of memory-efficient continual learning by eliminating the need to store raw data and task labels while maintaining competitive performance.

Method: The method integrates SOMs and VAEs, using SOM for latent spaces in high-dimensional inputs and standalone SOM for low-dimensional inputs, and stores statistical summaries for replay.

Result: The approach achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art memory-based methods and surpasses memory-free methods, improving single-class incremental results on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 by significant margins.

Conclusion: The proposed method is scalable, task-label-free, memory-efficient, and provides visualization and generative model utility for continual learning challenges.

Abstract: This work introduces a novel generative continual learning framework based on
self-organizing maps (SOMs) and variational autoencoders (VAEs) to enable
memory-efficient replay, eliminating the need to store raw data samples or task
labels. For high-dimensional input spaces, such as of CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100,
we design a scheme where the SOM operates over the latent space learned by a
VAE, whereas, for lower-dimensional inputs, such as those found in MNIST and
FashionMNIST, the SOM operates in a standalone fashion. Our method stores a
running mean, variance, and covariance for each SOM unit, from which synthetic
samples are then generated during future learning iterations. For the VAE-based
method, generated samples are then fed through the decoder to then be used in
subsequent replay. Experimental results on standard class-incremental
benchmarks show that our approach performs competitively with state-of-the-art
memory-based methods and outperforms memory-free methods, notably improving
over best state-of-the-art single class incremental performance on CIFAR-10 and
CIFAR-100 by nearly $10$\% and $7$\%, respectively. Our methodology further
facilitates easy visualization of the learning process and can also be utilized
as a generative model post-training. Results show our method's capability as a
scalable, task-label-free, and memory-efficient solution for continual
learning.

### [145] [A Mixture of Experts Gating Network for Enhanced Surrogate Modeling in External Aerodynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21249)
*Mohammad Amin Nabian,Sanjay Choudhry*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a Mixture of Experts (MoE) model to combine predictions from three advanced neural networks for improved aerodynamic simulation accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High computational costs in automotive aerodynamic simulations hinder efficient design and optimization processes.

Method: The MoE framework integrates three models—DoMINO, X-MeshGraphNet, and FigConvNet—using a gating network with entropy regularization to balance contributions.

Result: The proposed MoE model significantly reduces prediction errors, outperforming individual and ensemble average models in aerodynamic fields.

Conclusion: The MoE approach enhances surrogate model performance by synergistically leveraging diverse neural network architectures, establishing its utility in high-fidelity CFD simulations in automotive domains.

Abstract: The computational cost associated with high-fidelity CFD simulations remains
a significant bottleneck in the automotive design and optimization cycle. While
ML-based surrogate models have emerged as a promising alternative to accelerate
aerodynamic predictions, the field is characterized by a diverse and rapidly
evolving landscape of specialized neural network architectures, with no single
model demonstrating universal superiority. This paper introduces a novel
meta-learning framework that leverages this architectural diversity as a
strength. We propose a Mixture of Experts (MoE) model that employs a dedicated
gating network to dynamically and optimally combine the predictions from three
heterogeneous, state-of-the-art surrogate models: DoMINO, a decomposable
multi-scale neural operator; X-MeshGraphNet, a scalable multi-scale graph
neural network; and FigConvNet, a factorized implicit global convolution
network. The gating network learns a spatially-variant weighting strategy,
assigning credibility to each expert based on its localized performance in
predicting surface pressure and wall shear stress fields. To prevent model
collapse and encourage balanced expert contributions, we integrate an entropy
regularization term into the training loss function. The entire system is
trained and validated on the DrivAerML dataset, a large-scale, public benchmark
of high-fidelity CFD simulations for automotive aerodynamics. Quantitative
results demonstrate that the MoE model achieves a significant reduction in L-2
prediction error, outperforming not only the ensemble average but also the most
accurate individual expert model across all evaluated physical quantities. This
work establishes the MoE framework as a powerful and effective strategy for
creating more robust and accurate composite surrogate models by synergistically
combining the complementary strengths of specialized architectures.

*Farnoush Rezaei Jafari,Oliver Eberle,Ashkan Khakzar,Neel Nanda*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Relevance Patching (RelP), which improves the computational efficiency and accuracy of identifying model components responsible for specific behaviors, outperforming previous methods like attribution patching.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the computational inefficiency and noise-related issues in activation and attribution patching methods for identifying behavioral components in deep neural networks.

Method: Replace local gradients in attribution patching with propagation coefficients from Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP), ensuring properties like relevance conservation and improved signal-to-noise ratio.

Result: RelP achieves higher correlation with ground-truth activation patching, demonstrated by a Pearson correlation of 0.956 for MLP outputs in GPT-2 Large, compared to attribution patching's 0.006. It also achieves comparable faithfulness to Integrated Gradients at lower computational cost.

Conclusion: Relevance Patching (RelP) provides a more computationally efficient and faithful method for mechanistic interpretability tasks, offering significant advancements over attribution patching and comparable performance to more expensive methods like Integrated Gradients.

Abstract: Activation patching is a standard method in mechanistic interpretability for
localizing the components of a model responsible for specific behaviors, but it
is computationally expensive to apply at scale. Attribution patching offers a
faster, gradient-based approximation, yet suffers from noise and reduced
reliability in deep, highly non-linear networks. In this work, we introduce
Relevance Patching (RelP), which replaces the local gradients in attribution
patching with propagation coefficients derived from Layer-wise Relevance
Propagation (LRP). LRP propagates the network's output backward through the
layers, redistributing relevance to lower-level components according to local
propagation rules that ensure properties such as relevance conservation or
improved signal-to-noise ratio. Like attribution patching, RelP requires only
two forward passes and one backward pass, maintaining computational efficiency
while improving faithfulness. We validate RelP across a range of models and
tasks, showing that it more accurately approximates activation patching than
standard attribution patching, particularly when analyzing residual stream and
MLP outputs in the Indirect Object Identification (IOI) task. For instance, for
MLP outputs in GPT-2 Large, attribution patching achieves a Pearson correlation
of 0.006, whereas RelP reaches 0.956, highlighting the improvement offered by
RelP. Additionally, we compare the faithfulness of sparse feature circuits
identified by RelP and Integrated Gradients (IG), showing that RelP achieves
comparable faithfulness without the extra computational cost associated with
IG.

*Hossein KhademSohi,Hadi Hemmati,Jiayu Zhou,Steve Drew*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FedOwen approximates Shapley values efficiently for federated learning, improving global model convergence and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of estimating client contributions in federated learning efficiently and accurately, aiding in faster convergence of the global model.

Method: FedOwen combines Owen sampling for Shapley value approximation and an adaptive client selection strategy.

Result: Achieved 23% higher final accuracy compared to baselines on non-IID benchmarks under a fixed evaluation cost.

Conclusion: FedOwen provides a cost-effective, robust solution for estimating client contributions, enhancing federated learning outcomes in large-scale settings.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) aggregates information from multiple clients to train
a shared global model without exposing raw data. Accurately estimating each
client's contribution is essential not just for fair rewards, but for selecting
the most useful clients so the global model converges faster. The Shapley value
is a principled choice, yet exact computation scales exponentially with the
number of clients, making it infeasible for large federations. We propose
FedOwen, an efficient framework that uses Owen sampling to approximate Shapley
values under the same total evaluation budget as existing methods while keeping
the approximation error small. In addition, FedOwen uses an adaptive client
selection strategy that balances exploiting high-value clients with exploring
under-sampled ones, reducing bias and uncovering rare but informative data.
Under a fixed valuation cost, FedOwen achieves up to 23 percent higher final
accuracy within the same number of communication rounds compared to
state-of-the-art baselines on non-IID benchmarks.

*Roland Arnold*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Guess-and-Learn (G&L) evaluates machine learning models on cold-start adaptability, focusing on cumulative mistakes during early learning instead of endpoint accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current machine learning evaluations focus on accuracy, ignoring adaptability and early-phase learning performance.

Method: G&L follows a sequential protocol where models select, predict, and learn from an unlabeled dataset under either online or batch modes. It defines four evaluation tracks to analyze initialization and update frequency effects.

Result: Experiments show systematic adaptability differences across model types, with smaller models making fewer mistakes initially and pretrained benefits varying by domain. Current models fall short of the theoretical oracle band.

Conclusion: G&L provides a useful framework to analyze early learning efficiency, addressing gaps unseen in accuracy-focused benchmarks and encouraging adaptability improvement.

Abstract: Evaluation of machine learning models typically emphasizes final accuracy,
overlooking the cost of adaptation: the cumulative errors incurred while
learning from scratch. Guess-and- Learn (G&L) v1.0 addresses this gap by
measuring cold-start adaptability - the total mistakes a model makes while
sequentially labeling an unlabeled dataset. At each step, the learner selects
an instance, predicts its label, receives the ground truth, and updates
parameters under either online (per-sample) or batch (delayed) mode. The
resulting error trajectory exposes adaptation speed, selection quality, and
bias - dynamics invisible to endpoint metrics.
  G&L defines four tracks (Scratch/Pretrained $\times$ Online/Batch) to
disentangle the effects of initialization and update frequency. We formalize
the protocol, relate it to classical mistake-bound theory, and estimate a
heuristic "oracle reference band" for MNIST as a plausibility reference.
Baseline experiments on MNIST and AG News, spanning classical methods
(Perceptron, k-NN), convolutional architectures (CNN, ResNet-50), and
pretrained transformers (ViT-B/16, BERT-base), reveal systematic differences in
early-phase efficiency: smaller models can adapt with fewer initial errors,
while pretraining benefits vary by domain. Across settings, current models
remain well above the oracle band, highlighting an adaptability gap.
  By quantifying the mistake cost of early learning, G&L complements
conventional benchmarks and provides a reproducible framework for developing
learners that are not only accurate in the limit but also reliable from the
first examples.

### [149] [CALM: A Framework for Continuous, Adaptive, and LLM-Mediated Anomaly Detection in Time-Series Streams](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21273)
*Ashok Devireddy,Shunping Huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CALM is an adaptive framework using LLMs for real-time anomaly detection in non-stationary time-series, showing improved ROC AUC performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of anomaly detection in non-stationary time-series streams where concept drift causes traditional offline models to fail.

Method: The CALM framework employs Apache Beam for distributed processing, TimesFm for forecasting, continuous closed-loop fine-tuning for adapting to drifting data, and LLMs to differentiate noise from meaningful anomalies.

Result: The evaluation on the TSB-UAD benchmark demonstrated that CALM consistently outperformed static pre-trained models, particularly by enhancing ROC AUC scores.

Conclusion: By integrating continuous adaptability and LLMs for semantic judgment, CALM offers an innovative, high-performance solution for real-time anomaly detection in dynamic streaming data.

Abstract: The detection of anomalies in non-stationary time-series streams is a
critical but challenging task across numerous industrial and scientific
domains. Traditional models, trained offline, suffer significant performance
degradation when faced with concept drift, where the underlying statistical
properties of the data change over time. This paper introduces CALM
(Continuous, Adaptive, and LLM-Mediated), a novel, end-to-end framework for
real-time anomaly detection designed to address this challenge. CALM is built
on the Apache Beam distributed processing framework and leverages the TimesFm
foundation model for forecasting-based anomaly detection. The framework's
novelty lies in two core contributions. First, it implements a closed-loop,
continuous fine-tuning mechanism that allows the anomaly detection model to
adapt to evolving data patterns in near real-time. Second, it introduces an
LLM-as-a-Judge component, a Large Language Model that provides semantic,
context-aware judgments on detected anomalies to curate a high-quality training
dataset, deciding whether an anomaly represents transient noise or a meaningful
pattern shift. We evaluate CALM on the comprehensive TSB-UAD benchmark. Our
results demonstrate that the continuously fine-tuned model improves the ROC AUC
score in most datasets compared to the static, pre-trained base model,
validating the efficacy of our adaptive, LLM-guided approach to maintaining
high-performance anomaly detection in dynamic streaming environments.

TL;DR: This paper investigates detecting domain shifts in myoelectric signals using data stream learning techniques to enhance EMG signal processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Domain shifts due to non-stationarity in EMG signals pose challenges in achieving robust decoding, which is crucial for practical EMG applications.

Method: The study uses the DB6 dataset, employs KPCA with a cosine kernel for preprocessing, and evaluates drift detection methods such as CUSUM, Page-Hinckley, and ADWIN.

Result: The research identifies limitations in existing drift detection methods and the emerging advantages of streaming-based approaches for domain shift detection in EMG.

Conclusion: Streaming-based approaches hold promise for stable EMG decoding models, but there is a need for further work to improve their robustness and accuracy in real-world conditions.

Abstract: Detecting domain shifts in myoelectric activations poses a significant
challenge due to the inherent non-stationarity of electromyography (EMG)
signals. This paper explores the detection of domain shifts using data stream
(DS) learning techniques, focusing on the DB6 dataset from the Ninapro
database. We define domains as distinct time-series segments based on different
subjects and recording sessions, applying Kernel Principal Component Analysis
(KPCA) with a cosine kernel to pre-process and highlight these shifts. By
evaluating multiple drift detection methods such as CUSUM, Page-Hinckley, and
ADWIN, we reveal the limitations of current techniques in achieving high
performance for real-time domain shift detection in EMG signals. Our results
underscore the potential of streaming-based approaches for maintaining stable
EMG decoding models, while highlighting areas for further research to enhance
robustness and accuracy in real-world scenarios.

*Shihao Ji,Zihui Song*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces MyGO, a novel lifelong learning framework designed to prevent catastrophic forgetting without relying on raw data storage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address issues of data privacy, storage limitations, and performance degradation in lifelong learning when tasks are dissimilar.

Method: MyGO uses a biologically inspired wake-sleep cycle, consisting of rapid task learning (wake phase) and offline knowledge consolidation using pseudo-data generated by compact generative models (sleep phase).

Result: Across benchmarks like Split-MNIST and Split-AG News, MyGO mitigates catastrophic forgetting and achieves high average accuracy over tasks.

Conclusion: MyGO proves to be effective and domain-general, offering privacy and storage benefits for continual learning.

Abstract: Continual or Lifelong Learning aims to develop models capable of acquiring
new knowledge from a sequence of tasks without catastrophically forgetting what
has been learned before. Existing approaches often rely on storing samples from
previous tasks (experience replay) or employing complex regularization terms to
protect learned weights. However, these methods face challenges related to data
privacy, storage limitations, and performance degradation when tasks are
dissimilar. To address these challenges, we introduce MyGO (Memory Yielding
Generative Offline-consolidation), a novel lifelong learning framework inspired
by the biological wake-sleep cycle. During the "wake" phase, the system rapidly
learns a new task and trains a compact generative model (Generative Memory,
G-mem) to capture its data distribution. During the "sleep" phase, the system
enters an offline state, using all learned G-mem models to generate pseudo-data
("dreams") and consolidate new and old knowledge into a core feature extractor
via knowledge distillation. This approach obviates the need to store any raw
data, retaining only compact generative models, which offers significant
advantages in privacy and storage efficiency. We evaluate MyGO on computer
vision (Split-MNIST) and natural language processing (Split-AG News)
benchmarks, comparing it against a sequential fine-tuning baseline. The results
demonstrate that MyGO significantly mitigates catastrophic forgetting and
maintains high average accuracy across tasks, proving the framework's
effectiveness and domain-generality.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces "VILA," a computationally efficient framework for machine unlearning in LLMs, addressing issues in the existing "FILA" method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address unintentional generation of sensitive information by LLMs and reduce high computational costs associated with retraining or existing unlearning methods.

Method: Proposes VILA, which enhances parameter identification by addressing Fisher information assumptions and avoids accessing the entire model during unlearning.

Result: VILA achieves up to 100x higher parameter efficiency, 40x faster training speeds compared to FILA, and achieves state-of-the-art results on benchmarks like TOFU, WMDP, and MUSE.

Conclusion: VILA proves to be a fast, efficient, and accurate framework for machine unlearning, surpassing FILA and offering practical scalability for sensitive-data removal in LLMs.

Abstract: LLMs have demonstrated remarkable performance across various tasks but face
challenges related to unintentionally generating outputs containing sensitive
information. A straightforward approach to address this issue is to retrain the
model after excluding the problematic data. However, this approach incurs
prohibitively high computational costs. To overcome this limitation, machine
unlearning has emerged as a promising solution that can effectively remove
sensitive information without the need to retrain the model from scratch.
Recently, FILA has been proposed as a parameter-efficient unlearning method by
integrating LoRA adapters. Specifically, it calculates the Fisher information
to identify parameters associated with the forget set and assigns them to LoRA
adapters for updates. Despite its innovative approach, FILA still requires
access to all model parameters and does not adequately account for fundamental
assumptions underlying Fisher information, leading to inaccuracies in
importance estimation. To address these limitations, we propose VILA, a novel
unlearning framework that explicitly considers the assumptions overlooked in
FILA, thereby enhancing the accuracy of parameter identification for the forget
set. Moreover, VILA significantly reduces computational costs by enabling
parameter identification without accessing the entire model. Our method
achieves up to 100x higher parameter efficiency and 40x faster training speed
compared to FILA, and sets new state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks
including TOFU, WMDP, and MUSE. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Regularized Agent-State-Based Q-learning (RASQL) and analyzes its convergence behavior in reinforcement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the convergence challenges of common Q-learning algorithms used in practice.

Method: Analyzes RASQL by considering regularized MDPs influenced by behavioral policy and investigates its convergence under mild technical conditions.

Result: RASQL converges to the fixed point of a regularized MDP, and numerical examples validate the theoretical findings.

Conclusion: RASQL is effective in aligning empirical convergence with theoretical limits, making it a promising approach for practical reinforcement learning scenarios.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a framework to understand the convergence of
commonly used Q-learning reinforcement learning algorithms in practice. Two
salient features of such algorithms are: (i)~the Q-table is recursively updated
using an agent state (such as the state of a recurrent neural network) which is
not a belief state or an information state and (ii)~policy regularization is
often used to encourage exploration and stabilize the learning algorithm. We
investigate the simplest form of such Q-learning algorithms which we call
regularized agent-state-based Q-learning (RASQL) and show that it converges
under mild technical conditions to the fixed point of an appropriately defined
regularized MDP, which depends on the stationary distribution induced by the
behavioral policy. We also show that a similar analysis continues to work for a
variant of RASQL that learns periodic policies. We present numerical examples
to illustrate that the empirical convergence behavior matches with the proposed
theoretical limit.

### [154] [Distribution-Aware Feature Selection for SAEs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21324)
*Narmeen Oozeer,Nirmalendu Prakash,Michael Lan,Alice Rigg,Amirali Abdullah*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Sampled-SAE, a tunable method for sparse autoencoders, to enhance token reconstruction by balancing global structure and token-specific information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing TopK SAE methods are inefficient as they treat all tokens equally, ignoring their varying levels of informativeness. BatchTopK improves efficiency but has limitations like activation lottery.

Method: The authors propose Sampled-SAE, which scores neural activation features via $L_2$ norm or entropy, creates a candidate pool of features, and applies TopK selection from this pool. A parameter $l$ adjusts the balance between global consistency and token-specific reconstruction.

Result: Sampled-SAE allows adjustment of the $l$ parameter to balance different trade-offs in reconstruction and performance, showing that no single $l$ value universally optimizes these metrics.

Conclusion: Sampled-SAE offers a distribution-aware and tunable approach to improve sparse autoencoders, enabling flexible reconstruction fidelity and shared structure across batches.

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) decompose neural activations into interpretable
features. A widely adopted variant, the TopK SAE, reconstructs each token from
its K most active latents. However, this approach is inefficient, as some
tokens carry more information than others. BatchTopK addresses this limitation
by selecting top activations across a batch of tokens. This improves average
reconstruction but risks an "activation lottery," where rare high-magnitude
features crowd out more informative but lower-magnitude ones. To address this
issue, we introduce Sampled-SAE: we score the columns (representing features)
of the batch activation matrix (via $L_2$ norm or entropy), forming a candidate
pool of size $Kl$, and then apply Top-$K$ to select tokens across the batch
from the restricted pool of features. Varying $l$ traces a spectrum between
batch-level and token-specific selection. At $l=1$, tokens draw only from $K$
globally influential features, while larger $l$ expands the pool toward
standard BatchTopK and more token-specific features across the batch. Small $l$
thus enforces global consistency; large $l$ favors fine-grained reconstruction.
On Pythia-160M, no single value optimizes $l$ across all metrics: the best
choice depends on the trade-off between shared structure, reconstruction
fidelity, and downstream performance. Sampled-SAE thus reframes BatchTopK as a
tunable, distribution-aware family.

TL;DR: Stage-Diff is a generative model based on diffusion processes, designed to effectively generate long-term time series data by addressing crucial challenges such as long-range dependencies, data distribution shifts, and complex feature interrelationships.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to overcome the challenges of generating long-term time series data, which include preserving long-term dependencies, addressing gradual shifts in data distribution, and capturing complex intra-sequence and inter-sequence feature dependencies.

Method: Stage-Diff operates using staged generative modeling, including a sequence generation workflow that incorporates inter-stage information transfer and intra-stage progressive sequence decomposition. It combines channel-independent modeling and multi-channel fusion techniques to address time-series complexities.

Result: Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that the Stage-Diff model performs effectively in generating long-term time series, validating its proposed methods.

Conclusion: The model successfully addresses the challenges associated with long-term time series generation and achieves a balance between sequence dependencies and distribution drifts, providing a robust tool for this application.

Abstract: Generative models have been successfully used in the field of time series
generation. However, when dealing with long-term time series, which span over
extended periods and exhibit more complex long-term temporal patterns, the task
of generation becomes significantly more challenging. Long-term time series
exhibit long-range temporal dependencies, but their data distribution also
undergoes gradual changes over time. Finding a balance between these long-term
dependencies and the drift in data distribution is a key challenge. On the
other hand, long-term time series contain more complex interrelationships
between different feature sequences, making the task of effectively capturing
both intra-sequence and inter-sequence dependencies another important
challenge. To address these issues, we propose Stage-Diff, a staged generative
model for long-term time series based on diffusion models. First, through
stage-wise sequence generation and inter-stage information transfer, the model
preserves long-term sequence dependencies while enabling the modeling of data
distribution shifts. Second, within each stage, progressive sequence
decomposition is applied to perform channel-independent modeling at different
time scales, while inter-stage information transfer utilizes multi-channel
fusion modeling. This approach combines the robustness of channel-independent
modeling with the information fusion advantages of multi-channel modeling,
effectively balancing the intra-sequence and inter-sequence dependencies of
long-term time series. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets
validate the effectiveness of Stage-Diff in long-term time series generation
tasks.

### [156] [DLGAN : Time Series Synthesis Based on Dual-Layer Generative Adversarial Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21340)
*Xuan Hou,Shuhan Liu,Zhaohui Peng,Yaohui Chu,Yue Zhang,Yining Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes Dual-Layer Generative Adversarial Networks (DLGAN) for generating synthetic time series data, focusing on preserving temporal dependencies and original feature accuracy, outperforming existing models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing time series synthesis methods struggle to effectively capture and retain temporal dependencies when using random sequences, making it hard to model accurate feature information from original time series.

Method: The method involves a two-stage process: (1) using sequence feature extraction and sequence reconstruction to form a time series autoencoder that enables supervised learning, and (2) employing a GAN to generate synthetic feature vectors that align with real-time series feature vectors to ensure temporal feature preservation.

Result: Experiments on four publicly available datasets show that DLGAN outperforms existing methods across multiple evaluation metrics, demonstrating its effectiveness.

Conclusion: DLGAN successfully resolves the challenges of temporal dependency preservation and accurate feature modeling in time series synthesis, providing a superior alternative to existing methods.

Abstract: Time series synthesis is an effective approach to ensuring the secure
circulation of time series data. Existing time series synthesis methods
typically perform temporal modeling based on random sequences to generate
target sequences, which often struggle to ensure the temporal dependencies in
the generated time series. Additionally, directly modeling temporal features on
random sequences makes it challenging to accurately capture the feature
information of the original time series. To address the above issues, we
propose a simple but effective generative model \textbf{D}ual-\textbf{L}ayer
\textbf{G}enerative \textbf{A}dversarial \textbf{N}etworks, named
\textbf{DLGAN}. The model decomposes the time series generation process into
two stages: sequence feature extraction and sequence reconstruction. First,
these two stages form a complete time series autoencoder, enabling supervised
learning on the original time series to ensure that the reconstruction process
can restore the temporal dependencies of the sequence. Second, a Generative
Adversarial Network (GAN) is used to generate synthetic feature vectors that
align with the real-time sequence feature vectors, ensuring that the generator
can capture the temporal features from real time series. Extensive experiments
on four public datasets demonstrate the superiority of this model across
various evaluation metrics.

*Bodu Gong,Gustavo Enrique Batista,Pierre Lafaye de Micheaux*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Adaptive Heavy Tailed Stochastic Gradient Descent (AHTSGD), a novel optimizer that adapts noise distribution during training to accelerate convergence and improve generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern optimization algorithms often struggle with generalization due to an overreliance on training loss and sensitivity around sharp minima. This paper is motivated by two key observations: the heavy-tailed nature of gradient noise and the "Edge of Stability" during neural network training.

Method: AHTSGD dynamically adapts the noise injected into the optimizer, starting with heavier-tailed noise for exploration in early training and transitioning to lighter-tailed noise as the loss landscape sharpness stabilizes.

Result: The proposed AHTSGD algorithm outperforms standard SGD and other noise-based methods on datasets like MNIST, CIFAR-10, and SVHN, delivering improved generalization, robustness to learning rates, and faster convergence from poor initializations.

Conclusion: AHTSGD demonstrates that dynamically adapting noise distributions based on training dynamics leads to better stability and generalization, making it a robust choice across diverse scenarios.

Abstract: In the era of large-scale neural network models, optimization algorithms
often struggle with generalization due to an overreliance on training loss. One
key insight widely accepted in the machine learning community is the idea that
wide basins (regions around a local minimum where the loss increases gradually)
promote better generalization by offering greater stability to small changes in
input data or model parameters. In contrast, sharp minima are typically more
sensitive and less stable. Motivated by two key empirical observations - the
inherent heavy-tailed distribution of gradient noise in stochastic gradient
descent and the Edge of Stability phenomenon during neural network training, in
which curvature grows before settling at a plateau, we introduce Adaptive Heavy
Tailed Stochastic Gradient Descent (AHTSGD). The algorithm injects
heavier-tailed noise into the optimizer during the early stages of training to
enhance exploration and gradually transitions to lighter-tailed noise as
sharpness stabilizes. By dynamically adapting to the sharpness of the loss
landscape throughout training, AHTSGD promotes accelerated convergence to wide
basins. AHTSGD is the first algorithm to adjust the nature of injected noise
into an optimizer based on the Edge of Stability phenomenon. AHTSGD
consistently outperforms SGD and other noise-based methods on benchmarks like
MNIST and CIFAR-10, with marked gains on noisy datasets such as SVHN. It
ultimately accelerates early training from poor initializations and improves
generalization across clean and noisy settings, remaining robust to learning
rate choices.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Investigates the representation-building processes of neural networks using Leela Chess Zero, revealing both gradual trends in playing strength and non-smooth behaviors in policy distributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand whether neural networks develop their representations through gradual refinement or via complex, non-smooth computations.

Method: Extended the logit lens analysis to the policy network of Leela Chess Zero, examining trends in playing strength and policy distributions across different layers.

Result: Found strong monotonic trends in chess strength, as well as non-smooth trajectories in policy, including discarded puzzle solutions and high policy divergence until late layers.

Conclusion: Neural network representation-building may not always follow smooth, gradual computational trajectories, as seen in contrast to language models.

Abstract: Do neural networks build their representations through smooth, gradual
refinement, or via more complex computational processes? We investigate this by
extending the logit lens to analyze the policy network of Leela Chess Zero, a
superhuman chess engine. We find strong monotonic trends in playing strength
and puzzle-solving ability across layers, yet policy distributions frequently
follow non-smooth trajectories. Evidence for this includes correct puzzle
solutions that are discovered early but subsequently discarded, move rankings
that remain poorly correlated with final outputs, and high policy divergence
until late in the network. These findings contrast with the smooth
distributional convergence typically observed in language models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PMODE is a modular framework enabling mixture modeling with parametric and nonparametric components, achieving high-performance rates and competitive anomaly detection results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to create a modular and flexible mixture modeling approach that works across varied distribution families while scaling effectively for high-dimensional scenarios.

Method: PMODE partitions data into subsets, fits density estimators on each partition, and enables compatibility between diverse parametric and nonparametric components. MV-PMODE extends these capabilities to high-dimensional density estimation.

Result: PMODE demonstrates near-optimal estimation rates and strong performance in CIFAR-10 anomaly detection, performing competitively against deep learning-based methods.

Conclusion: PMODE's framework is robust, scalable, and efficient for mixture modeling, offering an effective mix of simplicity and performance in challenging high-dimensional settings.

Abstract: We introduce PMODE (Partitioned Mixture Of Density Estimators), a general and
modular framework for mixture modeling with both parametric and nonparametric
components. PMODE builds mixtures by partitioning the data and fitting separate
estimators to each subset. It attains near-optimal rates for this estimator
class and remains valid even when the mixture components come from different
distribution families. As an application, we develop MV-PMODE, which scales a
previously theoretical approach to high-dimensional density estimation to
settings with thousands of dimensions. Despite its simplicity, it performs
competitively against deep baselines on CIFAR-10 anomaly detection.

### [160] [Benchmarking the State of Networks with a Low-Cost Method Based on Reservoir Computing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21420)
*Felix Simon Reimers,Carl-Hendrik Peters,Stefano Nichele*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper demonstrates a low-cost method using reservoir computing to monitor mobile and transportation networks by analyzing performance on neuroscience-inspired proxy tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to find an inexpensive, non-invasive method to monitor the health and effectiveness of mobile and transportation networks using readily available data.

Method: The approach involves processing anonymous, aggregated mobile network utilization data with a reservoir computing framework, turning it into an echo state network (ESN), and evaluating performance on neuroscience-inspired tasks.

Result: The study shows that changes in ESN performance correlate with perturbations in network configurations, validating the monitoring method.

Conclusion: The proposed method is effective for network state assessment and offers potential for real-time monitoring and identifying weak points in communication and transportation networks.

Abstract: Using data from mobile network utilization in Norway, we showcase the
possibility of monitoring the state of communication and mobility networks with
a non-invasive, low-cost method. This method transforms the network data into a
model within the framework of reservoir computing and then measures the model's
performance on proxy tasks. Experimentally, we show how the performance on
these proxies relates to the state of the network. A key advantage of this
approach is that it uses readily available data sets and leverages the
reservoir computing framework for an inexpensive and largely agnostic method.
Data from mobile network utilization is available in an anonymous, aggregated
form with multiple snapshots per day. This data can be treated like a weighted
network. Reservoir computing allows the use of weighted, but untrained networks
as a machine learning tool. The network, initialized as a so-called echo state
network (ESN), projects incoming signals into a higher dimensional space, on
which a single trained layer operates. This consumes less energy than deep
neural networks in which every weight of the network is trained. We use
neuroscience inspired tasks and trained our ESN model to solve them. We then
show how the performance depends on certain network configurations and also how
it visibly decreases when perturbing the network. While this work serves as
proof of concept, we believe it can be elevated to be used for near-real-time
monitoring as well as the identification of possible weak spots of both mobile
communication networks as well as transportation networks.

*Pietro Buzzega,Riccardo Salami,Angelo Porrello,Simone Calderara*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces "Chain of Merges" (CoM), a novel layer-wise merging method for fine-tuned models, addressing inter-layer dependencies and covariate shift to improve model integration without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing number of task-specific fine-tuned models highlights the need to merge them into unified models without extensive retraining, overcoming the limitations of existing approaches.

Method: The proposed CoM method updates activation statistics layer-by-layer in an auto-regressive manner, considering cross-layer dependencies to mitigate internal covariate shift.

Result: CoM demonstrates superior performance in merging fine-tuned models compared to alternative methods, as evidenced by experiments on standard benchmarks.

Conclusion: CoM effectively addresses internal covariate shift and improves model merging by introducing a systematic layer-wise approach, achieving state-of-the-art results.

Abstract: Fine-tuning pretrained models has become a standard pathway to achieve
state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of domains, leading to a
proliferation of task-specific model variants. As the number of such
specialized modules in-creases, merging them into a unified model without
retraining has become a critical challenge. Existing merging techniques often
rely on interference heuristics,importance weighting, or activation matching
while treating each layer independently, thereby failing to account for the
inter-layer dependencies inherent in deep networks. This simplification leads
to distributional mismatches, especially inactivation-based methods, when
changes in early layers are not properly reflected in downstream ones. We
identify these mismatches as a form of internal covariate shift, comparable to
the phenomenon encountered in the initial phases of neural networks training.
To address it, we propose Chain of Merges (CoM), a layer-wise merging procedure
that updates activation statistics in an auto-regressive fashion, explicitly
accounting for cross-layer interactions. CoM produces a coherent merged model
through a series of conditionally optimal updates, effectively mitigating
degradation caused by covariate shift. Experiments on standard bench-marks
demonstrate that CoM achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Development of a GAN ensemble-based anomaly detection framework for continuous biomanufacturing processes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for robust and early anomaly detection in continuous biomanufacturing processes due to their complexity and economic impact.

Method: An unsupervised anomaly detection framework utilizing a GAN ensemble, simulated benchmarks, and hybrid quantum/classical approaches.

Result: The framework effectively detected anomalies caused by feedstock variability, and hybrid quantum/classical GANs improved detection rates.

Conclusion: Hybrid quantum/classical GANs hold potential for enhancing anomaly detection in complex biomanufacturing processes and solving real-world challenges.

Abstract: The development of continuous biomanufacturing processes requires robust and
early anomaly detection, since even minor deviations can compromise yield and
stability, leading to disruptions in scheduling, reduced weekly production, and
diminished economic performance. These processes are inherently complex and
exhibit non-linear dynamics with intricate relationships between process
variables, thus making advanced methods for anomaly detection essential for
efficient operation. In this work, we present a novel framework for
unsupervised anomaly detection in continuous biomanufacturing based on an
ensemble of generative adversarial networks (GANs). We first establish a
benchmark dataset simulating both normal and anomalous operation regimes in a
continuous process for the production of a small molecule. We then demonstrate
the effectiveness of our GAN-based framework in detecting anomalies caused by
sudden feedstock variability. Finally, we evaluate the impact of using a hybrid
quantum/classical GAN approach with both a simulated quantum circuit and a real
photonic quantum processor on anomaly detection performance. We find that the
hybrid approach yields improved anomaly detection rates. Our work shows the
potential of hybrid quantum/classical approaches for solving real-world
problems in complex continuous biomanufacturing processes.

### [163] [Beyond expected value: geometric mean optimization for long-term policy performance in reinforcement learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21443)
*Xinyi Sheng,Dominik Baumann*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces an RL algorithm that optimizes both ensemble average and time-average growth rate to improve performance on individual trajectories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional RL optimization of expected cumulative rewards may not accurately capture performance in real-world individual trajectories.

Method: The method defines a Bellman operator for time-average growth rate, proposes the geometric mean alignment, and introduces an estimator using $N$-sliding window embedded as a regularizer in the RL objective.

Result: Evaluation shows the proposed algorithm outperforms standard RL methods in simulations.

Conclusion: The algorithm effectively combines ensemble and time-average optimization, improving RL performance especially for individual trajectory considerations.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms typically optimize the expected
cumulative reward, i.e., the expected value of the sum of scalar rewards an
agent receives over the course of a trajectory. The expected value averages the
performance over an infinite number of trajectories. However, when deploying
the agent in the real world, this ensemble average may be uninformative for the
performance of individual trajectories. Thus, in many applications, optimizing
the long-term performance of individual trajectories might be more desirable.
In this work, we propose a novel RL algorithm that combines the standard
ensemble average with the time-average growth rate, a measure for the long-term
performance of individual trajectories. We first define the Bellman operator
for the time-average growth rate. We then show that, under multiplicative
reward dynamics, the geometric mean aligns with the time-average growth rate.
To address more general and unknown reward dynamics, we propose a modified
geometric mean with $N$-sliding window that captures the path-dependency as an
estimator for the time-average growth rate. This estimator is embedded as a
regularizer into the objective, forming a practical algorithm and enabling the
policy to benefit from ensemble average and time-average simultaneously. We
evaluate our algorithm in challenging simulations, where it outperforms
conventional RL methods.

TL;DR: This paper introduces Riemannian manifold NML (Rm-NML), a geometric extension of Normalized Maximum Likelihood (NML) designed for Riemannian manifolds, with applications to hyperbolic spaces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of conventional NML in Euclidean spaces when applied to graph data with hierarchical structures in Riemannian manifolds.

Method: The paper defines a novel NML invariant under coordinate transformations, extends computational techniques to Riemannian settings, and simplifies computations on Riemannian symmetric spaces like hyperbolic spaces.

Result: Developed a computational framework for Rm-NML and successfully computed Rm-NML for normal distributions in hyperbolic spaces.

Conclusion: This work provides an invariant, computationally feasible NML model fitting method for graph data on Riemannian manifolds, enhancing applicability in burgeoning areas like hyperbolic spaces.

Abstract: In recent years, with the large-scale expansion of graph data, there has been
an increased focus on Riemannian manifold data spaces other than Euclidean
space. In particular, the development of hyperbolic spaces has been remarkable,
and they have high expressive power for graph data with hierarchical
structures. Normalized Maximum Likelihood (NML) is employed in regret
minimization and model selection. However, existing formulations of NML have
been developed primarily in Euclidean spaces and are inherently dependent on
the choice of coordinate systems, making it non-trivial to extend NML to
Riemannian manifolds. In this study, we define a new NML that reflects the
geometric structure of Riemannian manifolds, called the Riemannian manifold NML
(Rm-NML). This Rm-NML is invariant under coordinate transformations and
coincides with the conventional NML under the natural parameterization in
Euclidean space. We extend existing computational techniques for NML to the
setting of Riemannian manifolds. Furthermore, we derive a method to simplify
the computation of Rm-NML on Riemannian symmetric spaces, which encompass data
spaces of growing interest such as hyperbolic spaces. To illustrate the
practical application of our proposed method, we explicitly computed the Rm-NML
for normal distributions on hyperbolic spaces.

TL;DR: This paper introduces CByG, a generative framework for 3D molecular design, addressing limitations like synthetic feasibility and selectivity overlooked in existing models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the gap of neglecting synthetic feasibility and selectivity in existing generative models used for 3D molecular generation in drug discovery.

Method: The proposed CByG framework extends Bayesian Flow Network into a conditional generative model that incorporates property-specific guidance to address practical pharmacological requirements.

Result: The experiments demonstrate CByG’s superiority over baseline models in binding affinity, synthetic feasibility, and selectivity benchmarks.

Conclusion: CByG is more effective and practical for real-world drug discovery than traditional methods.

Abstract: Recent advances in Structure-based Drug Design (SBDD) have leveraged
generative models for 3D molecular generation, predominantly evaluating model
performance by binding affinity to target proteins. However, practical drug
discovery necessitates high binding affinity along with synthetic feasibility
and selectivity, critical properties that were largely neglected in previous
evaluations. To address this gap, we identify fundamental limitations of
conventional diffusion-based generative models in effectively guiding molecule
generation toward these diverse pharmacological properties. We propose CByG, a
novel framework extending Bayesian Flow Network into a gradient-based
conditional generative model that robustly integrates property-specific
guidance. Additionally, we introduce a comprehensive evaluation scheme
incorporating practical benchmarks for binding affinity, synthetic feasibility,
and selectivity, overcoming the limitations of conventional evaluation methods.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed CByG framework
significantly outperforms baseline models across multiple essential evaluation
criteria, highlighting its effectiveness and practicality for real-world drug
discovery applications.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper investigates a paradoxical 'cold posterior effect' in Bayesian deep Q-learning and challenges common assumptions regarding priors and likelihoods in Bayesian reinforcement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite the growing interest in uncertainty quantification in reinforcement learning via Bayesian methods, insufficient attention has been given to the validity of prior and likelihood assumptions, impacting model performance.

Method: The authors empirically evaluate and test the prior distributions and Gaussian likelihood assumptions typically made in Bayesian Q-learning, identifying violations and proposing practical solutions.

Result: The study reveals that common Gaussian likelihood assumptions are often invalid and that more suitable priors and likelihood formulations improve Bayesian reinforcement learning performance.

Conclusion: Future Bayesian reinforcement learning research should focus on developing better likelihoods and priors to enhance algorithmic performance, as demonstrated with practical adjustments offered in this paper.

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification in reinforcement learning can greatly improve
exploration and robustness. Approximate Bayesian approaches have recently been
popularized to quantify uncertainty in model-free algorithms. However, so far
the focus has been on improving the accuracy of the posterior approximation,
instead of studying the accuracy of the prior and likelihood assumptions
underlying the posterior. In this work, we demonstrate that there is a cold
posterior effect in Bayesian deep Q-learning, where contrary to theory,
performance increases when reducing the temperature of the posterior. To
identify and overcome likely causes, we challenge common assumptions made on
the likelihood and priors in Bayesian model-free algorithms. We empirically
study prior distributions and show through statistical tests that the common
Gaussian likelihood assumption is frequently violated. We argue that developing
more suitable likelihoods and priors should be a key focus in future Bayesian
reinforcement learning research and we offer simple, implementable solutions
for better priors in deep Q-learning that lead to more performant Bayesian
algorithms.

*Piotr Kubaty,Filip Szatkowski,Metod Jazbec,Bartosz Wójcik*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper critiques the reliance on calibration in early-exit models and introduces failure prediction as a better metric for enhancing efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early-exit models aim to speed up predictions by stopping computation once certain criteria, typically based on confidence, are met.

Method: The paper analyzes calibration and introduces failure prediction as an alternative metric, demonstrating its superiority in various scenarios.

Result: Empirical evidence shows that miscalibrated networks can outperform calibrated ones, and failure prediction correlates strongly with efficiency improvements.

Conclusion: Failure prediction outperforms calibration as a tool for improving and evaluating early-exit models, offering a more reliable proxy for efficiency gains.

Abstract: Early-exit models speed up inference by attaching internal classifiers to
intermediate layers of the model and allowing computation to stop once a
prediction satisfies an exit criterion. Most early-exit methods rely on
confidence-based exit strategies, which motivated some works to calibrate
intermediate classifiers to improve the performance of the entire model. In
this paper, we show that calibration measures can be misleading indicators of
the performance of multi-exit models: a well-calibrated classifier may still
waste computation, and common calibration methods do not preserve the sample
ranking within a classifier. We demonstrate empirical cases where miscalibrated
networks outperform calibrated ones. As an alternative, we propose to use
failure prediction as a more useful proxy for early-exit model performance.
Unlike calibration, failure prediction accounts for changes in the ranking of
samples and shows a strong correlation with efficiency improvements, making it
a more dependable basis for designing and evaluating early-exit models.

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Spiking Decision Transformer (SNN-DT), a model combining spiking neural networks with reinforcement learning for energy-efficient sequential decision-making tasks, achieving high performance with low energy use.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the energy inefficiency of Transformer-based reinforcement learning models and adapt them for edge-oriented, low-power platforms using spiking neural networks.

Method: The SNN-DT embeds Leaky Integrate-and-Fire neurons into self-attention blocks, uses surrogate gradient training, integrates biologically inspired mechanisms such as three-factor plasticity, spike-based positional encodings, and lightweight dendritic routing modules.

Result: SNN-DT matches or outperforms standard Decision Transformers on several control benchmarks while emitting very few spikes per decision, achieving a significant reduction in energy usage.

Conclusion: SNN-DT demonstrates the feasibility of combining sequence modeling with ultra-low-power spiking neural network techniques, offering potential for energy-efficient real-time control applications on embedded and wearable devices.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning agents based on Transformer architectures have
achieved impressive performance on sequential decision-making tasks, but their
reliance on dense matrix operations makes them ill-suited for
energy-constrained, edge-oriented platforms. Spiking neural networks promise
ultra-low-power, event-driven inference, yet no prior work has seamlessly
merged spiking dynamics with return-conditioned sequence modeling. We present
the Spiking Decision Transformer (SNN-DT), which embeds Leaky
Integrate-and-Fire neurons into each self-attention block, trains end-to-end
via surrogate gradients, and incorporates biologically inspired three-factor
plasticity, phase-shifted spike-based positional encodings, and a lightweight
dendritic routing module. Our implementation matches or exceeds standard
Decision Transformer performance on classic control benchmarks (CartPole-v1,
MountainCar-v0, Acrobot-v1, Pendulum-v1) while emitting fewer than ten spikes
per decision, an energy proxy suggesting over four orders-of-magnitude
reduction in per inference energy. By marrying sequence modeling with
neuromorphic efficiency, SNN-DT opens a pathway toward real-time, low-power
control on embedded and wearable devices.

TL;DR: The paper evaluates LLMs' ability to process tabular data for loan approvals across regions, highlighting how serialization formats impact both performance and fairness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study is motivated by the need to ensure fairness and reliable predictions from LLMs as they are used in high-stakes decision-making, particularly for processing tabular data in sensitive areas like loan approvals.

Method: The authors assessed the zero-shot and in-context learning (ICL) capabilities of LLMs on serialized loan approval datasets from Ghana, Germany, and the United States, using various serialization formats to evaluate their impact.

Result: Certain serialization formats like GReat and LIFT improved F1 scores but worsened fairness disparities. ICL enhanced performance by 4.9-59.6% from zero-shot baselines, but the impact on fairness varied by dataset.

Conclusion: The study emphasizes the need for effective tabular data representation methods and fairness-aware LLM models to ensure the reliability of these systems in critical financial applications.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly employed in high-stakes
decision-making tasks, such as loan approvals. While their applications expand
across domains, LLMs struggle to process tabular data, ensuring fairness and
delivering reliable predictions. In this work, we assess the performance and
fairness of LLMs on serialized loan approval datasets from three geographically
distinct regions: Ghana, Germany, and the United States. Our evaluation focuses
on the model's zero-shot and in-context learning (ICL) capabilities. Our
results reveal that the choice of serialization (Serialization refers to the
process of converting tabular data into text formats suitable for processing by
LLMs.) format significantly affects both performance and fairness in LLMs, with
certain formats such as GReat and LIFT yielding higher F1 scores but
exacerbating fairness disparities. Notably, while ICL improved model
performance by 4.9-59.6% relative to zero-shot baselines, its effect on
fairness varied considerably across datasets. Our work underscores the
importance of effective tabular data representation methods and fairness-aware
models to improve the reliability of LLMs in financial decision-making.

*Geri Skenderi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores the limitations of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for solving SAT problems, linking these to negative graph curvature.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current GNN-based SAT solvers perform poorly on complex SAT instances, and the paper aims to understand why this happens.

Method: It analyzes graph Ricci Curvature to study connectivity bottlenecks in graph representations of k-SAT formulas and relates this curvature to solver performance.

Result: The study finds that negatively curved graphs correlate with higher problem difficulty and solver performance degradation due to oversquashing.

Conclusion: Curvature serves as a key complexity indicator and potential predictor of GNN solver performance, offering insights for improving solver designs.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have recently shown promise as solvers for
Boolean Satisfiability Problems (SATs) by operating on graph representations of
logical formulas. However, their performance degrades sharply on harder
instances, raising the question of whether this reflects fundamental
architectural limitations. In this work, we provide a geometric explanation
through the lens of graph Ricci Curvature (RC), which quantifies local
connectivity bottlenecks. We prove that bipartite graphs derived from random
k-SAT formulas are inherently negatively curved, and that this curvature
decreases with instance difficulty. Building on this, we show that GNN-based
SAT solvers are affected by oversquashing, a phenomenon where long-range
dependencies become impossible to compress into fixed-length representations.
We validate our claims empirically across different SAT benchmarks and confirm
that curvature is both a strong indicator of problem complexity and can be used
to predict performance. Finally, we connect our findings to design principles
of existing solvers and outline promising directions for future work.

*Jens Leysen,Marco Favier,Bart Goethals*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores minimizing data usage in recommender systems while maintaining their performance, highlighting the technical and practical challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of adhering to the data minimization principle in legal frameworks for recommender systems dependent on extensive personal data.

Method: The study introduces a new problem formulation, analyzes minimization techniques, and investigates key technical and user factors influencing performance.

Result: It demonstrates that reducing inference data is feasible without notable performance loss, though influenced by technical settings and user-specific characteristics.

Conclusion: While technically plausible, practical implementation of data minimization in recommender systems is challenging due to context-dependent variations, making a universal standard hard to establish.

Abstract: Data minimization is a legal principle requiring personal data processing to
be limited to what is necessary for a specified purpose. Operationalizing this
principle for recommender systems, which rely on extensive personal data,
remains a significant challenge. This paper conducts a feasibility study on
minimizing implicit feedback inference data for such systems. We propose a
novel problem formulation, analyze various minimization techniques, and
investigate key factors influencing their effectiveness. We demonstrate that
substantial inference data reduction is technically feasible without
significant performance loss. However, its practicality is critically
determined by two factors: the technical setting (e.g., performance targets,
choice of model) and user characteristics (e.g., history size, preference
complexity). Thus, while we establish its technical feasibility, we conclude
that data minimization remains practically challenging and its dependence on
the technical and user context makes a universal standard for data `necessity'
difficult to implement.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a wearable textile garment with innovative electrode placement for better ECG signal quality and evaluates its performance considering sex-specific differences in real-world scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for improved wearable ECG monitoring systems that are capable of addressing signal noise, motion artifacts, and ensuring equity across sexes for accurate physiological and psychophysiological state detection.

Method: The study involved sex-balanced testing with 30 participants using quantitative signal quality indices, rhythm-based physiological analysis, machine learning classification, ECG morphological feature assessment, and analysis of electrode projection angles, all while stratifying results by sex.

Result: The textile system demonstrated strong signal quality, high classification performance, accurate sex-specific determinant identification, and equivalent efficacy to reference devices.

Conclusion: Textile-based ECG garments can reliably monitor physiological data and psychophysiological states, highlighting the importance of sex-specific designs for equitable diagnostics in wearable health technologies.

Abstract: We introduce a novel wearable textile-garment featuring an innovative
electrode placement aimed at minimizing noise and motion artifacts, thereby
enhancing signal fidelity in Electrocardiography (ECG) recordings. We present a
comprehensive, sex-balanced evaluation involving 15 healthy males and 15
healthy female participants to ensure the device's suitability across
anatomical and physiological variations. The assessment framework encompasses
distinct evaluation approaches: quantitative signal quality indices to
objectively benchmark device performance; rhythm-based analyzes of
physiological parameters such as heart rate and heart rate variability; machine
learning classification tasks to assess application-relevant predictive
utility; morphological analysis of ECG features including amplitude and
interval parameters; and investigations of the effects of electrode projection
angle given by the textile / body shape, with all analyzes stratified by sex to
elucidate sex-specific influences. Evaluations were conducted across various
activity phases representing real-world conditions. The results demonstrate
that the textile system achieves signal quality highly concordant with
reference devices in both rhythm and morphological analyses, exhibits robust
classification performance, and enables identification of key sex-specific
determinants affecting signal acquisition. These findings underscore the
practical viability of textile-based ECG garments for physiological monitoring
as well as psychophysiological state detection. Moreover, we identify the
importance of incorporating sex-specific design considerations to ensure
equitable and reliable cardiac diagnostics in wearable health technologies.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PINNs integrate physical laws into learning to address data scarcity and improve consistency in smart grid modeling. They outperform traditional methods in generalization, accuracy, and physical feasibility, proving essential for energy system applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for models that can reliably predict and simulate smart grid dynamics despite issues such as data scarcity and the lack of physical consistency in conventional data-driven methods.

Method: PINNs were trained using physics-based loss functions, including enforcing power balance, operational constraints, and grid stability. Their performance was compared to traditional models like XGBoost, Random Forest, and Linear Regression through experiments in interpolation, cross-validation, and episodic trajectory prediction.

Result: PINNs demonstrated superior generalization, lower MAE, and reliable capturing of state transitions, outperforming traditional models, particularly in dynamic grid operations. While slight performance degradation occurred in extreme regimes, physical feasibility was consistently maintained.

Conclusion: PINNs offer a paradigm shift in smart grid modeling, blending data-driven techniques with physical principles, ensuring reliability and scalability in mission-critical energy applications.

Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) present a transformative approach
for smart grid modeling by integrating physical laws directly into learning
frameworks, addressing critical challenges of data scarcity and physical
consistency in conventional data-driven methods. This paper evaluates PINNs'
capabilities as surrogate models for smart grid dynamics, comparing their
performance against XGBoost, Random Forest, and Linear Regression across three
key experiments: interpolation, cross-validation, and episodic trajectory
prediction. By training PINNs exclusively through physics-based loss functions
(enforcing power balance, operational constraints, and grid stability) we
demonstrate their superior generalization, outperforming data-driven models in
error reduction. Notably, PINNs maintain comparatively lower MAE in dynamic
grid operations, reliably capturing state transitions in both random and
expert-driven control scenarios, while traditional models exhibit erratic
performance. Despite slight degradation in extreme operational regimes, PINNs
consistently enforce physical feasibility, proving vital for safety-critical
applications. Our results contribute to establishing PINNs as a
paradigm-shifting tool for smart grid surrogation, bridging data-driven
flexibility with first-principles rigor. This work advances real-time grid
control and scalable digital twins, emphasizing the necessity of physics-aware
architectures in mission-critical energy systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from challenges LLMs face with variability in structured data for few-shot tabular classification. The authors aim to bridge this gap by enabling robust and efficient classification using distilled insights.

Method: The InsightTab framework employs divide-and-conquer, easy-first, and reflective learning principles, combining rule summarization, strategic exemplification, and insight reflection, facilitated through collaboration between LLMs and data modeling.

Result: InsightTab consistently outperformed state-of-the-art methods in evaluations across nine datasets. Ablation studies validated its principle-driven distillation process, and analyses showed effective use of labeled data and mitigation of biases.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully enhances the alignment of LLMs' general knowledge to specialized tabular tasks, demonstrating its capacity for improved performance and bias management in few-shot structured data scenarios.

Abstract: Recent studies show the promise of large language models (LLMs) for few-shot
tabular classification but highlight challenges due to the variability in
structured data. To address this, we propose distilling data into actionable
insights to enable robust and effective classification by LLMs. Drawing
inspiration from human learning processes, we introduce InsightTab, an insight
distillation framework guided by principles of divide-and-conquer, easy-first,
and reflective learning. Our approach integrates rule summarization, strategic
exemplification, and insight reflection through deep collaboration between LLMs
and data modeling techniques. The obtained insights enable LLMs to better align
their general knowledge and capabilities with the particular requirements of
specific tabular tasks. We extensively evaluate InsightTab on nine datasets.
The results demonstrate consistent improvement over state-of-the-art methods.
Ablation studies further validate the principle-guided distillation process,
while analyses emphasize InsightTab's effectiveness in leveraging labeled data
and managing bias.

TL;DR: Introduces the OASIS system, leveraging diffusion adversarial models to improve salinity measurement in oceans despite irregular, sparse, and noisy data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ocean salinity is crucial for circulation, climate, and ecosystems, but current measurement methods have limitations like sparsity, noise, and reliance on linear assumptions.

Method: The OASIS system employs a diffusion adversarial framework to overcome data challenges and integrate physical covariates effectively.

Result: Addresses challenges of current methods, showing potential to improve ocean salinity data measurement.

Conclusion: OASIS offers a promising solution to enhance salinity measurement by overcoming limitations of traditional methods and machine learning.

Abstract: Ocean salinity plays a vital role in circulation, climate, and marine
ecosystems, yet its measurement is often sparse, irregular, and noisy,
especially in drifter-based datasets. Traditional approaches, such as remote
sensing and optimal interpolation, rely on linearity and stationarity, and are
limited by cloud cover, sensor drift, and low satellite revisit rates. While
machine learning models offer flexibility, they often fail under severe
sparsity and lack principled ways to incorporate physical covariates without
specialized sensors. In this paper, we introduce the OceAn Salinity Imputation
System (OASIS), a novel diffusion adversarial framework designed to address
these challenges.

*Agustinus Kristiadi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces accessible theoretical analyses of key probabilistic decision-making algorithms used in scientific discovery, aiming to reduce experimentation costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Costly experiments in scientific discovery necessitate efficient decision-making methods to reduce costs and improve workflow through adaptive algorithms.

Method: The paper provides self-contained, introductory theoretical analyses of algorithms like bandit algorithms, Bayesian optimization, and tree search, assuming basic probability and Gaussian processes knowledge.

Result: By offering an accessible approach, the paper enables a broader audience to understand and employ probabilistic decision-making theories in scientific domains.

Conclusion: Simplifying theoretical analyses makes advanced decision-making tools usable even for non-experts, fostering innovation and efficient problem-solving in resource-intensive fields.

Abstract: Decision theories offer principled methods for making choices under various
types of uncertainty. Algorithms that implement these theories have been
successfully applied to a wide range of real-world problems, including
materials and drug discovery. Indeed, they are desirable since they can
adaptively gather information to make better decisions in the future, resulting
in data-efficient workflows. In scientific discovery, where experiments are
costly, these algorithms can thus significantly reduce the cost of
experimentation. Theoretical analyses of these algorithms are crucial for
understanding their behavior and providing valuable insights for developing
next-generation algorithms. However, theoretical analyses in the literature are
often inaccessible to non-experts. This monograph aims to provide an
accessible, self-contained introduction to the theoretical analysis of commonly
used probabilistic decision-making algorithms, including bandit algorithms,
Bayesian optimization, and tree search algorithms. Only basic knowledge of
probability theory and statistics, along with some elementary knowledge about
Gaussian processes, is assumed.

### [178] [Predicting Social Media Engagement from Emotional and Temporal Features](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21650)
*Yunwoo Kim,Junhyuk Hwang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study introduces a machine learning model to predict likes and comments on social media content using emotional and temporal data, achieving strong results for likes but moderate results for comments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve understanding and prediction of social media engagement through the analysis of emotional and temporal features.

Method: A dataset of 600 songs with emotional annotations (valence, arousal) is used to train a multi-target regression model (HistGradientBoostingRegressor) on log-transformed engagement metrics like likes and comments.

Result: The model achieves high accuracy for predicting likes (R^2 = 0.98), but moderate performance for comments (R^2 = 0.41), highlighting a discrepancy in predictive capabilities for the two engagement types.

Conclusion: While emotional and temporal data are effective for predicting likes, comments are influenced by additional factors not captured in the current dataset, signaling the need for more comprehensive features.

Abstract: We present a machine learning approach for predicting social media engagement
(comments and likes) from emotional and temporal features. The dataset contains
600 songs with annotations for valence, arousal, and related sentiment metrics.
A multi target regression model based on HistGradientBoostingRegressor is
trained on log transformed engagement ratios to address skewed targets.
Performance is evaluated with both a custom order of magnitude accuracy and
standard regression metrics, including the coefficient of determination (R^2).
Results show that emotional and temporal metadata, together with existing view
counts, predict future engagement effectively. The model attains R^2 = 0.98 for
likes but only R^2 = 0.41 for comments. This gap indicates that likes are
largely driven by readily captured affective and exposure signals, whereas
comments depend on additional factors not represented in the current feature
set.

### [179] [Activation Subspaces for Out-of-Distribution Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21695)
*Barış Zöngür,Robin Hesse,Stefan Roth*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces ActSub, a new out-of-distribution (OOD) detection method based on singular value decomposition of the classification head's weight matrix, which separates activations into decisive and insignificant components.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To ensure the reliability of deep models in real-world applications, the paper addresses the challenge of distinguishing between in-distribution (ID) and OOD samples under various distribution shifts.

Method: ActSub decomposes activations using singular value decomposition into decisive and insignificant components, exploiting these subspaces differently for Near-OOD (small shifts) and Far-OOD (large shifts) cases.

Result: The proposed ActSub method achieves state-of-the-art performance across several standard OOD detection benchmarks.

Conclusion: By leveraging subspaces of decisive and insignificant components differently depending on the distribution shift, ActSub improves upon existing OOD detection methods and enhances model reliability in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: To ensure the reliability of deep models in real-world applications,
out-of-distribution (OOD) detection methods aim to distinguish samples close to
the training distribution (in-distribution, ID) from those farther away (OOD).
In this work, we propose a novel OOD detection method that utilizes singular
value decomposition of the weight matrix of the classification head to
decompose the model's activations into decisive and insignificant components,
which contribute maximally, respectively minimally, to the final classifier
output. We find that the subspace of insignificant components more effectively
distinguishes ID from OOD data than raw activations in regimes of large
distribution shifts (Far-OOD). This occurs because the classification objective
leaves the insignificant subspace largely unaffected, yielding features that
are ''untainted'' by the target classification task. Conversely, in regimes of
smaller distribution shifts (Near-OOD), we find that activation shaping methods
profit from only considering the decisive subspace, as the insignificant
component can cause interference in the activation space. By combining two
findings into a single approach, termed ActSub, we achieve state-of-the-art
results in various standard OOD benchmarks.

### [180] [Inferring Effects of Major Events through Discontinuity Forecasting of Population Anxiety](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21722)
*Siddharth Mangalik,Ojas Deshpande,Adithya V. Ganesan,Sean A. P. Clouston,H. Andrew Schwartz*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes using a Longitudinal Regression Discontinuity Design (LRDD) in a statistical learning framework to estimate community-specific mental health impacts of local events, showing promising results in forecasting anxiety discontinuities in US counties during COVID-19.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to better estimate and understand the causal effects of time-specific events on community mental health, as current forecasting methods fall short in providing actionable insights for public health policy.

Method: The study adapts LRDDs into a statistical learning model capable of predicting discontinuities (time-specific shifts) and slope changes (linear trends) in mental health scores, incorporating a location's historical data, dynamic covariates, and exogenous variables.

Result: The approach demonstrated improvements in predicting anxiety discontinuities and slopes, achieving correlations of $r=+.46$ for discontinuities and $r = +.65$ for slopes, outperforming traditional methods that rely solely on static data.

Conclusion: The framework expands the capability of LRDDs, enabling the estimation of individualized mental health impacts of future or hypothetical events, which could assist in targeted public health initiatives.

Abstract: Estimating community-specific mental health effects of local events is vital
for public health policy. While forecasting mental health scores alone offers
limited insights into the impact of events on community well-being,
quasi-experimental designs like the Longitudinal Regression Discontinuity
Design (LRDD) from econometrics help researchers derive more effects that are
more likely to be causal from observational data. LRDDs aim to extrapolate the
size of changes in an outcome (e.g. a discontinuity in running scores for
anxiety) due to a time-specific event. Here, we propose adapting LRDDs beyond
traditional forecasting into a statistical learning framework whereby future
discontinuities (i.e. time-specific shifts) and changes in slope (i.e. linear
trajectories) are estimated given a location's history of the score, dynamic
covariates (other running assessments), and exogenous variables (static
representations). Applying our framework to predict discontinuities in the
anxiety of US counties from COVID-19 events, we found the task was difficult
but more achievable as the sophistication of models was increased, with the
best results coming from integrating exogenous and dynamic covariates. Our
approach shows strong improvement ($r=+.46$ for discontinuity and $r = +.65$
for slope) over traditional static community representations. Discontinuity
forecasting raises new possibilities for estimating the idiosyncratic effects
of potential future or hypothetical events on specific communities.

*V. Bugra Yesilkaynak,Emine Dari,Alican Mertan,Gozde Unal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: UniMLR is a novel multi-label ranking framework modeling relevance of positive labels as probability distributions, enhanced by introducing synthetic datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MLR frameworks fail to leverage ranking among positive labels and presume them equally important, limiting the exploitation of label significance.

Method: The paper proposes UniMLR, a framework that models relevance probabilities for positive labels based on their ranking, combined with the creation of synthetic datasets to address MLR dataset limitations.

Result: Experiments reveal UniMLR's success in modeling rank order proportional to label significance, validated both statistically and empirically across diverse datasets.

Conclusion: UniMLR unifies classification and ranking in MLR tasks, offering a more nuanced understanding of label significance, outperforming prior approaches.

Abstract: Existing multi-label ranking (MLR) frameworks only exploit information
deduced from the bipartition of labels into positive and negative sets.
Therefore, they do not benefit from ranking among positive labels, which is the
novel MLR approach we introduce in this paper. We propose UniMLR, a new MLR
paradigm that models implicit class relevance/significance values as
probability distributions using the ranking among positive labels, rather than
treating them as equally important. This approach unifies ranking and
classification tasks associated with MLR. Additionally, we address the
challenges of scarcity and annotation bias in MLR datasets by introducing eight
synthetic datasets (Ranked MNISTs) generated with varying
significance-determining factors, providing an enriched and controllable
experimental environment. We statistically demonstrate that our method
accurately learns a representation of the positive rank order, which is
consistent with the ground truth and proportional to the underlying
significance values. Finally, we conduct comprehensive empirical experiments on
both real-world and synthetic datasets, demonstrating the value of our proposed
framework.

*Peng Yang,Zhengdong Huang,Zicheng Xie,Wentao Tian,Jingyu Liu,Lunhong Dong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a framework to improve heart rate prediction under heterogeneous real-world data conditions using random feature dropout and time-aware attention, validated on new and existing datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Heart rate prediction models face challenges due to data heterogeneity stemming from diverse source devices and unique individual physiological differences.

Method: The framework uses random feature dropout for handling device heterogeneity, a time-aware attention module for capturing user-specific traits, and contrastive learning for representation discrimination.

Result: Evaluations on the new ParroTao dataset and the FitRec dataset demonstrate model improvements of 17% and 15% over existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed method is effective in addressing data heterogeneity challenges in heart rate prediction and shows practical applicability through strong benchmark results and learned representation analysis.

Abstract: Heart rate prediction is vital for personalized health monitoring and
fitness, while it frequently faces a critical challenge when deploying in
real-world: data heterogeneity. We classify it in two key dimensions: source
heterogeneity from fragmented device markets with varying feature sets, and
user heterogeneity reflecting distinct physiological patterns across
individuals and activities. Existing methods either discard device-specific
information, or fail to model user-specific differences, limiting their
real-world performance. To address this, we propose a framework that learns
latent representations agnostic to both heterogeneity, enabling downstream
predictors to work consistently under heterogeneous data patterns.
Specifically, we introduce a random feature dropout strategy to handle source
heterogeneity, making the model robust to various feature sets. To manage user
heterogeneity, we employ a time-aware attention module to capture long-term
physiological traits and use a contrastive learning objective to build a
discriminative representation space. To reflect the heterogeneous nature of
real-world data, we created and publicly released a new benchmark dataset,
ParroTao. Evaluations on both ParroTao and the public FitRec dataset show that
our model significantly outperforms existing baselines by 17% and 15%,
respectively. Furthermore, analysis of the learned representations demonstrates
their strong discriminative power, and one downstream application task confirm
the practical value of our model.

*Xiaoyang Wang,Christopher C. Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MoE-Health is a Mixture of Experts framework that enhances multimodal healthcare prediction by dynamically adapting to varied or incomplete data modalities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Healthcare data comes in diverse modalities, often incomplete or varied, making robust clinical prediction difficult with existing approaches that require complete data or manual intervention.

Method: MoE-Health uses specialized expert networks and a dynamic gating mechanism to adaptively combine relevant modalities, addressing variability in data availability.

Result: Experimental evaluation on the MIMIC-IV dataset shows MoE-Health outperforms existing methods in clinical prediction tasks, including in-hospital mortality and hospital readmission, while being robust to incomplete modalities.

Conclusion: MoE-Health is a robust and flexible framework for multimodal fusion in healthcare, offering superior predictive performance and adaptability to real-world data constraints.

Abstract: Healthcare systems generate diverse multimodal data, including Electronic
Health Records (EHR), clinical notes, and medical images. Effectively
leveraging this data for clinical prediction is challenging, particularly as
real-world samples often present with varied or incomplete modalities. Existing
approaches typically require complete modality data or rely on manual selection
strategies, limiting their applicability in real-world clinical settings where
data availability varies across patients and institutions. To address these
limitations, we propose MoE-Health, a novel Mixture of Experts framework
designed for robust multimodal fusion in healthcare prediction. MoE-Health
architecture is specifically developed to handle samples with differing
modalities and improve performance on critical clinical tasks. By leveraging
specialized expert networks and a dynamic gating mechanism, our approach
dynamically selects and combines relevant experts based on available data
modalities, enabling flexible adaptation to varying data availability
scenarios. We evaluate MoE-Health on the MIMIC-IV dataset across three critical
clinical prediction tasks: in-hospital mortality prediction, long length of
stay, and hospital readmission prediction. Experimental results demonstrate
that MoE-Health achieves superior performance compared to existing multimodal
fusion methods while maintaining robustness across different modality
availability patterns. The framework effectively integrates multimodal
information, offering improved predictive performance and robustness in
handling heterogeneous and incomplete healthcare data, making it particularly
suitable for deployment in diverse healthcare environments with heterogeneous
data availability.

*Jessica Liang,Anirudh Bharadwaj*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces QR-LoRA, a fine-tuning technique for large language models that drastically reduces the trainable parameter count while maintaining or exceeding performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing scale of LLMs necessitates parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods like LoRA, but standard approaches involve computationally expensive steps, such as SVD, and lack interpretability.

Method: QR-LoRA extracts an orthonormal basis from pretrained weight matrices using QR decomposition with column pivoting, then trains only scalar coefficients for the LoRA update, minimizing the parameter count.

Result: QR-LoRA achieves comparable or better performance than full fine-tuning, standard LoRA, and SVD-LoRA, with as few as 601 trainable parameters, offering significant efficiency gains.

Conclusion: QR-LoRA provides an efficient and structured alternative to standard fine-tuning methods, reducing computational cost while retaining model performance.

Abstract: The growing scale of Large Language Models (LLMs) has necessitated the
development of parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques. Low-Rank Adaptation
(LoRA) has emerged as a promising approach, reducing the number of trainable
parameters by applying low-rank updates to pretrained weights. While standard
LoRA learns both update factors directly, several recent variants first
initialize those matrices via an SVD of the pretrained weights -- an operation
that can be expensive on large models and yields singular vectors that are not
always easy to interpret. In this work, we extract an orthonormal basis from
the pretrained weight matrix using QR decomposition with column pivoting, and
then express the LoRA update as a linear combination of these basis vectors --
training only the scalar coefficients, which imposes clear structure on
adaptation and drastically reduces parameter count. Experiments across GLUE
tasks show that QR-LoRA matches or exceeds the performance of full fine-tuning,
standard LoRA, and SVD-LoRA (LoRA with update matrices initialized via singular
value decomposition) with as few as 601 parameters -- a reduction of over 1000x
compared to full fine-tuning and 77x fewer than typical LoRA setups.

*Tobias Hyrup,Emmanouil Panagiotou,Arjun Roy,Arthur Zimek,Eirini Ntoutsi,Peter Schneider-Kamp*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FLIP is a transformer-based model to generate privacy-preserving and fair tabular synthetic data utilizing differential privacy and fairness alignment techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address growing privacy and fairness constraints in sensitive domains like healthcare, particularly under demanding regulations like GDPR and frameworks like the AI Act.

Method: FLIP uses transformer-based variational autoencoders with latent diffusion, employs RDP for privacy, and combines balanced sampling with CKA for fairness in both input and latent spaces.

Result: FLIP demonstrates significant fairness improvements for task-agnostic fairness and diverse downstream tasks while maintaining strong privacy guarantees.

Conclusion: FLIP offers a promising solution for generating synthetic tabular data that meets robust privacy and fairness demands, ensuring broader applicability in responsible AI tasks.

Abstract: As privacy regulations such as the GDPR and HIPAA and responsibility
frameworks for artificial intelligence such as the AI Act gain traction, the
ethical and responsible use of real-world data faces increasing constraints.
Synthetic data generation has emerged as a promising solution to risk-aware
data sharing and model development, particularly for tabular datasets that are
foundational to sensitive domains such as healthcare. To address both privacy
and fairness concerns in this setting, we propose FLIP (Fair Latent
Intervention under Privacy guarantees), a transformer-based variational
autoencoder augmented with latent diffusion to generate heterogeneous tabular
data. Unlike the typical setup in fairness-aware data generation, we assume a
task-agnostic setup, not reliant on a fixed, defined downstream task, thus
offering broader applicability. To ensure privacy, FLIP employs R\'enyi
differential privacy (RDP) constraints during training and addresses fairness
in the input space with RDP-compatible balanced sampling that accounts for
group-specific noise levels across multiple sampling rates. In the latent
space, we promote fairness by aligning neuron activation patterns across
protected groups using Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA), a similarity measure
extending the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC). This alignment
encourages statistical independence between latent representations and the
protected feature. Empirical results demonstrate that FLIP effectively provides
significant fairness improvements for task-agnostic fairness and across diverse
downstream tasks under differential privacy constraints.

Motivation: The paper aims to address the exponential complexity in traditional language translators by proposing a unified system for bidirectional language translations across multiple programming paradigms.

Method: CrossTL uses a unified intermediate representation, language-specific lexers/parsers, bidirectional translation modules, and backend implementations for translating code effectively.

Result: The evaluation showcases successful compilation and execution across all supported backends, demonstrating the effectiveness of CrossTL.

Conclusion: CrossTL facilitates language-agnostic programming, achieving write-once, deploy-everywhere functionality and simplifying the addition of new languages to the system.

Abstract: We present CrossTL, a universal programming language translator enabling
bidirectional translation between multiple languages through a unified
intermediate representation called CrossGL. Traditional approaches require
separate translators for each language pair, leading to exponential complexity
growth. CrossTL uses a single universal IR to facilitate translations between
CUDA, HIP, Metal, DirectX HLSL, OpenGL GLSL, Vulkan SPIR-V, Rust, and Mojo,
with Slang support in development. Our system consists of: language-specific
lexers/parsers converting source code to ASTs, bidirectional CrossGL
translation modules implementing ToCrossGLConverter classes for importing code
and CodeGen classes for target generation, and comprehensive backend
implementations handling full translation pipelines. We demonstrate
effectiveness through comprehensive evaluation across programming domains,
achieving successful compilation and execution across all supported backends.
The universal IR design enables adding new languages with minimal effort,
requiring only language-specific frontend/backend components. Our contributions
include: (1) a unified IR capturing semantics of multiple programming
paradigms, (2) a modular architecture enabling extensibility, (3) a
comprehensive framework supporting GPU compute, graphics programming, and
systems languages, and (4) empirical validation demonstrating practical
viability of universal code translation. CrossTL represents a significant step
toward language-agnostic programming, enabling write-once, deploy-everywhere
development.

TL;DR: EO-Robotics introduces EO-1, a model for overcoming limitations in multimodal reasoning and robot control. Using the comprehensive EO-Data1.5M dataset, EO-1 demonstrates enhanced open-world understanding and dexterous manipulation across embodiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in human-level multimodal reasoning and interaction for embodied intelligent systems, particularly in vision-language-action tasks.

Method: The EO-1 model uses a unified architecture for processing multiple modalities (image, text, video, action) and is trained on EO-Data1.5M with techniques like auto-regressive decoding and flow matching denoising.

Result: EO-1 achieves superior performance in multimodal reasoning and robot control tasks, excelling in open-world settings and long-horizon manipulation tasks.

Conclusion: EO-Robotics showcases promising advancements in embodied foundation models by leveraging interleaved vision-text-action learning and rich multimodal datasets, paving the way for improved robot intelligence systems.

Abstract: The human ability to seamlessly perform multimodal reasoning and physical
interaction in the open world is a core goal for general-purpose embodied
intelligent systems. Recent vision-language-action (VLA) models, which are
co-trained on large-scale robot and visual-text data, have demonstrated notable
progress in general robot control. However, they still fail to achieve
human-level flexibility in interleaved reasoning and interaction. In this work,
introduce EO-Robotics, consists of EO-1 model and EO-Data1.5M dataset. EO-1 is
a unified embodied foundation model that achieves superior performance in
multimodal embodied reasoning and robot control through interleaved
vision-text-action pre-training. The development of EO-1 is based on two key
pillars: (i) a unified architecture that processes multimodal inputs
indiscriminately (image, text, video, and action), and (ii) a massive,
high-quality multimodal embodied reasoning dataset, EO-Data1.5M, which contains
over 1.5 million samples with emphasis on interleaved vision-text-action
comprehension. EO-1 is trained through synergies between auto-regressive
decoding and flow matching denoising on EO-Data1.5M, enabling seamless robot
action generation and multimodal embodied reasoning. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of interleaved vision-text-action learning for
open-world understanding and generalization, validated through a variety of
long-horizon, dexterous manipulation tasks across multiple embodiments. This
paper details the architecture of EO-1, the data construction strategy of
EO-Data1.5M, and the training methodology, offering valuable insights for

*Tarek Bouazza,Soulaimane Berkane,Minh-Duc Hua,Tarek Hamel*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces a cascaded observer architecture using optical flow and IMU data for continuous monocular visual-inertial odometry, achieving improved velocity and gravity direction estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need to continuously estimate velocity and gravity direction using monocular visual-inertial data, as accurate attitude estimation is essential in applications requiring precise motion tracking.

Method: The authors develop a Riccati observer for velocity and gravity direction estimation using optical flow and IMU data, complemented by a gradient descent optimization for optical flow data processing, and extend it with a complementary observer for attitude estimation using gravity direction and magnetometer data.

Result: The interconnected observer architecture is proven to be almost globally asymptotically stable, and simulations demonstrate its effectiveness in estimating velocity, gravity direction, and attitude.

Conclusion: The paper showcases a robust observer design combining optical flow and IMU measurements for continuous VIO, validated through theoretical stability and simulation results.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel cascaded observer architecture that combines
optical flow and IMU measurements to perform continuous monocular
visual-inertial odometry (VIO). The proposed solution estimates body-frame
velocity and gravity direction simultaneously by fusing velocity direction
information from optical flow measurements with gyro and accelerometer data.
This fusion is achieved using a globally exponentially stable Riccati observer,
which operates under persistently exciting translational motion conditions. The
estimated gravity direction in the body frame is then employed, along with an
optional magnetometer measurement, to design a complementary observer on
$\mathbf{SO}(3)$ for attitude estimation. The resulting interconnected observer
architecture is shown to be almost globally asymptotically stable. To extract
the velocity direction from sparse optical flow data, a gradient descent
algorithm is developed to solve a constrained minimization problem on the unit
sphere. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithms is validated through
simulation results.

*Usman A. Khan,Mouhacine Benosman,Wenliang Liu,Federico Pecora,Joseph W. Durham*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel methodology using optimal transport theory and model predictive control for multi-robot path planning and scheduling, addressing deadlocks and overlapping paths.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To resolve challenges in multi-robot navigation, specifically minimizing deadlocks and ensuring non-overlapping trajectories in navigating towards multiple targets in a shared space with obstacles.

Method: The methodology integrates optimal transport theory to derive minimum cost paths and non-overlapping trajectories for robots. Space is discretized, and a cost structure is imposed for cell transitions. Temporal structures and replanning are incorporated to address dynamics and unavoidable overlaps.

Result: The approach guarantees optimal and non-overlapping paths with computational requirements of O(K³ log K) in worst cases and O(K² log K) in well-behaved scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed framework provides an effective solution for multi-robot navigation with non-overlapping trajectories, and temporal adjustments and predictive control enhance adaptability to real-world dynamics.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel methodology for path planning and
scheduling for multi-robot navigation that is based on optimal transport theory
and model predictive control. We consider a setup where $N$ robots are tasked
to navigate to $M$ targets in a common space with obstacles. Mapping robots to
targets first and then planning paths can result in overlapping paths that lead
to deadlocks. We derive a strategy based on optimal transport that not only
provides minimum cost paths from robots to targets but also guarantees
non-overlapping trajectories. We achieve this by discretizing the space of
interest into $K$ cells and by imposing a ${K\times K}$ cost structure that
describes the cost of transitioning from one cell to another. Optimal transport
then provides \textit{optimal and non-overlapping} cell transitions for the
robots to reach the targets that can be readily deployed without any scheduling
considerations. The proposed solution requires $\unicode{x1D4AA}(K^3\log K)$
computations in the worst-case and $\unicode{x1D4AA}(K^2\log K)$ for
well-behaved problems. To further accommodate potentially overlapping
trajectories (unavoidable in certain situations) as well as robot dynamics, we
show that a temporal structure can be integrated into optimal transport with
the help of \textit{replans} and \textit{model predictive control}.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A novel uncertainty-aware control framework is proposed for ankle exoskeletons that disengage during unfamiliar movements, ensuring safety across diverse scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitation of existing exoskeleton controllers that are restricted to predefined actions in controlled settings, making them unsuitable for real-world environments.

Method: Develop an uncertainty estimator to classify movement scenarios as familiar or unfamiliar using model ensembles, autoencoders, and generative adversarial networks, with online tests using the best-performing architecture.

Result: The ensemble-based approach successfully classified movements during online testing, achieving a high F1 score of 89.2, enabling autonomous switching of assistance during transitions.

Conclusion: The framework offers a promising solution for enabling exoskeletons to operate safely and autonomously in diverse real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Lower limb exoskeletons show promise to assist human movement, but their
utility is limited by controllers designed for discrete, predefined actions in
controlled environments, restricting their real-world applicability. We present
an uncertainty-aware control framework that enables ankle exoskeletons to
operate safely across diverse scenarios by automatically disengaging when
encountering unfamiliar movements. Our approach uses an uncertainty estimator
to classify movements as similar (in-distribution) or different
(out-of-distribution) relative to actions in the training set. We evaluated
three architectures (model ensembles, autoencoders, and generative adversarial
networks) on an offline dataset and tested the strongest performing
architecture (ensemble of gait phase estimators) online. The online test
demonstrated the ability of our uncertainty estimator to turn assistance on and
off as the user transitioned between in-distribution and out-of-distribution
tasks (F1: 89.2). This new framework provides a path for exoskeletons to safely
and autonomously support human movement in unstructured, everyday environments.

*Tara Mina,Lindsey Marinello,John Christian*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper compares stochastic cloning (SC) and delayed-state Kalman filter for handling correlated delayed-state measurements in robotics, showcasing that the latter can achieve equivalent results without state augmentation, offering computational and memory efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the handling of delayed-state measurements in robotics and navigation, focusing on computational and memory efficiency.

Method: The delayed-state Kalman filter was revisited and properly derived to demonstrate equivalence with stochastic cloning, showcasing how correlated delayed-state measurements can be effectively processed without augmenting the state vector.

Result: The delayed-state Kalman filter achieves the same state and covariance updates as stochastic cloning while offering computational advantages and lower memory requirements, especially for higher-dimensional states.

Conclusion: A properly derived delayed-state Kalman filter is a viable and efficient alternative to stochastic cloning, addressing misconceptions about Kalman filter limitations.

Abstract: Many estimation problems in robotics and navigation involve measurements that
depend on prior states. A prominent example is odometry, which measures the
relative change between states over time. Accurately handling these
delayed-state measurements requires capturing their correlations with prior
state estimates, and a widely used approach is stochastic cloning (SC), which
augments the state vector to account for these correlations.
  This work revisits a long-established but often overlooked alternative--the
delayed-state Kalman filter--and demonstrates that a properly derived filter
yields exactly the same state and covariance update as SC, without requiring
state augmentation. Moreover, the generalized Kalman filter formulation
provides computational advantages, while also reducing memory requirements for
higher-dimensional states.
  Our findings clarify a common misconception that Kalman filter variants are
inherently unable to handle correlated delayed-state measurements,
demonstrating that an alternative formulation achieves the same results more
efficiently.

Motivation: The paper aims to address challenges in autonomous driving development, such as complexity, lengthy training, and uncertainties, using Mini Autonomous Cars as cost-effective platforms for testing and evaluating machine learning models.

Method: The authors utilized RGB-D information combined with three-dimensional convolutional neural networks (3D CNNs). The performance was tested on two simulated tracks and compared against recurrent neural networks (RNNs) using metrics like task success, lap-time, and driving consistency.

Conclusion: 3D CNN-based models appear to be a viable approach for improving autonomous vehicle control, providing advantages in comparison to RNN-based alternatives.

Abstract: Autonomous driving applications have become increasingly relevant in the
automotive industry due to their potential to enhance vehicle safety,
efficiency, and user experience, thereby meeting the growing demand for
sophisticated driving assistance features. However, the development of reliable

prolonged training periods, and intrinsic levels of uncertainty. Mini
Autonomous Cars (MACs) are used as a practical testbed, enabling validation of
autonomous control methodologies on small-scale setups. This simplified and
cost-effective environment facilitates rapid evaluation and comparison of
machine learning models, which is particularly useful for algorithms requiring
online training. To address these challenges, this work presents a methodology
based on RGB-D information and three-dimensional convolutional neural networks
(3D CNNs) for MAC autonomous driving in simulated environments. We evaluate the
proposed approach against recurrent neural networks (RNNs), with architectures
trained and tested on two simulated tracks with distinct environmental
features. Performance was assessed using task completion success, lap-time
metrics, and driving consistency. Results highlight how architectural
modifications and track complexity influence the models' generalization
capability and vehicle control performance. The proposed 3D CNN demonstrated
promising results when compared with RNNs.

Result: Training results show 100% success for 2-piece assembly within 500 episodes, 92.9% success for 3-piece assembly, and 39.9% for 7-piece assembly after a total of 105,300 episodes.

Conclusion: This approach demonstrates significant improvements in efficiency and success rates for robot manipulation tasks while addressing safety and complexity issues.

Abstract: This paper presents the first comprehensive application of legal-action
masked Deep Q-Networks with safe ZYZ regrasp strategies to an underactuated
gripper-equipped 6-DOF collaborative robot for autonomous Soma cube assembly
learning. Our approach represents the first systematic integration of
constraint-aware reinforcement learning with singularity-safe motion planning
on a Doosan M0609 collaborative robot. We address critical challenges in
robotic manipulation: combinatorial action space explosion, unsafe motion
planning, and systematic assembly strategy learning. Our system integrates a
legal-action masked DQN with hierarchical architecture that decomposes
Q-function estimation into orientation and position components, reducing
computational complexity from $O(3,132)$ to $O(116) + O(27)$ while maintaining
solution completeness. The robot-friendly reward function encourages
ground-first, vertically accessible assembly sequences aligned with

TL;DR: This paper proposes a greedy algorithm leveraging matroid theory to efficiently assign heterogeneous sensors to optimize multi-target tracking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of optimally assigning robots with varying sensing capabilities to collaboratively track multiple targets and reduce uncertainty in target state estimation.

Method: Propose a greedy algorithm based on matroid theory guaranteeing constant-factor approximation bounds for tracking quality while operating within polynomial-time complexity.

Result: Simulations show accurate and extended target tracking, while numerical comparisons indicate its performance is close to optimal solutions.

Conclusion: The algorithm provides a robust, efficient, and applicable solution for multi-target tracking with heterogeneous sensors.

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of assigning heterogeneous sensors (i.e.,
robots with varying sensing capabilities) for multi-target tracking. We
classify robots into two categories: (1) sufficient sensing robots, equipped
with range and bearing sensors, capable of independently tracking targets, and
(2) limited sensing robots, which are equipped with only range or bearing
sensors and need to at least form a pair to collaboratively track a target. Our
objective is to optimize tracking quality by minimizing uncertainty in target
state estimation through efficient robot-to-target assignment. By leveraging
matroid theory, we propose a greedy assignment algorithm that dynamically
allocates robots to targets to maximize tracking quality. The algorithm
guarantees constant-factor approximation bounds of 1/3 for arbitrary tracking
quality functions and 1/2 for submodular functions, while maintaining
polynomial-time complexity. Extensive simulations demonstrate the algorithm's
effectiveness in accurately estimating and tracking targets over extended
periods. Furthermore, numerical results confirm that the algorithm's
performance is close to that of the optimal assignment, highlighting its
robustness and practical applicability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in cooperative vehicle coordination, particularly regarding safety and real-time performance in uncertain and dynamic environments.

Method: The framework employs robust trajectory control, a distributed optimization algorithm (ADMM-DTN), and an interactive attention mechanism to ensure safety, scalability, and computational efficiency.

Result: Simulation and real-world experiments show significant improvements, including reduced collision rates (by up to 40.79%) and computational demand (by 14.1%), while maintaining scalability with increasing vehicle numbers.

Conclusion: The framework effectively balances safety and real-time performance for vehicle coordination in complex environments, validated in real-world experiments, showcasing its scalability and robustness.

Abstract: Achieving both safety guarantees and real-time performance in cooperative
vehicle coordination remains a fundamental challenge, particularly in dynamic
and uncertain environments. This paper presents a novel coordination framework
that resolves this challenge through three key innovations: 1) direct control
of vehicles' trajectory distributions during coordination, formulated as a
robust cooperative planning problem with adaptive enhanced safety constraints,
ensuring a specified level of safety regarding the uncertainty of the
interactive trajectory, 2) a fully parallel ADMM-based distributed trajectory
negotiation (ADMM-DTN) algorithm that efficiently solves the optimization
problem while allowing configurable negotiation rounds to balance solution
quality and computational resources, and 3) an interactive attention mechanism
that selectively focuses on critical interactive participants to further
enhance computational efficiency. Both simulation results and practical
experiments demonstrate that our framework achieves significant advantages in
safety (reducing collision rates by up to 40.79\% in various scenarios) and
real-time performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, while maintaining
strong scalability with increasing vehicle numbers. The proposed interactive
attention mechanism further reduces the computational demand by 14.1\%. The
framework's effectiveness is further validated through real-world experiments

TL;DR: This paper introduces a multi-modal Model Predictive Path Integral control algorithm for motion planning in automated vehicles, which mitigates risk of sub-optimal solutions and ensures vehicle stability during evasive maneuvers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Develop effective and safe motion planning for automated vehicles, overcoming limitations of sub-optimal trajectories and stability issues.

Method: The approach integrates Sobol sampling, analytical collision avoidance, and a multi-modal control algorithm while using a non-linear single-track vehicle model for predictions.

Result: The algorithm successfully avoids obstacles, maintains stability during maneuvers, and outperforms standard techniques in simulations involving challenging road and obstacle scenarios.

Conclusion: This multi-modal approach enhances automated vehicle motion planning, ensuring safety and stability across diverse driving conditions.

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel approach to motion planning and decision-making
for automated vehicles, using a multi-modal Model Predictive Path Integral
control algorithm. The method samples with Sobol sequences around the prior
input and incorporates analytical solutions for collision avoidance. By
leveraging multiple modes, the multi-modal control algorithm explores diverse
trajectories, such as manoeuvring around obstacles or stopping safely before
them, mitigating the risk of sub-optimal solutions. A non-linear single-track
vehicle model with a Fiala tyre serves as the prediction model, and tyre force
constraints within the friction circle are enforced to ensure vehicle stability
during evasive manoeuvres. The optimised steering angle and longitudinal
acceleration are computed to generate a collision-free trajectory and to
control the vehicle. In a high-fidelity simulation environment, we demonstrate
that the proposed algorithm can successfully avoid obstacles, keeping the
vehicle stable while driving a double lane change manoeuvre on high and
low-friction road surfaces and occlusion scenarios with moving obstacles,
outperforming a standard Model Predictive Path Integral approach.

*Anuj Pasricha,Joewie Koh,Jay Vakil,Alessandro Roncone*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new trajectory generation method for articulated robots using denoising diffusion models, allowing safe handling of payloads exceeding nominal capacity across much of the workspace.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current robot payload ratings are overly conservative, leading to underutilization of robotic capabilities in terms of payload handling across their workspace.

Method: The method employs denoising diffusion models to generate dynamically feasible joint-space trajectories that incorporate payload constraints and avoid inefficiencies of traditional planning approaches.

Result: Experimental tests on a 7 DoF Franka Emika Panda robot showed that up to 67.6% of the workspace remains accessible with payloads exceeding 3 times the nominal capacity.

Conclusion: The approach reveals that incorporating nuanced payload dynamics in motion planning significantly expands the operational workspace and challenges conventional payload constraints.

Abstract: Nominal payload ratings for articulated robots are typically derived from
worst-case configurations, resulting in uniform payload constraints across the
entire workspace. This conservative approach severely underutilizes the robot's
inherent capabilities -- our analysis demonstrates that manipulators can safely
handle payloads well above nominal capacity across broad regions of their
workspace while staying within joint angle, velocity, acceleration, and torque
limits. To address this gap between assumed and actual capability, we propose a
novel trajectory generation approach using denoising diffusion models that
explicitly incorporates payload constraints into the planning process. Unlike
traditional sampling-based methods that rely on inefficient trial-and-error,
optimization-based methods that are prohibitively slow, or kinodynamic planners
that struggle with problem dimensionality, our approach generates dynamically
feasible joint-space trajectories in constant time that can be directly
executed on physical hardware without post-processing. Experimental validation
on a 7 DoF Franka Emika Panda robot demonstrates that up to 67.6% of the
workspace remains accessible even with payloads exceeding 3 times the nominal
capacity. This expanded operational envelope highlights the importance of a
more nuanced consideration of payload dynamics in motion planning algorithms.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces RoboInspector, a pipeline to assess and address unreliable behaviors in policy code generated by large language models for robotic manipulation and presents a refinement method to improve reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reliable policy code generation for robotic manipulation remains challenging due to task diversity and complex user instructions.

Method: The authors design RoboInspector to analyze task complexity and instruction granularity, identifying unreliable behaviors. They use insights to propose a guided refinement approach based on failure feedback.

Result: RoboInspector successfully characterizes four unreliable behaviors and improves policy code reliability by up to 35%.

Conclusion: The approach advances understanding and practical methods to enhance policy code reliability in LLM-enabled robotic manipulation, aiding real-world applications.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities in reasoning
and code generation, enabling robotic manipulation to be initiated with just a
single instruction. The LLM carries out various tasks by generating policy code
required to control the robot. Despite advances in LLMs, achieving reliable
policy code generation remains a significant challenge due to the diverse
requirements of real-world tasks and the inherent complexity of user
instructions. In practice, different users may provide distinct instructions to
drive the robot for the same task, which may cause the unreliability of policy
code generation. To bridge this gap, we design RoboInspector, a pipeline to
unveil and characterize the unreliability of the policy code for LLM-enabled
robotic manipulation from two perspectives: the complexity of the manipulation
task and the granularity of the instruction. We perform comprehensive
experiments with 168 distinct combinations of tasks, instructions, and LLMs in
two prominent frameworks. The RoboInspector identifies four main unreliable
behaviors that lead to manipulation failure. We provide a detailed
characterization of these behaviors and their underlying causes, giving insight
for practical development to reduce unreliability. Furthermore, we introduce a
refinement approach guided by failure policy code feedback that improves the
reliability of policy code generation by up to 35% in LLM-enabled robotic
manipulation, evaluated in both simulation and real-world environments.

TL;DR: The paper explores improving robot navigation in human spaces by addressing gaps in understanding human intentions and enhancing communication through geometric reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address robot-human interaction challenges under unexpected human behavior during navigation in shared environments.

Method: Geometric analysis of human cooperativeness and context, alongside verbal communication or robot action strategies in crossing scenarios.

Result: Developed evaluation metrics for human cooperativeness and demonstrated geometric reasoning-based communication strategies.

Conclusion: Effective communication grounded in geometric reasoning can improve robot-human interaction in navigation scenarios.

Abstract: Socially aware robot navigation is a planning paradigm where the robot
navigates in human environments and tries to adhere to social constraints while
interacting with the humans in the scene. These navigation strategies were
further improved using human prediction models, where the robot takes the
potential future trajectory of humans while computing its own. Though these
strategies significantly improve the robot's behavior, it faces difficulties
from time to time when the human behaves in an unexpected manner. This happens
as the robot fails to understand human intentions and cooperativeness, and the
human does not have a clear idea of what the robot is planning to do. In this
paper, we aim to address this gap through effective communication at an
appropriate time based on a geometric analysis of the context and human
cooperativeness in head-on crossing scenarios. We provide an assessment
methodology and propose some evaluation metrics that could distinguish a
cooperative human from a non-cooperative one. Further, we also show how
geometric reasoning can be used to generate appropriate verbal responses or
robot actions.

Motivation: Address the limitations of current imitation learning methods, which struggle with long-horizon tasks, require extensive datasets, and fail to generalize effectively under distribution shifts.

Method: Combines symbolic domain abstraction (using Answer Set Programming) with continuous control via diffusion policy imitation learning. It uses a graph-based high-level oracle to filter task-relevant information, providing interpretable decision-making and efficient control policy training.

Result: Validated in six challenging domains, the method achieves high data efficiency, needing only five demonstrations, with strong generalization capabilities and interpretable outcomes.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively learns and generalizes complex behaviors from limited data, overcoming the shortcomings of existing imitation learning approaches.

Abstract: Imitation learning enables intelligent systems to acquire complex behaviors
with minimal supervision. However, existing methods often focus on
short-horizon skills, require large datasets, and struggle to solve
long-horizon tasks or generalize across task variations and distribution
shifts. We propose a novel neuro-symbolic framework that jointly learns
continuous control policies and symbolic domain abstractions from a few skill
demonstrations. Our method abstracts high-level task structures into a graph,
discovers symbolic rules via an Answer Set Programming solver, and trains
low-level controllers using diffusion policy imitation learning. A high-level
oracle filters task-relevant information to focus each controller on a minimal
observation and action space. Our graph-based neuro-symbolic framework enables
capturing complex state transitions, including non-spatial and temporal
relations, that data-driven learning or clustering techniques often fail to
discover in limited demonstration datasets. We validate our approach in six
domains that involve four robotic arms, Stacking, Kitchen, Assembly, and Towers
of Hanoi environments, and a distinct Automated Forklift domain with two
environments. The results demonstrate high data efficiency with as few as five
skill demonstrations, strong zero- and few-shot generalizations, and
interpretable decision making.

### [202] [Estimated Informed Anytime Search for Sampling-Based Planning via Adaptive Sampler](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21549)
*Liding Zhang,Kuanqi Cai,Yu Zhang,Zhenshan Bing,Chaoqun Wang,Fan Wu,Sami Haddadin,Alois Knoll*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes MIT*, a novel sampling-based path planner that accelerates pathfinding by constructing estimated informed sets and dynamically adapting the sampling strategy, outperforming existing planners in simulations and real-world tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Path planning for high-dimensional, continuous robotics problems is computationally expensive, especially when initial solutions are unavailable and entire configuration spaces need exploration.

Method: The proposed MIT* planner constructs estimated informed sets using prior admissible solution costs, employs an adaptive sampler to adjust strategies during exploration, and incorporates length-related adaptive sparse collision checks to guide searches.

Result: MIT* demonstrates improved path cost efficiency, computation speeds, and success rates across R^4 to R^16 simulations and real-world robotics tasks, outperforming existing planners.

Conclusion: MIT* accelerates initial convergence in high-dimensional robotics problems, enhances computational efficiency, and proves its utility in practical applications with promising experimental validation.

Abstract: Path planning in robotics often involves solving continuously valued,
high-dimensional problems. Popular informed approaches include graph-based
searches, such as A*, and sampling-based methods, such as Informed RRT*, which
utilize informed set and anytime strategies to expedite path optimization
incrementally. Informed sampling-based planners define informed sets as subsets
of the problem domain based on the current best solution cost. However, when no
solution is found, these planners re-sample and explore the entire
configuration space, which is time-consuming and computationally expensive.
This article introduces Multi-Informed Trees (MIT*), a novel planner that
constructs estimated informed sets based on prior admissible solution costs
before finding the initial solution, thereby accelerating the initial
convergence rate. Moreover, MIT* employs an adaptive sampler that dynamically
adjusts the sampling strategy based on the exploration process. Furthermore,
MIT* utilizes length-related adaptive sparse collision checks to guide lazy
reverse search. These features enhance path cost efficiency and computation
times while ensuring high success rates in confined scenarios. Through a series
of simulations and real-world experiments, it is confirmed that MIT*
outperforms existing single-query, sampling-based planners for problems in R^4
to R^16 and has been successfully applied to real-world robot manipulation
tasks. A video showcasing our experimental results is available at:

### [203] [Learning Agile Gate Traversal via Analytical Optimal Policy Gradient](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21592)
*Tianchen Sun,Bingheng Wang,Longbin Tang,Yichao Gao,Lin Zhao*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper presents a hybrid framework combining model predictive control (MPC) with offline-trained neural networks (NN) to enhance quadrotor navigation through narrow gates, addressing efficiency and accuracy issues of existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traversing narrow gates is a complex benchmark for quadrotor agility and precision. Traditional and RL-based methods face challenges like parameter tuning, low sample efficiency, and limited interpretability.

Method: The hybrid approach fine-tunes MPC parameters online using a neural network trained offline. The NN predicts reference poses and cost-function weights based on gate coordinates and drone state. Novel analytical policy gradients and an optimized attitude tracking error formulation support effective learning.

Result: The framework demonstrated fast and accurate gate traversal abilities for quadrotors, with significant improvements in sample efficiency compared to naive end-to-end RL methods.

Conclusion: The proposed hybrid framework advances the state-of-the-art in autonomous quadrotor navigation, combining accuracy, efficiency, and practicality for constrained flight scenarios.

Abstract: Traversing narrow gates presents a significant challenge and has become a
standard benchmark for evaluating agile and precise quadrotor flight.
Traditional modularized autonomous flight stacks require extensive design and
parameter tuning, while end-to-end reinforcement learning (RL) methods often
suffer from low sample efficiency and limited interpretability. In this work,
we present a novel hybrid framework that adaptively fine-tunes model predictive
control (MPC) parameters online using outputs from a neural network (NN)
trained offline. The NN jointly predicts a reference pose and cost-function
weights, conditioned on the coordinates of the gate corners and the current
drone state. To achieve efficient training, we derive analytical policy
gradients not only for the MPC module but also for an optimization-based gate
traversal detection module. Furthermore, we introduce a new formulation of the
attitude tracking error that admits a simplified representation, facilitating
effective learning with bounded gradients. Hardware experiments demonstrate
that our method enables fast and accurate quadrotor traversal through narrow
gates in confined environments. It achieves several orders of magnitude
improvement in sample efficiency compared to naive end-to-end RL approaches.

*Bernhard Wullt,Johannes Köhler,Per Mattsson,Mikeal Norrlöf,Thomas B. Schön*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes a fast and safe motion planning technique for industrial manipulators using a novel Model Predictive Control (MPC) method that ensures collision-free motion in cluttered environments under uncertain conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Industrial manipulators face challenges in executing safe and fast movements in cluttered environments, compounded by model uncertainties that limit operational speed and overall effectiveness.

Method: The paper introduces a robust tube Model Predictive Control (MPC) integrated with a corridor planning algorithm to handle model uncertainties and ensure collision-free movement effectively.

Result: The proposed method was tested in a simulated environment with a 6 DOF industrial robot, demonstrating superior performance over benchmarks in handling higher model uncertainties while enabling faster motion.

Conclusion: The method effectively addresses the trade-off between safety and speed for industrial manipulators, offering a practical and efficient tool for motion planning in uncertain and constrained environments.

Abstract: Industrial manipulators are normally operated in cluttered environments,
making safe motion planning important. Furthermore, the presence of
model-uncertainties make safe motion planning more difficult. Therefore, in
practice the speed is limited in order to reduce the effect of disturbances.
There is a need for control methods that can guarantee safe motions that can be
executed fast. We address this need by suggesting a novel model predictive
control (MPC) solution for manipulators, where our two main components are a
robust tube MPC and a corridor planning algorithm to obtain collision-free
motion. Our solution results in a convex MPC, which we can solve fast, making
our method practically useful. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method in a
simulated environment with a 6 DOF industrial robot operating in cluttered
environments with uncertainties in model parameters. We outperform benchmark
methods, both in terms of being able to work under higher levels of model
uncertainties, while also yielding faster motion.

### [206] [Can a mobile robot learn from a pedestrian model to prevent the sidewalk salsa?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21690)
*Olger Siebinga,David Abbink*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper explores how pedestrians and robots interact to avoid collisions on sidewalks, using Reinforcement Learning agents to improve robotic behavior and reduce awkward interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand implicit communication during pedestrian interactions to design safe and acceptable robotic behavior in urban environments.

Method: Developed a Reinforcement Learning-based approach, leveraging a pre-existing pedestrian behavior model (CEI framework) to improve robot interaction with pedestrians.

Result: Basic RL agents successfully learned interactions with the CEI model, while risk-averse RL agents lowered perceived risks and improved motion communication with pedestrians.

Conclusion: The approach shows promise in enabling mobile robots to interact smoothly with pedestrians, encouraging further exploration for practical applications.

Abstract: Pedestrians approaching each other on a sidewalk sometimes end up in an
awkward interaction known as the "sidewalk salsa": they both (repeatedly)
deviate to the same side to avoid a collision. This provides an interesting use
case to study interactions between pedestrians and mobile robots because, in
the vast majority of cases, this phenomenon is avoided through a negotiation
based on implicit communication. Understanding how it goes wrong and how
pedestrians end up in the sidewalk salsa will therefore provide insight into
the implicit communication. This understanding can be used to design safe and
acceptable robotic behaviour. In a previous attempt to gain this understanding,
a model of pedestrian behaviour based on the Communication-Enabled Interaction
(CEI) framework was developed that can replicate the sidewalk salsa. However,
it is unclear how to leverage this model in robotic planning and
decision-making since it violates the assumptions of game theory, a much-used
framework in planning and decision-making. Here, we present a proof-of-concept
for an approach where a Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent leverages the model
to learn how to interact with pedestrians. The results show that a basic RL
agent successfully learned to interact with the CEI model. Furthermore, a
risk-averse RL agent that had access to the perceived risk of the CEI model
learned how to effectively communicate its intention through its motion and
thereby substantially lowered the perceived risk, and displayed effort by the
modelled pedestrian. These results show this is a promising approach and
encourage further exploration.

*Allen Wang,Gavin Tao*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces QuadKAN, a reinforcement learning-based framework for quadruped motion control, combining proprioception and vision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the limitations of state-to-action mapping in vision-guided quadruped motion control by combining proprioception and vision for enhanced performance.

Method: The proposed QuadKAN utilizes spline-parameterized Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) that incorporate proprioception and vision input fusion. It employs a Multi-Modal Delay Randomization technique and optimizes the model with Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO).

Result: QuadKAN outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in locomotion tasks, achieving better returns, longer distances, and fewer collisions across varied terrains and obstacle scenarios.

Conclusion: The results validate spline-parameterized policies as a robust, efficient, and interpretable approach for vision-guided locomotion in quadrupeds.

Abstract: We address vision-guided quadruped motion control with reinforcement learning
(RL) and highlight the necessity of combining proprioception with vision for
robust control. We propose QuadKAN, a spline-parameterized cross-modal policy
instantiated with Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs). The framework incorporates
a spline encoder for proprioception and a spline fusion head for
proprioception-vision inputs. This structured function class aligns the
state-to-action mapping with the piecewise-smooth nature of gait, improving
sample efficiency, reducing action jitter and energy consumption, and providing
interpretable posture-action sensitivities. We adopt Multi-Modal Delay
Randomization (MMDR) and perform end-to-end training with Proximal Policy
Optimization (PPO). Evaluations across diverse terrains, including both even
and uneven surfaces and scenarios with static or dynamic obstacles, demonstrate
that QuadKAN achieves consistently higher returns, greater distances, and fewer
collisions than state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines. These results show that
spline-parameterized policies offer a simple, effective, and interpretable
alternative for robust vision-guided locomotion. A repository will be made
available upon acceptance.

*Nazanin Siavash,Armin Moin*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper proposes using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines combined with Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance quantum and hybrid quantum-classical software systems. The focus is on generating Python code using Qiskit based on UML model instances and evaluating its accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to address the challenges of heterogeneous platform landscapes and the shortage of skilled developers in quantum and hybrid quantum-classical software systems by introducing model-driven approaches.

Method: The paper validates generating Python code from UML model instances utilizing RAG pipelines that incorporate Qiskit code samples from GitHub repositories, optimizing outputs using tailored prompts.

Result: Experiments demonstrated that carefully designed prompts can significantly enhance CodeBLEU scores (up to a fourfold improvement), ensuring more consistent and accurate quantum code generation.

Conclusion: The research direction shows promise for improving quantum software systems through enhanced LLM-RAG pipelines, with potential extensions for future experiments, such as model instance deployment or code transpilation scenarios.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel research direction for model-to-text/code
transformations by leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) that can be enhanced
with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines. The focus is on quantum
and hybrid quantum-classical software systems, where model-driven approaches
can help reduce the costs and mitigate the risks associated with the
heterogeneous platform landscape and lack of developers' skills. We validate
one of the proposed ideas regarding generating code out of UML model instances
of software systems. This Python code uses a well-established library, called
Qiskit, to execute on gate-based or circuit-based quantum computers. The RAG
pipeline that we deploy incorporates sample Qiskit code from public GitHub
repositories. Experimental results show that well-engineered prompts can
improve CodeBLEU scores by up to a factor of four, yielding more accurate and
consistent quantum code. However, the proposed research direction can go beyond
this through further investigation in the future by conducting experiments to
address our other research questions and ideas proposed here, such as deploying
software system model instances as the source of information in the RAG
pipelines, or deploying LLMs for code-to-code transformations, for instance,
for transpilation use cases.

*Dongjun Lee,Changho Hwang,Kimin Lee*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces UTRL, a reinforcement learning framework for training LLMs to generate superior unit tests by iteratively training a unit test generator and a code generator in an adversarial manner.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unit testing is essential in programming, but generating quality unit tests remains challenging. Automated approaches using LLMs exist, but training methods for producing high-quality tests are underexplored.

Method: The study employs an adversarial reinforcement learning framework (UTRL), where a unit test generator and a code generator iteratively improve by maximizing their respective rewards: discrimination reward and code reward.

Result: UTRL-trained Qwen3-4B generates unit tests that surpass those created through supervised fine-tuning and outperform frontier models like GPT-4.1, aligning closer with human-written ground-truth tests.

Conclusion: UTRL is effective in training LLMs to generate high-quality unit tests, showing significant advancement over existing methods and models like GPT-4.1.

Abstract: Unit testing is a core practice in programming, enabling systematic
evaluation of programs produced by human developers or large language models
(LLMs). Given the challenges in writing comprehensive unit tests, LLMs have
been employed to automate test generation, yet methods for training LLMs to
produce high-quality tests remain underexplored. In this work, we propose UTRL,
a novel reinforcement learning framework that trains an LLM to generate
high-quality unit tests given a programming instruction. Our key idea is to
iteratively train two LLMs, the unit test generator and the code generator, in
an adversarial manner via reinforcement learning. The unit test generator is
trained to maximize a discrimination reward, which reflects its ability to
produce tests that expose faults in the code generator's solutions, and the
code generator is trained to maximize a code reward, which reflects its ability
to produce solutions that pass the unit tests generated by the test generator.
In our experiments, we demonstrate that unit tests generated by Qwen3-4B
trained via UTRL show higher quality compared to unit tests generated by the
same model trained via supervised fine-tuning on human-written ground-truth
unit tests, yielding code evaluations that more closely align with those
induced by the ground-truth tests. Moreover, Qwen3-4B trained with UTRL
outperforms frontier models such as GPT-4.1 in generating high-quality unit
tests, highlighting the effectiveness of UTRL in training LLMs for this task.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper proposes a lightweight framework leveraging instruction-tuned language models with LoRA adapters for bug triaging, achieving promising results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bug triaging in large projects is slow and inconsistent, requiring an efficient methodology to improve assignment accuracy and speed.

Method: The framework uses instruction-tuned large language models combined with LoRA adapters and candidate-constrained decoding.

Result: The model achieved a Hit at 10 of up to 0.753, and accuracy significantly improved on recent snapshots in datasets like EclipseJDT and Mozilla.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates real-world potential, suggesting instruction-tuned LLMs can replace costly traditional methods for bug triaging with human-in-the-loop systems.

Abstract: Bug triaging, the task of assigning new issues to developers, is often slow
and inconsistent in large projects. We present a lightweight framework that
instruction-tuned large language model (LLM) with LoRA adapters and uses
candidate-constrained decoding to ensure valid assignments. Tested on
EclipseJDT and Mozilla datasets, the model achieves strong shortlist quality
(Hit at 10 up to 0.753) despite modest exact Top-1 accuracy. On recent
snapshots, accuracy rises sharply, showing the framework's potential for
real-world, human-in-the-loop triaging. Our results suggest that
instruction-tuned LLMs offer a practical alternative to costly feature
engineering and graph-based methods.

### [211] [The Complexity Trap: Simple Observation Masking Is as Efficient as LLM Summarization for Agent Context Management](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21433)
*Tobias Lindenbauer,Igor Slinko,Ludwig Felder,Egor Bogomolov,Yaroslav Zharov*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper evaluates simpler, cost-effective methods for managing context in LLM-based software engineering agents compared to complex summarization techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-based software engineering agents can generate costly, lengthy context histories during iterative reasoning and tool use. While some use summarization to address this, its benefits are unclear compared to simpler strategies.

Method: The paper compares observation-masking and LLM summarization strategies within a software engineering agent on a benchmark suite, testing multiple model configurations to determine performance and costs.

Result: Observation masking reduced costs by half while matching or slightly exceeding the problem-solving rates of summarization techniques. For instance, masking improved solve rates in a specific model configuration (Qwen3-Coder 480B) from 53.8% to 54.8%.

Conclusion: Simpler context management strategies, like observation masking, can be more effective and efficient than complex LLM summarization in certain software engineering contexts. Reproducibility is ensured by releasing code and data.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents solve complex tasks through iterative
reasoning, exploration, and tool-use, a process that can result in long,
expensive context histories. While state-of-the-art Software Engineering ( SE)
agents like OpenHands or Cursor use LLM-based summarization to tackle this
issue, it is unclear whether the increased complexity offers tangible
performance benefits compared to simply omitting older observations. We present
a systematic comparison of these strategies within SWE-agent on SWE-bench
Verified across five diverse model configurations. We find that a simple
observation-masking strategy halves cost relative to a raw agent while
matching, and sometimes slightly exceeding, the solve rate of LLM
summarization. For example, with Qwen3-Coder 480B, masking improves solve rate
from 53.8% (raw agent) to 54.8%, while remaining competitive with summarization
at a lower cost. These results suggest that, at least within SWE-agent on
SWE-bench Verified, the most effective and efficient context management can be
the simplest. We release code and data for reproducibility

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper introduces LMPA, a technique that uses large language models to improve pointer analysis by addressing user-defined function challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of current pointer analysis frameworks caused by incorrect fact propagation and overly conservative approaches to user-defined functions.

Method: Integrating LLMs into pointer analysis to identify semantically similar user-defined functions, infer points-to sets, and augment summary strategies with natural language.

Result: LMPA mitigates errors in cross-calling-context propagation and enhances the precision and scalability of pointer analysis.

Conclusion: Large language models present an effective avenue for addressing core challenges in pointer analysis by improving semantic understanding and analysis strategies.

Abstract: Pointer analysis has been studied for over four decades. However, existing
frameworks continue to suffer from the propagation of incorrect facts. A major
limitation stems from their insufficient semantic understanding of code,
resulting in overly conservative treatment of user-defined functions. Recent
advances in large language models (LLMs) present new opportunities to bridge
this gap. In this paper, we propose LMPA (LLM-enhanced Pointer Analysis), a
vision that integrates LLMs into pointer analysis to enhance both precision and
scalability. LMPA identifies user-defined functions that resemble system APIs
and models them accordingly, thereby mitigating erroneous cross-calling-context
propagation. Furthermore, it enhances summary-based analysis by inferring
initial points-to sets and introducing a novel summary strategy augmented with
natural language. Finally, we discuss the key challenges involved in realizing
this vision.

*Jørn Eirik Betten,Quentin Mazouni,Dennis Gross,Pedro Lind,Helge Spieker*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces Multi-Policy Test Case Selection (MPTCS), a method to create reusable and policy-agnostic test suites for evaluating RL agents by focusing on difficulty, diversity, and solvability of test cases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of reliably validating RL policy behaviors for deployment due to the tailored nature of current testing methods.

Method: The MPTCS approach collects test cases from policy testing frameworks using a difficulty score and promotes diversity through a state-space descriptor inspired by quality-diversity algorithms.

Result: MPTCS identifies reusable test cases that reveal typical flaws in RL agents and demonstrates the impact of policy set size and diversity-promoting mechanisms on test suite quality.

Conclusion: MPTCS provides an effective framework for designing versatile and policy-independent test suites that improve RL agent reliability while exposing behavioral flaws.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) agents show great promise in solving sequential
decision-making tasks. However, validating the reliability and performance of
the agent policies' behavior for deployment remains challenging. Most
reinforcement learning policy testing methods produce test suites tailored to
the agent policy being tested, and their relevance to other policies is
unclear. This work presents Multi-Policy Test Case Selection (MPTCS), a novel
automated test suite selection method for RL environments, designed to extract
test cases generated by any policy testing framework based on their
solvability, diversity, and general difficulty. MPTCS uses a set of policies to
select a diverse collection of reusable policy-agnostic test cases that reveal
typical flaws in the agents' behavior. The set of policies selects test cases
from a candidate pool, which can be generated by any policy testing method,
based on a difficulty score. We assess the effectiveness of the difficulty
score and how the method's effectiveness and cost depend on the number of
policies in the set. Additionally, a method for promoting diversity in the test
suite, a discretized general test case descriptor surface inspired by
quality-diversity algorithms, is examined to determine how it covers the state
space and which policies it triggers to produce faulty behaviors.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper compares AI-generated and human-written code across quality metrics like defects, security vulnerabilities, and complexity, finding distinct differences and raising concerns about AI-generated code's security risks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how AI-generated code compares to human-written code in terms of quality, reliability, maintainability, and security as AI tools become more integrated into software workflows.

Method: Analyzed over 500k code samples in Python and Java, comparing AI-generated and human-written code using Orthogonal Defect Classification for defects and Common Weakness Enumeration for security vulnerabilities.

Result: AI-generated code is simpler and repetitive but prone to unused constructs, debugging artifacts, and high-risk security vulnerabilities. Human code is structurally complex but has more maintainability issues.

Conclusion: Both AI and human code have unique strengths and weaknesses, with AI-generated code presenting significant security concerns that necessitate specialized quality assurance practices.

Abstract: As AI code assistants become increasingly integrated into software
development workflows, understanding how their code compares to human-written
programs is critical for ensuring reliability, maintainability, and security.
In this paper, we present a large-scale comparison of code authored by human
developers and three state-of-the-art LLMs, i.e., ChatGPT, DeepSeek-Coder, and
Qwen-Coder, on multiple dimensions of software quality: code defects, security
vulnerabilities, and structural complexity. Our evaluation spans over 500k code
samples in two widely used languages, Python and Java, classifying defects via
Orthogonal Defect Classification and security vulnerabilities using the Common
Weakness Enumeration. We find that AI-generated code is generally simpler and
more repetitive, yet more prone to unused constructs and hardcoded debugging,
while human-written code exhibits greater structural complexity and a higher
concentration of maintainability issues. Notably, AI-generated code also
contains more high-risk security vulnerabilities. These findings highlight the
distinct defect profiles of AI- and human-authored code and underscore the need
for specialized quality assurance practices in AI-assisted programming.

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: This paper introduces NSPDI-SNN, an efficient and sparse Spiking Neural Network method inspired by dendritic functions in biological neurons.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the limitations of current SNNs in matching the complex structure of biological dendrites, which are crucial for effective spatiotemporal information processing.

Method: It introduces nonlinear dendritic integration (NDI) for better neuron representation and nonlinear synaptic pruning (NSP) for high sparsity in SNNs.

Result: NSPDI-SNN achieved top results on three event-based datasets and outperformed existing methods in speech recognition and maze navigation tasks with minimal performance loss despite high sparsity.

Conclusion: The complex dendritic structure and nonlinear computation improve the efficiency and representational capability of SNNs, contributing to the development of lightweight AI methods.

Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) are artificial neural networks based on
simulated biological neurons and have attracted much attention in recent
artificial intelligence technology studies. The dendrites in biological neurons
have efficient information processing ability and computational power; however,
the neurons of SNNs rarely match the complex structure of the dendrites.
Inspired by the nonlinear structure and highly sparse properties of neuronal
dendrites, in this study, we propose an efficient, lightweight SNN method with
nonlinear pruning and dendritic integration (NSPDI-SNN). In this method, we
introduce nonlinear dendritic integration (NDI) to improve the representation
of the spatiotemporal information of neurons. We implement heterogeneous state
transition ratios of dendritic spines and construct a new and flexible
nonlinear synaptic pruning (NSP) method to achieve the high sparsity of SNN. We
conducted systematic experiments on three benchmark datasets (DVS128 Gesture,
CIFAR10-DVS, and CIFAR10) and extended the evaluation to two complex tasks
(speech recognition and reinforcement learning-based maze navigation task).
Across all tasks, NSPDI-SNN consistently achieved high sparsity with minimal
performance degradation. In particular, our method achieved the best
experimental results on all three event stream datasets. Further analysis
showed that NSPDI significantly improved the efficiency of synaptic information
transfer as sparsity increased. In conclusion, our results indicate that the
complex structure and nonlinear computation of neuronal dendrites provide a
promising approach for developing efficient SNN methods.

*Lauren Forbes,Jared Grossman,Montie Avery,Ryan Goh,Gabriel Koch Ocker*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: This study examines bifurcations in integrate-and-fire neural networks, exploring the impact of synaptic interactions' spatial and temporal structures on population dynamics and patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how spatial and temporal structures in synaptic interactions influence the macroscopic patterns of activity in neural networks.

Method: A deterministic mean-field approximation was used to study population dynamics, supported by simulations of the stochastic model.

Result: The study found that synaptic delays, local inhibition, and long-range excitation drive various bifurcations, including Hopf, Turing, and Turing-Hopf bifurcations, leading to oscillations, localized activity, and spatiotemporal wave dynamics.

Conclusion: The mean-field theory accurately predicts complex spatiotemporal patterns in population dynamics, validated through stochastic model simulations.

Abstract: We study bifurcations in networks of integrate-and-fire neurons with
stochastic spike emission, focusing on the effects of the spatial and temporal
structure of the synaptic interactions. Using a deterministic mean-field
approximation of the population dynamics, we characterize spatial, temporal,
and spatiotemporal patterns of macroscopic activity. In the mean-field theory,
synaptic delays give rise to uniform oscillations across the population through
a subcritical Hopf bifurcation of the stationary uniform equilibrium. With
local excitation and long-range inhibition the network undergoes a Turing
bifurcation, resulting in a localized area of sustained activity, or stationary
bump. When the coupling has both delays, local inhibition, and long range
excitation, the network undergoes a Turing-Hopf bifurcation leading to
spatiotemporal dynamics, such as standing and traveling waves. When multiple
instabilities are excited, we observe other complex spatiotemporal dynamics. We
confirm all these predictions of the mean-field theory in simulations of the
underlying stochastic model.

*Jia Li,Cees van Leeuwen,Roman Bauer,Ilias Rentzeperis*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: This study proposes a Hebbian-inspired model using homeostasis to explain the simultaneous emergence of heavy-tailed weight distributions and complex network structures in brain networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address whether a single mechanism can account for both heavy-tailed weight distributions and complex network topologies in neural networks.

Method: The researchers developed a model involving adaptive weight adjustment and rewiring of connections based on homeostatic principles, incorporating Hebbian-inspired dynamics.

Result: The model showed that weight adjustment alone produces heavy-tailed distributions when activity remains local, while adding adaptive rewiring yields similar distributions even for extended activity flow, along with complex network structures.

Conclusion: By unifying weight adjustment and rewiring under homeostatic dynamics, the model offers a robust, parsimonious explanation for neural network features seen across diverse conditions.

Abstract: Brain networks continually adjust the weights of their connections, resulting
in heavy-tailed distributions of their connection weights, a few strong
connections among many weaker ones. At the same time, these connections undergo
structural plasticity, forming a complex network topology. Although mechanisms
producing either heavy-tailed distributions or complex topologies have been
proposed, it has remained unclear whether a single mechanism can produce both.
We consider homeostasis as the driving principle and propose a Hebbian inspired
model that adaptively adjusts weights and rewires directed connections based on
homeostatic dynamics. Without adaptive rewiring, weight adjustment alone still
generates heavy-tailed weight distributions, as long as activity does not
spread beyond locally neighboring units. However, when combined with adaptive
rewiring, the homeostatic dynamics create a synergy that produces heavy-tailed
weight distributions also for more extended activity flow. Furthermore, the
model generates complex network structures that encompass convergent-divergent
circuits similar to those that facilitate signal transmission throughout the
nervous system. By combining adaptive weight adjustment and rewiring based on
the same homeostatic dynamics, our model provides a parsimonious and robust
mechanism that simultaneously produces heavy-tailed weight distributions and
convergent-divergent units under a wide range of dynamical regimes.

*Partha Ghose,Dimitris Pinotsis*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: The paper proposes experiments to detect quantum-like and Dirac-type effects in brain dynamics, linking neuroscience and quantum mechanics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore potential quantum-like and Dirac-type stochastic phenomena in brain processes, connecting neural dynamics with principles of relativistic quantum mechanics.

Method: The paper suggests two experimental approaches: (1) detecting coherence in axonal signal propagation and (2) observing neuronal temperature and fluctuation data for quantum markers.

Result: Proposed experiments aim to identify Dirac-type stochasticity and quantum-like effects in brain oscillations and signal propagation.

Conclusion: If the experiments succeed, they could provide groundbreaking evidence for quantum influences in neural activity.

Abstract: The emergence of the Dirac equation from a stochastic master equation
suggests a profound link between relativistic quantum mechanics and underlying
probabilistic descriptions of brain dynamics. In parallel, recent work has
shown that the FitzHugh-Nagumo equations describing excitable neurons can be
reformulated to yield a Schr\"{o}dinger-like equation with a novel Planck-like
constant, indicating that neural noise may give rise to quantum-like dynamics.
This paper brings these insights together to propose two novel neuroscience
experiments aimed at detecting emergent coherence in axonal signal propagation
and subthreshold oscillations. We suggest that stochastic interference effects
in axon branching structures may reveal signatures of Dirac-type stochasticity.
We also suggest that by measuring neuronal temperature and fluctuations we can
detect quantum effects in brain oscillations. If successful, these experiments
will provide experimental support for quantum markers of brain processes.

*Guy Amichay,Vijay Balasubramanian,Daniel M. Abrams*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: This paper explores the tendency of evolutionarily distinct species to communicate isochronously within a specific frequency range and hypothesizes a universal biophysical basis for this phenomenon.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The observation of similar communication frequencies in fireflies and crickets during fieldwork sparked curiosity about whether such communication might share a universal basis across species.

Method: A meta-analysis was conducted to identify frequency patterns in communication among various species. Additionally, tests were performed using small biological receiver circuits resembling neurons to assess their responsiveness to certain frequencies.

Result: The study revealed a prevalence of species communicating at ~0.5-4 Hz and demonstrated that biological circuits are most responsive to this range of frequencies.

Conclusion: This suggests that the observed frequency range is a biophysically significant hotspot for communication across species.

Abstract: During fieldwork in Thailand we observed nearly identical frequencies of
co-located flashing fireflies and chirping crickets. Motivated by this, we
perform a meta-analysis and show an abundance of evolutionarily distinct
species that communicate isochronously at ~0.5-4 Hz, suggesting that this might
be a frequency "hotspot." We hypothesize that this timescale may have a
universal basis in the biophysics of the receiver's neurons. We test this by
demonstrating that small receiver circuits constructed from elements
representing typical neurons will be most responsive in the observed frequency
range.

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: This paper reviews the development of two-photon optogenetic stimulation for precise control of neural activity, emphasizing its progression in large field-of-view microscopes and methods like spiral scanning, temporal focusing, and 3D CGH.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The aim is to overcome limitations of conventional methods in modulating neuronal activity, focusing on precision and reducing off-target effects.

Method: The paper outlines the advancement of two-photon stimulation techniques, highlighting methods such as spiral scanning, temporal focusing, and 3D holography to control neuron groups selectively.

Result: These methods provide accurate, flexible, and rapid stimulation patterns, enabling better causal investigation of neural circuits and behaviors.

Conclusion: Integrating these advanced optical techniques has great potential for brain-machine interfaces but requires addressing several technical challenges for broader applications.

Abstract: Over the past decade, techniques enabling bidirectional modulation of
neuronal activity with single cell precision have rapidly advanced in the form
of two-photon optogenetic stimulation. Unlike conventional electrophysiological
approaches or one-photon optogenetics, which inevitably activate many neurons
surrounding the target, two-photon optogenetics can drive hundreds of
specifically targeted neurons simultaneously, with stimulation patterns that
can be flexibly and rapidly reconfigured. In this review, we trace the
development of two-photon optogenetic stimulation, focusing on its progression
toward implementations in large field of view two-photon microscopes capable of
targeted multi neuron control. We highlight three principal strategies: spiral
scanning, temporal focusing, and three-dimensional computer-generated
holography (3D CGH), along with their combinations, which together provide
powerful tools for causal interrogation of neural circuits and behavior.
Finally, we discuss the integration of these optical technologies into brain
machine interfaces (BMIs), emphasizing both their transformative potential and
the technical challenges that must be addressed to realize their broader
impact.

### [222] [Quantum-inspired probability metrics define a complete, universal space for statistical learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21086)
*Logan S. McCarty*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper introduces Quantum Probability Metrics (QPMs) for comparing probability distributions, overcoming high-dimensional and non-compact domain limitations of existing methods like Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the challenges posed by existing probability comparison methods, such as MMD, when applied to high-dimensional and non-compact domains.

Method: The method involves embedding probability measures into the space of quantum states, enabling the creation of Quantum Probability Metrics (QPMs) supported by eigenvalue methods and analytic gradients.

Result: QPMs outperform MMD in sensitivity to distributional differences, especially in high-dimensional spaces, while providing analytic solutions applicable for learning and optimization.

Conclusion: This research bridges quantum mechanics and classical probability theory to offer powerful metrics for probability analysis, potentially improving tasks like generative modeling and optimization.

Abstract: Comparing probability distributions is a core challenge across the natural,
social, and computational sciences. Existing methods, such as Maximum Mean
Discrepancy (MMD), struggle in high-dimensional and non-compact domains. Here
we introduce quantum probability metrics (QPMs), derived by embedding
probability measures in the space of quantum states: positive, unit-trace
operators on a Hilbert space. This construction extends kernel-based methods
and overcomes the incompleteness of MMD on non-compact spaces. Viewed as an
integral probability metric (IPM), QPMs have dual functions that uniformly
approximate all bounded, uniformly continuous functions on $\mathbb{R}^n$,
offering enhanced sensitivity to subtle distributional differences in high
dimensions. For empirical distributions, QPMs are readily calculated using
eigenvalue methods, with analytic gradients suited for learning and
optimization. Although computationally more intensive for large sample sizes
($O(n^3)$ vs. $O(n^2)$), QPMs can significantly improve performance as a
drop-in replacement for MMD, as demonstrated in a classic generative modeling
task. By combining the rich mathematical framework of quantum mechanics with
classical probability theory, this approach lays the foundation for powerful
tools to analyze and manipulate probability measures.

### [223] [Weighted Support Points from Random Measures: An Interpretable Alternative for Generative Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21255)
*Peiqi Zhao,Carlos E. Rodríguez,Ramsés H. Mena,Stephen G. Walker*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces a generative modeling method using random weighted support points, achieving high-quality results efficiently without neural networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a scalable, interpretable, and efficient alternative for generative modeling that can compactly represent data without relying on complex neural network architectures.

Method: Introduce a framework based on random weighted support points using Dirichlet process-inspired weighting, paired with an optimization algorithm via the Convex–Concave Procedure.

Result: Empirical tests on MNIST and CelebA-HQ datasets showed diverse, high-quality outputs at lower computational costs compared to GANs and DDPMs.

Conclusion: Random weighted support points are a promising alternative for scalable and interpretable generative modeling, efficiently preserving data structure with diverse outputs.

Abstract: Support points summarize a large dataset through a smaller set of
representative points that can be used for data operations, such as Monte Carlo
integration, without requiring access to the full dataset. In this sense,
support points offer a compact yet informative representation of the original
data. We build on this idea to introduce a generative modeling framework based
on random weighted support points, where the randomness arises from a weighting
scheme inspired by the Dirichlet process and the Bayesian bootstrap. The
proposed method generates diverse and interpretable sample sets from a fixed
dataset, without relying on probabilistic modeling assumptions or neural
network architectures. We present the theoretical formulation of the method and
develop an efficient optimization algorithm based on the Convex--Concave
Procedure (CCP). Empirical results on the MNIST and CelebA-HQ datasets show
that our approach produces high-quality and diverse outputs at a fraction of
the computational cost of black-box alternatives such as Generative Adversarial
Networks (GANs) or Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs). These
results suggest that random weighted support points offer a principled,
scalable, and interpretable alternative for generative modeling. A key feature
is their ability to produce genuinely interpolative samples that preserve
underlying data structure.

### [224] [Adaptive generative moment matching networks for improved learning of dependence structures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21531)
*Marius Hofert,Gan Yao*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper presents Adaptive Generative Moment Matching Networks (AGMMNs) with improved training performance using adaptive kernel bandwidth selection and early stopping criteria.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard GMMNs face limitations when training large-scale, high-dimensional generative models, especially for copula-based random number generation, necessitating improvements for better convergence and model prediction.

Method: The authors introduced an adaptive bandwidth adjustment for mixture kernels in Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) loss, increasing the kernel count during training and employing validation error-based early stopping.

Result: AGMMNs exhibit significantly better performance in both training and prediction compared to standard GMMNs and parametric copula models, demonstrated through various applications including S&P 500 and FTSE 100 datasets.

Conclusion: AGMMNs outperform traditional GMMNs and parametric copula models in training and predictive tasks, demonstrating superior capabilities for high-dimensional generative modeling applications.

Abstract: An adaptive bandwidth selection procedure for the mixture kernel in the
maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) for fitting generative moment matching networks
(GMMNs) is introduced, and its ability to improve the learning of copula random
number generators is demonstrated. Based on the relative error of the training
loss, the number of kernels is increased during training; additionally, the
relative error of the validation loss is used as an early stopping criterion.
While training time of such adaptively trained GMMNs (AGMMNs) is similar to
that of GMMNs, training performance is increased significantly in comparison to
GMMNs, which is assessed and shown based on validation MMD trajectories,
samples and validation MMD values. Superiority of AGMMNs over GMMNs, as well as
typical parametric copula models, is demonstrated in terms of three
applications. First, convergence rates of quasi-random versus pseudo-random
samples from high-dimensional copulas are investigated for three functionals of
interest and in dimensions as large as 100 for the first time. Second,
replicated validation MMDs, as well as Monte Carlo and quasi-Monte Carlo
applications based on the expected payoff of a basked call option and the risk
measure expected shortfall as functionals are used to demonstrate the improved
training of AGMMNs over GMMNs for a copula model fitted to the standardized
residuals of the 50 constituents of the S&P 500 index after deGARCHing. Last,
both the latter dataset and 50 constituents of the FTSE~100 are used to
demonstrate that the improved training of AGMMNs over GMMNs and in comparison
to the fitting of classical parametric copula models indeed also translates to
an improved model prediction.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to analyze and steer large language models (LLMs) by identifying and adjusting concepts guiding their reasoning, particularly in economic forecasting, without compromising performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To use emerging techniques in computer science for understanding and guiding the reasoning processes within LLMs, specifically mapping economic forecasting outputs to understandable concepts.

Method: The authors employ brain-scanning techniques to identify plain-English concepts within LLMs, enabling researchers to evaluate their importance and steer their predictions towards specific biases or behaviors.

Result: The method demonstrated the ability to compute concept importance within economic forecasts and effectively adjust models to exhibit different biased behaviors like risk aversion or optimism.

Conclusion: A transparent and lightweight method was developed that enhances empirical research in social sciences by making economic forecasts from LLMs interpretable and steerable, fostering better understanding and bias correction.

Abstract: Emerging techniques in computer science make it possible to "brain scan"
large language models (LLMs), identify the plain-English concepts that guide
their reasoning, and steer them while holding other factors constant. We show
that this approach can map LLM-generated economic forecasts to concepts such as
sentiment, technical analysis, and timing, and compute their relative
importance without reducing performance. We also show that models can be
steered to be more or less risk-averse, optimistic, or pessimistic, which
allows researchers to correct or simulate biases. The method is transparent,
lightweight, and replicable for empirical research in the social sciences.

TL;DR: This paper introduces distributed algorithms DOGT and ADOGT for minimax optimization, achieving linear convergence and optimal rates using accelerated consensus protocols.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to improve convergence performance in distributed minimax optimization over networks, addressing heterogeneity among objective functions.

Method: The authors propose the DOGT and ADOGT methods, leveraging surrogate functions and Lyapunov-based analysis with an accelerated consensus protocol.

Result: DOGT shows linear convergence for strongly convex-strongly concave objectives, and ADOGT achieves optimal convergence and communication complexity.

Conclusion: Distributed optimistic gradient methods DOGT and ADOGT are effective for minimax optimization, validated by theoretical analysis and numerical experiments.

Abstract: This paper studies the distributed minimax optimization problem over
networks. To enhance convergence performance, we propose a distributed
optimistic gradient tracking method, termed DOGT, which solves a surrogate
function that captures the similarity between local objective functions to
approximate a centralized optimistic approach locally. Leveraging a
Lyapunov-based analysis, we prove that DOGT achieves linear convergence to the
optimal solution for strongly convex-strongly concave objective functions while
remaining robust to the heterogeneity among them. Moreover, by integrating an
accelerated consensus protocol, the accelerated DOGT (ADOGT) algorithm achieves
an optimal convergence rate of $\mathcal{O} \left( \kappa \log \left( \epsilon
^{-1} \right) \right)$ and communication complexity of $\mathcal{O} \left(
\kappa \log \left( \epsilon ^{-1} \right) /\sqrt{1-\sqrt{\rho _W}} \right)$ for
a suboptimality level of $\epsilon>0$, where $\kappa$ is the condition number
of the objective function and $\rho_W$ is the spectrum gap of the network.
Numerical experiments illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address inefficiencies and potential misalignments with human values in DePIN markets due to unregulated environments and autonomous AI agents.

Method: EconAgentic uses simulations to model DePIN market evolution, evaluate stakeholder actions and impacts, and analyze macroeconomic indicators to ensure societal alignment.

Result: EconAgentic provides valuable insights on the efficiency, inclusion, and stability of DePIN markets, highlighting differences between AI-driven decisions and human heuristics.

Conclusion: EconAgentic contributes to enhancing both academic understanding and practical governance of tokenized, decentralized economies.

Abstract: The Decentralized Physical Infrastructure (DePIN) market is revolutionizing
the sharing economy through token-based economics and smart contracts that
govern decentralized operations. By 2024, DePIN projects have exceeded \$10
billion in market capitalization, underscoring their rapid growth. However, the
unregulated nature of these markets, coupled with the autonomous deployment of
AI agents in smart contracts, introduces risks such as inefficiencies and
potential misalignment with human values. To address these concerns, we
introduce EconAgentic, a Large Language Model (LLM)-powered framework designed
to mitigate these challenges. Our research focuses on three key areas: 1)
modeling the dynamic evolution of DePIN markets, 2) evaluating stakeholders'
actions and their economic impacts, and 3) analyzing macroeconomic indicators
to align market outcomes with societal goals. Through EconAgentic, we simulate
how AI agents respond to token incentives, invest in infrastructure, and adapt
to market conditions, comparing AI-driven decisions with human heuristic
benchmarks. Our results show that EconAgentic provides valuable insights into
the efficiency, inclusion, and stability of DePIN markets, contributing to both
academic understanding and practical improvements in the design and governance
of decentralized, tokenized economies.

TL;DR: This paper explores the usage of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for tasks requiring path-following, obstacle sensing, and collision avoidance by introducing and integrating multiple novel algorithms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the challenge of efficient and accurate path-following, obstacle sensing, and avoidance for UAVs while ensuring conflict-free fusion of these subtasks.

Method: A deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based UAV formation path-following model with adaptive reward weights, integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) signals, the VFEO algorithm for obstacle estimation, and an online obstacle avoidance approach complemented by a hierarchical fusion strategy using NSB behavioral methods.

Result: Simulation results validate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed subtask algorithms and the hierarchical fusion strategy in managing UAV operations under dynamic conditions.

Conclusion: The proposed methods successfully integrate path-following, obstacle sensing, and avoidance tasks for UAVs, ensuring precise operations and enhanced safety standards.

Abstract: The high mobility of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) enables them to be used
in various civilian fields, such as rescue and cargo transport. Path-following
is a crucial way to perform these tasks while sensing and collision avoidance
are essential for safe flight. In this paper, we investigate how to efficiently
and accurately achieve path-following, obstacle sensing and avoidance subtasks,
as well as their conflict-free fusion scheduling. Firstly, a high precision
deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based UAV formation path-following model is
developed, and the reward function with adaptive weights is designed from the
perspective of distance and velocity errors. Then, we use integrated sensing
and communication (ISAC) signals to detect the obstacle and derive the
Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) for obstacle sensing by information-level fusion,
based on which we propose the variable formation enhanced obstacle position
estimation (VFEO) algorithm. In addition, an online obstacle avoidance scheme
without pretraining is designed to solve the sparse reward. Finally, with the
aid of null space based (NSB) behavioral method, we present a hierarchical
subtasks fusion strategy. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness and
superiority of the subtask algorithms and the hierarchical fusion strategy.

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: This study focuses on improving building thermal dynamics modeling through the comparison of Transfer Learning (TL) and Continual Learning (CL) strategies, introducing Seasonal Memory Learning (SML) for handling concept drifts effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for improved modeling of building thermal dynamics in situations with limited initial data and ongoing changes like retrofits and occupancy shifts.

Method: The study compares various TL and CL strategies using simulated data spanning 5-7 years, including scenarios with concept drifts, and introduces Seasonal Memory Learning (SML).

Result: Seasonal Memory Learning (SML) demonstrated superior accuracy improvements compared to existing CL and TL methods — outperforming by 28.1% with no concept drifts and 34.9% with concept drifts.

Conclusion: SML is effective for adapting building thermal dynamics models over time, achieving improved accuracy with low computational effort.

Abstract: Transfer Learning (TL) is currently the most effective approach for modeling
building thermal dynamics when only limited data are available. TL uses a
pretrained model that is fine-tuned to a specific target building. However, it
remains unclear how to proceed after initial fine-tuning, as more operational
measurement data are collected over time. This challenge becomes even more
complex when the dynamics of the building change, for example, after a retrofit
or a change in occupancy. In Machine Learning literature, Continual Learning
(CL) methods are used to update models of changing systems. TL approaches can
also address this challenge by reusing the pretrained model at each update step
and fine-tuning it with new measurement data. A comprehensive study on how to
incorporate new measurement data over time to improve prediction accuracy and
address the challenges of concept drifts (changes in dynamics) for building
thermal dynamics is still missing.
  Therefore, this study compares several CL and TL strategies, as well as a
model trained from scratch, for thermal dynamics modeling during building
operation. The methods are evaluated using 5--7 years of simulated data
representative of single-family houses in Central Europe, including scenarios
with concept drifts from retrofits and changes in occupancy. We propose a CL
strategy (Seasonal Memory Learning) that provides greater accuracy improvements
than existing CL and TL methods, while maintaining low computational effort.
SML outperformed the benchmark of initial fine-tuning by 28.1\% without concept
drifts and 34.9\% with concept drifts.

*Navid Aftabi,Abhishek Hanchate,Satish Bukkapatnam,Dan Li*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: The paper proposes DynaMark, a reinforcement learning framework to adapt dynamic watermarking in real-time, aiming to detect replay attacks in automated systems like MTCs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address vulnerabilities in current dynamic watermarking schemes for Industry 4.0 systems that are susceptible to replay attacks due to outdated sensor data.

Method: DynaMark models dynamic watermarking as a Markov decision process (MDP) and uses reinforcement learning to adaptively determine watermark statistics without system knowledge.

Result: DynaMark reduced watermark energy consumption by 70% while maintaining trajectory consistency and achieved rapid alarm activation with low detection delay.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively balances control performance, energy efficiency, and detection confidence for secure operation in networked controllers.

Abstract: Industry 4.0's highly networked Machine Tool Controllers (MTCs) are prime
targets for replay attacks that use outdated sensor data to manipulate
actuators. Dynamic watermarking can reveal such tampering, but current schemes
assume linear-Gaussian dynamics and use constant watermark statistics, making
them vulnerable to the time-varying, partly proprietary behavior of MTCs. We
close this gap with DynaMark, a reinforcement learning framework that models
dynamic watermarking as a Markov decision process (MDP). It learns an adaptive
policy online that dynamically adapts the covariance of a zero-mean Gaussian
watermark using available measurements and detector feedback, without needing
system knowledge. DynaMark maximizes a unique reward function balancing control
performance, energy consumption, and detection confidence dynamically. We
develop a Bayesian belief updating mechanism for real-time detection confidence
in linear systems. This approach, independent of specific system assumptions,
underpins the MDP for systems with linear dynamics. On a Siemens Sinumerik 828D
controller digital twin, DynaMark achieves a reduction in watermark energy by
70% while preserving the nominal trajectory, compared to constant variance
baselines. It also maintains an average detection delay equivalent to one
sampling interval. A physical stepper-motor testbed validates these findings,
rapidly triggering alarms with less control performance decline and exceeding
existing benchmarks.

TL;DR: The paper studies deep active learning using Bayesian Neural Networks (BNN) to classify lung disease severity from chest X-rays, reducing data labeling requirements under class imbalance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to reduce the dependency on large labeled datasets for lung disease severity classification from chest X-rays, especially under challenges like class imbalance.

Method: The method involves training a deep neural network with Monte Carlo Dropout and using active learning for sample selection, coupled with a weighted loss function for handling class imbalance.

Result: Entropy Sampling achieved 93.7% accuracy (AU ROC, 0.91) for binary classification using 15.4% of labeled data, while Mean STD Sampling achieved 70.3% accuracy (AU ROC, 0.86) for multi-class classification using 23.1% of labeled data.

Conclusion: The study concludes that deep active learning using BNN approximation and a weighted loss function effectively minimizes labeling requirements and maintains high diagnostic performance, surpassing traditional methods.

Abstract: To reduce the amount of required labeled data for lung disease severity
classification from chest X-rays (CXRs) under class imbalance, this study
applied deep active learning with a Bayesian Neural Network (BNN) approximation
and weighted loss function. This retrospective study collected 2,319 CXRs from
963 patients (mean age, 59.2 $\pm$ 16.6 years; 481 female) at Emory Healthcare
affiliated hospitals between January and November 2020. All patients had
clinically confirmed COVID-19. Each CXR was independently labeled by 3 to 6
board-certified radiologists as normal, moderate, or severe. A deep neural
network with Monte Carlo Dropout was trained using active learning to classify
disease severity. Various acquisition functions were used to iteratively select
the most informative samples from an unlabeled pool. Performance was evaluated
using accuracy, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AU
ROC), and area under the precision-recall curve (AU PRC). Training time and
acquisition time were recorded. Statistical analysis included descriptive
metrics and performance comparisons across acquisition strategies. Entropy
Sampling achieved 93.7% accuracy (AU ROC, 0.91) in binary classification
(normal vs. diseased) using 15.4% of the training data. In the multi-class
setting, Mean STD sampling achieved 70.3% accuracy (AU ROC, 0.86) using 23.1%
of the labeled data. These methods outperformed more complex and
computationally expensive acquisition functions and significantly reduced
labeling needs. Deep active learning with BNN approximation and weighted loss
effectively reduces labeled data requirements while addressing class imbalance,
maintaining or exceeding diagnostic performance.

### [232] [Surface Stability Modeling with Universal Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials: A Comprehensive Cleavage Energy Benchmarking Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21663)
*Ardavan Mehdizadeh,Peter Schindler*

Main category: cond-mat.mtrl-sci

TL;DR: This paper benchmarks 19 state-of-the-art universal MLIPs for their ability to predict cleavage energies, finding that appropriate training data composition is more crucial than architectural complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the lack of systematic evaluation of universal MLIPs in predicting cleavage energies, which are critical for understanding fracture, catalysis, surface stability, and interfacial phenomena.

Method: A benchmark study was conducted using 19 MLIPs, evaluated on a DFT database of 36,718 slab structures, covering diverse chemical compositions, crystal systems, thicknesses, and surface orientations.

Result: Models trained on the Open Materials 2024 dataset achieved under 6% error and correctly identified the most stable surface terminations in 87% of cases, outperforming models trained on equilibrium-only or surface-adsorbate datasets.

Conclusion: Strategic training data generation emphasizing relevant physical phenomena is crucial, as simpler architectures trained with suitable data rival complex models in accuracy while being far more computationally efficient.

Abstract: Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) have revolutionized
computational materials science by bridging the gap between quantum mechanical
accuracy and classical simulation efficiency, enabling unprecedented
exploration of materials properties across the periodic table. Despite their
remarkable success in predicting bulk properties, no systematic evaluation has
assessed how well these universal MLIPs (uMLIPs) can predict cleavage energies,
a critical property governing fracture, catalysis, surface stability, and
interfacial phenomena. Here, we present a comprehensive benchmark of 19
state-of-the-art uMLIPs for cleavage energy prediction using our previously
established density functional theory (DFT) database of 36,718 slab structures
spanning elemental, binary, and ternary metallic compounds. We evaluate diverse
architectural paradigms, analyzing their performance across chemical
compositions, crystal systems, thickness, and surface orientations. Our results
reveal that training data composition dominates architectural sophistication:
models trained on the Open Materials 2024 (OMat24) dataset, which emphasizes
non-equilibrium configurations, achieve mean absolute percentage errors below
6% and correctly identify the thermodynamically most stable surface
terminations in 87% of cases, without any explicit surface energy training. In
contrast, architecturally identical models trained on equilibrium-only datasets
show five-fold higher errors, while models trained on surface-adsorbate data
fail catastrophically with a 17-fold degradation. Remarkably, simpler
architectures trained on appropriate data achieve comparable accuracy to
complex transformers while offering 10-100x computational speedup. These
findings show that the community should focus on strategic training data
generation that captures the relevant physical phenomena.

*Theresia Veronika Rampisela,Maria Maistro,Tuukka Ruotsalo,Falk Scholer,Christina Lioma*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: This study examines the relationship between group fairness and individual fairness in recommender systems, finding that increasing fairness for one type can reduce fairness for the other.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of understanding regarding how group fairness and individual fairness interact in recommendation systems.

Method: The authors conducted experiments comparing evaluation measures for group and individual fairness across 8 runs on 3 datasets.

Result: The experiments revealed that systems highly fair for groups can be very unfair for individuals, demonstrating a trade-off between the two fairness types.

Conclusion: The findings highlight the importance of balancing group and individual fairness in RS design and offer insights for practitioners seeking to improve fairness.

Abstract: Fairness in recommender systems (RSs) is commonly categorised into group
fairness and individual fairness. However, there is no established scientific
understanding of the relationship between the two fairness types, as prior work
on both types has used different evaluation measures or evaluation objectives
for each fairness type, thereby not allowing for a proper comparison of the
two. As a result, it is currently not known how increasing one type of fairness
may affect the other. To fill this gap, we study the relationship of group and
individual fairness through a comprehensive comparison of evaluation measures
that can be used for both fairness types. Our experiments with 8 runs across 3
datasets show that recommendations that are highly fair for groups can be very
unfair for individuals. Our finding is novel and useful for RS practitioners
aiming to improve the fairness of their systems. Our code is available at:

### [235] [Diffusion-based Multi-modal Synergy Interest Network for Click-through Rate Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21460)
*Xiaoxi Cui,Weihai Lu,Yu Tong,Yiheng Li,Zhejun Zhao*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper introduces Diff-MSIN, a novel framework for improving multi-modal click-through rate (CTR) prediction by addressing shortcomings in existing methods, such as poor handling of multi-modal interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CTR prediction models overly rely on ID-based data and fail to adequately model multi-modal user preferences. These models also do not effectively disentangle and synergize information across modalities, necessitating a better approach.

Method: The study proposes Diff-MSIN, which includes three modules: Multi-modal Feature Enhancement (MFE), Synergistic Relationship Capture (SRC), and Feature Dynamic Adaptive Fusion (FDAF). These modules work together to enhance multi-modal representations, manage fusion noise, and capture complex inter-modal interactions.

Result: Experiments on Rec-Tmall and three Amazon datasets demonstrated that the proposed framework achieves at least a 1.67% performance improvement over baseline methods.

Conclusion: The Diff-MSIN framework improves multi-modal CTR prediction by enhancing feature representation and capturing interactions across modalities. This work provides a substantial advancement for multi-modal recommendation systems.

Abstract: In click-through rate prediction, click-through rate prediction is used to
model users' interests. However, most of the existing CTR prediction methods
are mainly based on the ID modality. As a result, they are unable to
comprehensively model users' multi-modal preferences. Therefore, it is
necessary to introduce multi-modal CTR prediction. Although it seems appealing
to directly apply the existing multi-modal fusion methods to click-through rate
prediction models, these methods (1) fail to effectively disentangle
commonalities and specificities across different modalities; (2) fail to
consider the synergistic effects between modalities and model the complex
interactions between modalities.
  To address the above issues, this paper proposes the Diffusion-based
Multi-modal Synergy Interest Network (Diff-MSIN) framework for click-through
prediction. This framework introduces three innovative modules: the Multi-modal
Feature Enhancement (MFE) Module Synergistic Relationship Capture (SRC) Module,
and the Feature Dynamic Adaptive Fusion (FDAF) Module. The MFE Module and SRC
Module extract synergistic, common, and special information among different
modalities. They effectively enhances the representation of the modalities,
improving the overall quality of the fusion. To encourage distinctiveness among
different features, we design a Knowledge Decoupling method. Additionally, the
FDAF Module focuses on capturing user preferences and reducing fusion noise. To
validate the effectiveness of the Diff-MSIN framework, we conducted extensive
experiments using the Rec-Tmall and three Amazon datasets. The results
demonstrate that our approach yields a significant improvement of at least
1.67% compared to the baseline, highlighting its potential for enhancing
multi-modal recommendation systems. Our code is available at the following

Method: Developing and training stochastic parametrizations (additive and multiplicative) in the Lorenz '96 system using CRPS-based trajectory learning.

Result: CRPS-based trajectory learning yields parametrizations that are accurate, sharp, and superior in short-term forecasts compared to derivative-fitting approaches.

Conclusion: The approach provides promising results for short lead time accuracy, particularly benefiting data assimilation applications.

Abstract: This paper demonstrates the feasibility of trajectory learning for ensemble
forecasts by employing the continuous ranked probability score (CRPS) as a loss
function. Using the two-scale Lorenz '96 system as a case study, we develop and
train both additive and multiplicative stochastic parametrizations to generate
ensemble predictions. Results indicate that CRPS-based trajectory learning
produces parametrizations that are both accurate and sharp. The resulting
parametrizations are straightforward to calibrate and outperform
derivative-fitting-based parametrizations in short-term forecasts. This
approach is particularly promising for data assimilation applications due to
its accuracy over short lead times.

TL;DR: This paper evaluates quantum text generation models compared to traditional approaches like Transformers using experiments across diverse datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Explores the growing interest in leveraging quantum computing for natural language processing (NLP).

Method: Compared a baseline Transformer model to quantum-inspired models like QKSAN, QRWKV, and QASA across five datasets and metrics like perplexity, BLEU scores, vocabulary diversity, etc.

Result: Found traditional Transformers outperform overall, but quantum models excel in certain tasks, with QKSAN showing zero repetition rates and QRWKV achieving perfect vocabulary diversity.

Conclusion: Quantum-inspired models are promising but yet to surpass traditional NLP methods, showing potential in specific niches.

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of quantum text generation
models against traditional Transformer/MLP architectures, addressing the
growing interest in quantum computing applications for natural language
processing. We conduct systematic experiments comparing five distinct models:
Transformer (baseline), Quantum Kernel Self-Attention Network (QKSAN), Quantum
RWKV (QRWKV), and Quantum Attention Sequence Architecture (QASA) across five
diverse datasets including simple sentences, short stories, quantum phrases,
haiku poetry, and proverbs. Our evaluation employs multiple metrics including
perplexity, BLEU scores, vocabulary diversity, repetition rates, and fluency
measures to assess different aspects of text generation quality. The
experimental results reveal that while traditional Transformer models maintain
overall superiority with the lowest average perplexity (1.21) and highest
BLEU-1 score (0.2895), quantum-inspired models demonstrate competitive
performance in specific scenarios. Notably, QKSAN achieves a competitive BLEU-1
score of 0.2800 while maintaining zero repetition rates, and QRWKV demonstrates
perfect vocabulary diversity (Distinct-1 = 1.000) in certain tasks.

Result: The HCQA created optimal quantum sensor circuits with high QFI sensitivity, demonstrating its efficiency in automating the generation of quantum states useful for estimation and control.

Conclusion: AI-driven learning and quantum techniques can autonomously generate intelligent quantum circuit designs, enhancing sensing and estimation capabilities in quantum physics problems.

Abstract: This study proposes an HCQA for designing optimal Quantum Sensor Circuits
(QSCs) to address complex quantum physics problems. The HCQA integrates
computational intelligence techniques by leveraging a Deep Q-Network (DQN) for
learning and policy optimization, enhanced by a quantum-based action selection
mechanism based on the Q-values. A quantum circuit encodes the agent current
state using Ry gates, and then creates a superposition of possible actions.
Measurement of the circuit results in probabilistic action outcomes, allowing
the agent to generate optimal QSCs by selecting sequences of gates that
maximize the Quantum Fisher Information (QFI) while minimizing the number of
gates. This computational intelligence-driven HCQA enables the automated
generation of entangled quantum states, specifically the squeezed states, with
high QFI sensitivity for quantum state estimation and control. Evaluation of
the HCQA on a QSC that consists of two qubits and a sequence of Rx, Ry, and S
gates demonstrates its efficiency in generating optimal QSCs with a QFI of 1.
This work highlights the synergy between AI-driven learning and quantum
computation, illustrating how intelligent agents can autonomously discover

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates the promising impact of combining quantum machine learning and tensor-network approaches for optimizing complex quantum circuits, offering a scalable and efficient solution under realistic constraints.

Abstract: As the number of qubits in a sensor increases, the complexity of designing

### [241] [Can Layer-wise SSL Features Improve Zero-Shot ASR Performance for Children's Speech?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21225)
*Abhijit Sinha,Hemant Kumar Kathania,Sudarsana Reddy Kadiri,Shrikanth Narayanan*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: This study analyzes features from pre-trained SSL models to improve children's speech recognition in ASR, achieving significant performance gains in zero-shot scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current ASR systems struggle to process children's speech accurately due to its distinct acoustic and linguistic variability. SSL models have improved adult speech transcription, but children's speech remains challenging to transcribe effectively.

Method: The study extracted layer-wise features from pre-trained SSL models (Wav2Vec2, HuBERT, Data2Vec, and WavLM) and integrated them into a simple DNN-based ASR system using Kaldi. It identified the best-performing model layers for zero-shot children's speech recognition performance.

Result: Layer 22 of the Wav2Vec2 model achieved the lowest WER of 5.15%, a 51.64% improvement over baseline zero-shot decoding. Consistent performance improvements were observed across age groups, with strong results even for younger children.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that specific SSL features can significantly improve ASR performance for children's speech in zero-shot settings, with robust generalizability across datasets and age groups.

Abstract: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems often struggle to accurately
process children's speech due to its distinct and highly variable acoustic and
linguistic characteristics. While recent advancements in self-supervised
learning (SSL) models have greatly enhanced the transcription of adult speech,
accurately transcribing children's speech remains a significant challenge. This
study investigates the effectiveness of layer-wise features extracted from
state-of-the-art SSL pre-trained models - specifically, Wav2Vec2, HuBERT,
Data2Vec, and WavLM in improving the performance of ASR for children's speech
in zero-shot scenarios. A detailed analysis of features extracted from these
models was conducted, integrating them into a simplified DNN-based ASR system
using the Kaldi toolkit. The analysis identified the most effective layers for
enhancing ASR performance on children's speech in a zero-shot scenario, where
WSJCAM0 adult speech was used for training and PFSTAR children speech for
testing. Experimental results indicated that Layer 22 of the Wav2Vec2 model
achieved the lowest Word Error Rate (WER) of 5.15%, representing a 51.64%
relative improvement over the direct zero-shot decoding using Wav2Vec2 (WER of
10.65%). Additionally, age group-wise analysis demonstrated consistent
performance improvements with increasing age, along with significant gains
observed even in younger age groups using the SSL features. Further experiments
on the CMU Kids dataset confirmed similar trends, highlighting the
generalizability of the proposed approach.

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: This paper presents a zero-shot Keyword Spotting (KWS) approach for children's speech using self-supervised learning (SSL) models, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Children's speech, with its unique acoustic and linguistic traits, poses challenges for existing KWS systems that primarily focus on adult speech. This paper seeks to adapt KWS methods to children's speech using advanced SSL models.

Method: The method involves extracting layer-wise features from SSL models (e.g., Wav2Vec2, HuBERT, Data2Vec) and training a Kaldi-based DNN KWS system. Training was done on an adult speech dataset, while testing was conducted on a children's speech dataset to assess zero-shot performance.

Result: The proposed method achieved state-of-the-art results on children's speech for all keywords. The Wav2Vec2 model (layer 22) stood out with an ATWV score of 0.691, MTWV of 0.7003, and significant false alarm/miss rate reductions. Results also showed effectiveness across age groups and robustness to noise.

Conclusion: Leveraging SSL embeddings significantly enhances zero-shot KWS for children, addressing the challenges of distinct child speech characteristics and providing a robust solution across various conditions.

Abstract: Numerous methods have been proposed to enhance Keyword Spotting (KWS) in
adult speech, but children's speech presents unique challenges for KWS systems
due to its distinct acoustic and linguistic characteristics. This paper
introduces a zero-shot KWS approach that leverages state-of-the-art
self-supervised learning (SSL) models, including Wav2Vec2, HuBERT and Data2Vec.
Features are extracted layer-wise from these SSL models and used to train a
Kaldi-based DNN KWS system. The WSJCAM0 adult speech dataset was used for
training, while the PFSTAR children's speech dataset was used for testing,
demonstrating the zero-shot capability of our method. Our approach achieved
state-of-the-art results across all keyword sets for children's speech.
Notably, the Wav2Vec2 model, particularly layer 22, performed the best,
delivering an ATWV score of 0.691, a MTWV score of 0.7003 and probability of
false alarm and probability of miss of 0.0164 and 0.0547 respectively, for a
set of 30 keywords. Furthermore, age-specific performance evaluation confirmed
the system's effectiveness across different age groups of children. To assess
the system's robustness against noise, additional experiments were conducted
using the best-performing layer of the best-performing Wav2Vec2 model. The
results demonstrated a significant improvement over traditional MFCC-based
baseline, emphasizing the potential of SSL embeddings even in noisy conditions.
To further generalize the KWS framework, the experiments were repeated for an
additional CMU dataset. Overall the results highlight the significant
contribution of SSL features in enhancing Zero-Shot KWS performance for
children's speech, effectively addressing the challenges associated with the
distinct characteristics of child speakers.

### [243] [Synthetic CVs To Build and Test Fairness-Aware Hiring Tools](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21179)
*Jorge Saldivar,Anna Gatzioura,Carlos Castillo*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: The paper introduces a synthetic dataset of 1,730 CVs modeled on real materials to address bias and fairness evaluation in algorithmic hiring systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Algorithmic hiring systems risk introducing bias, leading to discrimination based on age, gender, or national origin. To research fairness, diverse datasets are needed but currently don't exist.

Method: The authors conducted a data donation campaign to collect real CVs and used the features from these donations to build a synthetic dataset.

Result: They successfully created a dataset of 1,730 synthetic CVs designed to reflect diverse backgrounds and characteristics.

Conclusion: This synthetic dataset serves as a potential standard for benchmarking research on bias and fairness in algorithmic hiring practices.

Abstract: Algorithmic hiring has become increasingly necessary in some sectors as it
promises to deal with hundreds or even thousands of applicants. At the heart of
these systems are algorithms designed to retrieve and rank candidate profiles,
which are usually represented by Curricula Vitae (CVs). Research has shown,
however, that such technologies can inadvertently introduce bias, leading to
discrimination based on factors such as candidates' age, gender, or national
origin. Developing methods to measure, mitigate, and explain bias in
algorithmic hiring, as well as to evaluate and compare fairness techniques
before deployment, requires sets of CVs that reflect the characteristics of
people from diverse backgrounds.
  However, datasets of these characteristics that can be used to conduct this
research do not exist. To address this limitation, this paper introduces an
approach for building a synthetic dataset of CVs with features modeled on real
materials collected through a data donation campaign. Additionally, the
resulting dataset of 1,730 CVs is presented, which we envision as a potential
benchmarking standard for research on algorithmic hiring discrimination.

*Weihuan Deng,Yaofu Huang,Luan Chen,Xun Li,Yao Yao*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: The study introduced a new rural livability assessment method using drone imagery and multimodal large language models, analyzing 1,766 villages in China.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current rural livability measurement methods have limitations, including scaling challenges with questionnaires and poor suitability of urban-based visual methods for rural areas.

Method: The paper implemented a drone-based approach, captured large-scale imagery of villages, developed efficient image comparison mechanisms, and utilized expert-informed chain-of-thought prompting within a multimodal large language model framework.

Result: The analysis revealed a dual-core-periphery spatial pattern in rural livability across China, radiating from Sichuan and Zhejiang provinces, with government fiscal expenditure as the primary influencing factor.

Conclusion: The framework delivers a scalable and reliable way to assess rural livability, aiding policymakers in rural development strategies and enhancing living conditions.

Abstract: With the deepening of poverty alleviation and rural revitalization
strategies, improving the rural living environment and enhancing the quality of
life have become key priorities. Rural livability is a key indicator for
measuring the effectiveness of these efforts. Current measurement approaches
face significant limitations, as questionnaire-based methods are difficult to
scale, while urban-oriented visual perception methods are poorly suited for
rural contexts. In this paper, a rural-specific livability assessment framework
was proposed based on drone imagery and multimodal large language models
(MLLMs). To comprehensively assess village livability, this study first used a
top-down approach to collect large-scale drone imagery of 1,766 villages in 146
counties across China. In terms of the model framework, an efficient image
comparison mechanism was developed, incorporating binary search interpolation
to determine effective image pairs while reducing comparison iterations.
Building on expert knowledge, a chain-of-thought prompting suitable for
nationwide rural livability measurement was constructed, considering both
living quality and ecological habitability dimensions. This approach enhanced
the rationality and reliability of the livability assessment. Finally, this
study characterized the spatial heterogeneity of rural livability across China
and thoroughly analyzed its influential factors. The results show that: (1) The
rural livability in China demonstrates a dual-core-periphery spatial pattern,
radiating outward from Sichuan and Zhejiang provinces with declining gradients;
(2) Among various influential factors, government fiscal expenditure emerged as
the core determinant, with each unit increase corresponding to a 3.9 - 4.9 unit
enhancement in livability. The findings provide valuable insights for rural
construction policy-making.

Motivation: Current methods in proteomics rely on global fragmentation statistics, which oversimplify biochemical principles, leading to less accurate predictions.

Method: The authors created the Pep2Prob dataset from 183 million high-quality MS$^2$ spectra, offering statistics for 608,780 unique precursors, and benchmarked performance using statistical and learning-based models.

Result: Models leveraging peptide-specific data significantly outperformed those using global statistics, highlighting the need for advanced machine learning to address complex nonlinearities.

Conclusion: Pep2Prob demonstrates the importance of peptide-specific features for accurate prediction and suggests advanced machine learning methods are required to capture complex fragmentation relationships.

Abstract: Proteins perform nearly all cellular functions and constitute most drug
targets, making their analysis fundamental to understanding human biology in
health and disease. Tandem mass spectrometry (MS$^2$) is the major analytical
technique in proteomics that identifies peptides by ionizing them, fragmenting
them, and using the resulting mass spectra to identify and quantify proteins in
biological samples. In MS$^2$ analysis, peptide fragment ion probability
prediction plays a critical role, enhancing the accuracy of peptide
identification from mass spectra as a complement to the intensity information.
Current approaches rely on global statistics of fragmentation, which assumes
that a fragment's probability is uniform across all peptides. Nevertheless,
this assumption is oversimplified from a biochemical principle point of view
and limits accurate prediction. To address this gap, we present Pep2Prob, the
first comprehensive dataset and benchmark designed for peptide-specific
fragment ion probability prediction. The proposed dataset contains fragment ion
probability statistics for 608,780 unique precursors (each precursor is a pair
of peptide sequence and charge state), summarized from more than 183 million
high-quality, high-resolution, HCD MS$^2$ spectra with validated peptide
assignments and fragmentation annotations. We establish baseline performance
using simple statistical rules and learning-based methods, and find that models
leveraging peptide-specific information significantly outperform previous
methods using only global fragmentation statistics. Furthermore, performance
across benchmark models with increasing capacities suggests that the
peptide-fragmentation relationship exhibits complex nonlinearities requiring
sophisticated machine learning approaches.

### [246] [Data-Driven Bifurcation Handling in Physics-Based Reduced-Order Vascular Hemodynamic Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21165)
*Natalia L. Rubio,Eric F. Darve,Alison L. Marsden*

Main category: cs.CE

TL;DR: This paper introduces a machine learning-integrated framework to enhance zero-dimensional (0D) hemodynamic reduced-order models (ROMs) for more accurate and efficient cardiovascular simulations, especially at bifurcations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High computational costs limit the practicality of accurate 3D finite-element simulations for cardiovascular flows, and existing reduced-order models lack accuracy at vessel bifurcations. The aim is to improve accuracy and efficiency to support clinical decision-making.

Method: The paper develops a resistor-resistor-inductor (RRI) model using machine learning predictions of pressure-flow relationships at bifurcations and incorporates it into 0D ROMs with an optimization-based solution strategy. Non-dimensionalization and apriori flow split predictions are used to enhance the model.

Result: The proposed method significantly improves the accuracy of 0D models, reducing inlet pressure errors from 45% (standard models) to 17% (RRI model) and from 45% to 26% (RI variant) across various Reynolds numbers. It performs especially well at high Reynolds numbers and in complex vascular networks.

Conclusion: The study presents an effective and computationally efficient hybrid framework for real-time hemodynamic modeling, enabling applications in clinical decision support and digital twin technology in cardiovascular care.

Abstract: Three-dimensional (3D) finite-element simulations of cardiovascular flows
provide high-fidelity predictions to support cardiovascular medicine, but their
high computational cost limits clinical practicality. Reduced-order models
(ROMs) offer computationally efficient alternatives but suffer reduced
accuracy, particularly at vessel bifurcations where complex flow physics are
inadequately captured by standard Poiseuille flow assumptions. We present an
enhanced numerical framework that integrates machine learning-predicted
bifurcation coefficients into zero-dimensional (0D) hemodynamic ROMs to improve
accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency. We develop a
resistor-resistor-inductor (RRI) model that uses neural networks to predict
pressure-flow relationships from bifurcation geometry, incorporating linear and
quadratic resistances along with inductive effects. The method employs
non-dimensionalization to reduce training data requirements and apriori flow
split prediction for improved bifurcation characterization. We incorporate the
RRI model into a 0D model using an optimization-based solution strategy. We
validate the approach in isolated bifurcations and vascular trees, across
Reynolds numbers from 0 to 5,500, defining ROM accuracy by comparison to 3D
finite element simulation. Results demonstrate substantial accuracy
improvements: averaged across all trees and Reynolds numbers, the RRI method
reduces inlet pressure errors from 54 mmHg (45%) for standard 0D models to 25
mmHg (17%), while a simplified resistor-inductor (RI) variant achieves 31 mmHg
(26%) error. The enhanced 0D models show particular effectiveness at high
Reynolds numbers and in extensive vascular networks. This hybrid numerical
approach enables accurate, real-time hemodynamic modeling for clinical decision
support, uncertainty quantification, and digital twins in cardiovascular
biomedical engineering.

### [247] [Considerations for Estimating Causal Effects of Informatively Timed Treatments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21804)
*Arman Oganisian*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: This paper addresses the issue of informative timing in sequential treatment decisions for survival outcomes, proposing g-methods for unbiased analysis and providing implementation guidance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing literature lacks awareness and solutions for the issue of informative timing in treatment decisions, which can bias outcome analysis.

Method: G-methods are proposed to adjust for waiting times between treatment decisions, treating them as time-varying confounders, and biases are illustrated with synthetic examples.

Result: The paper shows how unadjusted g-methods lead to biases and demonstrates how adjustment can be performed effectively, even in cases of patient death or censoring.

Conclusion: Timing plays a critical role in valid inference, and the proposed g-methods provide a practical approach to adjust for informative timing and improve analysis robustness.

Abstract: Epidemiological studies are often concerned with estimating causal effects of
a sequence of treatment decisions on survival outcomes. In many settings,
treatment decisions do not occur at fixed, pre-specified followup times.
Rather, timing varies across subjects in ways that may be informative of
subsequent treatment decisions and potential outcomes. Awareness of the issue
and its potential solutions is lacking in the literature, which motivate this
work. Here, we formalize the issue of informative timing, problems associated
with ignoring it, and show how g-methods can be used to analyze sequential
treatments that are informatively timed. As we describe, in such settings, the
waiting times between successive treatment decisions may be properly viewed as
a time-varying confounders. Using synthetic examples, we illustrate how
g-methods that do not adjust for these waiting times may be biased and how
adjustment can be done in scenarios where patients may die or be censored in
between treatments. We draw connections between adjustment and identification
with discrete-time versus continuous-time models. Finally, we provide
implementation guidance and examples using publicly available software. Our
concluding message is that 1) considering timing is important for valid
inference and 2) correcting for informative timing can be done with g-methods
that adjust for waiting times between treatments as time-varying confounders.

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: This paper introduces Miffie, a framework using large language models for automated, accurate database normalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual database normalization is often time-consuming, error-prone, and requires significant human effort.

Method: Miffie employs a dual-model self-refinement architecture, pairing a schema generation module with a verification module, integrating zero-shot prompts for guidance.

Result: Experimental results indicate Miffie's ability to normalize complex database schemas with high accuracy.

Conclusion: Miffie showcases a promising approach for reducing human effort in database normalization while achieving effective and precise results.

Abstract: Database normalization is crucial to preserving data integrity. However, it
is time-consuming and error-prone, as it is typically performed manually by
data engineers. To this end, we present Miffie, a database normalization
framework that leverages the capability of large language models. Miffie
enables automated data normalization without human effort while preserving high
accuracy. The core of Miffie is a dual-model self-refinement architecture that
combines the best-performing models for normalized schema generation and
verification, respectively. The generation module eliminates anomalies based on
the feedback of the verification module until the output schema satisfies the
requirement for normalization. We also carefully design task-specific zero-shot
prompts to guide the models for achieving both high accuracy and cost
efficiency. Experimental results show that Miffie can normalize complex
database schemas while maintaining high accuracy.

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: The paper explores a mediator's role in guiding players in a two-player game toward desired outcomes, finding limitations in current approaches and proposing augmented strategies to improve effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of steering players toward desired outcomes in mediated two-player games, especially under constraints in information design and incentive structures.

Method: The authors analyze the conditions for successful steering, propose a novel one-shot information design phase paired with transforming the game into a Stackelberg framework, and validate their theoretical model empirically.

Result: The approach theoretically demonstrated improved convergence rates to target action profiles by a constant factor with high probability.

Conclusion: Augmented strategies involving upfront information design combined with Stackelberg transformation are effective for steering outcomes and overcoming limitations in conventional methods.

Abstract: In this work, we investigate a steering problem in a mediator-augmented
two-player normal-form game, where the mediator aims to guide players toward a
specific action profile through information and incentive design. We first
characterize the games for which successful steering is possible. Moreover, we
establish that steering players to any desired action profile is not always
achievable with information design alone, nor when accompanied with sublinear
payment schemes. Consequently, we derive a lower bound on the constant payments
required per round to achieve this goal. To address these limitations incurred
with information design, we introduce an augmented approach that involves a
one-shot information design phase before the start of the repeated game,
transforming the prior interaction into a Stackelberg game. Finally, we
theoretically demonstrate that this approach improves the convergence rate of
players' action profiles to the target point by a constant factor with high
probability, and support it with empirical results.

*Thomas Besnier,Sylvain Arguillère,Mohamed Daoudi*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: This paper introduces a data-driven framework for motion prediction and transfer on unregistered 3D body meshes by employing a motion embedding network and a feature field.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unregistered 3D surface meshes and raw scans often face issues, such as the absence of point-wise correspondences and noise, complicating the automatic computation of plausible deformations.

Method: The authors developed a rig-free framework combining a motion embedding network with a per-vertex feature field to create a spatio-temporal deformation field for mesh deformations.

Result: The approach demonstrated effectiveness and versatility through extensive quantitative benchmarks and qualitative evaluations on tasks like walking and running for unregistered meshes.

Conclusion: This method offers a practical and robust solution for handling motion on unregistered surface meshes, showcasing its utility in generating accurate mesh deformations.

Abstract: Unregistered surface meshes, especially raw 3D scans, present significant
challenges for automatic computation of plausible deformations due to the lack
of established point-wise correspondences and the presence of noise in the
data. In this paper, we propose a new, rig-free, data-driven framework for
motion prediction and transfer on such body meshes. Our method couples a robust
motion embedding network with a learned per-vertex feature field to generate a
spatio-temporal deformation field, which drives the mesh deformation. Extensive
evaluations, including quantitative benchmarks and qualitative visuals on tasks
such as walking and running, demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of
our approach on challenging unregistered meshes.

### [251] [ARGS: Advanced Regularization on Aligning Gaussians over the Surface](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21344)
*Jeong Uk Lee,Sung Hee Choi*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: The paper proposes improvements to 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) for reconstructing high-quality 3D meshes and visuals through two new regularization techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The reconstruction of high-quality 3D visuals and meshes from 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) remains a challenge, even with existing solutions like SuGaR, which still exhibit limitations in visual fidelity and scene consistency.

Method: The paper introduces two complementary regularization strategies: (1) a rank regularization to prevent 'needle-like' Gaussian shapes by favoring more balanced 'disk-like' forms, and (2) incorporating a neural Signed Distance Function (SDF) guided by Eikonal loss to serve as a continuous global surface prior for improved surface alignment.

Result: The proposed methods enhance the stability and coherence of reconstructed surfaces while improving the visual fidelity of individual Gaussian primitives and their collective behavior.

Conclusion: The study presents an improved framework for 3DGS-based reconstruction with superior visual and geometric consistency, enhancing both individual Gaussian shapes and overall surface alignment.

Abstract: Reconstructing high-quality 3D meshes and visuals from 3D Gaussian
Splatting(3DGS) still remains a central challenge in computer graphics.
Although existing models such as SuGaR offer effective solutions for rendering,
there is is still room to improve improve both visual fidelity and scene
consistency. This work builds upon SuGaR by introducing two complementary
regularization strategies that address common limitations in both the shape of
individual Gaussians and the coherence of the overall surface. The first
strategy introduces an effective rank regularization, motivated by recent
studies on Gaussian primitive structures. This regularization discourages
extreme anisotropy-specifically, "needle-like" shapes-by favoring more
balanced, "disk-like" forms that are better suited for stable surface
reconstruction. The second strategy integrates a neural Signed Distance
Function (SDF) into the optimization process. The SDF is regularized with an
Eikonal loss to maintain proper distance properties and provides a continuous
global surface prior, guiding Gaussians toward better alignment with the
underlying geometry. These two regularizations aim to improve both the fidelity
of individual Gaussian primitives and their collective surface behavior. The
final model can make more accurate and coherent visuals from 3DGS data.

*A H M Nazmus Sakib,Mahsin Bin Akram,Joseph Spracklen,Sahan Kalutarage,Raveen Wijewickrama,Igor Bilogrevic,Murtuza Jadliwala*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper examines how WebAssembly-based obfuscation can bypass JavaScript fingerprinting defenses, revealing vulnerabilities in research detectors but robust performance in browser-level defenses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The widespread use of WebAssembly creates blind spots for traditional JavaScript fingerprinting defenses, necessitating an evaluation of its impact.

Method: An automated pipeline translates JavaScript fingerprinting scripts into WebAssembly variants, which are tested against research literature detectors and browser-based defenses.

Result: Research detectors showed moderate vulnerability due to outdated datasets or lack of WebAssembly compatibility, while browser-level defenses remained effective.

Conclusion: There exists a significant gap between academic and practical detection strategies, emphasizing the need for improved defenses against WebAssembly obfuscation and signaling potential for advanced evasion techniques.

Abstract: Browser fingerprinting defenses have historically focused on detecting
JavaScript(JS)-based tracking techniques. However, the widespread adoption of
WebAssembly (WASM) introduces a potential blind spot, as adversaries can
convert JS to WASM's low-level binary format to obfuscate malicious logic. This
paper presents the first systematic evaluation of how such WASM-based
obfuscation impacts the robustness of modern fingerprinting defenses. We
develop an automated pipeline that translates real-world JS fingerprinting
scripts into functional WASM-obfuscated variants and test them against two
classes of defenses: state-of-the-art detectors in research literature and
commercial, in-browser tools. Our findings reveal a notable divergence:
detectors proposed in the research literature that rely on feature-based
analysis of source code show moderate vulnerability, stemming from outdated
datasets or a lack of WASM compatibility. In contrast, defenses such as browser
extensions and native browser features remained completely effective, as their
API-level interception is agnostic to the script's underlying implementation.
These results highlight a gap between academic and practical defense strategies
and offer insights into strengthening detection approaches against WASM-based
obfuscation, while also revealing opportunities for more evasive techniques in
future attacks.

### [253] [Locus: Agentic Predicate Synthesis for Directed Fuzzing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21302)
*Jie Zhu,Chihao Shen,Ziyang Li,Jiahao Yu,Yizheng Chen,Kexin Pei*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: Locus improves directed fuzzing by using synthesized predicates to capture meaningful intermediate states, enhancing efficiency in discovering vulnerabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Directed fuzzing is challenging due to deeply nested target states and vast input search spaces. Current methods lack precision or require manual constraints.

Method: Locus synthesizes predicates as progress markers, uses symbolic execution to refine them, and employs these predicates to guide fuzzing more effectively.

Result: Locus enhanced eight fuzzers with an average speedup of 41.6x and discovered eight previously unpatched bugs.

Conclusion: Synthesized predicates improve fuzzing guidance, enhancing vulnerability discovery efficiency and generalizing across diverse programs.

Abstract: Directed fuzzing aims to find program inputs that lead to specified target
program states. It has broad applications, such as debugging system crashes,
confirming reported bugs, and generating exploits for potential
vulnerabilities. This task is inherently challenging because target states are
often deeply nested in the program, while the search space manifested by
numerous possible program inputs is prohibitively large. Existing approaches
rely on branch distances or manually-specified constraints to guide the search;
however, the branches alone are often insufficient to precisely characterize
progress toward reaching the target states, while the manually specified
constraints are often tailored for specific bug types and thus difficult to
generalize to diverse target states and programs.
  We present Locus, a novel framework to improve the efficiency of directed
fuzzing. Our key insight is to synthesize predicates to capture fuzzing
progress as semantically meaningful intermediate states, serving as milestones
towards reaching the target states. When used to instrument the program under
fuzzing, they can reject executions unlikely to reach the target states, while
providing additional coverage guidance. To automate this task and generalize to
diverse programs, Locus features an agentic framework with program analysis
tools to synthesize and iteratively refine the candidate predicates, while
ensuring the predicates strictly relax the target states to prevent false
rejections via symbolic execution. Our evaluation shows that Locus
substantially improves the efficiency of eight state-of-the-art fuzzers in
discovering real-world vulnerabilities, achieving an average speedup of 41.6x.
So far, Locus has found eight previously unpatched bugs, with one already
acknowledged with a draft patch.

*Jukka Ruohonen,Jesper Løffler Nielsen,Jakub Skórczynski*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper examines how risks are framed in five key EU cyber security legislative acts, noting gaps and offering practical compliance insights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how risks are legally conceptualized in EU cyber security laws and whether these representations converge or diverge across different acts.

Method: Qualitative legal interpretation paired with taxonomy-building to analyze legislative texts.

Result: The five acts address technical, organizational, human, and non-human risks. Notable gaps include acceptable risks, non-probabilistic risks, and residual risks.

Conclusion: The EU's cyber security laws have expanded risk-based regulation, but increased complexity and compliance burdens warrant practical strategies for adherence.

Abstract: The European Union (EU) has long favored a risk-based approach to regulation.
Such an approach is also used in recent cyber security legislation enacted in
the EU. Risks are also inherently related to compliance with the new
legislation. Objective: The paper investigates how risks are framed in the EU's
five core cyber security legislative acts, whether the framings indicate
convergence or divergence between the acts and their risk concepts, and what
qualifying words and terms are used when describing the legal notions of risks.
Method : The paper's methodology is based on qualitative legal interpretation
and taxonomy-building. Results: The five acts have an encompassing coverage of
different cyber security risks, including but not limited to risks related to
technical, organizational, and human security as well as those not originating
from man-made actions. Both technical aspects and assets are used to frame the
legal risk notions in many of the legislative acts. A threat-centric viewpoint
is also present in one of the acts. Notable gaps are related to acceptable
risks, non-probabilistic risks, and residual risks. Conclusion: The EU's new
cyber security legislation has significantly extended the risk-based approach
to regulations. At the same time, complexity and compliance burden have
increased. With this point in mind, the paper concludes with a few practical
takeaways about means to deal with compliance and research it.

### [255] [An Empirical Study of Vulnerable Package Dependencies in LLM Repositories](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21417)
*Shuhan Liu,Xing Hu,Xin Xia,David Lo,Xiaohu Yang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper analyzes security risks in the dependency ecosystem of large language models (LLMs). It found long undisclosed vulnerabilities and widespread usage of vulnerable dependencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the overlooked risk of vulnerabilities within the LLM dependency supply chain and understand their implications.

Method: Empirical analysis of 52 open-source LLMs, examining third-party dependencies, associated vulnerabilities, and comparing with the Python ecosystem.

Result: Half of the vulnerabilities in LLM ecosystems remain undisclosed for over 56.2 months. 75.8% of LLMs have vulnerable dependencies in configuration files.

Conclusion: This study highlights risks in the LLM dependency supply chain, provides actionable insights for practitioners, and underscores the need for improved security measures.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have developed rapidly in recent years,
revolutionizing various fields. Despite their widespread success, LLMs heavily
rely on external code dependencies from package management systems, creating a
complex and interconnected LLM dependency supply chain. Vulnerabilities in
dependencies can expose LLMs to security risks. While existing research
predominantly focuses on model-level security threats, vulnerabilities within
the LLM dependency supply chain have been overlooked. To fill this gap, we
conducted an empirical analysis of 52 open-source LLMs, examining their
third-party dependencies and associated vulnerabilities. We then explored
activities within the LLM repositories to understand how maintainers manage
third-party vulnerabilities in practice. Finally, we compared third-party
dependency vulnerabilities in the LLM ecosystem to those in the Python
ecosystem. Our results show that half of the vulnerabilities in the LLM
ecosystem remain undisclosed for more than 56.2 months, significantly longer
than those in the Python ecosystem. Additionally, 75.8% of LLMs include
vulnerable dependencies in their configuration files. This study advances the
understanding of LLM supply chain risks, provides insights for practitioners,
and highlights potential directions for improving the security of the LLM
supply chain.

*Wenjie Qu,Yuguang Zhou,Bo Wang,Wengrui Zheng,Yuexin Li,Jinyuan Jia,Jiaheng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: RepoMark, a data marking framework, enhances data auditing for code LLMs by enabling repository owners to verify whether their repositories were used for model training, achieving a detection success rate above 90%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address ethical and legal concerns surrounding the use of open-source code repositories for training LLMs and to improve transparency and compliance with open-source licenses.

Method: RepoMark introduces semantically equivalent code variants as data marks into repositories. It utilizes a ranking-based hypothesis test to detect memorization within models, ensuring semantic preservation and a strict theoretical false detection rate (FDR) guarantee.

Result: RepoMark achieves a detection success rate above 90% on small code repositories under a stringent FDR of 5%, significantly outperforming prior techniques which achieve less than 55%.

Conclusion: RepoMark is a robust and theoretically sound solution for enhancing transparency in code LLM training, safeguarding repository owners' rights, and representing a significant advancement over previous data marking methods.

Abstract: The rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs) for code generation has
transformed software development by automating coding tasks with unprecedented
efficiency.
  However, the training of these models on open-source code repositories (e.g.,
from GitHub) raises critical ethical and legal concerns, particularly regarding
data authorization and open-source license compliance. Developers are
increasingly questioning whether model trainers have obtained proper
authorization before using repositories for training, especially given the lack
of transparency in data collection.
  To address these concerns, we propose a novel data marking framework RepoMark
to audit the data usage of code LLMs. Our method enables repository owners to
verify whether their code has been used in training, while ensuring semantic
preservation, imperceptibility, and theoretical false detection rate (FDR)
guarantees. By generating multiple semantically equivalent code variants,
RepoMark introduces data marks into the code files, and during detection,
RepoMark leverages a novel ranking-based hypothesis test to detect memorization
within the model. Compared to prior data auditing approaches, RepoMark
significantly enhances sample efficiency, allowing effective auditing even when
the user's repository possesses only a small number of code files.
  Experiments demonstrate that RepoMark achieves a detection success rate over
90\% on small code repositories under a strict FDR guarantee of 5\%. This
represents a significant advancement over existing data marking techniques, all
of which only achieve accuracy below 55\% under identical settings. This
further validates RepoMark as a robust, theoretically sound, and promising
solution for enhancing transparency in code LLM training, which can safeguard
the rights of repository owners.

### [257] [Detecting Stealthy Data Poisoning Attacks in AI Code Generators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21636)
*Cristina Improta*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper studies vulnerabilities in AI models generating code, showcasing that current defenses struggle against silent attacks introducing insecure code.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenges posed by stealthy data poisoning attacks on natural language-to-code DL models used in software development.

Method: It conducted targeted poisoning attacks on three DL models and evaluated detection methods including spectral signatures analysis, activation clustering, and static analysis.

Result: Findings indicated that current defenses fail to reliably detect triggerless poisoning attacks, suffering from both false positives and negatives.

Conclusion: More robust and trigger-independent defenses are necessary to ensure secure AI-assisted code generation against stealthy poisoning threats.

Abstract: Deep learning (DL) models for natural language-to-code generation have become
integral to modern software development pipelines. However, their heavy
reliance on large amounts of data, often collected from unsanitized online
sources, exposes them to data poisoning attacks, where adversaries inject
malicious samples to subtly bias model behavior. Recent targeted attacks
silently replace secure code with semantically equivalent but vulnerable
implementations without relying on explicit triggers to launch the attack,
making it especially hard for detection methods to distinguish clean from
poisoned samples. We present a systematic study on the effectiveness of
existing poisoning detection methods under this stealthy threat model.
Specifically, we perform targeted poisoning on three DL models (CodeBERT,
CodeT5+, AST-T5), and evaluate spectral signatures analysis, activation
clustering, and static analysis as defenses. Our results show that all methods
struggle to detect triggerless poisoning, with representation-based approaches
failing to isolate poisoned samples and static analysis suffering false
positives and false negatives, highlighting the need for more robust,
trigger-independent defenses for AI-assisted code generation.

TL;DR: The paper introduces zkLoRA, a framework combining LoRA fine-tuning and zero-knowledge proofs to ensure secure and efficient fine-tuning of large language models in untrusted environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the computational and security challenges in fine-tuning LLMs, especially ensuring correctness and privacy in untrusted environments while maintaining efficiency.

Method: Integrate Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) for parameter-efficient fine-tuning with zero-knowledge proofs using advanced cryptographic techniques to verify computations during the fine-tuning process.

Result: zkLoRA provides end-to-end verifiability for LoRA fine-tuning while safeguarding the privacy of parameters and data, demonstrated successfully on open-source LLMs with up to 13 billion parameters.

Conclusion: zkLoRA bridges the gap between secure and efficient fine-tuning of LLMs, making it a practical solution for deployment in sensitive or untrusted scenarios.

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) is crucial for adapting them to
specific tasks, yet it remains computationally demanding and raises concerns
about correctness and privacy, particularly in untrusted environments. Although
parameter-efficient methods like Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) significantly
reduce resource requirements, ensuring the security and verifiability of
fine-tuning under zero-knowledge constraints remains an unresolved challenge.
To address this, we introduce zkLoRA, the first framework to integrate LoRA
fine-tuning with zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs), achieving provable security and
correctness. zkLoRA employs advanced cryptographic techniques -- such as lookup
arguments, sumcheck protocols, and polynomial commitments -- to verify both
arithmetic and non-arithmetic operations in Transformer-based architectures.
The framework provides end-to-end verifiability for forward propagation,
backward propagation, and parameter updates during LoRA fine-tuning, while
safeguarding the privacy of model parameters and training data. Leveraging
GPU-based implementations, zkLoRA demonstrates practicality and efficiency
through experimental validation on open-source LLMs like LLaMA, scaling up to
13 billion parameters. By combining parameter-efficient fine-tuning with ZKPs,
zkLoRA bridges a critical gap, enabling secure and trustworthy deployment of
LLMs in sensitive or untrusted environments.

TL;DR: The paper addresses model stealing attacks on machine learning services, standardizes attack design and evaluations, and establishes a generic methodology for comparison and evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Model stealing attacks threaten the confidentiality of machine learning models and violate intellectual property, yet design and evaluation approaches for these attacks are not standardized.

Method: The study focuses on image classification models, proposing a comprehensive threat model, developing a framework for attack comparison, analyzing prior setups, and providing recommendations for attack evaluation.

Result: The paper presents best practices for all stages of attack development and an extensive list of open research questions, creating a standardized methodology for assessing progress in model stealing attacks.

Conclusion: The work provides the first generic evaluation framework for model stealing attacks, contributing to more structured research and transferable insights across problem domains.

Abstract: Model stealing attacks endanger the confidentiality of machine learning
models offered as a service. Although these models are kept secret, a malicious
party can query a model to label data samples and train their own substitute
model, violating intellectual property. While novel attacks in the field are
continually being published, their design and evaluations are not standardised,
making it challenging to compare prior works and assess progress in the field.
This paper is the first to address this gap by providing recommendations for
designing and evaluating model stealing attacks. To this end, we study the
largest group of attacks that rely on training a substitute model -- those
attacking image classification models. We propose the first comprehensive
threat model and develop a framework for attack comparison. Further, we analyse
attack setups from related works to understand which tasks and models have been
studied the most. Based on our findings, we present best practices for attack
development before, during, and beyond experiments and derive an extensive list
of open research questions regarding the evaluation of model stealing attacks.
Our findings and recommendations also transfer to other problem domains, hence
establishing the first generic evaluation methodology for model stealing
attacks.

### [260] [OptMark: Robust Multi-bit Diffusion Watermarking via Inference Time Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21727)
*Jiazheng Xing,Hai Ci,Hongbin Xu,Hangjie Yuan,Yong Liu,Mike Zheng Shou*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: OptMark is a robust multi-bit watermarking system for diffusion-generated images, addressing challenges in user tracking and watermark resilience through an optimization-based approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current watermarking methods for diffusion images are inadequate for large-scale user tracking or fail to withstand common image transformations and generative attacks.

Method: OptMark embeds both structural and detail watermarks at different stages of the diffusion denoising process, with customized regularization and memory-efficient adjoint gradient methods.

Result: The method achieves invisible multi-bit watermarks that are resilient to a wide range of attacks, including transformation and regeneration.

Conclusion: OptMark overcomes existing limitations, providing a comprehensive watermarking solution for robust copyright protection and user tracking in diffusion-generated images.

Abstract: Watermarking diffusion-generated images is crucial for copyright protection
and user tracking. However, current diffusion watermarking methods face
significant limitations: zero-bit watermarking systems lack the capacity for
large-scale user tracking, while multi-bit methods are highly sensitive to
certain image transformations or generative attacks, resulting in a lack of
comprehensive robustness. In this paper, we propose OptMark, an
optimization-based approach that embeds a robust multi-bit watermark into the
intermediate latents of the diffusion denoising process. OptMark strategically
inserts a structural watermark early to resist generative attacks and a detail
watermark late to withstand image transformations, with tailored regularization
terms to preserve image quality and ensure imperceptibility. To address the
challenge of memory consumption growing linearly with the number of denoising
steps during optimization, OptMark incorporates adjoint gradient methods,
reducing memory usage from O(N) to O(1). Experimental results demonstrate that
OptMark achieves invisible multi-bit watermarking while ensuring robust
resilience against valuemetric transformations, geometric transformations,
editing, and regeneration attacks.

### [261] [Data-driven Discovery of Digital Twins in Biomedical Research](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21484)
*Clémence Métayer,Annabelle Ballesta,Julien Martinelli*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: The paper reviews automated methodologies for developing biomedical digital twins from biological time series data, comparing techniques like sparse and symbolic regression across multiple challenges. Sparse regression, especially with Bayesian methods, often outperformed others, and the authors propose hybrid frameworks combining deep learning and mechanistic models for future progress.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the labor-intensive process of manually integrating diverse biological data into computational models (digital twins) and to explore the potential of automated and data-driven discovery in the field.

Method: The study reviewed methodologies such as sparse and symbolic regression to automatically infer digital twins from biological time series and evaluated them across eight biological and methodological challenges.

Result: Sparse regression, particularly with Bayesian frameworks, generally performed better in tackling the identified challenges. Deep learning and large language models show potential for integrating prior knowledge but require reliability improvements.

Conclusion: The authors argue that hybrid and modular frameworks combining reaction network-based grounding, Bayesian uncertainty quantification, and deep learning capabilities will drive future advancements. They also propose a benchmarking framework for method evaluation.

Abstract: Recent technological advances have expanded the availability of
high-throughput biological datasets, enabling the reliable design of digital
twins of biomedical systems or patients. Such computational tools represent key
reaction networks driving perturbation or drug response and can guide drug
discovery and personalized therapeutics. Yet, their development still relies on
laborious data integration by the human modeler, so that automated approaches
are critically needed. The success of data-driven system discovery in Physics,
rooted in clean datasets and well-defined governing laws, has fueled interest
in applying similar techniques in Biology, which presents unique challenges.
Here, we reviewed methodologies for automatically inferring digital twins from
biological time series, which mostly involve symbolic or sparse regression. We
evaluate algorithms according to eight biological and methodological
challenges, associated to noisy/incomplete data, multiple conditions, prior
knowledge integration, latent variables, high dimensionality, unobserved
variable derivatives, candidate library design, and uncertainty quantification.
Upon these criteria, sparse regression generally outperformed symbolic
regression, particularly when using Bayesian frameworks. We further highlight
the emerging role of deep learning and large language models, which enable
innovative prior knowledge integration, though the reliability and consistency
of such approaches must be improved. While no single method addresses all
challenges, we argue that progress in learning digital twins will come from
hybrid and modular frameworks combining chemical reaction network-based
mechanistic grounding, Bayesian uncertainty quantification, and the generative
and knowledge integration capacities of deep learning. To support their
development, we further propose a benchmarking framework to evaluate methods
across all challenges.

*Shawnak Shivakumar,Matthew Sandora*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: This paper introduces a machine learning framework, ImmunoAI, aimed at accelerating antibody discovery against human metapneumovirus by using advanced prediction models and cutting-edge structural biology tools.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Limited speed and effectiveness of traditional antibody discovery pipelines hinder rapid response to viral outbreaks like human metapneumovirus.

Method: The study employs machine learning (LightGBM regressor) trained on curated datasets of antibody-antigen complexes using thermodynamic, hydrodynamic, and 3D topological features. Additionally, AlphaFold2 was used for 3D structure prediction.

Result: The antibody search space was reduced by 89%, RMSE improved from 1.70 to 0.92 through fine-tuning, and two antibodies with picomolar affinities were identified for targeting hMPV mutation sites.

Conclusion: ImmunoAI demonstrates notable effectiveness in shortening antibody design cycles and promoting rapid, structure-based responses to viral outbreaks.

Abstract: Human metapneumovirus (hMPV) poses serious risks to pediatric, elderly, and
immunocompromised populations. Traditional antibody discovery pipelines require
10-12 months, limiting their applicability for rapid outbreak response. This
project introduces ImmunoAI, a machine learning framework that accelerates
antibody discovery by predicting high-affinity candidates using
gradient-boosted models trained on thermodynamic, hydrodynamic, and 3D
topological interface descriptors. A dataset of 213 antibody-antigen complexes
was curated to extract geometric and physicochemical features, and a LightGBM
regressor was trained to predict binding affinity with high precision. The
model reduced the antibody candidate search space by 89%, and fine-tuning on
117 SARS-CoV-2 binding pairs further reduced Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) from
1.70 to 0.92. In the absence of an experimental structure for the hMPV A2.2
variant, AlphaFold2 was used to predict its 3D structure. The fine-tuned model
identified two optimal antibodies with predicted picomolar affinities targeting
key mutation sites (G42V and E96K), making them excellent candidates for
experimental testing. In summary, ImmunoAI shortens design cycles and enables
faster, structure-informed responses to viral outbreaks.

### [263] [Population-Scale Network Embeddings Expose Educational Divides in Network Structure Related to Right-Wing Populist Voting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21236)
*Malte Lüken,Javier Garcia-Bernardo,Sreeparna Deb,Flavio Hafner,Megha Khosla*

Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: This paper presents the use of machine learning to create interpretable network embeddings from population-scale Dutch registry data, highlighting their limited but interesting application in predicting right-wing populist voting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The researchers aim to explore whether population-scale network embeddings, derived from contextual ties such as family, school, and work, can provide meaningful insights and predictions, particularly in political behavior like right-wing populist voting.

Method: They created numerical embeddings for the entire Dutch population based on five shared contexts using machine learning. The performance of these embeddings in predicting right-wing populist voting was assessed and further refined by sparsifying and orthogonalizing the embedding dimensions.

Result: Embeddings alone performed above chance and slightly improved predictions when combined with individual characteristics. A specific sparse and orthogonalized embedding dimension showed strong association with right-wing populist voting, linked to network structures in education and school ties.

Conclusion: This study advances methodological understanding of population-scale network embeddings and highlights their potential in understanding societal phenomena, emphasizing differences in educational network structures associated with right-wing populist voting.

Abstract: Administrative registry data can be used to construct population-scale
networks whose ties reflect shared social contexts between persons. With
machine learning, such networks can be encoded into numerical representations
-- embeddings -- that automatically capture individuals' position within the
network. We created embeddings for all persons in the Dutch population from a
population-scale network that represents five shared contexts: neighborhood,
work, family, household, and school. To assess the informativeness of these
embeddings, we used them to predict right-wing populist voting. Embeddings
alone predicted right-wing populist voting above chance-level but performed
worse than individual characteristics. Combining the best subset of embeddings
with individual characteristics only slightly improved predictions. However,
after transforming the embeddings to make their dimensions more sparse and
orthogonal, we found that one embedding dimension was strongly associated with
the outcome. Mapping this dimension back to the population network revealed
differences in network structure related to right-wing populist voting between
different school ties and achieved education levels. Our study contributes
methodologically by demonstrating how population-scale network embeddings can
be made interpretable, and substantively by linking structural network
differences in education to right-wing populist voting.

### [264] [Faster Inference of Cell Complexes from Flows via Matrix Factorization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21372)
*Til Spreuer,Josef Hoppe,Michael T. Schaub*

Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: This paper proposes a heuristic method to efficiently lift edge-flow signals on a graph to sparse gradient and curl representations using cell complexes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to handle the challenge of representing edge-flow signals on graphs as sparse combinations of gradient and curl flows, addressing both computational efficiency and interpretability.

Method: They develop a matrix-factorization-based heuristic to augment graphs with 2-cells, enabling sparse representations using the Hodge Laplacian eigenvectors.

Result: Their approach is computationally faster than prior heuristics and achieves comparable performance, even outperforming these methods in noisy settings.

Conclusion: The proposed heuristic balances computational efficiency and representation quality, making it valuable in noisy conditions when compared with previous methods.

Abstract: We consider the following inference problem: Given a set of edge-flow signals
observed on a graph, lift the graph to a cell complex, such that the observed
edge-flow signals can be represented as a sparse combination of gradient and
curl flows on the cell complex. Specifically, we aim to augment the observed
graph by a set of 2-cells (polygons encircled by closed, non-intersecting
paths), such that the eigenvectors of the Hodge Laplacian of the associated
cell complex provide a sparse, interpretable representation of the observed
edge flows on the graph. As it has been shown that the general problem is
NP-hard in prior work, we here develop a novel matrix-factorization-based
heuristic to solve the problem. Using computational experiments, we demonstrate
that our new approach is significantly less computationally expensive than
prior heuristics, while achieving only marginally worse performance in most
settings. In fact, we find that for specifically noisy settings, our new
approach outperforms the previous state of the art in both solution quality and
computational speed.

*Vanessa Figueiredo*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: This study examines how Brazilian children (ages 9-11) interact with conversational agents (CAs) for education and entertainment, and evaluates structured scaffolds to improve these interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and improve the integration of conversational agents into children's learning and entertainment experiences.

Method: The paper conducted two studies: (1) a seven-week investigation analyzing children's interactive patterns with CAs using interviews and Cognitive Work Analysis; (2) testing scaffolding methods via 1,200 simulated child-CA exchanges with GPT-4o-mini.

Result: The structured recipe-based scaffolds produced better readability, diverse questioning, depth, and coherence compared to unstructured interactions.

Conclusion: Structured scaffolds and design enhancements can significantly improve children’s interaction with conversational agents for enriched educational and entertainment experiences.

Abstract: This paper presents two studies on how Brazilian children (ages 9--11) use
conversational agents (CAs) for schoolwork, discovery, and entertainment, and
how structured scaffolds can enhance these interactions. In Study 1, a
seven-week online investigation with 23 participants (children, parents,
teachers) employed interviews, observations, and Cognitive Work Analysis to map
children's information-processing flows, the role of more knowledgeable others,
functional uses, contextual goals, and interaction patterns to inform
conversation-tree design. We identified three CA functions: School, Discovery,
Entertainment, and derived ``recipe'' scaffolds mirroring parent-child support.
In Study 2, we prompted GPT-4o-mini on 1,200 simulated child-CA exchanges,
comparing conversation-tree recipes based on structured-prompting to an
unstructured baseline. Quantitative evaluation of readability, question
count/depth/diversity, and coherence revealed gains for the recipe approach.
Building on these findings, we offer design recommendations: scaffolded
conversation-trees, child-dedicated profiles for personalized context, and
caregiver-curated content. Our contributions include the first CWA application
with Brazilian children, an empirical framework of child-CA information flows,
and an LLM-scaffolding ``recipe'' (i.e., structured-prompting) for effective,
scaffolded learning.

*Yi-Hao Peng,Dingzeyu Li,Jeffrey P. Bigham,Amy Pavel*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: Morae, a UI agent designed for blind and low-vision users, integrates decision-making pauses during task execution to enhance user agency and task success.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current UI agents reduce user agency by automatically completing tasks without involving users in key decisions, leading to mismatched choices.

Method: Morae uses large multimodal models to interpret user queries, UI code, and screenshots, then prompts users for clarification during decision points.

Result: In real-world web tasks, Morae enabled BLV users to complete more tasks and make better preference-aligned choices compared to baseline agents.

Conclusion: The mixed-initiative approach of Morae combines automation with user interaction, empowering BLV users to express preferences while benefiting from UI agent support.

Abstract: User interface (UI) agents promise to make inaccessible or complex UIs easier
to access for blind and low-vision (BLV) users. However, current UI agents
typically perform tasks end-to-end without involving users in critical choices
or making them aware of important contextual information, thus reducing user
agency. For example, in our field study, a BLV participant asked to buy the
cheapest available sparkling water, and the agent automatically chose one from
several equally priced options, without mentioning alternative products with
different flavors or better ratings. To address this problem, we introduce
Morae, a UI agent that automatically identifies decision points during task
execution and pauses so that users can make choices. Morae uses large
multimodal models to interpret user queries alongside UI code and screenshots,
and prompt users for clarification when there is a choice to be made. In a
study over real-world web tasks with BLV participants, Morae helped users
complete more tasks and select options that better matched their preferences,
as compared to baseline agents, including OpenAI Operator. More broadly, this
work exemplifies a mixed-initiative approach in which users benefit from the
automation of UI agents while being able to express their preferences.

*Maya Guhan,Meghan E. Hurley,Eric A. Storch,John Herrington,Casey Zampella,Julia Parish-Morris,Gabriel Lázaro-Muñoz,Kristin Kostick-Quenet*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: This paper explores design priorities for AI-based computer perception tools in clinical workflows, emphasizing user acceptability, trustworthiness, and ethical responsibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to understand how developers can balance clinical utility, user trust, and ethical considerations when designing AI-based tools for healthcare.

Method: In-depth thematic analysis of 20 interviews with developers of AI-based computer perception tools to identify design priorities.

Result: Identified four design priorities: explainability, workflow alignment, stakeholder customization, and innovation while adhering to established paradigms.

Conclusion: Developers need to act as ethical stewards, balancing technological innovation with user and clinician needs, requiring collaboration across disciplines for integration.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI)-based computer perception (CP) technologies use
mobile sensors to collect behavioral and physiological data for clinical
decision-making. These tools can reshape how clinical knowledge is generated
and interpreted. However, effective integration of these tools into clinical
workflows depends on how developers balance clinical utility with user
acceptability and trustworthiness. Our study presents findings from 20 in-depth
interviews with developers of AI-based CP tools. Interviews were transcribed
and inductive, thematic analysis was performed to identify 4 key design
priorities: 1) to account for context and ensure explainability for both
patients and clinicians; 2) align tools with existing clinical workflows; 3)
appropriately customize to relevant stakeholders for usability and
acceptability; and 4) push the boundaries of innovation while aligning with
established paradigms. Our findings highlight that developers view themselves
as not merely technical architects but also ethical stewards, designing tools
that are both acceptable by users and epistemically responsible (prioritizing
objectivity and pushing clinical knowledge forward). We offer the following
suggestions to help achieve this balance: documenting how design choices around
customization are made, defining limits for customization choices,
transparently conveying information about outputs, and investing in user
training. Achieving these goals will require interdisciplinary collaboration
between developers, clinicians, and ethicists.

*Kevin Putra Santoso,Rizka Wakhidatus Sholikah,Raden Venantius Hari Ginardi*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: This paper presents WaveLLDM, a lightweight latent diffusion model for audio restoration and denoising, demonstrating reduced computational complexity but underperforming in perceptual quality compared to state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Degradation in audio due to noise, compression, and transmission artifacts poses significant challenges in many applications. Existing diffusion models are computationally demanding and face limitations with long missing segments.

Method: WaveLLDM combines an efficient neural audio codec with latent diffusion, operating in a compressed latent space instead of the time or spectral domain to reduce computational demands while maintaining reconstruction quality.

Result: WaveLLDM achieves low Log-Spectral Distance (LSD) scores (0.48 to 0.60) and adapts well to unseen data, but falls short in perceptual quality and clarity, with WB-PESQ scores of 1.62-1.71 and STOI scores of 0.76-0.78.

Conclusion: While WaveLLDM shows promise in computational efficiency and adaptability, it requires architectural tuning, fine-tuning, and longer training to improve perceptual quality and clarity.

Abstract: High-quality audio is essential in a wide range of applications, including
online communication, virtual assistants, and the multimedia industry. However,
degradation caused by noise, compression, and transmission artifacts remains a
major challenge. While diffusion models have proven effective for audio
restoration, they typically require significant computational resources and
struggle to handle longer missing segments. This study introduces WaveLLDM
(Wave Lightweight Latent Diffusion Model), an architecture that integrates an
efficient neural audio codec with latent diffusion for audio restoration and
denoising. Unlike conventional approaches that operate in the time or spectral
domain, WaveLLDM processes audio in a compressed latent space, reducing
computational complexity while preserving reconstruction quality. Empirical
evaluations on the Voicebank+DEMAND test set demonstrate that WaveLLDM achieves
accurate spectral reconstruction with low Log-Spectral Distance (LSD) scores
(0.48 to 0.60) and good adaptability to unseen data. However, it still
underperforms compared to state-of-the-art methods in terms of perceptual
quality and speech clarity, with WB-PESQ scores ranging from 1.62 to 1.71 and
STOI scores between 0.76 and 0.78. These limitations are attributed to
suboptimal architectural tuning, the absence of fine-tuning, and insufficient
training duration. Nevertheless, the flexible architecture that combines a
neural audio codec and latent diffusion model provides a strong foundation for
future development.

*Aditya Makineni,Baocheng Geng,Qing Tian*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: This paper introduces Full-Frequency Temporal Patching (FFTP) to address inefficiencies in existing approaches in audio spectrogram classification, reducing computation and improving performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the inefficiencies of square patching in spectrogram modeling, which disrupts harmonic frequency patterns and results in excessive computational overhead.

Method: The paper proposes Full-Frequency Temporal Patching (FFTP) and SpecMask augmentation. FFTP optimizes the patching strategy to align with the time-frequency asymmetry in spectrograms, reducing patch count. SpecMask enhances temporal robustness through targeted masking under a fixed budget.

Result: Improvements of up to +6.76 mAP on AudioSet-18k and +8.46 accuracy on SpeechCommandsV2, along with a computational reduction of up to 83.26%.

Conclusion: This approach strikes a balance between efficiency and performance in handling spectrograms, demonstrating the effectiveness of FFTP and SpecMask in audio classification tasks.

Abstract: Transformers and State-Space Models (SSMs) have advanced audio classification
by modeling spectrograms as sequences of patches. However, existing models such
as the Audio Spectrogram Transformer (AST) and Audio Mamba (AuM) adopt square
patching from computer vision, which disrupts continuous frequency patterns and
produces an excessive number of patches, slowing training, and increasing
computation. We propose Full-Frequency Temporal Patching (FFTP), a patching
strategy that better matches the time-frequency asymmetry of spectrograms by
spanning full frequency bands with localized temporal context, preserving
harmonic structure, and significantly reducing patch count and computation. We
also introduce SpecMask, a patch-aligned spectrogram augmentation that combines
full-frequency and localized time-frequency masks under a fixed masking budget,
enhancing temporal robustness while preserving spectral continuity. When
applied on both AST and AuM, our patching method with SpecMask improves mAP by
up to +6.76 on AudioSet-18k and accuracy by up to +8.46 on SpeechCommandsV2,
while reducing computation by up to 83.26%, demonstrating both performance and
efficiency gains.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper introduces an advanced vibration sensor system to address remote dementia caregiving, focusing on scalable solutions for privacy-preserving activity recognition with minimal labeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper acknowledges the growing need for efficient remote caregiving solutions as one in four individuals with dementia live alone, posing challenges for distant family caregivers.

Method: It proposes using synthesized near-surface acoustic audio data for pretraining a vibration sensor-based activity recognition model. The model is fine-tuned using limited labeled data for deployment in real-world environments.

Result: The developed framework successfully demonstrates scalability and robustness in tracking daily routines with minimal labeling requirements.

Conclusion: The solution reduces data-labeling demands and paves the way for privacy-preserving, generalizable remote activity monitoring in dementia caregiving contexts.

Abstract: One in four people dementia live alone, leading family members to take on
caregiving roles from a distance. Many researchers have developed remote
monitoring solutions to lessen caregiving needs; however, limitations remain
including privacy preserving solutions, activity recognition, and model
generalizability to new users and environments. Structural vibration sensor
systems are unobtrusive solutions that have been proven to accurately monitor
human information, such as identification and activity recognition, in
controlled settings by sensing surface vibrations generated by activities.
However, when deploying in an end user's home, current solutions require a
substantial amount of labeled data for accurate activity recognition. Our
scalable solution adapts synthesized data from near-surface acoustic audio to
pretrain a model and allows fine tuning with very limited data in order to
create a robust framework for daily routine tracking.

### [272] [DRASP: A Dual-Resolution Attentive Statistics Pooling Framework for Automatic MOS Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21407)
*Cheng-Yeh Yang,Kuan-Tang Huang,Chien-Chun Wang,Hung-Shin Lee,Hsin-Min Wang,Berlin Chen*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper introduces Dual-Resolution Attentive Statistics Pooling (DRASP), which enhances mean opinion score (MOS) prediction by combining global statistical summaries and local attentive analyses into a unified framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing pooling methods for MOS prediction either focus globally or locally, often missing complementary perceptual information, leading to less robust representations of speech quality.

Method: The DRASP framework combines coarse-grained global statistical summaries with fine-grained attentive analyses of perceptually important segments to create a robust dual-resolution representation.

Result: Experiments show DRASP consistently outperforming baseline methods across datasets, prediction backbones, and audio systems, with a relative improvement of 10.39% in system-level SRCC compared to average pooling.

Conclusion: DRASP demonstrates a strong generalization capability and effectiveness in modeling speech quality by leveraging dual-resolution pooling, making it superior to traditional pooling mechanisms.

Abstract: A pooling mechanism is essential for mean opinion score (MOS) prediction,
facilitating the transformation of variable-length audio features into a
concise fixed-size representation that effectively encodes speech quality.
Existing pooling methods typically operate at a singular granularity,
concentrating either on a comprehensive global perspective or a detailed
frame-level analysis, which may overlook complementary perceptual insights. To
address this limitation, we introduce the Dual-Resolution Attentive Statistics
Pooling (DRASP) framework. DRASP integrates both coarse-grained, global
statistical summaries and fine-grained, attentive analyses of perceptually
significant segments. This dual-view architecture empowers our model to
formulate a more thorough and robust representation, capturing both the
overarching structural context and salient local details concurrently.
Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness and strong generalization
ability of the proposed framework. It consistently outperforms various baseline
methods across diverse datasets (MusicEval and AES-Natural), MOS prediction
backbones (including a CLAP-based model and AudioBox-Aesthetics), and different
audio generation systems, achieving a relative improvement of 10.39% in
system-level Spearman's rank correlation coefficient (SRCC) over the
widely-used average pooling approach.

*Anna Geißler,Luca-Sophie Bien,Friedrich Schöppler,Tobias Hertel*

Main category: physics.ed-ph

TL;DR: The paper presents an evaluation of Large Language Models (LLMs) for undergraduate thermodynamics tutoring and finds them inadequate for unsupervised use, achieving up to 82% accuracy but failing at complex tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to assess the reliability of LLMs in offering unsupervised tutoring in science education, focusing on their ability to follow principle-grounded reasoning.

Method: A benchmark called UTQA was created, featuring 50 thermodynamics questions to test LLMs' accuracy in a variety of scenarios, including diagram interpretation and understanding of irreversible processes.

Result: No LLM evaluated achieved the 95% competence threshold. Text-based questions were moderately well-answered (up to 82% accuracy), but models performed poorly on image-based reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: Current LLMs lack the capacity for unsupervised tutoring in thermodynamics, particularly for irreversible processes and visual-feature binding, necessitating future improvements.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly considered as tutoring aids in
science education. Yet their readiness for unsupervised use in undergraduate
instruction remains uncertain, as reliable teaching requires more than fluent
recall: it demands consistent, principle-grounded reasoning. Thermodynamics,
with its compact laws and subtle distinctions between state and path functions,
reversibility, and entropy, provides an ideal testbed for evaluating such
capabilities. Here we present UTQA, a 50-item undergraduate thermodynamics
question answering benchmark, covering ideal-gas processes, reversibility, and
diagram interpretation. No leading 2025-era model exceeded our 95\% competence
threshold: the best LLMs achieved 82\% accuracy, with text-only items
performing better than image reasoning tasks, which often fell to chance
levels. Prompt phrasing and syntactic complexity showed modest to little
correlation with performance. The gap concentrates in finite-rate/irreversible
scenarios and in binding visual features to thermodynamic meaning, indicating
that current LLMs are not yet suitable for unsupervised tutoring in this
domain.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: This paper proposes the Sequential Matched Filter (SMF), replacing conventional filters with a sequence designed by a Reinforcement Learning agent, improving signal detection in noisy environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The effectiveness of matched filters declines for low signal-to-noise ratio signals, such as those found in ear-ECGs, where the noise closely resembles the target patterns.

Method: Filter design is treated as a sequential decision-making process, with Reinforcement Learning employed to adaptively create signal-specific filter sequences.

Result: The SMF achieved state-of-the-art performance for R-peak detection and physiological state classification on two real-world ECG datasets.

Conclusion: The SMF framework is not only reliable and interpretable for clinical decision-making but also extendable to other pattern localisation applications involving noise-corrupted signals.

Abstract: Matched filters are widely used to localise signal patterns due to their high
efficiency and interpretability. However, their effectiveness deteriorates for
low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) signals, such as those recorded on edge
devices, where prominent noise patterns can closely resemble the target within
the limited length of the filter. One example is the ear-electrocardiogram
(ear-ECG), where the cardiac signal is attenuated and heavily corrupted by
artefacts. To address this, we propose the Sequential Matched Filter (SMF), a
paradigm that replaces the conventional single matched filter with a sequence
of filters designed by a Reinforcement Learning agent. By formulating filter
design as a sequential decision-making process, SMF adaptively design
signal-specific filter sequences that remain fully interpretable by revealing
key patterns driving the decision-making. The proposed SMF framework has strong
potential for reliable and interpretable clinical decision support, as
demonstrated by its state-of-the-art R-peak detection and physiological state
classification performance on two challenging real-world ECG datasets. The
proposed formulation can also be extended to a broad range of applications that
require accurate pattern localisation from noise-corrupted signals.
