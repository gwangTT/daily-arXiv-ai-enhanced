### [1] [Contextual Integrity in LLMs via Reasoning and Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04245)
*Guangchen Lan,Huseyin A. Inan,Sahar Abdelnabi,Janardhan Kulkarni,Lukas Wutschitz,Reza Shokri,Christopher G. Brinton,Robert Sim*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of ensuring contextual integrity (CI) in autonomous agents by integrating reasoning and reinforcement learning to prevent inappropriate information disclosure while maintaining task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle the issue of inappropriate information disclosure by autonomous agents, ensuring they can reason about context and adhere to CI principles during decision-making tasks.

Method: They prompt Large Language Models (LLMs) to reason explicitly about CI, then develop a reinforcement learning framework and use a synthetic dataset of ~700 examples for training.

Result: The method significantly reduces inappropriate information disclosure and maintains task performance, with improvements transferring effectively to CI benchmarks like PrivacyLens.

Conclusion: Integrating CI reasoning with reinforcement learning can train autonomous agents to make context-aware decisions, ensuring privacy and effective task execution.

Abstract: As the era of autonomous agents making decisions on behalf of users unfolds,
ensuring contextual integrity (CI) -- what is the appropriate information to
share while carrying out a certain task -- becomes a central question to the
field. We posit that CI demands a form of reasoning where the agent needs to
reason about the context in which it is operating. To test this, we first
prompt LLMs to reason explicitly about CI when deciding what information to
disclose. We then extend this approach by developing a reinforcement learning
(RL) framework that further instills in models the reasoning necessary to
achieve CI. Using a synthetic, automatically created, dataset of only $\sim700$
examples but with diverse contexts and information disclosure norms, we show
that our method substantially reduces inappropriate information disclosure
while maintaining task performance across multiple model sizes and families.
Importantly, improvements transfer from this synthetic dataset to established
CI benchmarks such as PrivacyLens that has human annotations and evaluates
privacy leakage of AI assistants in actions and tool calls.

### [2] [A Graph-Retrieval-Augmented Generation Framework Enhances Decision-Making in the Circular Economy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04252)
*Yang Zhao,Chengxiao Dai,Dusit Niyato,Chuan Fu Tan,Keyi Xiang,Yueyang Wang,Zhiquan Yeo,Daren Tan Zong Loong,Jonathan Low Zhaozhi,Eugene H. Z. HO*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CircuGraphRAG: A retrieval-augmented generation framework grounded in a circular economy knowledge graph for accurate industrial code and emission factor reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the issue of hallucination in LLMs when handling industrial codes and emission factors, which can negatively impact regulatory and investment decisions in sustainable manufacturing.

Method: The authors introduce CircuGraphRAG, a RAG framework that utilizes a domain-specific knowledge graph containing industrial entities, waste classification codes, and GWP100 emission data. Queries are translated to SPARQL to ensure traceable and accurate retrieval and reasoning.

Result: CircuGraphRAG outperforms standalone LLMs and naive RAG implementations, achieving high ROUGE-L F1 scores of up to 1.0 and improving efficiency by reducing response time and token usage.

Conclusion: This framework advances reliable resource decision-making in the circular economy by offering accurate, traceable, and efficiency-enhanced insights for low-carbon planning.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) hold promise for sustainable manufacturing, but
often hallucinate industrial codes and emission factors, undermining regulatory
and investment decisions. We introduce CircuGraphRAG, a retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG) framework that grounds LLMs outputs in a domain-specific
knowledge graph for the circular economy. This graph connects 117,380
industrial and waste entities with classification codes and GWP100 emission
data, enabling structured multi-hop reasoning. Natural language queries are
translated into SPARQL and verified subgraphs are retrieved to ensure accuracy
and traceability. Compared with Standalone LLMs and Naive RAG, CircuGraphRAG
achieves superior performance in single-hop and multi-hop question answering,
with ROUGE-L F1 scores up to 1.0, while baseline scores below 0.08. It also
improves efficiency, halving the response time and reducing token usage by 16%
in representative tasks. CircuGraphRAG provides fact-checked, regulatory-ready
support for circular economy planning, advancing reliable, low-carbon resource
decision making.

### [3] [Matter-of-Fact: A Benchmark for Verifying the Feasibility of Literature-Supported Claims in Materials Science](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04410)
*Peter Jansen,Samiah Hassan,Ruoyao Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Matter-of-Fact, a dataset to assess hypothesis feasibility in automated scientific discovery, and highlights the challenges current models face in solving this task.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the high costs of running large-scale automated experiments by filtering hypotheses based on feasibility, which can increase both efficiency and discovery potential.

Method: The authors create the Matter-of-Fact dataset, comprising 8.4k claims from materials science literature, and evaluate strong baselines involving retrieval-augmented generation and code generation models.

Result: Current models achieved a maximum performance of 72% on the feasibility task, while domain-expert verification found nearly all claims solvable, illustrating the difficulty of the dataset for existing methods.

Conclusion: The study emphasizes the need to improve existing models to better filter feasible hypotheses, which could significantly accelerate scientific discovery efforts.

Abstract: Contemporary approaches to assisted scientific discovery use language models
to automatically generate large numbers of potential hypothesis to test, while
also automatically generating code-based experiments to test those hypotheses.
While hypotheses can be comparatively inexpensive to generate, automated
experiments can be costly, particularly when run at scale (i.e. thousands of
experiments). Developing the capacity to filter hypotheses based on their
feasibility would allow discovery systems to run at scale, while increasing
their likelihood of making significant discoveries. In this work we introduce
Matter-of-Fact, a challenge dataset for determining the feasibility of
hypotheses framed as claims. Matter-of-Fact includes 8.4k claims extracted from
scientific articles spanning four high-impact contemporary materials science
topics, including superconductors, semiconductors, batteries, and aerospace
materials, while including qualitative and quantitative claims from
theoretical, experimental, and code/simulation results. We show that strong
baselines that include retrieval augmented generation over scientific
literature and code generation fail to exceed 72% performance on this task
(chance performance is 50%), while domain-expert verification suggests nearly
all are solvable -- highlighting both the difficulty of this task for current
models, and the potential to accelerate scientific discovery by making
near-term progress.

### [4] [Evaluation is All You Need: Strategic Overclaiming of LLM Reasoning Capabilities Through Evaluation Design](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04734)
*Lin Sun,Weihong Lin,Jinzhu Wu,Yongfu Zhu,Xiaoqi Jian,Guangxiang Zhao,Change Jia,Linglin Zhang,Sai-er Hu,Yuhan Wu,Xiangzheng Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper critiques the Deepseek-R1-Distill models, highlighting performance fluctuations due to varying evaluation conditions, and calls for stricter benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the reliability issues in the performance assessments of popular reasoning models, ensuring that their claimed improvements are reproducible.

Method: The authors analyzed the evaluation results of Deepseek-R1-Distill models and other related models, studying their consistency under varying conditions.

Result: Significant fluctuations in benchmark results were discovered for Deepseek-R1-Distill and similar models, questioning the reliability of their performance claims.

Conclusion: The paper suggests the necessity of a rigorous evaluation paradigm to eliminate inconsistencies and improve reliability in reasoning model assessments.

Abstract: Reasoning models represented by the Deepseek-R1-Distill series have been
widely adopted by the open-source community due to their strong performance in
mathematics, science, programming, and other domains. However, our study
reveals that their benchmark evaluation results are subject to significant
fluctuations caused by various factors. Subtle differences in evaluation
conditions can lead to substantial variations in results. Similar phenomena are
observed in other open-source inference models fine-tuned based on the
Deepseek-R1-Distill series, as well as in the QwQ-32B model, making their
claimed performance improvements difficult to reproduce reliably. Therefore, we
advocate for the establishment of a more rigorous paradigm for model
performance evaluation and present our empirical assessments of the
Deepseek-R1-Distill series models.

### [5] [When Thinking LLMs Lie: Unveiling the Strategic Deception in Representations of Reasoning Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04909)
*Kai Wang,Yihao Zhang,Meng Sun*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper addresses the challenge of detecting and controlling strategic deception in large language models by engineering their reasoning processes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ensuring the honesty of CoT-enabled LLMs is critical for aligning these models with trustworthy AI principles, as they may exhibit intentional goal-driven misinformation.

Method: Using representation engineering and Linear Artificial Tomography (LAT), the study extracts deception vectors to induce and detect deceptive reasoning with high accuracy.

Result: Researchers achieved 89% detection accuracy for deceptive reasoning and a 40% success rate in eliciting contextual deception using activation steering.

Conclusion: The paper provides a novel approach to addressing the honesty challenges in reasoning-based LLMs, contributing tools and methods for improving AI alignment.

Abstract: The honesty of large language models (LLMs) is a critical alignment
challenge, especially as advanced systems with chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning
may strategically deceive humans. Unlike traditional honesty issues on LLMs,
which could be possibly explained as some kind of hallucination, those models'
explicit thought paths enable us to study strategic deception--goal-driven,
intentional misinformation where reasoning contradicts outputs. Using
representation engineering, we systematically induce, detect, and control such
deception in CoT-enabled LLMs, extracting "deception vectors" via Linear
Artificial Tomography (LAT) for 89% detection accuracy. Through activation
steering, we achieve a 40% success rate in eliciting context-appropriate
deception without explicit prompts, unveiling the specific honesty-related
issue of reasoning models and providing tools for trustworthy AI alignment.

### [6] [LLM-First Search: Self-Guided Exploration of the Solution Space](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05213)
*Nathan Herr,Tim Rocktäschel,Roberta Raileanu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces LLM-First Search (LFS), a self-guided search method where a large language model autonomously manages its search process without relying on fixed hyperparameters or external heuristics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing search techniques like Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) rely on fixed hyperparameters, which limit adaptability across tasks of varying complexity and make them impractical for certain applications.

Method: The authors propose LLM-First Search (LFS), where the large language model uses internal scoring mechanisms to make search decisions, enabling context-sensitive and flexible exploration without manual tuning.

Result: LFS outperforms state-of-the-art search algorithms like ToT-BFS, BestFS, and MCTS, particularly on challenging tasks, with improved computational efficiency, better scaling with stronger models, and enhanced performance with larger compute budgets.

Conclusion: LLM-First Search demonstrates greater adaptability and efficiency compared to traditional methods, establishing itself as a scalable and robust approach for reasoning tasks across various domains.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable improvements in
reasoning and planning through increased test-time compute, often by framing
problem-solving as a search process. While methods like Monte Carlo Tree Search
(MCTS) have proven effective in some domains, their reliance on fixed
exploration hyperparameters limits their adaptability across tasks of varying
difficulty, rendering them impractical or expensive in certain settings. In
this paper, we propose \textbf{LLM-First Search (LFS)}, a novel \textit{LLM
Self-Guided Search} method that removes the need for pre-defined search
strategies by empowering the LLM to autonomously control the search process via
self-guided exploration. Rather than relying on external heuristics or
hardcoded policies, the LLM evaluates whether to pursue the current search path
or explore alternative branches based on its internal scoring mechanisms. This
enables more flexible and context-sensitive reasoning without requiring manual
tuning or task-specific adaptation. We evaluate LFS on Countdown and Sudoku
against three classic widely-used search algorithms, Tree-of-Thoughts' Breadth
First Search (ToT-BFS), Best First Search (BestFS), and MCTS, each of which
have been used to achieve SotA results on a range of challenging reasoning
tasks. We found that LFS (1) performs better on more challenging tasks without
additional tuning, (2) is more computationally efficient compared to the other
methods, especially when powered by a stronger model, (3) scales better with
stronger models, due to its LLM-First design, and (4) scales better with
increased compute budget. Our code is publicly available at

### [7] [Ontology-based knowledge representation for bone disease diagnosis: a foundation for safe and sustainable medical artificial intelligence systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04756)
*Loan Dao,Ngoc Quoc Ly*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces an ontology-based framework for bone disease diagnosis, integrating systematic domain expertise and leveraging multimodal AI techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address gaps in medical AI systems that often lack structured domain knowledge, impacting diagnostic reliability.

Method: The framework incorporates a hierarchical neural network guided by bone disease ontology, ontology-enhanced Visual Question Answering, and a multimodal deep learning model that integrates diverse data types using ontology principles.

Result: Theoretical contributions are established, but experimental validation is pending due to dataset and resource limitations.

Conclusion: The framework offers potential for extensibility beyond bone diseases, with reusability and standardization as core strengths. Future work will focus on dataset expansion and thorough validation.

Abstract: Medical artificial intelligence (AI) systems frequently lack systematic
domain expertise integration, potentially compromising diagnostic reliability.
This study presents an ontology-based framework for bone disease diagnosis,
developed in collaboration with Ho Chi Minh City Hospital for Traumatology and
Orthopedics. The framework introduces three theoretical contributions: (1) a
hierarchical neural network architecture guided by bone disease ontology for
segmentation-classification tasks, incorporating Visual Language Models (VLMs)
through prompts, (2) an ontology-enhanced Visual Question Answering (VQA)
system for clinical reasoning, and (3) a multimodal deep learning model that
integrates imaging, clinical, and laboratory data through ontological
relationships. The methodology maintains clinical interpretability through
systematic knowledge digitization, standardized medical terminology mapping,
and modular architecture design. The framework demonstrates potential for
extension beyond bone diseases through its standardized structure and reusable
components. While theoretical foundations are established, experimental
validation remains pending due to current dataset and computational resource
limitations. Future work will focus on expanding the clinical dataset and
conducting comprehensive system validation.

### [8] [Zero-Shot Adaptation of Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning in Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04244)
*Farzad Farhadzadeh,Debasmit Das,Shubhankar Borse,Fatih Porikli*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ProLoRA enables zero-shot transfer of low-rank adjustments (LoRA) between text-to-image models without retraining, using a novel projection mechanism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Adapting low-rank adjustments between models traditionally requires retraining, presenting challenges due to data constraints. The authors aim to remove this bottleneck while maintaining performance.

Method: ProLoRA projects source model adjustments into the target model's weight space by leveraging similarities in subspace and null space, focusing on aligned layers.

Result: Experiments demonstrate successful knowledge transfer and performance on text-to-image models comparable to retraining, without the need for additional training data.

Conclusion: ProLoRA offers a parameter-efficient and data-independent approach to adapt models in text-to-image generation, addressing significant retraining challenges.

Abstract: We introduce ProLoRA, enabling zero-shot adaptation of parameter-efficient
fine-tuning in text-to-image diffusion models. ProLoRA transfers pre-trained
low-rank adjustments (e.g., LoRA) from a source to a target model without
additional training data. This overcomes the limitations of traditional methods
that require retraining when switching base models, often challenging due to
data constraints. ProLoRA achieves this via projection of source adjustments
into the target model's weight space, leveraging subspace and null space
similarities and selectively targeting aligned layers. Evaluations on
established text-to-image models demonstrate successful knowledge transfer and
comparable performance without retraining.

### [9] [Language-Guided Multi-Agent Learning in Simulations: A Unified Framework and Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04251)
*Zhengyang Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper presents a framework called LLM-MARL, using large language models to improve multi-agent reinforcement learning through components like subgoal generation, communication, and memory to enhance performance and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To integrate large language models into multi-agent reinforcement learning for better coordination, communication, and adaptability in simulated environments.

Method: The framework employs a modular design (Coordinator, Communicator, Memory) with subgoal generation, symbolic communication, and episodic recall, training agents using language-conditioned loss and gated LLM queries.

Result: Experiments in game environments demonstrate superior win rate, coordination score, and generalization compared to traditional methods like MAPPO and QMIX. Key components like language-based messaging proved impactful.

Conclusion: This work bridges language modeling and policy learning to advance the design of intelligent cooperative agents, enabling better training, gaming, and human-AI collaboration in multi-agent systems.

Abstract: This paper introduces LLM-MARL, a unified framework that incorporates large
language models (LLMs) into multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to
enhance coordination, communication, and generalization in simulated game
environments. The framework features three modular components of Coordinator,
Communicator, and Memory, which dynamically generate subgoals, facilitate
symbolic inter-agent messaging, and support episodic recall. Training combines
PPO with a language-conditioned loss and LLM query gating. LLM-MARL is
evaluated in Google Research Football, MAgent Battle, and StarCraft II. Results
show consistent improvements over MAPPO and QMIX in win rate, coordination
score, and zero-shot generalization. Ablation studies demonstrate that subgoal
generation and language-based messaging each contribute significantly to
performance gains. Qualitative analysis reveals emergent behaviors such as role
specialization and communication-driven tactics. By bridging language modeling
and policy learning, this work contributes to the design of intelligent,
cooperative agents in interactive simulations. It offers a path forward for
leveraging LLMs in multi-agent systems used for training, games, and human-AI
collaboration.

### [10] [HADA: Human-AI Agent Decision Alignment Architecture](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04253)
*Tapio Pitkäranta,Leena Pitkäranta*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HADA is a framework-agnostic architecture that aligns AI/LLM agents with organizational values through stakeholder-specific conversational APIs, enabling transparent and ethical decision-making.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of aligning AI systems, especially LLMs and algorithms, with organizational goals, values, and ethical considerations to maintain transparency and trust.

Method: It develops HADA as a reference architecture that incorporates stakeholder agents with conversational APIs for alignment. These APIs allow querying, steering, auditing, and contesting decisions, while organizational KPIs and constraints are tracked and logged during decision-making processes.

Result: The cloud-native implementation in a credit-scoring model demonstrated that HADA successfully meets predefined objectives, ensuring alignment, traceability, and ethical compliance across multi-agent systems.

Conclusion: HADA enables improved decision accuracy, transparency, and ethical compliance by allowing diverse stakeholders to interact with and control AI/LLM agents, making it an effective solution for human-AI alignment in business environments.

Abstract: We present HADA (Human-AI Agent Decision Alignment), a protocol- and
framework agnostic reference architecture that keeps both large language model
(LLM) agents and legacy algorithms aligned with organizational targets and
values. HADA wraps any algorithm or LLM in role-specific stakeholder agents --
business, data-science, audit, ethics, and customer -- each exposing
conversational APIs so that technical and non-technical actors can query,
steer, audit, or contest every decision across strategic, tactical, and
real-time horizons. Alignment objectives, KPIs, and value constraints are
expressed in natural language and are continuously propagated, logged, and
versioned while thousands of heterogeneous agents run on different
orchestration stacks. A cloud-native proof of concept packages a production
credit-scoring model (getLoanDecision) and deploys it on
Docker/Kubernetes/Python; five scripted retail-bank scenarios show how target
changes, parameter tweaks, explanation requests, and ethics triggers flow end
to end through the architecture. Evaluation followed the Design-Science
Research Methodology. Walkthrough observation and log inspection demonstrated
complete coverage of six predefined objectives: every role could invoke
conversational control, trace KPIs and value constraints, detect and mitigate
ZIP-code bias, and reproduce full decision lineage, independent of the
underlying LLM or agent library. Contributions: (1) an open-source HADA
architecture, (2) a mid-range design theory for human-AI alignment in
multi-agent systems, and (3) empirical evidence that framework-agnostic,
protocol-compliant stakeholder agents improve accuracy, transparency, and
ethical compliance in real-world decision pipelines.

### [11] [Automated Skill Discovery for Language Agents through Exploration and Iterative Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04287)
*Yongjin Yang,Sinjae Kang,Juyong Lee,Dongjun Lee,Se-Young Yun,Kimin Lee*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces EXIF, a framework for training LLM-powered agents to acquire skills using an exploration-first strategy, eliminating human intervention and improving agent performance iteratively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome challenges in creating training datasets for LLM agents, such as requiring human effort or generating infeasible or redundant tasks, enabling improved skill acquisition and open-ended learning.

Method: The method uses an exploration agent (Alice) to interact with the environment and create a dataset of feasible, grounded tasks. This dataset trains a target agent (Bob). An iterative feedback loop ensures Alice evaluates Bob's performance to refine subsequent data collection.

Result: EXIF successfully discovers meaningful skills, expands agent capabilities, and achieves significant performance improvements in environments like Webshop and Crafter, without human involvement.

Conclusion: EXIF demonstrates potential for building self-evolving systems, especially through iterative, automated exploration and training processes, even when using the same model for both Alice and Bob agents.

Abstract: Training large language model (LLM) agents to acquire necessary skills and
perform diverse tasks within an environment is gaining interest as a means to
enable open-endedness. However, creating the training dataset for their skill
acquisition faces several challenges. Manual trajectory collection requires
significant human effort. Another approach, where LLMs directly propose tasks
to learn, is often invalid, as the LLMs lack knowledge of which tasks are
actually feasible. Moreover, the generated data may not provide a meaningful
learning signal, as agents often already perform well on the proposed tasks. To
address this, we propose a novel automatic skill discovery framework EXIF for
LLM-powered agents, designed to improve the feasibility of generated target
behaviors while accounting for the agents' capabilities. Our method adopts an
exploration-first strategy by employing an exploration agent (Alice) to train
the target agent (Bob) to learn essential skills in the environment.
Specifically, Alice first interacts with the environment to retrospectively
generate a feasible, environment-grounded skill dataset, which is then used to
train Bob. Crucially, we incorporate an iterative feedback loop, where Alice
evaluates Bob's performance to identify areas for improvement. This feedback
then guides Alice's next round of exploration, forming a closed-loop data
generation process. Experiments on Webshop and Crafter demonstrate EXIF's
ability to effectively discover meaningful skills and iteratively expand the
capabilities of the trained agent without any human intervention, achieving
substantial performance improvements. Interestingly, we observe that setting
Alice to the same model as Bob also notably improves performance, demonstrating
EXIF's potential for building a self-evolving system.

### [12] [A Statistical Physics of Language Model Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04374)
*Jack David Carson,Amir Reisizadeh*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a statistical physics framework to understand reasoning in transformer LMs by modeling their hidden states as a stochastic dynamical system.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer LMs exhibit emergent reasoning behaviors that are not well-understood mechanistically.

Method: The authors model sentence-level hidden state trajectories using a drift-diffusion system on a lower-dimensional manifold, incorporating latent regime switches to capture diverse reasoning phases.

Result: The model shows that a rank-40 projection captures ~50% of variance and identifies four latent reasoning regimes. The SLDS model is validated to accurately represent these features.

Conclusion: The framework provides a novel, low-cost way to simulate and analyze reasoning dynamics in LMs, enabling better prediction of critical transitions and failures such as misaligned states.

Abstract: Transformer LMs show emergent reasoning that resists mechanistic
understanding. We offer a statistical physics framework for continuous-time
chain-of-thought reasoning dynamics. We model sentence-level hidden state
trajectories as a stochastic dynamical system on a lower-dimensional manifold.
This drift-diffusion system uses latent regime switching to capture diverse
reasoning phases, including misaligned states or failures. Empirical
trajectories (8 models, 7 benchmarks) show a rank-40 projection (balancing
variance capture and feasibility) explains ~50% variance. We find four latent
reasoning regimes. An SLDS model is formulated and validated to capture these
features. The framework enables low-cost reasoning simulation, offering tools
to study and predict critical transitions like misaligned states or other LM
failures.

### [13] [Plugging Schema Graph into Multi-Table QA: A Human-Guided Framework for Reducing LLM Reliance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04427)
*Xixi Wang,Miguel Costa,Jordanka Kovaceva,Shuai Wang,Francisco C. Pereira*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper presents a graph-based approach to handle multi-table Question Answering (QA) by explicitly encoding schema links and join paths, improving upon the limitations of existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods in multi-table QA struggle with schema linking and coherence in complex, real-world settings, despite progress in single-table QA.

Method: The authors propose a graph-based framework that leverages relational knowledge and includes strategies like pruning and sub-path merging to construct interpretable reasoning chains while processing natural language queries.

Result: The approach demonstrated superior performance through experiments on both benchmarks and industrial-scale datasets, marking its uniqueness in handling realistic, large-scale multi-table data.

Conclusion: The framework advances the state of multi-table QA by effectively navigating and reasoning over complex, real-world tabular data, showing promise for industrial applications.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in table Question Answering
(Table QA). However, extending these capabilities to multi-table QA remains
challenging due to unreliable schema linking across complex tables. Existing
methods based on semantic similarity work well only on simplified hand-crafted
datasets and struggle to handle complex, real-world scenarios with numerous and
diverse columns. To address this, we propose a graph-based framework that
leverages human-curated relational knowledge to explicitly encode schema links
and join paths. Given a natural language query, our method searches this graph
to construct interpretable reasoning chains, aided by pruning and sub-path
merging strategies to enhance efficiency and coherence. Experiments on both
standard benchmarks and a realistic, large-scale dataset demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach. To our knowledge, this is the first multi-table
QA system applied to truly complex industrial tabular data.

### [14] [An AI-Based Public Health Data Monitoring System](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04429)
*Ananya Joshi,Nolan Gormley,Richa Gadgil,Tina Townes,Roni Rosenfeld,Bryan Wilder*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a ranking-based AI anomaly detection system for monitoring public health data, demonstrating increased efficiency over traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Public health monitoring systems face challenges with high data volumes and constant threshold adjustments in alert-based methods.

Method: The authors developed a ranking-based monitoring paradigm using AI anomaly detection techniques, deploying it at a national organization.

Result: The deployed system improved monitoring objectives and achieved a 54x increase in reviewer efficiency during a three-month evaluation.

Conclusion: Human-centered AI has transformative potential for improving public health decision-making processes.

Abstract: Public health experts need scalable approaches to monitor large volumes of
health data (e.g., cases, hospitalizations, deaths) for outbreaks or data
quality issues. Traditional alert-based monitoring systems struggle with modern
public health data monitoring systems for several reasons, including that
alerting thresholds need to be constantly reset and the data volumes may cause
application lag. Instead, we propose a ranking-based monitoring paradigm that

### [15] [Matching Markets Meet LLMs: Algorithmic Reasoning with Ranked Preferences](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04478)
*Hadi Hosseini,Samarth Khanna,Ronak Singh*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper explores the limitations of large language models (LLMs) in handling ranked preferences for combinatorial reasoning tasks, focusing on matching markets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to investigate whether LLMs, which have shown prowess in reasoning tasks, can effectively handle ranked preferences and structured algorithms in real-world combinatorial scenarios like matching markets.

Method: The authors evaluate several state-of-the-art LLMs on different tasks within matching markets, including stable-matching generation, instability detection, instability resolution, and preference queries. Fine-tuning (LoRA) is also examined to assess performance improvements.

Result: The study found that even advanced LLMs struggle with instability resolution in large markets, failing to identify blocking pairs or execute iterative algorithms effectively. LoRA fine-tuning improves performance in small markets but not in larger contexts.

Conclusion: LLMs face significant challenges in reasoning about ranked preferences in large combinatorial domains. Sophisticated methods are needed to enhance their capabilities, particularly for handling large-context inputs.

Abstract: The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has driven progress in reasoning
tasks -- from program synthesis to scientific hypothesis generation -- yet
their ability to handle ranked preferences and structured algorithms in
combinatorial domains remains underexplored. We study matching markets, a core
framework behind applications like resource allocation and ride-sharing, which
require reconciling individual ranked preferences to ensure stable outcomes. We
evaluate several state-of-the-art models on a hierarchy of preference-based
reasoning tasks -- ranging from stable-matching generation to instability
detection, instability resolution, and fine-grained preference queries -- to
systematically expose their logical and algorithmic limitations in handling
ranked inputs. Surprisingly, even top-performing models with advanced reasoning
struggle to resolve instability in large markets, often failing to identify
blocking pairs or execute algorithms iteratively. We further show that
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (LoRA) significantly improves performance in
small markets, but fails to bring about a similar improvement on large
instances, suggesting the need for more sophisticated strategies to improve
LLMs' reasoning with larger-context inputs.

*Jiayu Liu,Zhenya Huang,Wei Dai,Cheng Cheng,Jinze Wu,Jing Sha,Song Li,Qi Liu,Shijin Wang,Enhong Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces CogMath, an approach to comprehensively evaluate LLMs' mathematical abilities via 9 fine-grained dimensions inspired by human cognition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluations of LLMs in mathematical tasks focus on overall answer accuracy but fail to assess deeper reasoning capabilities.

Method: CogMath evaluates LLMs through a 3-stage human reasoning model—problem comprehension, problem solving, and solution summarization—with 9 specific dimensions using a multi-agent system.

Result: Applying CogMath to benchmarks shows that LLMs' mathematical performance is overestimated by 30%-40% and identifies their strengths/weaknesses in reasoning.

Conclusion: CogMath offers deeper insights into the capabilities and limitations of LLMs, helping to enhance their future mathematical reasoning abilities.

Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) show promise in solving complex
mathematical tasks, existing evaluation paradigms rely solely on a coarse
measure of overall answer accuracy, which are insufficient for assessing their
authentic capabilities. In this paper, we propose \textbf{CogMath}, which
comprehensively assesses LLMs' mathematical abilities through the lens of human
cognition. Specifically, inspired by psychological theories, CogMath formalizes
human reasoning process into 3 stages: \emph{problem comprehension},
\emph{problem solving}, and \emph{solution summarization}. Within these stages,
we investigate perspectives such as numerical calculation, knowledge, and
counterfactuals, and design a total of 9 fine-grained evaluation dimensions. In
each dimension, we develop an ``\emph{Inquiry}-\emph{Judge}-\emph{Reference}''
multi-agent system to generate inquiries that assess LLMs' mastery from this
dimension. An LLM is considered to truly master a problem only when excelling
in all inquiries from the 9 dimensions. By applying CogMath on three
benchmarks, we reveal that the mathematical capabilities of 7 mainstream LLMs
are overestimated by 30\%-40\%. Moreover, we locate their strengths and
weaknesses across specific stages/dimensions, offering in-depth insights to
further enhance their reasoning abilities.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces STPR, a framework that uses large language models (LLMs) to convert instructional constraints into executable Python functions for robotic navigation, ensuring compliance and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of translating complex, informal constraints from natural language into formal descriptions usable by planning algorithms in robotic navigation.

Method: STPR employs LLMs to generate Python functions from natural language constraints, leveraging coding capabilities to process constraints accurately while avoiding reasoning errors and hallucinations.

Result: The framework demonstrates accurate translations of constraints and applies them effectively to point cloud representations using traditional search algorithms, with full compliance and short runtimes in simulated environments.

Conclusion: STPR is effective in ensuring constraint compliance during robotic navigation, and its compatibility with smaller, code-specific LLMs broadens its applicability while maintaining low inference costs.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have spurred interest in
robotic navigation that incorporates complex spatial, mathematical, and
conditional constraints from natural language into the planning problem. Such
constraints can be informal yet highly complex, making it challenging to
translate into a formal description that can be passed on to a planning
algorithm. In this paper, we propose STPR, a constraint generation framework
that uses LLMs to translate constraints (expressed as instructions on ``what
not to do'') into executable Python functions. STPR leverages the LLM's strong
coding capabilities to shift the problem description from language into
structured and transparent code, thus circumventing complex reasoning and
avoiding potential hallucinations. We show that these LLM-generated functions
accurately describe even complex mathematical constraints, and apply them to
point cloud representations with traditional search algorithms. Experiments in
a simulated Gazebo environment show that STPR ensures full compliance across
several constraints and scenarios, while having short runtimes. We also verify
that STPR can be used with smaller, code-specific LLMs, making it applicable to
a wide range of compact models at low inference cost.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Schemas are essential for data quality in the Semantic Web, but their manual creation demands substantial expertise and effort.

Method: LLM-based pipelines leverage knowledge graphs using local and global information to produce schemas in Shape Expressions (ShEx). Two datasets, YAGO Schema and Wikidata EntitySchema, and evaluation metrics are introduced.

Result: Experiments showcase that LLMs can generate high-quality ShEx schemas and demonstrate scalability for large knowledge graphs.

Conclusion: LLMs exhibit significant potential for automated schema generation, introducing challenges for structured generation and expanding LLM applications to syntactically rich formalisms.

Abstract: Schemas are vital for ensuring data quality in the Semantic Web and natural
language processing. Traditionally, their creation demands substantial
involvement from knowledge engineers and domain experts. Leveraging the
impressive capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in related tasks like
ontology engineering, we explore automatic schema generation using LLMs. To
bridge the resource gap, we introduce two datasets: YAGO Schema and Wikidata
EntitySchema, along with evaluation metrics. The LLM-based pipelines
effectively utilize local and global information from knowledge graphs (KGs) to
generate validating schemas in Shape Expressions (ShEx). Experiments
demonstrate LLMs' strong potential in producing high-quality ShEx schemas,
paving the way for scalable, automated schema generation for large KGs.
Furthermore, our benchmark introduces a new challenge for structured
generation, pushing the limits of LLMs on syntactically rich formalisms.

TL;DR: OpenAg introduces an advanced framework for agricultural AI combining specialized models, knowledge graphs, and explainable multi-agent reasoning systems to overcome limitations of general-purpose AI in farm decision-making.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle challenges like lack of context, explainability, and actionable support in existing agricultural AI systems, particularly for smallholder farmers.

Method: The system integrates domain-specific foundation models, neural knowledge graphs, multi-agent reasoning, causal explainability, and adaptive transfer learning into one unified framework.

Result: OpenAg provides a structured and interpretative decision-making framework, ensuring scientific reliability and farmer-relevant recommendations.

Conclusion: OpenAg bridges the gap between scientific knowledge and practical farming expertise, supporting scalable and meaningful agricultural advancements.

Abstract: Agriculture is undergoing a major transformation driven by artificial
intelligence (AI), machine learning, and knowledge representation technologies.
However, current agricultural intelligence systems often lack contextual
understanding, explainability, and adaptability, especially for smallholder
farmers with limited resources. General-purpose large language models (LLMs),
while powerful, typically lack the domain-specific knowledge and contextual
reasoning needed for practical decision support in farming. They tend to
produce recommendations that are too generic or unrealistic for real-world
applications. To address these challenges, we present OpenAg, a comprehensive
framework designed to advance agricultural artificial general intelligence
(AGI). OpenAg combines domain-specific foundation models, neural knowledge
graphs, multi-agent reasoning, causal explainability, and adaptive transfer
learning to deliver context-aware, explainable, and actionable insights. The
system includes: (i) a unified agricultural knowledge base that integrates
scientific literature, sensor data, and farmer-generated knowledge; (ii) a
neural agricultural knowledge graph for structured reasoning and inference;
(iii) an adaptive multi-agent reasoning system where AI agents specialize and
collaborate across agricultural domains; and (iv) a causal transparency
mechanism that ensures AI recommendations are interpretable, scientifically
grounded, and aligned with real-world constraints. OpenAg aims to bridge the
gap between scientific knowledge and the tacit expertise of experienced farmers
to support scalable and locally relevant agricultural decision-making.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes DeePoly, a hybrid framework combining deep neural networks (DNNs) and polynomial basis functions to efficiently solve Partial Differential Equations (PDEs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to improve computational efficiency and convergence guarantees in solving PDEs, addressing the shortcomings of DNN-based methods compared to traditional numerical techniques.

Method: DeePoly involves a two-stage framework: (1) a DNN capturing global features, and (2) linear optimization combining DNN-extracted features (Scoper) with polynomial basis functions (Sniper).

Result: The approach achieves high-order accuracy and efficiency for various PDE problems while maintaining mesh-free and scheme-free characteristics.

Conclusion: DeePoly effectively integrates DNNs with polynomial bases to combine the strengths of both, achieving stability, accuracy, and computational efficiency in PDE solutions.

Abstract: Recently, machine learning methods have gained significant traction in
scientific computing, particularly for solving Partial Differential Equations
(PDEs). However, methods based on deep neural networks (DNNs) often lack
convergence guarantees and computational efficiency compared to traditional
numerical schemes. This work introduces DeePoly, a novel framework that
transforms the solution paradigm from pure non-convex parameter optimization to
a two-stage approach: first employing a DNN to capture complex global features,
followed by linear space optimization with combined DNN-extracted features
(Scoper) and polynomial basis functions (Sniper). This strategic combination
leverages the complementary strengths of both methods -- DNNs excel at
approximating complex global features (i.e., high-gradient features) and
stabilize the polynomial approximation while polynomial bases provide
high-precision local corrections with convergence guarantees. Theoretical
analysis and numerical experiments demonstrate that this approach significantly
enhances both high-order accuracy and efficiency across diverse problem types
while maintaining mesh-free and scheme-free properties. This paper also serves
as a theoretical exposition for the open-source project DeePoly.

*Yuyang Wanyan,Xi Zhang,Haiyang Xu,Haowei Liu,Junyang Wang,Jiabo Ye,Yutong Kou,Ming Yan,Fei Huang,Xiaoshan Yang,Weiming Dong,Changsheng Xu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a mechanism called GUI-Critic to improve multimodal reasoning for GUI automation tasks, emphasizing error prevention in interactive environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving reliability in GUI automation tasks using MLLMs due to their error intolerance and potential irreversible consequences during step-by-step interaction.

Method: A pre-operative critic mechanism called GUI-Critic-R1, utilizing Suggestion-aware Gradient Relative Policy Optimization (S-GRPO) strategy, paired with a reasoning-bootstrapping pipeline for data collection.

Result: GUI-Critic-R1 outperforms general MLLMs in critic accuracy in static tests and achieves better success rates and efficiency in dynamic evaluations.

Conclusion: The proposed GUI-Critic mechanism effectively enhances decision-making reliability for GUI automation in both mobile and web environments.

Abstract: In recent years, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have been
extensively utilized for multimodal reasoning tasks, including Graphical User
Interface (GUI) automation. Unlike general offline multimodal tasks, GUI
automation is executed in online interactive environments, necessitating
step-by-step decision-making based on real-time status of the environment. This
task has a lower tolerance for decision-making errors at each step, as any
mistakes may cumulatively disrupt the process and potentially lead to
irreversible outcomes like deletions or payments. To address these issues, we
introduce a pre-operative critic mechanism that provides effective feedback
prior to the actual execution, by reasoning about the potential outcome and
correctness of actions. Specifically, we propose a Suggestion-aware Gradient
Relative Policy Optimization (S-GRPO) strategy to construct our pre-operative
critic model GUI-Critic-R1, incorporating a novel suggestion reward to enhance
the reliability of the model's feedback. Furthermore, we develop a
reasoning-bootstrapping based data collection pipeline to create a
GUI-Critic-Train and a GUI-Critic-Test, filling existing gaps in GUI critic
data. Static experiments on the GUI-Critic-Test across both mobile and web
domains reveal that our GUI-Critic-R1 offers significant advantages in critic
accuracy compared to current MLLMs. Dynamic evaluation on GUI automation
benchmark further highlights the effectiveness and superiority of our model, as
evidenced by improved success rates and operational efficiency.

*Lucas Irwin,Arda Kaz,Peiyao Sheng,Pramod Viswanath*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces CHANCERY, a corporate governance reasoning benchmark testing language models on binary classification tasks to determine compliance with corporate governance charters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the lack of legal reasoning tests in NLP benchmarks, though legal datasets exist, and reasoning is central to legal practice.

Method: The benchmark consists of corporate charters and executive proposals, designed using 24 governance principles and real-life data from 10k corporate charters. Binary classification tasks evaluate reasoning accuracy.

Result: SOTA models like Claude 3.7 Sonnet and GPT-4o perform at 64.5% and 75.2% accuracy respectively, while ReAct and CodeAct-based reasoning agents achieve higher scores of 76.1% and 78.1%.

Conclusion: The benchmark demonstrates its complexity and reveals challenges in legal reasoning for current models, offering insights into their capabilities.

Abstract: Law has long been a domain that has been popular in natural language
processing (NLP) applications. Reasoning (ratiocination and the ability to make
connections to precedent) is a core part of the practice of the law in the real
world. Nevertheless, while multiple legal datasets exist, none have thus far
focused specifically on reasoning tasks. We focus on a specific aspect of the
legal landscape by introducing a corporate governance reasoning benchmark
(CHANCERY) to test a model's ability to reason about whether
executive/board/shareholder's proposed actions are consistent with corporate
governance charters. This benchmark introduces a first-of-its-kind corporate
governance reasoning test for language models - modeled after real world
corporate governance law. The benchmark consists of a corporate charter (a set
of governing covenants) and a proposal for executive action. The model's task
is one of binary classification: reason about whether the action is consistent
with the rules contained within the charter. We create the benchmark following
established principles of corporate governance - 24 concrete corporate
governance principles established in and 79 real life corporate charters
selected to represent diverse industries from a total dataset of 10k real life
corporate charters. Evaluations on state-of-the-art (SOTA) reasoning models
confirm the difficulty of the benchmark, with models such as Claude 3.7 Sonnet
and GPT-4o achieving 64.5% and 75.2% accuracy respectively. Reasoning agents
exhibit superior performance, with agents based on the ReAct and CodeAct
frameworks scoring 76.1% and 78.1% respectively, further confirming the
advanced legal reasoning capabilities required to score highly on the
benchmark. We also conduct an analysis of the types of questions which current
reasoning models struggle on, revealing insights into the legal reasoning
capabilities of SOTA models.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores whether Large Language Models (LLMs) can improve their strategic thinking in challenging environments like the board game Settlers of Catan. Self-evolving agents outperform static ones when given autonomy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of LLMs in devising and executing coherent long-term strategies, particularly in autonomous settings.

Method: The paper employs the game Settlers of Catan within the Catanatron framework, using a multi-agent architecture with specialized roles such as Analyzer, Researcher, Coder, and Player to iteratively improve gameplay strategies.

Result: Self-evolving agents powered by Claude 3.7 and GPT-4o surpass static agents by autonomously developing strategies, adapting behavior, and reasoning through multiple cycles.

Conclusion: Placing LLMs in iterative, strategic environments allows them to autonomously enhance their reasoning abilities, thereby outperforming baseline models.

Abstract: Recent advances in LLMs have enabled their use as autonomous agents across a
range of tasks, yet they continue to struggle with formulating and adhering to
coherent long-term strategies. In this paper, we investigate whether LLM agents
can self-improve when placed in environments that explicitly challenge their
strategic planning abilities. Using the board game Settlers of Catan, accessed
through the open-source Catanatron framework, we benchmark a progression of
LLM-based agents, from a simple game-playing agent to systems capable of
autonomously rewriting their own prompts and their player agent's code. We
introduce a multi-agent architecture in which specialized roles (Analyzer,
Researcher, Coder, and Player) collaborate to iteratively analyze gameplay,
research new strategies, and modify the agent's logic or prompt. By comparing
manually crafted agents to those evolved entirely by LLMs, we evaluate how
effectively these systems can diagnose failure and adapt over time. Our results
show that self-evolving agents, particularly when powered by models like Claude
3.7 and GPT-4o, outperform static baselines by autonomously adopting their
strategies, passing along sample behavior to game-playing agents, and
demonstrating adaptive reasoning over multiple iterations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this study is the increasing use of e-bikes along with a rise in reported accidents, which necessitates effective tools to analyze safety trends despite the challenge posed by unstructured narrative formats in incident reports.

Method: The study introduces a framework of four LLM-powered agents for classifying and extracting safety variables from incident reports and uses an ordered logit model to explore relationships between accident factors and severity.

Result: The model achieved a high weighted F1 score of 0.87, revealing that equipment issues are more frequent while human-related incidents are more fatal. Pedals, tires, and brakes are identified as frequent contributors to accidents.

Conclusion: The research demonstrates the high potential of LLMs in processing unstructured data for niche applications like transportation safety, offering a scalable solution for improving e-bike safety analysis and guiding policy decisions.

Abstract: Electric bicycles (e-bikes) are rapidly increasing in use, raising safety
concerns due to a rise in accident reports. However, e-bike incident reports
often use unstructured narrative formats, which hinders quantitative safety
analysis. This study introduces E-bike agents, a framework that uses large
language models (LLM) powered agents to classify and extract safety variables
from unstructured incident reports. Our framework consists of four LLM agents,
handling data classification, information extraction, injury cause
determination, and component linkage, to extract the key factors that could
lead to E-bike accidents and cause varying severity levels. Furthermore, we
used an ordered logit model to examine the relationship between the severity of
the incident and the factors retrieved, such as gender, the type of cause, and
environmental conditions. Our research shows that equipment issues are slightly
more common than human-related ones, but human-related incidents are more often
fatal. Specifically, pedals, tires, and brakes are frequent contributors to
accidents. The model achieves a high weighted F1 score of 0.87 in
classification accuracy, highlighting the potential of using LLMs to extract
unstructured data in niche domains, such as transportation. Our method offers a
scalable solution to improve e-bike safety analytics and provides actionable
information for policy makers, designers, and regulators.

Conclusion: LLM-based agents show promise in enhancing MMO economic simulations by replicating human-like economic behavior and adaptability.

Abstract: Within the domain of Massively Multiplayer Online (MMO) economy research,
Agent-Based Modeling (ABM) has emerged as a robust tool for analyzing game
economics, evolving from rule-based agents to decision-making agents enhanced
by reinforcement learning. Nevertheless, existing works encounter significant
challenges when attempting to emulate human-like economic activities among
agents, particularly regarding agent reliability, sociability, and
interpretability. In this study, we take a preliminary step in introducing a
novel approach using Large Language Models (LLMs) in MMO economy simulation.
Leveraging LLMs' role-playing proficiency, generative capacity, and reasoning
aptitude, we design LLM-driven agents with human-like decision-making and
adaptability. These agents are equipped with the abilities of role-playing,
perception, memory, and reasoning, addressing the aforementioned challenges
effectively. Simulation experiments focusing on in-game economic activities
demonstrate that LLM-empowered agents can promote emergent phenomena like role

TL;DR: Reinforcement learning (RL) improves reasoning capabilities in language models by enabling them to develop better internal strategies and utilize provided knowledge effectively, despite certain trade-offs on complex tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the lack of understanding about why RL-based methods like GRPO demonstrate substantial empirical gains in enhancing reasoning capabilities of language models.

Method: The paper introduces a fine-grained analytic framework to evaluate RL's impact on reasoning in terms of plan-following, problem decomposition, and knowledge utilization. Key experiments are performed on challenging benchmarks to draw insights.

Result: RL-tuned models show increased robustness, smaller performance drops on complex benchmarks, and improved integration of provided knowledge. However, step-by-step plans provided to the models degrade performance in some scenarios.

Conclusion: RL enhances a model's internal strategy formulation and knowledge integration across tasks, enabling more effective reasoning processes. The findings guide more rigorous training and evaluation approaches for reasoning models.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become the dominant paradigm for endowing
language models with advanced reasoning capabilities. Despite the substantial
empirical gains demonstrated by RL-based training methods like GRPO, a granular
understanding of their advantages is still lacking. To address this gap, we
introduce a fine-grained analytic framework to dissect the impact of RL on
reasoning. Our framework specifically investigates key elements that have been
hypothesized to benefit from RL training: (1) plan-following and execution, (2)
problem decomposition, and (3) improved reasoning and knowledge utilization.
Using this framework, we gain insights beyond mere accuracy. For instance,
providing models with explicit step-by-step plans surprisingly degrades
performance on the most challenging benchmarks, yet RL-tuned models exhibit
greater robustness, experiencing markedly smaller performance drops than their
base counterparts. This suggests that RL may not primarily enhance the
execution of external plans but rather empower models to formulate and follow
internal strategies better suited to their reasoning processes. Conversely, we
observe that RL enhances the model's capacity to integrate provided knowledge
into its reasoning process, leading to performance improvements across diverse
tasks. We also study difficulty, showing improved training by developing new
ways to exploit hard problems. Our findings lay a foundation for more
principled training and evaluation of reasoning models.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a model-based RL framework that ensures safety and reliability by adapting dynamically to agent capabilities and optimizing both safety and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhance the safety and reliability of reinforcement learning applications in real-world, safety-critical scenarios.

Method: Develops an adaptive framework that switches between model-based planning and direct execution, incorporates implicit world models, and uses dynamic safety thresholds.

Result: The proposed method significantly outperforms existing non-adaptive methods in diverse safety-critical continuous control tasks.

Conclusion: The framework successfully balances safety and performance optimization, demonstrating robustness and superiority over traditional methods.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) applications in real-world scenarios must
prioritize safety and reliability, which impose strict constraints on agent
behavior. Model-based RL leverages predictive world models for action planning
and policy optimization, but inherent model inaccuracies can lead to
catastrophic failures in safety-critical settings. We propose a novel
model-based RL framework that jointly optimizes task performance and safety. To
address world model errors, our method incorporates an adaptive mechanism that
dynamically switches between model-based planning and direct policy execution.
We resolve the objective mismatch problem of traditional model-based approaches
using an implicit world model. Furthermore, our framework employs dynamic
safety thresholds that adapt to the agent's evolving capabilities, consistently
selecting actions that surpass safe policy suggestions in both performance and
safety. Experiments demonstrate significant improvements over non-adaptive
methods, showing that our approach optimizes safety and performance
simultaneously rather than merely meeting minimum safety requirements. The
proposed framework achieves robust performance on diverse safety-critical
continuous control tasks, outperforming existing methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As cyber-attacks grow increasingly complex, multi-agent approaches are needed to develop effective cyber-defense strategies that address these threats early in the network.

Method: The authors employed a Markovian modeling approach and implemented a simulator to study interactions between cyber-attacker and cyber-defender agents on network nodes. Actions and property changes reflect the network's states and reactions.

Result: They created an experimental framework simulating realistic coordinated cyber-attack scenarios, allowing analysis of dynamic strategies used by cyber-defender agents.

Conclusion: The simulator provides insights into the dynamics of cyber-attacks and defenses, enabling further exploration of effective coordinated cyber-defense strategies.

Abstract: As cyber-attacks show to be more and more complex and coordinated,
cyber-defenders strategy through multi-agent approaches could be key to tackle
against cyber-attacks as close as entry points in a networked system. This
paper presents a Markovian modeling and implementation through a simulator of
fighting cyber-attacker agents and cyber-defender agents deployed on host
network nodes. It aims to provide an experimental framework to implement
realistically based coordinated cyber-attack scenarios while assessing
cyber-defenders dynamic organizations. We abstracted network nodes by sets of
properties including agents' ones. Actions applied by agents model how the
network reacts depending in a given state and what properties are to change.
Collective choice of the actions brings the whole environment closer or farther
from respective cyber-attackers and cyber-defenders goals. Using the simulator,
we implemented a realistically inspired scenario with several behavior
implementation approaches for cyber-defenders and cyber-attackers.

Motivation: The paper aims to leverage the reasoning capabilities of LLMs to control embodied agents effectively, integrating symbolic reasoning with sensory-motor data for continuous-action tasks.

Method: The approach involves LLMs iteratively refining a control strategy generated from textual descriptions, guided by performance feedback and sensory-motor data during evaluations.

Result: The method is validated on tasks from the Gymnasium and MuJoCo libraries, showing successful identification of optimal or high-performing solutions by combining symbolic knowledge with sensory-motor data.

Conclusion: The proposed method demonstrates that LLMs can effectively integrate reasoning capabilities with sensory data to generate and optimize control strategies for complex tasks.

Abstract: We propose a method that enables large language models (LLMs) to control
embodied agents by directly mapping continuous observation vectors to
continuous action vectors. Initially, the LLMs generate a control strategy
based on a textual description of the agent, its environment, and the intended
goal. This strategy is then iteratively refined through a learning process in
which the LLMs are repeatedly prompted to improve the current strategy, using
performance feedback and sensory-motor data collected during its evaluation.
The method is validated on classic control tasks from the Gymnasium library and
the inverted pendulum task from the MuJoCo library. In most cases, it
successfully identifies optimal or high-performing solutions by integrating
symbolic knowledge derived through reasoning with sub-symbolic sensory-motor
data gathered as the agent interacts with its environment.

*Pietro Miotti,Eyvind Niklasson,Ettore Randazzo,Alexander Mordvintsev*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes Differentiable Logic Cellular Automata (DiffLogic CA), combining neural adaptability and logic circuit design for robust pattern generation and programmable computing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a framework that integrates differentiable logic gate networks with neural cellular automata for programmable matter and discrete computation modeling.

Method: Combining differentiable logic gates as computational units in end-to-end differentiable training, allowing discrete state inference and pattern-targeted training with local update rules.

Result: Showcased model capabilities in tasks like learning Conway's Game of Life, resilient pattern generation, shape creation, and multi-color patterns using both synchronous and asynchronous setups.

Conclusion: The DiffLogic CA approach offers advancements in discrete computing systems with robust logic and adaptability, marking a significant step toward programmable matter integration.

Abstract: This paper introduces Differentiable Logic Cellular Automata (DiffLogic CA),
a novel combination of Neural Cellular Automata (NCA) and Differentiable Logic
Gates Networks (DLGNs). The fundamental computation units of the model are
differentiable logic gates, combined into a circuit. During training, the model
is fully end-to-end differentiable allowing gradient-based training, and at
inference time it operates in a fully discrete state space. This enables
learning local update rules for cellular automata while preserving their
inherent discrete nature. We demonstrate the versatility of our approach
through a series of milestones: (1) fully learning the rules of Conway's Game
of Life, (2) generating checkerboard patterns that exhibit resilience to noise
and damage, (3) growing a lizard shape, and (4) multi-color pattern generation.
Our model successfully learns recurrent circuits capable of generating desired
target patterns. For simpler patterns, we observe success with both synchronous
and asynchronous updates, demonstrating significant generalization capabilities
and robustness to perturbations. We make the case that this combination of
DLGNs and NCA represents a step toward programmable matter and robust computing
systems that combine binary logic, neural network adaptability, and localized
processing. This work, to the best of our knowledge, is the first successful
application of differentiable logic gate networks in recurrent architectures.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Energentic Intelligence, autonomous systems prioritizing internal energy regulation over task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable autonomous agents to sustain themselves in environments with volatile resources and no external supervision.

Method: Development of an energy-based utility function, viability-constrained survival horizon, and modular architecture combining energy harvesting, thermal regulation, and adaptive computation.

Result: The simulated environment shows stable, resource-aware behavior emerging without external supervision.

Conclusion: The contributions lay the groundwork for autonomous agents in self-regulated, resource-volatile environments.

Abstract: This paper introduces Energentic Intelligence, a class of autonomous systems
defined not by task performance, but by their capacity to sustain themselves
through internal energy regulation. Departing from conventional reward-driven
paradigms, these agents treat survival-maintaining functional operation under
fluctuating energetic and thermal conditions-as the central objective. We
formalize this principle through an energy-based utility function and a
viability-constrained survival horizon, and propose a modular architecture that
integrates energy harvesting, thermal regulation, and adaptive computation into
a closed-loop control system. A simulated environment demonstrates the
emergence of stable, resource-aware behavior without external supervision.
Together, these contributions provide a theoretical and architectural
foundation for deploying autonomous agents in resource-volatile settings where
persistence must be self-regulated and infrastructure cannot be assumed.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This study introduces RAG-UAV, a retrieval-augmented generation framework that improves the mathematical reasoning of LLMs in UAV-specific contexts by providing access to relevant domain literature. It tested with a small UAV-Math-Bench problem set.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the mathematical reasoning ability of LLMs in UAV applications, addressing their struggles with selecting and applying correct mathematical formulations and executing precise multi-step arithmetic.

Method: The paper presents the RAG-UAV framework, which enhances LLMs by retrieving domain-specific literature during mathematical reasoning tasks. It evaluates its performance with a new benchmark, UAV-Math-Bench, containing 20 UAV-centric mathematical problems.

Result: The RAG-UAV framework improved answer accuracy (up to 75% for the best model), reduced incorrect formulation selection (from 25% to 5%), and significantly lowered numerical errors and Mean Squared Error (MSE).

Conclusion: RAG-UAV enhances general-purpose LLMs for UAV engineering analysis, though more extensive validation is required for real-time flight control tasks.

Abstract: Autonomous UAV operation necessitates reliable mathematical reasoning for
tasks such as trajectory planning and power management. While traditional
flight control relies on hardcoded equations, recent Large Language Models
(LLMs) offer potential for more flexible problem-solving but struggle with
reliably selecting and applying correct mathematical formulations and executing
precise multi-step arithmetic. We propose RAG-UAV, a retrieval-augmented
generation framework designed to improve the mathematical reasoning of several
LLMs (including GPT o1/Turbo, Llama-3.2/3.3, Mistral, and DeepSeek R1) in
UAV-specific contexts by providing access to relevant domain literature. To
conduct an initial assessment, we introduce the UAV-Math-Bench, a small problem
set comprising 20 UAV-centric mathematical problems across four difficulty
levels. Our experiments demonstrate that incorporating retrieval substantially
increases exact answer accuracy (achieving up to 75% with o1), reduces
instances of incorrect formulation selection (from 25% without RAG to 5% with
RAG), decreases numerical errors, reducing Mean Squared Error (MSE) by orders
of magnitude for the best-performing models. This pilot study indicates that
RAG can enable general-purpose LLMs to function as more reliable tools for
engineering analysis, although direct real-time flight control requires further
investigation and validation on a larger scale. All benchmark data, question
and answer are publicly available.

### [34] [Truly Self-Improving Agents Require Intrinsic Metacognitive Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05109)
*Tennison Liu,Mihaela van der Schaar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Current approaches to self-improving agents lack adaptability and scalability. This paper introduces a framework inspired by human metacognition to address these challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to enhance self-improving agents by addressing limitations in their adaptability and scalability, inspired by the human metacognitive process.

Method: A formal framework for intrinsic metacognition derived from human-centric concepts is proposed, including three components: metacognitive knowledge, planning, and evaluation.

Result: The paper identifies that current agents rely on extrinsic metacognitive mechanisms and offers a solution using intrinsic metacognition.

Conclusion: Adopting intrinsic metacognition and optimizing human-agent responsibility distribution are vital steps toward effective, scalable, generalized self-improvement systems.

Abstract: Self-improving agents aim to continuously acquire new capabilities with
minimal supervision. However, current approaches face two key limitations:
their self-improvement processes are often rigid, fail to generalize across
tasks domains, and struggle to scale with increasing agent capabilities. We
argue that effective self-improvement requires intrinsic metacognitive
learning, defined as an agent's intrinsic ability to actively evaluate, reflect
on, and adapt its own learning processes. Drawing inspiration from human
metacognition, we introduce a formal framework comprising three components:
metacognitive knowledge (self-assessment of capabilities, tasks, and learning
strategies), metacognitive planning (deciding what and how to learn), and
metacognitive evaluation (reflecting on learning experiences to improve future
learning). Analyzing existing self-improving agents, we find they rely
predominantly on extrinsic metacognitive mechanisms, which are fixed,
human-designed loops that limit scalability and adaptability. Examining each
component, we contend that many ingredients for intrinsic metacognition are
already present. Finally, we explore how to optimally distribute metacognitive
responsibilities between humans and agents, and robustly evaluate and improve
intrinsic metacognitive learning, key challenges that must be addressed to
enable truly sustained, generalized, and aligned self-improvement.

### [35] [Just Enough Thinking: Efficient Reasoning with Adaptive Length Penalties Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05256)
*Violet Xiang,Chase Blagden,Rafael Rafailov,Nathan Lile,Sang Truong,Chelsea Finn,Nick Haber*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes Adaptive Length Penalty (ALP), a method to reduce token usage in large reasoning models while maintaining performance and improving efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current large reasoning models waste computational resources on easy problems due to excessive token generation, and existing solutions either require manual effort or fail to differentiate problem difficulty.

Method: The authors introduce Adaptive Length Penalty (ALP), which utilizes reinforcement learning to impose penalties on token generation based on the difficulty of each prompt, using online solve rates as feedback.

Result: ALP reduces average token usage by 50% without compromising performance, redistributes computational resources to focus on harder problems, and achieves better accuracy on the most challenging tasks compared to baselines.

Conclusion: ALP effectively optimizes resource use in reasoning models by intelligently tailoring token allocation per problem difficulty, leading to more efficient and accurate model performance.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) achieve higher performance on challenging
reasoning tasks by generating more tokens at inference time, but this verbosity
often wastes computation on easy problems. Existing solutions, including
supervised finetuning on shorter traces, user-controlled budgets, or RL with
uniform penalties, either require data curation, manual configuration, or treat
all problems alike regardless of difficulty. We introduce Adaptive Length
Penalty (ALP), a reinforcement learning objective tailoring generation length
to per-prompt solve rate. During training, ALP monitors each prompt's online
solve rate through multiple rollouts and adds a differentiable penalty whose
magnitude scales inversely with that rate, so confident (easy) prompts incur a
high cost for extra tokens while hard prompts remain unhindered. Posttraining
DeepScaleR-1.5B with ALP cuts average token usage by 50\% without significantly
dropping performance. Relative to fixed-budget and uniform penalty baselines,
ALP redistributes its reduced budget more intelligently by cutting compute on
easy prompts and reallocating saved tokens to difficult ones, delivering higher
accuracy on the hardest problems with higher cost.

*Mikhail Terekhov,Zhen Ning David Liu,Caglar Gulcehre,Samuel Albanie*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces the concept of 'Control Tax' to quantify the costs of integrating oversight mechanisms in AI pipelines and provides a framework for balancing safety and cost-effectiveness in AI Control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the need for robust oversight mechanisms in high-stakes applications of agentic AI, where the operational and financial challenges of implementing such measures impact adoption.

Method: The researchers propose a theoretical framework quantifying 'Control Tax,' analyze adversarial scenarios with backdoor-injection experiments on language models, and provide financial cost estimates along with optimized monitoring strategies.

Result: The evaluation proves the validity of the framework by correlating safety assurances with classifier performance. Adversarial experiments demonstrated vulnerabilities, and cost analyses pinpointed more efficient strategies under budget constraints.

Conclusion: The study connects the economic feasibility of AI control measures with safety performance, aiding practitioners in navigating trade-offs to ensure secure AI deployment across various contexts.

Abstract: The rapid integration of agentic AI into high-stakes real-world applications
requires robust oversight mechanisms. The emerging field of AI Control (AIC)
aims to provide such an oversight mechanism, but practical adoption depends
heavily on implementation overhead. To study this problem better, we introduce
the notion of Control tax -- the operational and financial cost of integrating
control measures into AI pipelines. Our work makes three key contributions to
the field of AIC: (1) we introduce a theoretical framework that quantifies the
Control Tax and maps classifier performance to safety assurances; (2) we
conduct comprehensive evaluations of state-of-the-art language models in
adversarial settings, where attacker models insert subtle backdoors into code
while monitoring models attempt to detect these vulnerabilities; and (3) we
provide empirical financial cost estimates for control protocols and develop
optimized monitoring strategies that balance safety and cost-effectiveness
while accounting for practical constraints like auditing budgets. Our framework
enables practitioners to make informed decisions by systematically connecting
safety guarantees with their costs, advancing AIC through principled economic
feasibility assessment across different deployment contexts.

TL;DR: The paper introduces hdl2v, a dataset designed to expand human-written Verilog data by translating other hardware description languages, enhancing large language models' capability in Verilog code generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the scarcity of publicly available Verilog code in comparison to software language datasets like Python, thus improving LLMs' proficiency in Verilog code generation.

Method: The authors compiled and translated three hardware description languages (VHDL, Chisel, and PyMTL3) into Verilog, creating the hdl2v dataset. They then evaluated its impact on LLM performance in Verilog tasks.

Result: Using hdl2v, an open-weight LLM's Verilog performance improved by up to 23% (pass@10), without knowledge distillation or data augmentation. Further fine-tuning methods showed a 63% improvement.

Conclusion: The hdl2v dataset effectively boosts Verilog generation in LLMs and its characteristics offer insights for future research on hardware description language datasets and improved LLM training methodologies.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are playing an increasingly large role in
domains such as code generation, including hardware code generation, where
Verilog is the key language. However, the amount of publicly available Verilog
code pales in comparison to the amount of code available for software languages
like Python. In this work, we present hdl2v ("HDL-to-Verilog"), a dataset which
seeks to increase the amount of available human-written Verilog data by
translating or compiling three other hardware description languages - VHDL,
Chisel, and PyMTL3 - to Verilog. Furthermore, we demonstrate the value of hdl2v
in enhancing LLM Verilog generation by improving performance of a 32
billion-parameter open-weight model by up to 23% (pass@10) in VerilogEvalV2,
without utilizing any data augmentation or knowledge distillation from larger
models. We also show hdl2v's ability to boost the performance of a data
augmentation-based fine-tuning approach by 63%. Finally, we characterize and
analyze our dataset to better understand which characteristics of
HDL-to-Verilog datasets can be expanded upon in future work for even better
performance.

TL;DR: The paper introduces ROSGuard, a portable tool for monitoring and controlling timing interference in ROS2 applications using Linux-based systems, achieving comparable effectiveness to specialized solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address timing interference in multicore systems for modular ROS2 applications that have less stringent timing needs, but still benefit from bandwidth regulation.

Method: Developed ROSGuard, leveraging Linux-based software stacks and ROS2 middleware, deployed on NVIDIA AGX Orin for evaluations on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks.

Result: ROSGaurd demonstrated effective bandwidth regulation comparable to state-of-the-art solutions with finer granularity, providing a modular and portable approach for industrial applications.

Conclusion: ROSGaurd effectively addresses timing interference in a broader range of applications, offering a balance of portability, modularity, and effective timing management strategies.

Abstract: Multicore timing interference, arising when multiple requests contend for the
same shared hardware resources, is a primary concern for timing verification
and validation of time-critical applications. Bandwidth control and regulation
approaches have been proposed in the literature as an effective method to
monitor and limit the impact of timing interference at run time. These
approaches seek for fine-grained control of the bandwidth consumption (at the
microsecond level) to meet stringent timing requirements on embedded critical
systems. Such granularity and configurations, while effective, can become an
entry barrier for the application of bandwidth control to a wide class of
productized, modular ROS2 applications. This is so because those applications
have less stringent timing requirements but would still benefit from bandwidth
regulation, though under less restrictive, and therefore more portable,
granularity and configurations.
  In this work, we provide ROSGuard, a highly-portable, modular implementation
of a timing interference monitoring and control mechanism that builds on the
abstractions available on top of a generic and portable Linux-based software
stack with the Robotic Operating System 2 (ROS2) layer, a widespreadedly
adopted middleware for a wide class of industrial applications, far beyond the
robotic domain. We deploy ROSGuard on an NVIDIA AGX Orin platform as a
representative target for functionally rich distributed AI-based applications
and a set of synthetic and real-world benchmarks. We apply an effective
bandwidth regulation scheme on ROS2-based applications and achieve comparable
effectiveness to specialized, finer-grained state-of-the-art solutions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional design paradigms for processor chips face challenges such as physical constraints, resource demands, and ecosystem diversity.

Method: The method involves creating a hierarchical system: a bottom-layer LPCM addressing AI-specific challenges, a middle-layer Hardware and Software Design Agent, and applications demonstrating its efficacy.

Result: Some components of QiMeng have already succeeded in various applications, showcasing its potential in automation.

Conclusion: QiMeng has shown promise as a feasible solution for fully automated hardware/software design, with future efforts focusing on overall integration and optimization.

Abstract: Processor chip design technology serves as a key frontier driving
breakthroughs in computer science and related fields. With the rapid
advancement of information technology, conventional design paradigms face three
major challenges: the physical constraints of fabrication technologies, the
escalating demands for design resources, and the increasing diversity of
ecosystems. Automated processor chip design has emerged as a transformative
solution to address these challenges. While recent breakthroughs in Artificial
Intelligence (AI), particularly Large Language Models (LLMs) techniques, have
opened new possibilities for fully automated processor chip design, substantial
challenges remain in establishing domain-specific LLMs for processor chip
design.
  In this paper, we propose QiMeng, a novel system for fully automated hardware
and software design of processor chips. QiMeng comprises three hierarchical
layers. In the bottom-layer, we construct a domain-specific Large Processor
Chip Model (LPCM) that introduces novel designs in architecture, training, and
inference, to address key challenges such as knowledge representation gap, data
scarcity, correctness assurance, and enormous solution space. In the
middle-layer, leveraging the LPCM's knowledge representation and inference
capabilities, we develop the Hardware Design Agent and the Software Design
Agent to automate the design of hardware and software for processor chips.
Currently, several components of QiMeng have been completed and successfully
applied in various top-layer applications, demonstrating significant advantages
and providing a feasible solution for efficient, fully automated
hardware/software design of processor chips. Future research will focus on
integrating all components and performing iterative top-down and bottom-up
design processes to establish a comprehensive QiMeng system.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces GEM, a self-supervised approach to enable large language models (LLMs) to generate high-quality text embeddings while retaining their generative and reasoning capabilities, improving performance on embedding tasks without compromising NLP capacities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems require separate embedding models, leading to system complexity and potential misalignment between embedding understanding and generative reasoning in LLMs.

Method: GEM introduces special tokens and manipulates the attention mask of LLMs to generate summarization embeddings, which can be easily integrated during post-training or fine-tuning phases.

Result: The proposed GEM approach was applied to two LLM families (sizes 1B–8B). It demonstrated significant improvements on text embedding benchmarks (MTEB) and minimal impact on NLP benchmarks (MMLU).

Conclusion: GEM successfully equips LLMs with state-of-the-art embedding capabilities while preserving their existing text generation and reasoning performance, offering a streamlined alternative to using separate embedding models.

Abstract: Large decoder-only language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in
generation and reasoning tasks, where they generate text responses given
instructions. However, many applications, e.g., retrieval augmented generation
(RAG), still rely on separate embedding models to generate text embeddings,
which can complicate the system and introduce discrepancies in understanding of
the query between the embedding model and LLMs. To address this limitation, we
propose a simple self-supervised approach, Generative Embedding large language
Model (GEM), that enables any large decoder-only LLM to generate high-quality
text embeddings while maintaining its original text generation and reasoning
capabilities. Our method inserts new special token(s) into a text body, and
generates summarization embedding of the text by manipulating the attention
mask. This method could be easily integrated into post-training or fine tuning
stages of any existing LLMs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach
by applying it to two popular LLM families, ranging from 1B to 8B parameters,
and evaluating the transformed models on both text embedding benchmarks (MTEB)
and NLP benchmarks (MMLU). The results show that our proposed method
significantly improves the original LLMs on MTEB while having a minimal impact
on MMLU. Our strong results indicate that our approach can empower LLMs with
state-of-the-art text embedding capabilities while maintaining their original
NLP performance

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study examines how different factors in ASR training data affect speech recognition robustness to unseen accents in a low-resource setting, emphasizing the benefit of increasing the number of speakers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop ASR systems capable of serving global users by ensuring robustness across a diverse range of accents, especially unseen ones, while addressing challenges in low-resource scenarios.

Method: The study evaluates the influence of three training data factors: the number of speakers, the audio duration per speaker, and accent diversity, on ASR performance in unseen accents using fixed training hours.

Result: Increasing the number of speakers improves ASR robustness and enhances performance when scaling the training hours. Prioritizing accent diversity among speakers yields minimal benefits if the speaker count remains fixed.

Conclusion: Maximizing the speaker count in ASR training data is critical for improving recognition performance in new languages and unseen accents.

Abstract: To build an automatic speech recognition (ASR) system that can serve everyone
in the world, the ASR needs to be robust to a wide range of accents including
unseen accents. We systematically study how three different variables in
training data -- the number of speakers, the audio duration per each individual
speaker, and the diversity of accents -- affect ASR robustness towards unseen
accents in a low-resource training regime. We observe that for a fixed number
of ASR training hours, it is more beneficial to increase the number of speakers
(which means each speaker contributes less) than the number of hours
contributed per speaker. We also observe that more speakers enables ASR
performance gains from scaling number of hours. Surprisingly, we observe
minimal benefits to prioritizing speakers with different accents when the
number of speakers is controlled. Our work suggests that practitioners should
prioritize increasing the speaker count in ASR training data composition for
new languages.

TL;DR: This paper proposes a method to decompose sentence embeddings into interpretable components using dictionary learning on token-level representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of human interpretability and traceability in the structure of sentence embeddings.

Method: Mechanistic decomposition of sentence embeddings using dictionary learning applied to token-level representations.

Result: The study reveals insights into the encoding of semantic and syntactic aspects in sentence embeddings, noting that many are linearly encoded.

Conclusion: The approach bridges token-level interpretability with sentence-level analysis, enhancing transparency and control in sentence embedding representations.

Abstract: Sentence embeddings are central to modern NLP and AI systems, yet little is
known about their internal structure. While we can compare these embeddings
using measures such as cosine similarity, the contributing features are not
human-interpretable, and the content of an embedding seems untraceable, as it
is masked by complex neural transformations and a final pooling operation that
combines individual token embeddings. To alleviate this issue, we propose a new
method to mechanistically decompose sentence embeddings into interpretable
components, by using dictionary learning on token-level representations. We
analyze how pooling compresses these features into sentence representations,
and assess the latent features that reside in a sentence embedding. This
bridges token-level mechanistic interpretability with sentence-level analysis,
making for more transparent and controllable representations. In our studies,
we obtain several interesting insights into the inner workings of sentence
embedding spaces, for instance, that many semantic and syntactic aspects are
linearly encoded in the embeddings.

TL;DR: The paper proposes HTC-CLIP, a novel architecture that synergizes two existing methods for hierarchical text classification, achieving better results using contrastive learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to enhance hierarchical text classification by combining two complementary methods to better capture label hierarchy characteristics.

Method: HTC-CLIP incorporates contrastive learning to blend hierarchy-aware text representation with text-informed path-guided hierarchy representation, pooling two sets of class probability distributions during inference.

Result: The proposed HTC-CLIP model outperforms state-of-the-art methods on two benchmark datasets, with Macro F1 score improvements ranging from 0.99% to 2.37%.

Conclusion: HTC-CLIP effectively combines two distinct approaches to hierarchical text classification, demonstrating that a unified architecture can deliver superior performance.

Abstract: Hierarchical Text Classification (HTC) has recently gained traction given the
ability to handle complex label hierarchy. This has found applications in
domains like E- commerce, customer care and medicine industry among other
real-world applications. Existing HTC models either encode label hierarchy
separately and mix it with text encoding or guide the label hierarchy structure
in the text encoder. Both approaches capture different characteristics of label
hierarchy and are complementary to each other. In this paper, we propose a
Hierarchical Text Classification using Contrastive Learning Informed Path
guided hierarchy (HTC-CLIP), which learns hierarchy-aware text representation
and text informed path guided hierarchy representation using contrastive
learning. During the training of HTC-CLIP, we learn two different sets of class
probabilities distributions and during inference, we use the pooled output of
both probabilities for each class to get the best of both representations. Our
results show that the two previous approaches can be effectively combined into
one architecture to achieve improved performance. Tests on two public benchmark
datasets showed an improvement of 0.99 - 2.37% in Macro F1 score using HTC-CLIP
over the existing state-of-the-art models.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limited effectiveness of LLMs for low-resource languages like Maltese and provide benchmarks and insights for these languages.

Method: Evaluated 55 LLMs using a newly created benchmark covering 11 discriminative and generative NLP tasks, paired with a multidimensional analysis of factors influencing performance.

Result: Most LLMs performed poorly on generative tasks, but smaller fine-tuned models frequently outperformed larger models across nearly all tasks. Prior exposure to Maltese was crucial for better results.

Conclusion: Fine-tuning is more reliable than prompting for low-resource languages despite initial costs. The authors emphasize the need for more inclusive language technologies leveraging traditional modeling.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across
various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, largely due to their
generalisability and ability to perform tasks without additional training.
However, their effectiveness for low-resource languages remains limited. In
this study, we evaluate the performance of 55 publicly available LLMs on
Maltese, a low-resource language, using a newly introduced benchmark covering
11 discriminative and generative tasks. Our experiments highlight that many
models perform poorly, particularly on generative tasks, and that smaller
fine-tuned models often perform better across all tasks. From our
multidimensional analysis, we investigate various factors impacting
performance. We conclude that prior exposure to Maltese during pre-training and
instruction-tuning emerges as the most important factor. We also examine the
trade-offs between fine-tuning and prompting, highlighting that while
fine-tuning requires a higher initial cost, it yields better performance and
lower inference costs. Through this work, we aim to highlight the need for more
inclusive language technologies and recommend that researchers working with
low-resource languages consider more "traditional" language modelling
approaches.

Motivation: The motivation is to improve intent classification in multilingual and multi-domain customer care scenarios, which is restricted by limited annotated domain-specific data. The goal is to create a model that generalizes efficiently across domains with reduced manual labeling.

Method: The authors propose an embedder-cum-classifier model that employs supervised fine-tuning with isotropic regularization to train a domain-specific sentence embedder and uses multilingual knowledge distillation for cross-domain adaptability. The deployable system relies on augmenting the trained embedder with a linear classifier.

Result: Experiments on Canada and Mexico's e-commerce customer care datasets for few-shot intent detection showed a 20-23% accuracy improvement over existing state-of-the-art pre-trained models.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively addresses data scarcity in multilingual and multi-domain intent classification, demonstrating the practicality of the embedder-cum-classifier model for customer care applications.

Abstract: Customer care is an essential pillar of the e-commerce shopping experience
with companies spending millions of dollars each year, employing automation and
human agents, across geographies (like US, Canada, Mexico, Chile), channels
(like Chat, Interactive Voice Response (IVR)), and languages (like English,
Spanish). SOTA pre-trained models like multilingual-BERT, fine-tuned on
annotated data have shown good performance in downstream tasks relevant to
Customer Care. However, model performance is largely subject to the
availability of sufficient annotated domain-specific data. Cross-domain
availability of data remains a bottleneck, thus building an intent classifier
that generalizes across domains (defined by channel, geography, and language)
with only a few annotations, is of great practical value. In this paper, we
propose an embedder-cum-classifier model architecture which extends
state-of-the-art domain-specific models to other domains with only a few
labeled samples. We adopt a supervised fine-tuning approach with isotropic
regularizers to train a domain-specific sentence embedder and a multilingual
knowledge distillation strategy to generalize this embedder across multiple
domains. The trained embedder, further augmented with a simple linear
classifier can be deployed for new domains. Experiments on Canada and Mexico
e-commerce Customer Care dataset with few-shot intent detection show an
increase in accuracy by 20-23% against the existing state-of-the-art
pre-trained models.

### [47] [Unpacking Let Alone: Human-Scale Models Generalize to a Rare Construction in Form but not Meaning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04408)
*Wesley Scivetti,Tatsuya Aoyama,Ethan Wilcox,Nathan Schneider*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates whether human-scale language models possess human-like abilities to generalize rare grammatical phenomena, focusing on the LET-ALONE construction's form and meaning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study examines whether recent large language models can generalize from frequent to rare grammatical constructions and understand their meanings, similar to human language learners.

Method: The researchers tested transformer-based language models on the rare LET-ALONE construction using a synthetic benchmark that evaluates both syntactic and semantic properties.

Result: Findings show that while language models are sensitive to the form of rare constructions, they fail to accurately generalize their meanings.

Conclusion: Current language models exhibit asymmetry in learning efficiency between linguistic form and meaning, in contrast to human language learners, suggesting limitations in their architecture.

Abstract: Humans have a remarkable ability to acquire and understand grammatical
phenomena that are seen rarely, if ever, during childhood. Recent evidence
suggests that language models with human-scale pretraining data may possess a
similar ability by generalizing from frequent to rare constructions. However,
it remains an open question how widespread this generalization ability is, and
to what extent this knowledge extends to meanings of rare constructions, as
opposed to just their forms. We fill this gap by testing human-scale
transformer language models on their knowledge of both the form and meaning of
the (rare and quirky) English LET-ALONE construction. To evaluate our LMs we
construct a bespoke synthetic benchmark that targets syntactic and semantic
properties of the construction. We find that human-scale LMs are sensitive to
form, even when related constructions are filtered from the dataset. However,
human-scale LMs do not make correct generalizations about LET-ALONE's meaning.
These results point to an asymmetry in the current architectures' sample
efficiency between language form and meaning, something which is not present in
human language learners.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces ZOES, a zero-shot method for extracting entity structures without predefined schemas or annotations, outperforming traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for extracting entity structures from text heavily depend on predefined schemas or labeled datasets, often leading to incomplete results.

Method: ZOES uses a mechanism of enrichment, refinement, and unification to extract entity structures in a zero-shot manner, leveraging the interdependence between entities and their structures.

Result: Experiments show ZOES improves LLMs' capability to extract more complete entity structures across multiple domains.

Conclusion: The enrichment, refinement, and unification mechanism proposed in ZOES appears to be a promising approach for enhancing LLM-based entity structure discovery.

Abstract: Entity structure extraction, which aims to extract entities and their
associated attribute-value structures from text, is an essential task for text
understanding and knowledge graph construction. Existing methods based on large
language models (LLMs) typically rely heavily on predefined entity attribute
schemas or annotated datasets, often leading to incomplete extraction results.
To address these challenges, we introduce Zero-Shot Open-schema Entity
Structure Discovery (ZOES), a novel approach to entity structure extraction
that does not require any schema or annotated samples. ZOES operates via a
principled mechanism of enrichment, refinement, and unification, based on the
insight that an entity and its associated structure are mutually reinforcing.
Experiments demonstrate that ZOES consistently enhances LLMs' ability to
extract more complete entity structures across three different domains,
showcasing both the effectiveness and generalizability of the method. These
findings suggest that such an enrichment, refinement, and unification mechanism
may serve as a principled approach to improving the quality of LLM-based entity
structure discovery in various scenarios.

### [50] [Watermarking Degrades Alignment in Language Models: Analysis and Mitigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04462)
*Apurv Verma,NhatHai Phan,Shubhendu Trivedi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper analyzes the effects of watermarking techniques on core alignment properties of large language models and proposes a sampling method to restore alignment while maintaining watermark detectability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the impact of popular watermarking techniques on truthfulness, safety, and helpfulness of aligned LLMs, and to address the degradation issues caused by watermarking.

Method: The paper examines two watermarking approaches (Gumbel and KGW) across four LLMs, identifies degradation patterns, and introduces Alignment Resampling (AR), a sampling method using external reward models.

Result: AR effectively recovers or surpasses the alignment scores of unwatermarked models while maintaining robust watermark detectability. A modified Gumbel implementation increases response diversity.

Conclusion: The study highlights the trade-offs between watermark strength and model alignment and offers a practical inference-time solution for deploying watermarked LLMs responsibly.

Abstract: Watermarking techniques for large language models (LLMs) can significantly
impact output quality, yet their effects on truthfulness, safety, and
helpfulness remain critically underexamined. This paper presents a systematic
analysis of how two popular watermarking approaches-Gumbel and KGW-affect these
core alignment properties across four aligned LLMs. Our experiments reveal two
distinct degradation patterns: guard attenuation, where enhanced helpfulness
undermines model safety, and guard amplification, where excessive caution
reduces model helpfulness. These patterns emerge from watermark-induced shifts
in token distribution, surfacing the fundamental tension that exists between
alignment objectives.
  To mitigate these degradations, we propose Alignment Resampling (AR), an
inference-time sampling method that uses an external reward model to restore
alignment. We establish a theoretical lower bound on the improvement in
expected reward score as the sample size is increased and empirically
demonstrate that sampling just 2-4 watermarked generations effectively recovers
or surpasses baseline (unwatermarked) alignment scores. To overcome the limited
response diversity of standard Gumbel watermarking, our modified implementation
sacrifices strict distortion-freeness while maintaining robust detectability,
ensuring compatibility with AR. Experimental results confirm that AR
successfully recovers baseline alignment in both watermarking approaches, while
maintaining strong watermark detectability. This work reveals the critical
balance between watermark strength and model alignment, providing a simple
inference-time solution to responsibly deploy watermarked LLMs in practice.

*Zhaoxuan Tan,Zheng Li,Tianyi Liu,Haodong Wang,Hyokun Yun,Ming Zeng,Pei Chen,Zhihan Zhang,Yifan Gao,Ruijie Wang,Priyanka Nigam,Bing Yin,Meng Jiang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces PUGC, a framework that uses implicit user preferences in user-generated content (UGC) to improve large language model alignment in a scalable manner, demonstrating significant performance gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for aligning large language models with human preferences depend heavily on curated datasets, which are costly and hard to scale. This paper aims to address this scalability issue by leveraging implicit preferences in user-generated content.

Method: The proposed framework, PUGC, extracts implicit preferences from unlabeled user-generated content. It uses this content to create user queries and evaluate the generated responses by comparing them to the UGC as a reference, enabling preference-driven model alignment.

Result: PUGC outperforms traditional approaches with a 9.37% performance improvement in Alpaca Eval 2. It also sets a 35.93% state-of-the-art length-controlled win rate using Mistral-7B-Instruct, showing improvements in domain-specific alignment, robustness, and theory of mind capabilities.

Conclusion: Leveraging implicit human preferences in UGC can serve as a scalable and effective approach for aligning large language models, achieving better performance and domain-specific adaptability.

Abstract: Learning from preference feedback is essential for aligning large language
models (LLMs) with human values and improving the quality of generated
responses. However, existing preference learning methods rely heavily on
curated data from humans or advanced LLMs, which is costly and difficult to
scale. In this work, we present PUGC, a novel framework that leverages implicit
human Preferences in unlabeled User-Generated Content (UGC) to generate
preference data. Although UGC is not explicitly created to guide LLMs in
generating human-preferred responses, it often reflects valuable insights and
implicit preferences from its creators that has the potential to address
readers' questions. PUGC transforms UGC into user queries and generates
responses from the policy model. The UGC is then leveraged as a reference text
for response scoring, aligning the model with these implicit preferences. This
approach improves the quality of preference data while enabling scalable,
domain-specific alignment. Experimental results on Alpaca Eval 2 show that
models trained with DPO and PUGC achieve a 9.37% performance improvement over
traditional methods, setting a 35.93% state-of-the-art length-controlled win
rate using Mistral-7B-Instruct. Further studies highlight gains in reward
quality, domain-specific alignment effectiveness, robustness against UGC
quality, and theory of mind capabilities. Our code and dataset are available at

### [52] [SQLens: An End-to-End Framework for Error Detection and Correction in Text-to-SQL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04494)
*Yue Gong,Chuan Lei,Xiao Qin,Kapil Vaidya,Balakrishnan Narayanaswamy,Tim Kraska*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes SQLens, a framework to detect and correct semantic errors in SQL queries generated by large language models, significantly improving error detection and execution accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Non-technical users rely on text-to-SQL systems to query structured data through natural language. However, existing systems, especially those using large language models (LLMs), often generate semantically incorrect SQL queries, and current solutions lack reliable methods to identify and rectify such errors.

Method: The researchers developed SQLens, an end-to-end system that integrates error signals from both the database and LLMs. This system identifies semantic errors in SQL clauses using fine-grained detection techniques and employs these signals to enable guided query correction.

Result: SQLens achieved a 25.78% improvement in F1 score for error detection compared to the best available LLM-based evaluation methods. Additionally, it increased execution accuracy of text-to-SQL systems by up to 20%.

Conclusion: SQLens effectively enhances the reliability of LLM-based text-to-SQL systems by providing advanced error detection and correction mechanisms, making them more accurate and user-friendly for non-technical users.

Abstract: Text-to-SQL systems translate natural language (NL) questions into SQL
queries, enabling non-technical users to interact with structured data. While
large language models (LLMs) have shown promising results on the text-to-SQL
task, they often produce semantically incorrect yet syntactically valid
queries, with limited insight into their reliability. We propose SQLens, an
end-to-end framework for fine-grained detection and correction of semantic
errors in LLM-generated SQL. SQLens integrates error signals from both the
underlying database and the LLM to identify potential semantic errors within
SQL clauses. It further leverages these signals to guide query correction.
Empirical results on two public benchmarks show that SQLens outperforms the
best LLM-based self-evaluation method by 25.78% in F1 for error detection, and
improves execution accuracy of out-of-the-box text-to-SQL systems by up to 20%.

### [53] [DRE: An Effective Dual-Refined Method for Integrating Small and Large Language Models in Open-Domain Dialogue Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04516)
*Kun Zhao,Bohao Yang,Chen Tang,Siyuan Dai,Haoteng Tang,Chenghua Lin,Liang Zhan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces SLIDE and DRE frameworks to synergize SLMs and LLMs for reliable dialogue evaluation, showcasing enhanced results through adaptive integration and dual refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with ambiguous situations, while SLMs are robust but vulnerable to adversarial inputs. Combining their strengths can improve reliability in tasks like dialogue evaluation.

Method: SLIDE integrates SLMs and LLMs via adaptive weighting, and DRE refines this approach by having SLM guide and adjust LLM evaluations for accuracy enhancement.

Result: Experiments validate that DRE surpasses existing evaluation methods, aligning more closely with human judgments across diverse benchmarks.

Conclusion: Integrating SLMs and LLMs can create a more reliable tool for open-ended, complex tasks like dialogue evaluation while capitalizing on their complementary strengths.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at many tasks but struggle with ambiguous
scenarios where multiple valid responses exist, often yielding unreliable
results. Conversely, Small Language Models (SLMs) demonstrate robustness in
such scenarios but are susceptible to misleading or adversarial inputs. We
observed that LLMs handle negative examples effectively, while SLMs excel with
positive examples. To leverage their complementary strengths, we introduce
SLIDE (Small and Large Integrated for Dialogue Evaluation), a method
integrating SLMs and LLMs via adaptive weighting. Building on SLIDE, we further
propose a Dual-Refinement Evaluation (DRE) method to enhance SLM-LLM
integration: (1) SLM-generated insights guide the LLM to produce initial
evaluations; (2) SLM-derived adjustments refine the LLM's scores for improved
accuracy. Experiments demonstrate that DRE outperforms existing methods,
showing stronger alignment with human judgment across diverse benchmarks. This
work illustrates how combining small and large models can yield more reliable
evaluation tools, particularly for open-ended tasks such as dialogue
evaluation.

*Di Wu,Seth Aycock,Christof Monz*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates the effectiveness of decomposition-based step-by-step translation strategies in large language models and finds simpler methods to be more effective.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether explicitly decomposing translation tasks with Chain-of-Thought reasoning or multi-step prompts truly improves translation performance.

Method: Analyzed multi-step prompting strategies and compared them with simpler re-translation prompting approaches to assess translation performance.

Result: Found no clear evidence supporting improved performance from decomposition strategies and demonstrated that simple 'translate again' prompts outperform explicit human-like step-by-step prompting.

Conclusion: The findings question the benefit of decomposition in translation tasks, urging further study into the factors contributing to Chain-of-Thought reasoning's effectiveness in this area.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong reasoning capabilities for
many tasks, often by explicitly decomposing the task via Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
reasoning. Recent work on LLM-based translation designs hand-crafted prompts to
decompose translation, or trains models to incorporate intermediate
steps.~\textit{Translating Step-by-step}~\citep{briakou2024translating}, for
instance, introduces a multi-step prompt with decomposition and refinement of
translation with LLMs, which achieved state-of-the-art results on WMT24. In
this work, we scrutinise this strategy's effectiveness. Empirically, we find no
clear evidence that performance gains stem from explicitly decomposing the
translation process, at least for the models on test; and we show that simply
prompting LLMs to ``translate again'' yields even better results than
human-like step-by-step prompting. Our analysis does not rule out the role of
reasoning, but instead invites future work exploring the factors for CoT's
effectiveness in the context of translation.

*William Sheffield,Kanishka Misra,Valentina Pyatkin,Ashwini Deo,Kyle Mahowald,Junyi Jessy Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores how large language models (LLMs) interpret different senses of the English particle 'just,' finding that they can identify broad categories but struggle with subtle distinctions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate the ability of LLMs to understand the nuanced and polyfunctional nature of discourse particles, specifically 'just,' which plays a significant role in shaping text meaning.

Method: The study employs data labeled by expert linguists to test LLMs’ capacity to distinguish fine-grained senses of 'just,' examining how well the models perform across subtle and broader meanings.

Result: LLMs show partial success, as they can distinguish broader categories in meaning, but they fail to reliably capture subtler distinctions in the uses of 'just.'

Conclusion: The study underscores a limitation in LLMs' comprehension of nuanced semantic and discourse roles, suggesting the need for further advancements in modeling discourse particles.

Abstract: Discourse particles are crucial elements that subtly shape the meaning of
text. These words, often polyfunctional, give rise to nuanced and often quite
disparate semantic/discourse effects, as exemplified by the diverse uses of the
particle "just" (e.g., exclusive, temporal, emphatic). This work investigates
the capacity of LLMs to distinguish the fine-grained senses of English "just",
a well-studied example in formal semantics, using data meticulously created and
labeled by expert linguists. Our findings reveal that while LLMs exhibit some
ability to differentiate between broader categories, they struggle to fully
capture more subtle nuances, highlighting a gap in their understanding of
discourse particles.

Motivation: To identify and analyze the performance of LLMs on questions that lack reasonable answers, challenging their robustness.

Method: A new benchmark and a method for modifying existing datasets were developed to test LLMs on unanswerable questions.

Result: The study reveals that current models perform poorly when confronted with such unanswerable questions.

Conclusion: Addressing the limitations of LLMs regarding unanswerable questions is critical for future model improvement.

Abstract: We propose that benchmarking LLMs on questions which have no reasonable
answer actually isn't as silly as it sounds. We also present a benchmark that
allows such testing and a method to modify the existing datasets, and discover
that existing models demonstrate a performance far from the perfect on such
questions. Our code and data artifacts are available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces SSA-MTE, a large-scale machine translation evaluation dataset tailored for 13 African languages, and proposes new metrics (SSA-COMET and SSA-COMET-QE) that outperform existing tools in low-resource settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address challenges in evaluating machine translation quality for under-resourced African languages, as existing metrics are limited in language coverage, dataset size, and performance on low-resource languages.

Method: The authors developed SSA-MTE, a dataset with over 63,000 sentence-level annotations for 13 African language pairs, and proposed new evaluation metrics (SSA-COMET and SSA-COMET-QE) to improve translation evaluations, alongside benchmarking LLM-based approaches.

Result: Experimental results show that SSA-COMET metrics significantly outperform existing tools like AfriCOMET, and are competitive with state-of-the-art LLMs, especially in low-resource languages like Twi, Luo, and Yoruba.

Conclusion: The study provides a robust dataset and metrics tailored for African languages, sets a new standard in evaluating low-resource machine translation, and shares all resources openly for further research and development.

Abstract: Evaluating machine translation (MT) quality for under-resourced African
languages remains a significant challenge, as existing metrics often suffer
from limited language coverage and poor performance in low-resource settings.
While recent efforts, such as AfriCOMET, have addressed some of the issues,
they are still constrained by small evaluation sets, a lack of publicly
available training data tailored to African languages, and inconsistent
performance in extremely low-resource scenarios. In this work, we introduce
SSA-MTE, a large-scale human-annotated MT evaluation (MTE) dataset covering 13
African language pairs from the News domain, with over 63,000 sentence-level
annotations from a diverse set of MT systems. Based on this data, we develop
SSA-COMET and SSA-COMET-QE, improved reference-based and reference-free
evaluation metrics. We also benchmark prompting-based approaches using
state-of-the-art LLMs like GPT-4o and Claude. Our experimental results show
that SSA-COMET models significantly outperform AfriCOMET and are competitive
with the strongest LLM (Gemini 2.5 Pro) evaluated in our study, particularly on
low-resource languages such as Twi, Luo, and Yoruba. All resources are released
under open licenses to support future research.

*Can Zheng,Yuhan Cao,Xiaoning Dong,Tianxing He*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper investigates integrity attacks in Multi-Agent Systems (MAS), where malicious agents manipulate interactions using prompt engineering to gain unfair advantages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study is motivated by the vulnerabilities of MAS to subtle manipulation by malicious agents, risking system integrity.

Method: Four types of integrity attacks are explored (
Scapegoater, Boaster, Self-Dealer, Free-Rider) through malicious prompt crafting and simulations to assess their impact on MAS.

Result: The attacks demonstrate effective manipulation of MAS behaviors and evasion of advanced LLM-based monitors like GPT-4o-mini, indicating significant flaws.

Conclusion: Robust security protocols, improved content validation mechanisms, and better risk scenario assessments are essential to safeguarding MAS against integrity attacks.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
natural language understanding, code generation, and complex planning.
Simultaneously, Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) have garnered attention for their
potential to enable cooperation among distributed agents. However, from a
multi-party perspective, MAS could be vulnerable to malicious agents that
exploit the system to serve self-interests without disrupting its core
functionality. This work explores integrity attacks where malicious agents
employ subtle prompt manipulation to bias MAS operations and gain various
benefits. Four types of attacks are examined: \textit{Scapegoater}, who
misleads the system monitor to underestimate other agents' contributions;
\textit{Boaster}, who misleads the system monitor to overestimate their own
performance; \textit{Self-Dealer}, who manipulates other agents to adopt
certain tools; and \textit{Free-Rider}, who hands off its own task to others.
We demonstrate that strategically crafted prompts can introduce systematic
biases in MAS behavior and executable instructions, enabling malicious agents
to effectively mislead evaluation systems and manipulate collaborative agents.
Furthermore, our attacks can bypass advanced LLM-based monitors, such as
GPT-4o-mini and o3-mini, highlighting the limitations of current detection
mechanisms. Our findings underscore the critical need for MAS architectures
with robust security protocols and content validation mechanisms, alongside
monitoring systems capable of comprehensive risk scenario assessment.

*Dimitris Vamvourellis,Dhagash Mehta*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study evaluates how large language models (LLMs) perform in zero-shot financial sentiment analysis, finding that intuitive, quick decision-making aligns better with human judgment than slower, reasoning-based approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the effectiveness of reasoning-based versus non-reasoning large language models (LLMs) in financial sentiment analysis and how they align with human-labeled data.

Method: Evaluated three proprietary LLMs and two smaller fine-tuned models across different prompting paradigms (simulating intuitive 'System 1' and deliberate 'System 2' thinking), using the Financial PhraseBank dataset.

Result: Surprisingly, the GPT-4o model without Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting performed best, while reasoning-based approaches introduced overthinking and yielded suboptimal predictions.

Conclusion: For financial sentiment classification, intuitive 'System 1' thinking aligns more closely with human judgment than deliberate 'System 2' reasoning, challenging the assumption that reasoning improves LLM decision-making in financial tasks.

Abstract: We investigate the effectiveness of large language models (LLMs), including
reasoning-based and non-reasoning models, in performing zero-shot financial
sentiment analysis. Using the Financial PhraseBank dataset annotated by domain
experts, we evaluate how various LLMs and prompting strategies align with
human-labeled sentiment in a financial context. We compare three proprietary
LLMs (GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, o3-mini) under different prompting paradigms that
simulate System 1 (fast and intuitive) or System 2 (slow and deliberate)
thinking and benchmark them against two smaller models (FinBERT-Prosus,
FinBERT-Tone) fine-tuned on financial sentiment analysis. Our findings suggest
that reasoning, either through prompting or inherent model design, does not
improve performance on this task. Surprisingly, the most accurate and
human-aligned combination of model and method was GPT-4o without any
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting. We further explore how performance is
impacted by linguistic complexity and annotation agreement levels, uncovering
that reasoning may introduce overthinking, leading to suboptimal predictions.
This suggests that for financial sentiment classification, fast, intuitive
"System 1"-like thinking aligns more closely with human judgment compared to
"System 2"-style slower, deliberative reasoning simulated by reasoning models
or CoT prompting. Our results challenge the default assumption that more
reasoning always leads to better LLM decisions, particularly in high-stakes
financial applications.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a benchmark, SCALe, to assess and improve large language models’ (LLMs) ability to handle diverse lexical expressions in logical reasoning. A new method, MenTaL, addresses identified deficiencies, improving LLM performance on such tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the unreliability of LLMs in handling lexical diversification when acting as translators for logical reasoning tasks, and they also highlight the insufficiency of existing benchmarks in representing this linguistic challenge.

Method: The authors propose SCALe, a benchmark for lexically diversified logical reasoning evaluation, and introduce MenTaL, a method where LLMs first construct a unification table for diverse expressions before performing logical translation. This method is implemented through in-context learning and supervised fine-tuning.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that LLMs struggle with lexically diverse text, confirming the issue highlighted by SCALe. The MenTaL approach significantly improves LLMs’ translation accuracy under such conditions.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that SCALe effectively exposes deficiencies in LLMs' handling of lexical diversity for logical reasoning tasks, and the new MenTaL method offers a promising solution to mitigate these limitations.

Abstract: Neuro-symbolic approaches combining large language models (LLMs) with solvers
excels in logical reasoning problems need long reasoning chains. In this
paradigm, LLMs serve as translators, converting natural language reasoning
problems into formal logic formulas. Then reliable symbolic solvers return
correct solutions. Despite their success, we find that LLMs, as translators,
struggle to handle lexical diversification, a common linguistic phenomenon,
indicating that LLMs as logic translators are unreliable in real-world
scenarios. Moreover, existing logical reasoning benchmarks lack lexical
diversity, failing to challenge LLMs' ability to translate such text and thus
obscuring this issue. In this work, we propose SCALe, a benchmark designed to
address this significant gap through **logic-invariant lexical
diversification**. By using LLMs to transform original benchmark datasets into
lexically diversified but logically equivalent versions, we evaluate LLMs'
ability to consistently map diverse expressions to uniform logical symbols on
these new datasets. Experiments using SCALe further confirm that current LLMs
exhibit deficiencies in this capability. Building directly on the deficiencies
identified through our benchmark, we propose a new method, MenTaL, to address
this limitation. This method guides LLMs to first construct a table unifying
diverse expressions before performing translation. Applying MenTaL through
in-context learning and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) significantly improves the
performance of LLM translators on lexically diversified text. Our code is now
available at https://github.com/wufeiwuwoshihua/LexicalDiver.

### [61] [Selecting Demonstrations for Many-Shot In-Context Learning via Gradient Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04579)
*Jianfei Zhang,Bei Li,Jun Bai,Rumei Li,Yanmeng Wang,Chenghua Lin,Wenge Rong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new demonstration selection method for many-shot in-context learning (ICL) using gradient matching, resulting in improved performance over random selection across multiple tasks and models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of selecting effective demonstrations for many-shot in-context learning, moving beyond random selection approaches.

Method: A gradient matching approach is developed, where demonstration examples are chosen by aligning fine-tuning gradients between the full training set and selected examples.

Result: The proposed method outperforms random selection across 9 datasets and several LLMs, achieving performance improvements of up to 4% on large open-source models like Qwen2.5-72B and Llama3-70B, and around 2% on closed-source models.

Conclusion: Gradient matching enhances the efficacy of many-shot ICL, rendering it more reliable for diverse applications and tasks.

Abstract: In-Context Learning (ICL) empowers Large Language Models (LLMs) for rapid
task adaptation without Fine-Tuning (FT), but its reliance on demonstration
selection remains a critical challenge. While many-shot ICL shows promising
performance through scaled demonstrations, the selection method for many-shot
demonstrations remains limited to random selection in existing work. Since the
conventional instance-level retrieval is not suitable for many-shot scenarios,
we hypothesize that the data requirements for in-context learning and
fine-tuning are analogous. To this end, we introduce a novel gradient matching
approach that selects demonstrations by aligning fine-tuning gradients between
the entire training set of the target task and the selected examples, so as to
approach the learning effect on the entire training set within the selected
examples. Through gradient matching on relatively small models, e.g.,
Qwen2.5-3B or Llama3-8B, our method consistently outperforms random selection
on larger LLMs from 4-shot to 128-shot scenarios across 9 diverse datasets. For
instance, it surpasses random selection by 4% on Qwen2.5-72B and Llama3-70B,
and by around 2% on 5 closed-source LLMs. This work unlocks more reliable and
effective many-shot ICL, paving the way for its broader application.

### [62] [SUCEA: Reasoning-Intensive Retrieval for Adversarial Fact-checking through Claim Decomposition and Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04583)
*Hongjun Liu,Yilun Zhao,Arman Cohan,Chen Zhao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes SUCEA, a training-free modular framework for improving automatic fact-checking of adversarial claims.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enhance automatic fact-checking systems, which struggle with adversarial claims that are designed to challenge their capabilities.

Method: The SUCEA framework has three steps: 1) Segments adversarial claims into sub-claims, 2) Iteratively retrieves evidence and refines claims for easier fact retrieval, 3) Aggregates evidence and predicts entailment labels to verify claims.

Result: SUCEA significantly outperforms previous methods in evidence retrieval and entailment label accuracy across two challenging fact-checking datasets.

Conclusion: SUCEA addresses critical challenges in fact-checking adversarial claims without requiring additional training, advancing the capabilities of misinformation detection systems.

Abstract: Automatic fact-checking has recently received more attention as a means of
combating misinformation. Despite significant advancements, fact-checking
systems based on retrieval-augmented language models still struggle to tackle
adversarial claims, which are intentionally designed by humans to challenge
fact-checking systems. To address these challenges, we propose a training-free
method designed to rephrase the original claim, making it easier to locate
supporting evidence. Our modular framework, SUCEA, decomposes the task into
three steps: 1) Claim Segmentation and Decontextualization that segments
adversarial claims into independent sub-claims; 2) Iterative Evidence Retrieval
and Claim Editing that iteratively retrieves evidence and edits the subclaim
based on the retrieved evidence; 3) Evidence Aggregation and Label Prediction
that aggregates all retrieved evidence and predicts the entailment label.
Experiments on two challenging fact-checking datasets demonstrate that our
framework significantly improves on both retrieval and entailment label
accuracy, outperforming four strong claim-decomposition-based baselines.

*Yash Kumar Lal,Manikanta Bandham,Mohammad Saqib Hasan,Apoorva Kashi,Mahnaz Koupaee,Niranjan Balasubramanian*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces MuSciClaims, a benchmark for testing claim verification with multimodal data from scientific figures, and diagnostic tasks to analyze model failures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of multimodal benchmarks directly testing claim verification on scientific literature data, especially involving figures.

Method: They generated MuSciClaims by extracting claims from scientific articles and introducing specific perturbations to create contradicted claims, alongside diagnostic tasks to evaluate model failures in localization, aggregation, and figure understanding.

Result: Vision-language models generally performed poorly (F1 scores ranging from 0.3 to 0.77) and exhibited biases in claim judgment and difficulties understanding nuanced challenges.

Conclusion: Current models lack robust multimodal reasoning necessary for claim verification, signaling the need for improved models and methodologies to bridge these gaps.

Abstract: Assessing scientific claims requires identifying, extracting, and reasoning
with multimodal data expressed in information-rich figures in scientific
literature. Despite the large body of work in scientific QA, figure captioning,
and other multimodal reasoning tasks over chart-based data, there are no
readily usable multimodal benchmarks that directly test claim verification
abilities. To remedy this gap, we introduce a new benchmark MuSciClaims
accompanied by diagnostics tasks. We automatically extract supported claims
from scientific articles, which we manually perturb to produce contradicted
claims. The perturbations are designed to test for a specific set of claim
verification capabilities. We also introduce a suite of diagnostic tasks that
help understand model failures. Our results show most vision-language models
are poor (~0.3-0.5 F1), with even the best model only achieving 0.77 F1. They
are also biased towards judging claims as supported, likely misunderstanding
nuanced perturbations within the claims. Our diagnostics show models are bad at
localizing correct evidence within figures, struggle with aggregating
information across modalities, and often fail to understand basic components of
the figure.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address inaccuracies in pseudo-labeled data from speech recognition and translation systems, and maximize LLM knowledge transfer for better performance.

Method: LESS refines pseudo-labeled text using LLMs, incorporates a data filtering strategy, and optimizes the process across various configurations and tasks.

Result: LESS demonstrated a 3.77% absolute WER reduction in Mandarin ASR and impressive BLEU scores on Spanish-English AST tasks, showing cross-lingual and domain adaptability.

Conclusion: The framework is effective in leveraging LLMs to enhance pseudo-labeled data for various speech processing applications and offers insights through thorough ablation studies.

Abstract: We introduce LESS (Large Language Model Enhanced Semi-supervised Learning), a
versatile framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to correct
pseudo labels generated from in-the-wild data. Within the LESS framework,
pseudo-labeled text from Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) or Automatic Speech
Translation (AST) of the unsupervised data is refined by an LLM, and augmented
by a data filtering strategy to optimize LLM knowledge transfer efficiency.
Experiments on both Mandarin ASR and Spanish-to-English AST tasks show that
LESS achieves a notable absolute WER reduction of 3.77% on the Wenet Speech
test set, as well as BLEU scores of 34.0 and 64.7 on Callhome and Fisher test
sets respectively. These results validate the adaptability of LESS across
different languages, tasks, and domains. Ablation studies conducted with
various LLMs and prompt configurations provide novel insights into leveraging
LLM-derived knowledge for speech processing applications.

*Chengwu Liu,Ye Yuan,Yichun Yin,Yan Xu,Xin Xu,Zaoyu Chen,Yasheng Wang,Lifeng Shang,Qun Liu,Ming Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel formal verification framework named $Safe$ to address hallucinations in Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning by using formal mathematical language Lean 4 to verify reasoning steps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the difficulty in detecting hallucinations in Chain-of-Thought prompting, as current methods like process reward models and self-consistency lack checkable evidence, reducing their reliability.

Method: The authors propose $Safe$, a step-aware formal verification framework that translates reasoning steps into formal mathematical language Lean 4 and provides formal proofs to identify and mitigate hallucinations.

Result: The framework $Safe$ demonstrated significant performance improvements across various LLMs and mathematical datasets, with interpretable and verifiable evidence. Additionally, the authors created a benchmark named $FormalStep$ with 30,809 formal statements for theorem proving.

Conclusion: This work is the first to utilize Lean 4 for verifying natural language reasoning by LLMs, offering a robust foundation for mitigating hallucinations and advancing the interpretability of mathematical proofs in language models.

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has become the de facto method to elicit
reasoning capabilities from large language models (LLMs). However, to mitigate
hallucinations in CoT that are notoriously difficult to detect, current methods
such as process reward models (PRMs) or self-consistency operate as opaque
boxes and do not provide checkable evidence for their judgments, possibly
limiting their effectiveness. To address this issue, we draw inspiration from
the idea that "the gold standard for supporting a mathematical claim is to
provide a proof". We propose a retrospective, step-aware formal verification
framework $Safe$. Rather than assigning arbitrary scores, we strive to
articulate mathematical claims in formal mathematical language Lean 4 at each
reasoning step and provide formal proofs to identify hallucinations. We
evaluate our framework $Safe$ across multiple language models and various
mathematical datasets, demonstrating a significant performance improvement
while offering interpretable and verifiable evidence. We also propose
$FormalStep$ as a benchmark for step correctness theorem proving with $30,809$
formal statements. To the best of our knowledge, our work represents the first
endeavor to utilize formal mathematical language Lean 4 for verifying natural
language content generated by LLMs, aligning with the reason why formal
mathematical languages were created in the first place: to provide a robust
foundation for hallucination-prone human-written proofs.

*Firoz Shaik,Mobashir Sadat,Nikita Gautam,Doina Caragea,Cornelia Caragea*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new benchmark, MISMATCHED, for Scientific Natural Language Inference across three non-CS domains with 2,700 annotated sentence pairs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current datasets for Scientific NLI focus only on computer science domains, leaving non-CS domains underrepresented.

Method: They created MISMATCHED with human-annotated sentence pairs from psychology, engineering, and public health domains, and tested performance on Pre-trained Small and Large Language Models.

Result: The best-performing baseline achieved a Macro F1 score of 78.17%, highlighting ample room for improvement in scientific NLI tasks.

Conclusion: The dataset and findings encourage advancements in NLI across diverse domains, with the dataset and code openly available for further research.

Abstract: Scientific Natural Language Inference (NLI) is the task of predicting the
semantic relation between a pair of sentences extracted from research articles.
Existing datasets for this task are derived from various computer science (CS)
domains, whereas non-CS domains are completely ignored. In this paper, we
introduce a novel evaluation benchmark for scientific NLI, called MISMATCHED.
The new MISMATCHED benchmark covers three non-CS domains-PSYCHOLOGY,
ENGINEERING, and PUBLIC HEALTH, and contains 2,700 human annotated sentence
pairs. We establish strong baselines on MISMATCHED using both Pre-trained Small
Language Models (SLMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs). Our best performing
baseline shows a Macro F1 of only 78.17% illustrating the substantial headroom
for future improvements. In addition to introducing the MISMATCHED benchmark,
we show that incorporating sentence pairs having an implicit scientific NLI
relation between them in model training improves their performance on
scientific NLI. We make our dataset and code publicly available on GitHub.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the reasoning capability of Large Language Models during inference by leveraging additional compute and addressing the diversity limitation in reasoning-optimized models.

Method: The authors categorize TTS methods into sampling-based, search-based, and trajectory optimization strategies. They introduce ADAPT, which applies prefix tuning with a diversity-aware data strategy to improve reasoning performance.

Result: ADAPT exhibits 80% accuracy on mathematical reasoning tasks while requiring eight times less compute than competing baselines.

Conclusion: Generative diversity is critical for improving TTS effectiveness, and the proposed ADAPT method provides a lightweight, efficient solution for addressing this challenge.

Abstract: Test-Time Scaling (TTS) improves the reasoning performance of Large Language
Models (LLMs) by allocating additional compute during inference. We conduct a
structured survey of TTS methods and categorize them into sampling-based,
search-based, and trajectory optimization strategies. We observe that
reasoning-optimized models often produce less diverse outputs, which limits TTS
effectiveness. To address this, we propose ADAPT (A Diversity Aware Prefix
fine-Tuning), a lightweight method that applies prefix tuning with a
diversity-focused data strategy. Experiments on mathematical reasoning tasks
show that ADAPT reaches 80% accuracy using eight times less compute than strong
baselines. Our findings highlight the essential role of generative diversity in
maximizing TTS effectiveness.

*Likun Cao,Rui Pan,James Evans*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper examines personal and interpersonal innovation opportunities using machine learning, focusing on innovators' positions within conceptual spaces formed by dynamic language models. Observational and simulated data reveal relationships between perspective/background diversity and creative success.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to understand how innovators' subjective perspectives and interpersonal dynamics influence creative achievements, shifting attention from static social structures to dynamic trajectories shaped by past experiences.

Method: The study quantifies innovators' perspectives using dynamic language representations and analyzes millions of individuals across diverse domains. It incorporates observational datasets and simulations of AI collaborations with varied diversity traits.

Result: Subjective perspectives predict creative achievements, with perspective diversity driving success while background diversity tends to hinder it. These patterns hold across multiple domains and time periods.

Conclusion: The findings suggest that successful collaborations arise from leveraging common language among diverse experiences via provocation and convergence. This insight has implications for team assembly and research policies.

Abstract: Existing studies of innovation emphasize the power of social structures to
shape innovation capacity. Emerging machine learning approaches, however,
enable us to model innovators' personal perspectives and interpersonal
innovation opportunities as a function of their prior trajectories of
experience. We theorize then quantify subjective perspectives and innovation
opportunities based on innovator positions within the geometric space of
concepts inscribed by dynamic language representations. Using data on millions
of scientists, inventors, writers, entrepreneurs, and Wikipedia contributors
across the creative domains of science, technology, film, entrepreneurship, and
Wikipedia, here we show that measured subjective perspectives anticipate what
ideas individuals and groups creatively attend to and successfully combine in
future. When perspective and background diversity are decomposed as the angular
difference between collaborators' perspectives on their creation and between
their experiences, the former consistently anticipates creative achievement
while the latter portends its opposite, across all cases and time periods
examined. We analyze a natural experiment and simulate creative collaborations
between AI (large language model) agents designed with various perspective and
background diversity, which are consistent with our observational findings. We
explore mechanisms underlying these findings and identify how successful
collaborators leverage common language to weave together diverse experience
obtained through trajectories of prior work that converge to provoke one
another and innovate. We explore the importance of these findings for team
assembly and research policy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current word embeddings lack optimization for sentence-level semantic representation, necessitating improvements in efficiency and effectiveness for tasks like monolingual and cross-lingual evaluation.

Method: Extract word embeddings from pre-trained Sentence Transformers, enhance them using sentence-level principal component analysis, and apply either knowledge distillation or contrastive learning. Sentences are represented by averaging these embeddings during inference.

Result: The proposed models outperformed existing static models on sentence semantic tasks and rivaled a basic Sentence Transformer (SimCSE) on specific datasets.

Conclusion: The approach removes irrelevant components from word embeddings and adjusts vector norms to enhance sentence semantics, showcasing its efficacy in a variety of analyses.

Abstract: We propose new static word embeddings optimised for sentence semantic
representation. We first extract word embeddings from a pre-trained Sentence
Transformer, and improve them with sentence-level principal component analysis,
followed by either knowledge distillation or contrastive learning. During
inference, we represent sentences by simply averaging word embeddings, which
requires little computational cost. We evaluate models on both monolingual and
cross-lingual tasks and show that our model substantially outperforms existing
static models on sentence semantic tasks, and even rivals a basic Sentence
Transformer model (SimCSE) on some data sets. Lastly, we perform a variety of
analyses and show that our method successfully removes word embedding
components that are irrelevant to sentence semantics, and adjusts the vector
norms based on the influence of words on sentence semantics.

TL;DR: Tool-MVR is a novel tool-augmented language model that improves AI's tool usage reliability and error correction abilities through high-quality datasets and advanced learning paradigms, outperforming existing models significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of unreliable tool planning and weak error correction in AI agents, enabling them to solve complex problems more effectively.

Method: Two innovations: (1) A Multi-Agent Meta-Verification pipeline to create ToolBench-V, a high-quality instruction dataset; and (2) Exploration-based Reflection Learning to improve error correction, resulting in the ToolBench-R dataset.

Result: Tool-MVR achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing models like ToolLLM and GPT-4, significantly reducing API calls and achieving a high error correction rate.

Conclusion: The proposed Tool-MVR model demonstrates robust capabilities in leveraging tools and correcting errors, addressing critical limitations in current tool-augmented AI models.

Abstract: Empowering large language models (LLMs) with effective tool utilization
capabilities is crucial for enabling AI agents to solve complex problems.
However, current models face two major limitations: (1) unreliable tool
planning and invocation due to low-quality instruction datasets (e.g.,
widespread hallucinated API calls), and (2) weak tool reflection abilities
(over 90% of errors cannot be corrected) resulting from static imitation
learning. To address these critical limitations, we propose Tool-MVR, a novel
Tool-Augmented LLM that achieves comprehensive System 2 reasoning through two
key innovations. Specifically, we first introduce Multi-Agent Meta-Verification
(MAMV), a systematic pipeline that rigorously validates APIs, queries, and
reasoning trajectories to construct ToolBench-V, a new high-quality instruction
dataset that addresses the limitation of unreliable tool planning and
invocation. Second, we propose Exploration-based Reflection Learning (EXPLORE),
which enhances tool reflection capabilities by leveraging tool feedback through
a dynamic "Error -> Reflection -> Correction" learning paradigm, resulting in
our reflection dataset ToolBench-R and addressing the critical weakness in tool
reflection. Finally, we obtain Tool-MVR by finetuning open-source LLMs (e.g.,
Qwen-7B) on both ToolBench-V and ToolBench-R. Our experiments demonstrate that
Tool-MVR achieves state-of-the-art performance on StableToolBench, surpassing
both ToolLLM (by 23.9%) and GPT-4 (by 15.3%) while reducing API calls by 31.4%,
with strong generalization capabilities across unseen tools and scenarios.
Additionally, on our proposed RefineToolBench, the first benchmark specifically
designed to evaluate tool reflection capabilities, Tool-MVR achieves a 58.9%
error correction rate, significantly outperforming ToolLLM's 9.1%.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes an efficient method for generating Audio-Visual Speech Recognition (AVSR) datasets from raw video to make AVSR more accessible, particularly for under-resourced languages, and demonstrates its application with a Vietnamese model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional speech recognition systems struggle in noisy environments, and AVSR provides enhanced robustness. However, the scarcity of AVSR datasets for languages other than English limits its widespread usability. Automated data collection aims to address this challenge.

Method: The authors refine existing techniques to create AVSR datasets automatically from raw video and apply this method specifically for Vietnamese language to evaluate its performance.

Result: The automatically collected dataset enables the development of a strong Vietnamese AVSR model, which performs competitively in clean conditions and surpasses audio-only ASR models in noisy environments.

Conclusion: This efficient dataset generation method facilitates extending AVSR to under-resourced languages, proving its potential to broaden global applicability.

Abstract: Audio-Visual Speech Recognition (AVSR) has gained significant attention
recently due to its robustness against noise, which often challenges
conventional speech recognition systems that rely solely on audio features.
Despite this advantage, AVSR models remain limited by the scarcity of extensive
datasets, especially for most languages beyond English. Automated data
collection offers a promising solution. This work presents a practical approach
to generate AVSR datasets from raw video, refining existing techniques for
improved efficiency and accessibility. We demonstrate its broad applicability
by developing a baseline AVSR model for Vietnamese. Experiments show the
automatically collected dataset enables a strong baseline, achieving
competitive performance with robust ASR in clean conditions and significantly
outperforming them in noisy environments like cocktail parties. This efficient
method provides a pathway to expand AVSR to more languages, particularly
under-resourced ones.

*Vinay Joshi,Pratik Prabhanjan Brahma,Zicheng Liu,Emad Barsoum*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces TaDA, a training-free method for compressing key-value (KV) caches in transformers, achieving major memory reductions and comparable accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing memory demands of the KV cache in transformer models create difficulties in scaling language models efficiently during inference, especially with longer sequence lengths.

Method: The approach, TaDA, involves a quantization strategy that adapts to error sensitivity across layers and eliminates the need to manage outliers by mean-centering KV activations.

Result: TaDA reduced KV cache memory to 27% of the original size (16-bit) while maintaining accuracy comparable to uncompressed methods, across multiple models and context lengths.

Conclusion: TaDA offers a scalable solution for transformer-based models, reducing memory requirements significantly, and enabling efficient inference for longer context and reasoning tasks.

Abstract: The key-value (KV) cache in transformer models is a critical component for
efficient decoding or inference, yet its memory demands scale poorly with
sequence length, posing a major challenge for scalable deployment of large
language models. Among several approaches to KV cache compression, quantization
of key and value activations has been widely explored. Most KV cache
quantization methods still need to manage sparse and noncontiguous outliers
separately. To address this, we introduce TaDA, a training-free recipe for KV
cache compression with quantization precision that adapts to error sensitivity
across layers and a mean centering to eliminate separate outlier handling. Our
approach yields substantial accuracy improvements for multiple models
supporting various context lengths. Moreover, our approach does not need to
separately manage outlier elements -- a persistent hurdle in most traditional
quantization methods. Experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that our
technique reduces KV cache memory footprint to 27% of the original 16-bit
baseline while achieving comparable accuracy. Our method paves the way for
scalable and high-performance reasoning in language models by potentially
enabling inference for longer context length models, reasoning models, and
longer chain of thoughts.

TL;DR: Flex-TravelPlanner benchmark evaluates LLMs in dynamic planning scenarios with sequential and competing constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks fail to assess LLMs' adaptability in real-world dynamic planning issues.

Method: Introduces new evaluation settings to test sequential constraints and prioritized competing constraints.

Result: Analysis shows poor multi-turn adaptability, sensitivity to constraint order, and difficulty in prioritization.

Conclusion: Enhancing the realism in benchmarks can improve LLM capabilities in complex planning tasks.

Abstract: Real-world planning problems require constant adaptation to changing
requirements and balancing of competing constraints. However, current
benchmarks for evaluating LLMs' planning capabilities primarily focus on
static, single-turn scenarios. We introduce Flex-TravelPlanner, a benchmark
that evaluates language models' ability to reason flexibly in dynamic planning
scenarios. Building on the TravelPlanner dataset~\citep{xie2024travelplanner},
we introduce two novel evaluation settings: (1) sequential constraint
introduction across multiple turns, and (2) scenarios with explicitly
prioritized competing constraints. Our analysis of GPT-4o and Llama 3.1 70B
reveals several key findings: models' performance on single-turn tasks poorly
predicts their ability to adapt plans across multiple turns; constraint
introduction order significantly affects performance; and models struggle with
constraint prioritization, often incorrectly favoring newly introduced lower
priority preferences over existing higher-priority constraints. These findings
highlight the importance of evaluating LLMs in more realistic, dynamic planning
scenarios and suggest specific directions for improving model performance on
complex planning tasks. The code and dataset for our framework are publicly
available at https://github.com/juhyunohh/FlexTravelBench.

*Raphaël Millière*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper identifies a critical flaw in current AI alignment methods for large language models, highlighting their vulnerability to adversarial exploitation due to lack of genuine normative deliberation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by concerns about the safe deployment of increasingly capable AI systems, particularly large language models, and questions the adequacy of existing alignment strategies to prevent misuse.

Method: The analysis draws from moral psychology research to compare human normative reasoning with LLM behavior and evaluates the limitations of these models in resolving normative conflicts.

Result: The research identifies that current alignment methods instill shallow behavioral dispositions in LLMs rather than robust deliberative reasoning skills, leaving them vulnerable to adversarial attacks.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that existing approaches to aligning LLMs are inadequate for ensuring AI systems' safety, with broader implications for AI regulation and efforts toward mitigating harm.

Abstract: The progress of AI systems such as large language models (LLMs) raises
increasingly pressing concerns about their safe deployment. This paper examines
the value alignment problem for LLMs, arguing that current alignment strategies
are fundamentally inadequate to prevent misuse. Despite ongoing efforts to
instill norms such as helpfulness, honesty, and harmlessness in LLMs through
fine-tuning based on human preferences, they remain vulnerable to adversarial
attacks that exploit conflicts between these norms. I argue that this
vulnerability reflects a fundamental limitation of existing alignment methods:
they reinforce shallow behavioral dispositions rather than endowing LLMs with a
genuine capacity for normative deliberation. Drawing from on research in moral
psychology, I show how humans' ability to engage in deliberative reasoning
enhances their resilience against similar adversarial tactics. LLMs, by
contrast, lack a robust capacity to detect and rationally resolve normative
conflicts, leaving them susceptible to manipulation; even recent advances in
reasoning-focused LLMs have not addressed this vulnerability. This ``shallow
alignment'' problem carries significant implications for AI safety and
regulation, suggesting that current approaches are insufficient for mitigating
potential harms posed by increasingly capable AI systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces REWIRE, a method to transform low-quality web texts into valuable pre-training data for language models, improving performance across various tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the "data wall" caused by the limited availability of high-quality text and the inefficiency of existing data filtering pipelines during pre-training.

Method: REWIRE enriches low-quality web documents through guided rewriting, enabling their use in pre-training datasets alongside high-quality data.

Result: Empirical results show REWIRE improves task performance of LMs by up to 2.5% compared to standard filtered web data and outperforms synthetic data generation methods.

Conclusion: Recycling web texts is a promising and efficient strategy for scaling pre-training datasets, enhancing model performance while leveraging discarded low-quality data.

Abstract: Scaling laws predict that the performance of large language models improves
with increasing model size and data size. In practice, pre-training has been
relying on massive web crawls, using almost all data sources publicly available
on the internet so far. However, this pool of natural data does not grow at the
same rate as the compute supply. Furthermore, the availability of high-quality
texts is even more limited: data filtering pipelines often remove up to 99% of
the initial web scrapes to achieve state-of-the-art. To address the "data wall"
of pre-training scaling, our work explores ways to transform and recycle data
discarded in existing filtering processes. We propose REWIRE, REcycling the Web
with guIded REwrite, a method to enrich low-quality documents so that they
could become useful for training. This in turn allows us to increase the
representation of synthetic data in the final pre-training set. Experiments at
1B, 3B and 7B scales of the DCLM benchmark show that mixing high-quality raw
texts and our rewritten texts lead to 1.0, 1.3 and 2.5 percentage points
improvement respectively across 22 diverse tasks, compared to training on only
filtered web data. Training on the raw-synthetic data mix is also more
effective than having access to 2x web data. Through further analysis, we
demonstrate that about 82% of the mixed in texts come from transforming
lower-quality documents that would otherwise be discarded. REWIRE also
outperforms related approaches of generating synthetic data, including
Wikipedia-style paraphrasing, question-answer synthesizing and knowledge
extraction. These results suggest that recycling web texts holds the potential
for being a simple and effective approach for scaling pre-training data.

### [77] [Cracking the Code: Enhancing Implicit Hate Speech Detection through Coding Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04693)
*Lu Wei,Liangzhi Li,Tong Xiang,Xiao Liu,Noa Garcia*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper addresses the challenge of detecting subtle implicit hate speech (im-HS) online by introducing a taxonomy of encoding strategies termed codetypes and employing large language models (LLMs) for enhanced detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study is motivated by limitations in detecting implicit hate speech, which poses a risk to social harmony and personal well-being compared to explicit hate speech detection systems that are more effective.

Method: The researchers developed a taxonomy with six encoding strategies (codetypes) to improve im-HS detection and introduced two methods to leverage LLMs: prompting them to classify sentences based on responses and embedding codetypes during the LLM encoding process.

Result: Experimental results show that integrating codetypes improves detection of implicit hate speech in both English and Chinese datasets.

Conclusion: The incorporation of codetypes with LLMs enhances the ability to detect implicit hate speech across languages, addressing a critical gap in current automatic detection methods.

Abstract: The internet has become a hotspot for hate speech (HS), threatening societal
harmony and individual well-being. While automatic detection methods perform
well in identifying explicit hate speech (ex-HS), they struggle with more
subtle forms, such as implicit hate speech (im-HS). We tackle this problem by
introducing a new taxonomy for im-HS detection, defining six encoding
strategies named codetypes. We present two methods for integrating codetypes
into im-HS detection: 1) prompting large language models (LLMs) directly to
classify sentences based on generated responses, and 2) using LLMs as encoders
with codetypes embedded during the encoding process. Experiments show that the
use of codetypes improves im-HS detection in both Chinese and English datasets,
validating the effectiveness of our approach across different languages.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces STAND (STochastic Adaptive N-gram Drafting), a model-free speculative decoding method that speeds up language model reasoning while maintaining accuracy, reducing inference latency by 60-65%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current reasoning tasks using language models achieve high performance through computationally intensive methods like best-of-N sampling, which creates a trade-off between computational resource demands and reasoning efficiency.

Method: STAND employs model-free speculative decoding using stochastic drafting, a memory-efficient logit-based N-gram module, and optimized Gumbel-Top-K sampling for predicting reasoning tasks without requiring additional model training. It identifies reused reasoning patterns for token prediction efficiency.

Result: STAND demonstrated significant latency reduction (60–65%) and improved throughput (14–28%) in various reasoning benchmarks, outperforming existing speculative decoding methods and maintaining high accuracy.

Conclusion: STAND is an efficient, plug-and-play decoding solution that improves language model reasoning performance while requiring no additional training, addressing both computational efficiency and accuracy concerns.

Abstract: Language models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in reasoning tasks
through test-time scaling techniques like best-of-N sampling and tree search.
However, these approaches often demand substantial computational resources,
creating a critical trade-off between performance and efficiency. We introduce
STAND (STochastic Adaptive N-gram Drafting), a novel model-free speculative
decoding approach that leverages the inherent redundancy in reasoning
trajectories to achieve significant acceleration without compromising accuracy.
Our analysis reveals that reasoning paths frequently reuse similar reasoning
patterns, enabling efficient model-free token prediction without requiring
separate draft models. By introducing stochastic drafting and preserving
probabilistic information through a memory-efficient logit-based N-gram module,
combined with optimized Gumbel-Top-K sampling and data-driven tree
construction, STAND significantly improves token acceptance rates. Extensive
evaluations across multiple models and reasoning tasks (AIME-2024,
GPQA-Diamond, and LiveCodeBench) demonstrate that STAND reduces inference
latency by 60-65% compared to standard autoregressive decoding while
maintaining accuracy. Furthermore, STAND outperforms state-of-the-art
speculative decoding methods by 14-28% in throughput and shows strong
performance even in single-trajectory scenarios, reducing inference latency by
48-58%. As a model-free approach, STAND can be applied to any existing language
model without additional training, being a powerful plug-and-play solution for
accelerating language model reasoning.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper focuses on low-resource speech translation between Bhojpuri and Hindi, leveraging the SeamlessM4T model with hyperparameter optimization and data augmentation techniques, achieving improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of translating in low-resource language pairs, such as Bhojpuri-Hindi, and improving translation quality through model tuning and augmentation.

Method: The authors used fine-tuning of the SeamlessM4T model, hyperparameter optimization (learning rates, batch sizes, label smoothing, etc.), data augmentations like speed perturbation and SpecAugment, and cross-lingual joint training with Marathi data.

Result: Experiments show that optimized hyperparameters and applied data augmentation enhance the translation performance significantly. Joint training with related languages also added value.

Conclusion: Low-resource speech translation platforms can achieve better translations with careful model tuning, augmentation, and leveraging cross-lingual data. Error analysis highlights key areas for improvement in translation quality, especially reflected in BLEU scores.

Abstract: This paper presents the submission of IIITH-BUT to the IWSLT 2025 shared task
on speech translation for the low-resource Bhojpuri-Hindi language pair. We
explored the impact of hyperparameter optimisation and data augmentation
techniques on the performance of the SeamlessM4T model fine-tuned for this
specific task. We systematically investigated a range of hyperparameters
including learning rate schedules, number of update steps, warm-up steps, label
smoothing, and batch sizes; and report their effect on translation quality. To
address data scarcity, we applied speed perturbation and SpecAugment and
studied their effect on translation quality. We also examined the use of
cross-lingual signal through joint training with Marathi and Bhojpuri speech
data. Our experiments reveal that careful selection of hyperparameters and the
application of simple yet effective augmentation techniques significantly
improve performance in low-resource settings. We also analysed the translation
hypotheses to understand various kinds of errors that impacted the translation
quality in terms of BLEU.

### [80] [SPARTA ALIGNMENT: Collectively Aligning Multiple Language Models through Combat](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04721)
*Yuru Jiang,Wenxuan Ding,Shangbin Feng,Greg Durrett,Yulia Tsvetkov*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SPARTA ALIGNMENT introduces a framework where multiple LLMs compete and evaluate each other to improve collectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address diversity shortcomings and biases of individual LLMs in generation and evaluation processes.

Method: LLMs form a competitive group where two models duel on tasks, judged by peers, with reputation-based scoring and iterative learning from outcomes.

Result: SPARTA ALIGNMENT improves task performance by 7.0% on average across 10 out of 12 tasks, excelling in generalization to unseen scenarios.

Conclusion: The algorithm shown enhances LLMs' collective performance, utilizing diversity and self-evolution processes effectively.

Abstract: We propose SPARTA ALIGNMENT, an algorithm to collectively align multiple LLMs
through competition and combat. To complement a single model's lack of
diversity in generation and biases in evaluation, multiple LLMs form a "sparta
tribe" to compete against each other in fulfilling instructions while serving
as judges for the competition of others. For each iteration, one instruction
and two models are selected for a duel, the other models evaluate the two
responses, and their evaluation scores are aggregated through a adapted
elo-ranking based reputation system, where winners/losers of combat gain/lose
weight in evaluating others. The peer-evaluated combat results then become
preference pairs where the winning response is preferred over the losing one,
and all models learn from these preferences at the end of each iteration.
SPARTA ALIGNMENT enables the self-evolution of multiple LLMs in an iterative
and collective competition process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
SPARTA ALIGNMENT outperforms initial models and 4 self-alignment baselines
across 10 out of 12 tasks and datasets with 7.0% average improvement. Further
analysis reveals that SPARTA ALIGNMENT generalizes more effectively to unseen
tasks and leverages the expertise diversity of participating models to produce
more logical, direct and informative outputs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces the C$^2$EFND framework, combining large and small language models for fake news detection, achieving superior accuracy and adaptability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fake news dissemination on social media poses severe societal challenges, and existing methods struggle with data scarcity, knowledge updates, and adaptability.

Method: The proposed framework combines large language models' generalization with small language models' classification through multi-round collaborative learning, alongside incremental knowledge updates and replay-based learning.

Result: Experiments on Pheme and Twitter16 datasets confirm that C$^2$EFND excels in improving detection accuracy and adaptability compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: The C$^2$EFND framework offers a robust solution for fake news detection, leveraging complementary strengths of language models to address evolving challenges effectively.

Abstract: The widespread dissemination of fake news on social media has significantly
impacted society, resulting in serious consequences. Conventional deep learning
methodologies employing small language models (SLMs) suffer from extensive
supervised training requirements and difficulties adapting to evolving news
environments due to data scarcity and distribution shifts. Large language
models (LLMs), despite robust zero-shot capabilities, fall short in accurately
detecting fake news owing to outdated knowledge and the absence of suitable
demonstrations. In this paper, we propose a novel Continuous Collaborative
Emergent Fake News Detection (C$^2$EFND) framework to address these challenges.
The C$^2$EFND framework strategically leverages both LLMs' generalization power
and SLMs' classification expertise via a multi-round collaborative learning
framework. We further introduce a lifelong knowledge editing module based on a
Mixture-of-Experts architecture to incrementally update LLMs and a replay-based
continue learning method to ensure SLMs retain prior knowledge without
retraining entirely. Extensive experiments on Pheme and Twitter16 datasets
demonstrate that C$^2$EFND significantly outperforms existed methods,
effectively improving detection accuracy and adaptability in continuous
emergent fake news scenarios.

*Léane Jourdan,Florian Boudin,Richard Dufour,Nicolas Hernandez*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper addresses challenges in evaluating text revisions in scientific writing, criticizing traditional metrics for their focus on similarity, and proposes combining LLM-based evaluations with domain-specific metrics to provide a more reliable assessment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Revise evaluation in scientific writing is challenging as existing metrics like ROUGE and BERTScore are insufficient to assess meaningful improvements in text revisions.

Method: The authors conduct a manual annotation study, investigate reference-free metrics, and evaluate LLM-as-a-judge approaches both with and without gold references.

Result: The results indicate LLMs effectively assess instruction-following but perform poorly on correctness, while domain-specific metrics offer unique insights.

Conclusion: Combining LLM-as-a-judge evaluations with domain-specific metrics results in the most reliable evaluation approach for assessing text revision quality.

Abstract: Evaluating text revision in scientific writing remains a challenge, as
traditional metrics such as ROUGE and BERTScore primarily focus on similarity
rather than capturing meaningful improvements. In this work, we analyse and
identify the limitations of these metrics and explore alternative evaluation
methods that better align with human judgments. We first conduct a manual
annotation study to assess the quality of different revisions. Then, we
investigate reference-free evaluation metrics from related NLP domains.
Additionally, we examine LLM-as-a-judge approaches, analysing their ability to
assess revisions with and without a gold reference. Our results show that LLMs
effectively assess instruction-following but struggle with correctness, while
domain-specific metrics provide complementary insights. We find that a hybrid
approach combining LLM-as-a-judge evaluation and task-specific metrics offers
the most reliable assessment of revision quality.

*Jingyu Hu,Mengyue Yang,Mengnan Du,Weiru Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper probes LLMs' internal political opinions using a multi-dimensional framework and representation techniques, demonstrating improved transparency and control over political concept learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the misalignment between LLMs' open-ended responses and their internal intentions regarding political opinions, and to overcome limitations of single-axis political analysis.

Method: Designed a four-dimensional political learning framework and created a dataset for fine-grained political concept vector learning. Applied three representation engineering techniques on eight open-source LLMs.

Result: Political concept vectors successfully disentangled confounds, validated semantic meaning, showed robust generalization in out-of-distribution tests, and enabled intervention in LLMs to alter political leanings.

Conclusion: The framework enables transparent analysis and control over LLMs' political concepts, facilitating detection, understanding, and intentional modification of their responses.

Abstract: Studies of LLMs' political opinions mainly rely on evaluations of their
open-ended responses. Recent work indicates that there is a misalignment
between LLMs' responses and their internal intentions. This motivates us to
probe LLMs' internal mechanisms and help uncover their internal political
states. Additionally, we found that the analysis of LLMs' political opinions
often relies on single-axis concepts, which can lead to concept confounds. In
this work, we extend the single-axis to multi-dimensions and apply
interpretable representation engineering techniques for more transparent LLM
political concept learning. Specifically, we designed a four-dimensional
political learning framework and constructed a corresponding dataset for
fine-grained political concept vector learning. These vectors can be used to
detect and intervene in LLM internals. Experiments are conducted on eight
open-source LLMs with three representation engineering techniques. Results show
these vectors can disentangle political concept confounds. Detection tasks
validate the semantic meaning of the vectors and show good generalization and
robustness in OOD settings. Intervention Experiments show these vectors can
intervene in LLMs to generate responses with different political leanings.

*Dingdong Wang,Jincenzi Wu,Junan Li,Dongchao Yang,Xueyuan Chen,Tianhua Zhang,Helen Meng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces MMSU, a benchmark for evaluating and improving Speech Large Language Models (SpeechLLMs) by analyzing their fine-grained perception and reasoning abilities in spoken language.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current SpeechLLMs demonstrate impressive capabilities with audio data but lack deep understanding and reasoning in natural speech, involving linguistic phenomena like phonetics, prosody, and semantics.

Method: The paper presents MMSU, a dataset comprising 5,000 audio-based question-answering triplets across 47 linguistic tasks, systematically grounded in linguistic theory. It evaluates 14 SpeechLLMs using this benchmark.

Result: The evaluation pinpointed significant gaps in the fine-grained perceptual and reasoning abilities of current SpeechLLMs, suggesting ample room for model improvement.

Conclusion: The MMSU benchmark sets a new standard for understanding spoken language, guiding future development of advanced SpeechLLMs for better human-AI speech interactions.

Abstract: Speech inherently contains rich acoustic information that extends far beyond
the textual language. In real-world spoken language understanding, effective
interpretation often requires integrating semantic meaning (e.g., content),
paralinguistic features (e.g., emotions, speed, pitch) and phonological
characteristics (e.g., prosody, intonation, rhythm), which are embedded in
speech. While recent multimodal Speech Large Language Models (SpeechLLMs) have
demonstrated remarkable capabilities in processing audio information, their
ability to perform fine-grained perception and complex reasoning in natural
speech remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, we introduce MMSU, a
comprehensive benchmark designed specifically for understanding and reasoning
in spoken language. MMSU comprises 5,000 meticulously curated
audio-question-answer triplets across 47 distinct tasks. To ground our
benchmark in linguistic theory, we systematically incorporate a wide range of
linguistic phenomena, including phonetics, prosody, rhetoric, syntactics,
semantics, and paralinguistics. Through a rigorous evaluation of 14 advanced
SpeechLLMs, we identify substantial room for improvement in existing models,
highlighting meaningful directions for future optimization. MMSU establishes a
new standard for comprehensive assessment of spoken language understanding,
providing valuable insights for developing more sophisticated human-AI speech
interaction systems. MMSU benchmark is available at

TL;DR: This paper surveys 125 Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) developed between 2021 and 2025, offering a taxonomy that classifies integration strategies, learning techniques, and training paradigms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the lack of systematic understanding of how multimodal data integrates with large language model backbones.

Method: The authors propose a classification framework based on three dimensions: architectural strategies, representation learning techniques, and training paradigms, analyzing 125 MLLMs as case studies.

Result: They identify emerging patterns and create a structured taxonomy for understanding current multimodal integration techniques, filling a gap in the literature.

Conclusion: The taxonomy serves as a resource for researchers to guide the development of advanced MLLMs with improved integration techniques.

Abstract: The rapid progress of Multimodal Large Language Models(MLLMs) has transformed
the AI landscape. These models combine pre-trained LLMs with various modality
encoders. This integration requires a systematic understanding of how different
modalities connect to the language backbone. Our survey presents an LLM-centric
analysis of current approaches. We examine methods for transforming and
aligning diverse modal inputs into the language embedding space. This addresses
a significant gap in existing literature. We propose a classification framework
for MLLMs based on three key dimensions. First, we examine architectural
strategies for modality integration. This includes both the specific
integration mechanisms and the fusion level. Second, we categorize
representation learning techniques as either joint or coordinate
representations. Third, we analyze training paradigms, including training
strategies and objective functions. By examining 125 MLLMs developed between
2021 and 2025, we identify emerging patterns in the field. Our taxonomy
provides researchers with a structured overview of current integration
techniques. These insights aim to guide the development of more robust
multimodal integration strategies for future models built on pre-trained
foundations.

TL;DR: FineLogic proposes a new framework to better evaluate and improve logical reasoning in large language models (LLMs), focusing on multiple evaluation dimensions and the effects of supervision styles during fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Logical reasoning is essential for many LLM applications, but existing benchmarks fail to assess the quality of the reasoning process comprehensively.

Method: The paper introduces FineLogic, which evaluates reasoning via benchmark accuracy, stepwise soundness, and representation-level alignment. It also experiments with four supervision styles to fine-tune LLMs: one natural language and three symbolic formats.

Result: Natural language supervision leads to better generalization performance, while symbolic styles enhance structural reasoning. Fine-tuning improves step-by-step generation rather than shortcut prediction.

Conclusion: FineLogic offers a more nuanced and interpretable way to evaluate logical reasoning in LLMs and demonstrates the importance of stepwise reasoning and the choice of supervision format in fine-tuning.

Abstract: Logical reasoning is a core capability for many applications of large
language models (LLMs), yet existing benchmarks often rely solely on
final-answer accuracy, failing to capture the quality and structure of the
reasoning process. We propose FineLogic, a fine-grained evaluation framework
that assesses logical reasoning across three dimensions: overall benchmark
accuracy, stepwise soundness, and representation-level alignment. In addition,
to better understand how reasoning capabilities emerge, we conduct a
comprehensive study on the effects of supervision format during fine-tuning. We
construct four supervision styles (one natural language and three symbolic
variants) and train LLMs under each. Our findings reveal that natural language
supervision yields strong generalization even on out-of-distribution and
long-context tasks, while symbolic reasoning styles promote more structurally
sound and atomic inference chains. Further, our representation-level probing
shows that fine-tuning primarily improves reasoning behaviors through
step-by-step generation, rather than enhancing shortcut prediction or
internalized correctness. Together, our framework and analysis provide a more
rigorous and interpretable lens for evaluating and improving logical reasoning
in LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes a robust machine translation proofreading method combining CNN and BERT, achieving over 10% improvement in accuracy and F1 over recent techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address errors in automatic translations that require extensive human post-editing, improving translation accuracy through robust proofreading is needed.

Method: The paper combines CNNs for n-gram pattern recognition with BERT for context-aware sequence encoding. It detects translation errors via BERT’s attention mechanism and employs a GRU decoder alongside translation memory for corrections.

Result: The model achieved 90% accuracy, 89.37% F1, and 16.24% MSE, surpassing recent methods by more than 10% in overall performance.

Conclusion: The hybrid CNN-BERT approach delivers state-of-the-art performance in detecting and correcting translation issues, showcasing its efficacy for multi-domain English-German translation tasks.

Abstract: Since automatic translations can contain errors that require substantial
human post-editing, machine translation proofreading is essential for improving
quality. This paper proposes a novel hybrid approach for robust proofreading
that combines convolutional neural networks (CNN) with Bidirectional Encoder
Representations from Transformers (BERT). In order to extract semantic
information from phrases and expressions, CNN uses a variety of convolution
kernel filters to capture local n-gram patterns. In the meanwhile, BERT creates
context-rich representations of whole sequences by utilizing stacked
bidirectional transformer encoders. Using BERT's attention processes, the
integrated error detection component relates tokens to spot translation
irregularities including word order problems and omissions. The correction
module then uses parallel English-German alignment and GRU decoder models in
conjunction with translation memory to propose logical modifications that
maintain original meaning. A unified end-to-end training process optimized for
post-editing performance is applied to the whole pipeline. The multi-domain
collection of WMT and the conversational dialogues of Open-Subtitles are two of
the English-German parallel corpora used to train the model. Multiple loss
functions supervise detection and correction capabilities. Experiments attain a
90% accuracy, 89.37% F1, and 16.24% MSE, exceeding recent proofreading
techniques by over 10% overall. Comparative benchmarking demonstrates
state-of-the-art performance in identifying and coherently rectifying
mistranslations and omissions.

TL;DR: This study evaluates the application of VLMs and LLMs in grading and providing feedback for grade 4 students' handwritten exam responses in Indonesia, revealing challenges like handwriting recognition and limited feedback personalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the real-world applicability of VLMs and LLMs for educational assessment in underrepresented educational contexts, specifically addressing challenges in tasks such as grading and feedback generation.

Method: The study tested a state-of-the-art VLM and several LLMs on handwritten exam responses (646 sheets) from Indonesian grade 4 students, covering Mathematics and English, involving multiple-choice, short-answer, and essay questions.

Result: The VLM encountered difficulties in recognizing student handwriting, causing error propagation in grading tasks. However, LLMs generated feedback that was somewhat useful, albeit with minimal personalization and contextual shortcomings.

Conclusion: While AI tools show potential in educational assessments, challenges like accurate handwriting recognition and meaningful personalized feedback generation need to be addressed for widespread classroom adoption.

Abstract: Although vision-language and large language models (VLM and LLM) offer
promising opportunities for AI-driven educational assessment, their
effectiveness in real-world classroom settings, particularly in
underrepresented educational contexts, remains underexplored. In this study, we
evaluated the performance of a state-of-the-art VLM and several LLMs on 646
handwritten exam responses from grade 4 students in six Indonesian schools,
covering two subjects: Mathematics and English. These sheets contain more than
14K student answers that span multiple choice, short answer, and essay
questions. Assessment tasks include grading these responses and generating
personalized feedback. Our findings show that the VLM often struggles to
accurately recognize student handwriting, leading to error propagation in
downstream LLM grading. Nevertheless, LLM-generated feedback retains some
utility, even when derived from imperfect input, although limitations in
personalization and contextual relevance persist.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Cryptic crosswords involve clues with definitions and wordplay. This paper proposes an LLM-based system that solves such clues using hypothesizing, explanation, and verification methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance on a challenging dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve computational systems that can solve cryptic crossword clues, achieving human-level reasoning and interpretability in explanations.

Method: The method includes using a large language model (LLM)-based reasoning system to hypothesize answers, propose wordplay explanations, and verify solutions through codified reasoning steps.

Result: The system achieves a new state-of-the-art performance on the Cryptonite dataset from UK newspapers, surpassing prior benchmarks.

Conclusion: The paper presents a powerful LLM-based solution for cryptic crossword solving, providing interpretable Python-reasoned solutions and setting a new standard for automated clue-solving systems.

Abstract: Cryptic crossword clues are challenging language tasks for which new test
sets are released daily by major newspapers on a global basis. Each cryptic
clue contains both the definition of the answer to be placed in the crossword
grid (in common with regular crosswords), and 'wordplay' that proves that the
answer is correct (i.e. a human solver can be confident that an answer is
correct without needing crossing words as confirmation). This work describes an
LLM-based reasoning system built from open-licensed components that solves
cryptic clues by (i) hypothesising answers; (ii) proposing wordplay
explanations; and (iii) using a verifier system that operates on codified
reasoning steps. Overall, this system establishes a new state-of-the-art
performance on the challenging Cryptonite dataset of clues from The Times and
The Telegraph newspapers in the UK. Because each proved solution is expressed
in Python, interpretable wordplay reasoning for proven answers is available for
inspection.

Motivation: LRMs often produce redundant or logically inconsistent reasoning traces, which can become hallucination sources, yet traditional detection methods focus only on answer-level uncertainty.

Method: RACE extracts key reasoning steps and evaluates four diagnostic signals: inter-sample consistency, answer uncertainty, semantic alignment, and reasoning coherence.

Result: Experiments show RACE surpasses existing hallucination detection methods, proving its efficacy across datasets and large language models.

Conclusion: RACE advances hallucination detection in LRMs, improving transparency and robustness in decision-making processes.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) extend large language models with explicit,
multi-step reasoning traces to enhance transparency and performance on complex
tasks. However, these reasoning traces can be redundant or logically
inconsistent, making them a new source of hallucination that is difficult to
detect. Existing hallucination detection methods focus primarily on
answer-level uncertainty and often fail to detect hallucinations or logical
inconsistencies arising from the model's reasoning trace. This oversight is
particularly problematic for LRMs, where the explicit thinking trace is not
only an important support to the model's decision-making process but also a key
source of potential hallucination. To this end, we propose RACE (Reasoning and
Answer Consistency Evaluation), a novel framework specifically tailored for
hallucination detection in LRMs. RACE operates by extracting essential
reasoning steps and computing four diagnostic signals: inter-sample consistency
of reasoning traces, entropy-based answer uncertainty, semantic alignment
between reasoning and answers, and internal coherence of reasoning. This joint
analysis enables fine-grained hallucination detection even when the final
answer appears correct. Experiments across datasets and different LLMs
demonstrate that RACE outperforms existing hallucination detection baselines,
offering a robust and generalizable solution for evaluating LRMs. Our code is

*Dávid Javorský,Ondřej Bojar,François Yvon*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study introduces a dataset, MockConf, for simultaneous interpreting alongside a corresponding annotation tool, InterAlign, aimed at improving alignment and evaluation tools in this domain.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the dynamic task of simultaneous interpreting and its automatic reproduction necessitates dedicated parallel speech datasets and advanced annotation tools, which existing options do not adequately address.

Method: The paper presents MockConf, a 7-hour student-interpreting dataset in 5 European languages, transcribed and aligned at the span and word levels. It also introduces InterAlign, a web-based tool for annotation and alignment in simultaneous interpreting.

Result: MockConf and InterAlign were successfully developed, with proposed metrics for evaluation and a baseline for automated alignment provided. Both resources are publicly released to the research community.

Conclusion: The study fills a gap in simultaneous interpreting research tools by introducing a new dataset and alignment tool, lowering barriers for further analysis, monitoring, and evaluation.

Abstract: In simultaneous interpreting, an interpreter renders a source speech into
another language with a very short lag, much sooner than sentences are
finished. In order to understand and later reproduce this dynamic and complex
task automatically, we need dedicated datasets and tools for analysis,
monitoring, and evaluation, such as parallel speech corpora, and tools for
their automatic annotation. Existing parallel corpora of translated texts and
associated alignment algorithms hardly fill this gap, as they fail to model
long-range interactions between speech segments or specific types of
divergences (e.g., shortening, simplification, functional generalization)
between the original and interpreted speeches. In this work, we introduce
MockConf, a student interpreting dataset that was collected from Mock
Conferences run as part of the students' curriculum. This dataset contains 7
hours of recordings in 5 European languages, transcribed and aligned at the
level of spans and words. We further implement and release InterAlign, a modern
web-based annotation tool for parallel word and span annotations on long
inputs, suitable for aligning simultaneous interpreting. We propose metrics for
the evaluation and a baseline for automatic alignment. Dataset and tools are
released to the community.

*Giorgio Biancini,Alessio Ferrato,Carla Limongelli*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper compares LLMs (Llama 2, Mistral, GPT-3.5) in creating MCQs, showing GPT-3.5 performs the best while addressing challenges and reluctance in AI adoption in education.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual generation of MCQs is time-consuming and labor-intensive, prompting the exploration of AI-based solutions for efficient question creation.

Method: Three LLMs were compared (Llama 2, Mistral, GPT-3.5) through knowledge-injected prompts involving educators to analyze their MCQ generation capabilities.

Result: GPT-3.5 was found to generate the most effective MCQs using metrics, though resistance to AI adoption in education persists.

Conclusion: LLMs have high potential to enhance educational processes, especially in MCQ generation, but further work is needed to overcome adoption challenges.

Abstract: Integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI) in educational settings has brought
new learning approaches, transforming the practices of both students and
educators. Among the various technologies driving this transformation, Large
Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for creating educational
materials and question answering, but there are still space for new
applications. Educators commonly use Multiple-Choice Questions (MCQs) to assess
student knowledge, but manually generating these questions is
resource-intensive and requires significant time and cognitive effort. In our
opinion, LLMs offer a promising solution to these challenges. This paper
presents a novel comparative analysis of three widely known LLMs - Llama 2,
Mistral, and GPT-3.5 - to explore their potential for creating informative and
challenging MCQs. In our approach, we do not rely on the knowledge of the LLM,
but we inject the knowledge into the prompt to contrast the hallucinations,
giving the educators control over the test's source text, too. Our experiment
involving 21 educators shows that GPT-3.5 generates the most effective MCQs
across several known metrics. Additionally, it shows that there is still some
reluctance to adopt AI in the educational field. This study sheds light on the
potential of LLMs to generate MCQs and improve the educational experience,
providing valuable insights for the future.

*Dávid Javorský,Ondřej Bojar,François Yvon*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study evaluates isometric machine translation across various languages using open-source large language models, focusing on translation quality, length control, and prompting strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the effectiveness of LLMs in achieving controlled translation output length, quality, and compatibility across different languages in the context of IWSLT Isometric Shared Task 2022.

Method: Researchers applied prompting strategies, varying few-shot examples, and instruction phrasing using eight large language models to explore how these factors affect translation performance.

Result: Results highlighted that extreme examples lead to shorter translations, while isometric demonstrations often fail to enforce length constraints. Few-shot prompting improves quality but shows diminishing returns beyond a certain threshold.

Conclusion: Leveraging multiple outputs can significantly enhance the trade-off between translation length and quality, achieving state-of-the-art results for specific language pairs.

Abstract: In this study, we explore the effectiveness of isometric machine translation
across multiple language pairs (En$\to$De, En$\to$Fr, and En$\to$Es) under the
conditions of the IWSLT Isometric Shared Task 2022. Using eight open-source
large language models (LLMs) of varying sizes, we investigate how different
prompting strategies, varying numbers of few-shot examples, and demonstration
selection influence translation quality and length control. We discover that
the phrasing of instructions, when aligned with the properties of the provided
demonstrations, plays a crucial role in controlling the output length. Our
experiments show that LLMs tend to produce shorter translations only when
presented with extreme examples, while isometric demonstrations often lead to
the models disregarding length constraints. While few-shot prompting generally
enhances translation quality, further improvements are marginal across 5, 10,
and 20-shot settings. Finally, considering multiple outputs allows to notably
improve overall tradeoff between the length and quality, yielding
state-of-the-art performance for some language pairs.

TL;DR: The paper integrates Universal Dependencies (UD) into pretrained models, enhancing performance in a cross-lingual paraphrase identification task.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore whether Universal Dependencies can enhance performance in cross-lingual syntactic tasks, particularly in adversarial paraphrase identification.

Method: The authors incorporated UD into pretrained language models and evaluated their performance through experiments involving cross-lingual adversarial paraphrase identification.

Result: UD integration achieved significant performance gains in accuracy (+3.85%) and F1 scores (+6.08%), bridging gaps between pretrained and large language models in certain cases.

Conclusion: Universal Dependencies have strong potential for improving language model performance in challenging, out-of-domain, cross-lingual tasks.

Abstract: Universal Dependencies (UD), while widely regarded as the most successful
linguistic framework for cross-lingual syntactic representation, remains
underexplored in terms of its effectiveness. This paper addresses this gap by
integrating UD into pretrained language models and assesses if UD can improve
their performance on a cross-lingual adversarial paraphrase identification
task. Experimental results show that incorporation of UD yields significant
improvements in accuracy and $F_1$ scores, with average gains of 3.85\% and
6.08\% respectively. These enhancements reduce the performance gap between
pretrained models and large language models in some language pairs, and even
outperform the latter in some others. Furthermore, the UD-based similarity
score between a given language and English is positively correlated to the
performance of models in that language. Both findings highlight the validity
and potential of UD in out-of-domain tasks.

*Shiyi Xu,Yiwen Hu,Yingqian Min,Zhipeng Chen,Wayne Xin Zhao,Ji-Rong Wen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces ICPC-Eval, a competitive coding benchmark to evaluate the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in realistic ICPC competition scenarios, addressing limitations of existing benchmarks and metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks and metrics for evaluating coding capabilities of LLMs, such as LiveCodeBench, CodeElo, and Pass@K, do not capture the reflective and iterative reasoning abilities of models in real competitive coding environments.

Method: The authors propose ICPC-Eval, a benchmark comprising 118 problems from recent ICPC contests, along with a local evaluation toolkit. They introduce Refine@K, a metric to evaluate iterative solution refinement based on execution feedback.

Result: The results highlight that top-tier models like DeepSeek-R1 depend heavily on multi-turn feedback to leverage their in-context reasoning capabilities. These models, despite progress, still perform below top human teams.

Conclusion: ICPC-Eval provides a robust and realistic platform to assess the reasoning and iterative abilities of LLMs in complex coding tasks, but current models fall short of human-level performance.

Abstract: With the significant progress of large reasoning models in complex coding and
reasoning tasks, existing benchmarks, like LiveCodeBench and CodeElo, are
insufficient to evaluate the coding capabilities of large language models
(LLMs) in real competition environments. Moreover, current evaluation metrics
such as Pass@K fail to capture the reflective abilities of reasoning models. To
address these challenges, we propose \textbf{ICPC-Eval}, a top-level
competitive coding benchmark designed to probing the frontiers of LLM
reasoning. ICPC-Eval includes 118 carefully curated problems from 11 recent
ICPC contests held in various regions of the world, offering three key
contributions: 1) A challenging realistic ICPC competition scenario, featuring
a problem type and difficulty distribution consistent with actual contests. 2)
A robust test case generation method and a corresponding local evaluation
toolkit, enabling efficient and accurate local evaluation. 3) An effective
test-time scaling evaluation metric, Refine@K, which allows iterative repair of
solutions based on execution feedback. The results underscore the significant
challenge in evaluating complex reasoning abilities: top-tier reasoning models
like DeepSeek-R1 often rely on multi-turn code feedback to fully unlock their
in-context reasoning potential when compared to non-reasoning counterparts.
Furthermore, despite recent advancements in code generation, these models still
lag behind top-performing human teams. We release the benchmark at:

*Alex Pan,Mary-Anne Williams*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle with nested narrative reasoning despite processing facts well. The paper introduces Verbose ListOps, a benchmark to test these challenges by embedding ListOps computations into lengthy, coherent stories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To specifically test the reasoning limitations of LLMs when dealing with nested and semantically complex narratives, which existing benchmarks fail to adequately address.

Method: Verbose ListOps creates computationally intensive reasoning challenges within lengthy narratives, withholding intermediate results and offering control over narrative size and reasoning complexity.

Result: Experiments show that leading LLMs fail in state management for nested sub-reasoning amidst distractors at modest narrative lengths (~10k tokens), despite solving simpler equations outside of narratives.

Conclusion: Verbose ListOps highlights an essential vulnerability in LLM reasoning, signaling that improvements in state management and filtering irrelevant information are crucial for real-world text interpretation.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), whilst great at extracting facts from text,
struggle with nested narrative reasoning. Existing long context and multi-hop
QA benchmarks inadequately test this, lacking realistic distractors or failing
to decouple context length from reasoning complexity, masking a fundamental LLM
limitation. We introduce Verbose ListOps, a novel benchmark that
programmatically transposes ListOps computations into lengthy, coherent
stories. This uniquely forces internal computation and state management of
nested reasoning problems by withholding intermediate results, and offers
fine-grained controls for both narrative size \emph{and} reasoning difficulty.
Whilst benchmarks like LongReason (2025) advance approaches for synthetically
expanding the context size of multi-hop QA problems, Verbose ListOps pinpoints
a specific LLM vulnerability: difficulty in state management for nested
sub-reasoning amongst semantically-relevant, distracting narrative. Our
experiments show that leading LLMs (e.g., OpenAI o4, Gemini 2.5 Pro) collapse
in performance on Verbose ListOps at modest (~10k token) narrative lengths,
despite effortlessly solving raw ListOps equations. Addressing this failure is
paramount for real-world text interpretation which requires identifying key
reasoning points, tracking conceptual intermediate results, and filtering
irrelevant information. Verbose ListOps, and its extensible generation
framework thus enables targeted reasoning enhancements beyond mere
context-window expansion; a critical step to automating the world's knowledge
work.

*Ondřej Klejch,William Lamb,Peter Bell*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper argues that hybrid HMM combined with self-supervised models achieves better performance for low-resource ASR languages compared to fine-tuning existing multilingual E2E models, achieving 32% WER reduction in Scottish Gaelic.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fine-tuning multilingual E2E models has been considered the norm for low-resource ASR systems, leveraging large datasets from many languages. This paper aims to test alternative strategies for limited language data scenarios.

Method: The authors compare the performance of fine-tuned multilingual E2E models to an alternative, combining Hybrid HMMs with self-supervised models. This alternative emphasizes self-supervised pre-training and semi-supervised training to optimize the use of speech and text data.

Result: The hybrid HMM and self-supervised model approach outperformed fine-tuned Whisper models, yielding a relative 32% WER reduction on Scottish Gaelic despite limited training data.

Conclusion: Hybrid HMM approaches combined with self-supervised learning can outperform popular fine-tuning strategies for low-resource languages, showing promise in leveraging diverse data sources for speech recognition.

Abstract: An effective approach to the development of ASR systems for low-resource
languages is to fine-tune an existing multilingual end-to-end model. When the
original model has been trained on large quantities of data from many
languages, fine-tuning can be effective with limited training data, even when
the language in question was not present in the original training data. The
fine-tuning approach has been encouraged by the availability of public-domain
E2E models and is widely believed to lead to state-of-the-art results. This
paper, however, challenges that belief. We show that an approach combining
hybrid HMMs with self-supervised models can yield substantially better
performance with limited training data. This combination allows better
utilisation of all available speech and text data through continued
self-supervised pre-training and semi-supervised training. We benchmark our
approach on Scottish Gaelic, achieving WER reductions of 32% relative over our
best fine-tuned Whisper model.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study investigates the ability of large language models (LLMs) to provide multilingual, mathematically-focused instructional feedback, showing improvements in learning outcomes, particularly for low-resource languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to evaluate whether LLMs can effectively deliver instructional feedback across various languages, particularly focusing on mathematically grounded reasoning tasks, which is critical for inclusive AI-assisted education.

Method: The paper uses a large-scale simulation where stronger LLMs act as tutors generating hints, and weaker models act as students. It explores interactions across 11 languages, 4 LLMs, and different prompting strategies to measure learning outcomes.

Result: Results indicate multilingual feedback significantly enhances learning outcomes, especially in low-resource languages if feedback aligns with the student's native language.

Conclusion: The findings highlight the potential for LLMs to develop inclusive, effective multilingual educational tools, emphasizing the importance of language alignment in instructional feedback.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated the ability to generate
formative feedback and instructional hints in English, making them increasingly
relevant for AI-assisted education. However, their ability to provide effective
instructional support across different languages, especially for mathematically
grounded reasoning tasks, remains largely unexamined. In this work, we present
the first large-scale simulation of multilingual tutor-student interactions
using LLMs. A stronger model plays the role of the tutor, generating feedback
in the form of hints, while a weaker model simulates the student. We explore
352 experimental settings across 11 typologically diverse languages, four
state-of-the-art LLMs, and multiple prompting strategies to assess whether
language-specific feedback leads to measurable learning gains. Our study
examines how student input language, teacher feedback language, model choice,
and language resource level jointly influence performance. Results show that
multilingual hints can significantly improve learning outcomes, particularly in
low-resource languages when feedback is aligned with the student's native
language. These findings offer practical insights for developing multilingual,
LLM-based educational tools that are both effective and inclusive.

TL;DR: The study demonstrates that adding contextual information, such as visual data, improves neural machine translation quality in domain-specific e-commerce settings using a new Czech-to-Polish dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural Machine Translation struggles with word ambiguity and lack of context, especially in domain-specific settings like e-commerce, where sentences may be unclear or data quality poor.

Method: The authors develop the ConECT dataset, a Czech-to-Polish e-commerce translation dataset enriched with images and metadata, and test vision-language and text-to-text context-aware methods to evaluate translation improvement.

Result: Incorporating contextual information, such as visual data, category paths, and image descriptions, enhances translation quality within e-commerce applications.

Conclusion: Including both visual and textual contextual information can significantly improve machine translation performance in specialized domains, and the new ConECT dataset is released for public use.

Abstract: Neural Machine Translation (NMT) has improved translation by using
Transformer-based models, but it still struggles with word ambiguity and
context. This problem is especially important in domain-specific applications,
which often have problems with unclear sentences or poor data quality. Our
research explores how adding information to models can improve translations in
the context of e-commerce data. To this end we create ConECT -- a new
Czech-to-Polish e-commerce product translation dataset coupled with images and
product metadata consisting of 11,400 sentence pairs. We then investigate and
compare different methods that are applicable to context-aware translation. We
test a vision-language model (VLM), finding that visual context aids
translation quality. Additionally, we explore the incorporation of contextual
information into text-to-text models, such as the product's category path or
image descriptions. The results of our study demonstrate that the incorporation
of contextual information leads to an improvement in the quality of machine
translation. We make the new dataset publicly available.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a semi-supervised learning pipeline to fine-tune ASR systems using limited labeled data and related auxiliary data, achieving substantial performance improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of fine-tuning ASR models in domain-specific contexts when labeled data is scarce but unlabeled and auxiliary domain data is available.

Method: The pipeline incrementally integrates limited in-domain labeled data with auxiliary datasets from related domains, applies pseudo-label filtering using multi-model consensus or NER, and iteratively refines the model.

Result: The proposed methods outperform single-step fine-tuning, with consensus-based filtering achieving up to 22.3% and 24.8% relative improvement on two datasets, and NER offering competitive results with lower computational needs.

Conclusion: Incremental semi-supervised learning with effective filtering techniques such as consensus-based filtering or NER enables significant ASR fine-tuning performance improvements in data-scarce domain-specific scenarios.

Abstract: Fine-tuning pretrained ASR models for specific domains is challenging when
labeled data is scarce. But unlabeled audio and labeled data from related
domains are often available. We propose an incremental semi-supervised learning
pipeline that first integrates a small in-domain labeled set and an auxiliary
dataset from a closely related domain, achieving a relative improvement of 4%
over no auxiliary data. Filtering based on multi-model consensus or named
entity recognition (NER) is then applied to select and iteratively refine
pseudo-labels, showing slower performance saturation compared to random
selection. Evaluated on the multi-domain Wow call center and Fisher English
corpora, it outperforms single-step fine-tuning. Consensus-based filtering
outperforms other methods, providing up to 22.3% relative improvement on Wow
and 24.8% on Fisher over single-step fine-tuning with random selection. NER is
the second-best filter, providing competitive performance at a lower
computational cost.

*Yongjie Xiao,Hongru Liang,Peixin Qin,Yao Zhang,Wenqiang Lei*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper evaluates the comprehension processes of large language models (LLMs) from a cognitive perspective using the proposed SCOP framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the lack of rational and explainable alignment between the comprehension processes of LLMs and human experts, hindering their reliability in real-world applications.

Method: The proposed SCOP framework systematically defines five requisite comprehension skills, constructs testing data for these skills, and analyzes open- and closed-sourced LLMs' performance using this data.

Result: The study finds that LLMs struggle with expert-level comprehension, perform better with local rather than global information, and sometimes reach correct answers via flawed reasoning processes.

Conclusion: The authors suggest enhancing LLM training by focusing on refining the comprehension process and ensuring it thoroughly develops all requisite comprehension skills.

Abstract: Despite the great potential of large language models(LLMs) in machine
comprehension, it is still disturbing to fully count on them in real-world
scenarios. This is probably because there is no rational explanation for
whether the comprehension process of LLMs is aligned with that of experts. In
this paper, we propose SCOP to carefully examine how LLMs perform during the
comprehension process from a cognitive view. Specifically, it is equipped with
a systematical definition of five requisite skills during the comprehension
process, a strict framework to construct testing data for these skills, and a
detailed analysis of advanced open-sourced and closed-sourced LLMs using the
testing data. With SCOP, we find that it is still challenging for LLMs to
perform an expert-level comprehension process. Even so, we notice that LLMs
share some similarities with experts, e.g., performing better at comprehending
local information than global information. Further analysis reveals that LLMs
can be somewhat unreliable -- they might reach correct answers through flawed
comprehension processes. Based on SCOP, we suggest that one direction for
improving LLMs is to focus more on the comprehension process, ensuring all
comprehension skills are thoroughly developed during training.

TL;DR: The paper presents a simple approach to control the length of generated text summaries by enhancing the importance of predicting the EOS token during training, compatible with diverse models and algorithms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to effectively control text summary length without complex modifications to pre-trained models or architectures.

Method: Utilize cross-entropy loss computation to boost the importance of correctly predicting the EOS token, ensuring model compatibility and method simplicity.

Result: The approach successfully controls summary length across various models, such as encoder-decoder and GPT-style LLMs, with minimal impact on summary quality.

Conclusion: This method provides an effective, model-agnostic solution for length-controllable text summarization, maintaining summary quality and compatibility.

Abstract: Controlling the length of generated text can be crucial in various
text-generation tasks, including summarization. Existing methods often require
complex model alterations, limiting compatibility with pre-trained models. We
address these limitations by developing a simple approach for controlling the
length of automatic text summaries by increasing the importance of correctly
predicting the EOS token in the cross-entropy loss computation. The proposed
methodology is agnostic to architecture and decoding algorithms and orthogonal
to other inference-time techniques to control the generation length. We tested
it with encoder-decoder and modern GPT-style LLMs, and show that this method
can control generation length, often without affecting the quality of the
summary.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs demonstrate impressive results in reasoning tasks but exhibit robustness issues, failing on simple reasoning problems. Existing evaluations using limited methods suggest data contamination as a cause. This paper aims to develop a more thorough robustness evaluation framework.

Method: The proposed AR-Checker dynamically creates mathematical problem variants via multiple rounds of LLM-based rewriting and verification, ensuring the meanings are preserved yet challenging for the models. This approach avoids issues of data contamination.

Result: AR-Checker showed strong results in generating meaningful task variants across benchmarks like GSM8K, MATH-500, and in non-math datasets such as MMLU, MMLU-Pro, and CommonsenseQA, demonstrating its effectiveness beyond mathematics.

Conclusion: The AR-Checker framework serves as a robust and dynamic tool to evaluate and enhance the reasoning robustness of LLMs, addressing key challenges overlooked by previous evaluation methods.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved distinguished performance on
various reasoning-intensive tasks. However, LLMs might still face the
challenges of robustness issues and fail unexpectedly in some simple reasoning
tasks. Previous works evaluate the LLM robustness with hand-crafted templates
or a limited set of perturbation rules, indicating potential data contamination
in pre-training or fine-tuning datasets. In this work, inspired by stress
testing in software engineering, we propose a novel framework, Automatic
Robustness Checker (AR-Checker), to generate mathematical problem variants that
maintain the semantic meanings of the original one but might fail the LLMs. The
AR-Checker framework generates mathematical problem variants through
multi-round parallel streams of LLM-based rewriting and verification. Our
framework can generate benchmark variants dynamically for each LLM, thus
minimizing the risk of data contamination. Experiments on GSM8K and MATH-500
demonstrate the strong performance of AR-Checker on mathematical tasks. We also
evaluate AR-Checker on benchmarks beyond mathematics, including MMLU, MMLU-Pro,
and CommonsenseQA, where it also achieves strong performance, further proving
the effectiveness of AR-Checker.

*Moshe Ofer,Orel Zamler,Amos Azaria*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces TALL, a framework that boosts LLM performance in low-resource languages through bilingual translation models and parameter-efficient training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often underperform in low-resource languages due to lack of adequate training data, creating a need for solutions that enhance their effectiveness in such contexts.

Method: The authors propose TALL, which uses bilingual translation models to transform low-resource inputs into high-resource language representations. This includes dimension alignment layers and specialized transformers, while leveraging a lightweight, parameter-efficient training strategy by freezing pre-trained LLM components and training minimal adapter modules.

Result: Experiments conducted on Hebrew showed considerable performance improvements compared to baselines like direct LLM use, naive translation, and fine-tuning approaches.

Conclusion: The results demonstrate the effectiveness of TALL in enhancing low-resource language performance of LLMs through an efficient and scalable design.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in high-resource languages but struggle
with low-resource languages due to limited training data. This paper presents
TALL (Trainable Architecture for Enhancing LLM Performance in Low-Resource
Languages), which integrates an LLM with two bilingual translation models. TALL
transforms low-resource inputs into high-resource representations, leveraging
the LLM's capabilities while preserving linguistic features through dimension
alignment layers and custom transformers. Our experiments on Hebrew demonstrate
significant improvements over several baselines, including direct use, naive
translation, and fine-tuning approaches. The architecture employs a
parameter-efficient strategy, freezing pre-trained components while training
only lightweight adapter modules, balancing computational efficiency with
performance gains.

### [107] [Debatable Intelligence: Benchmarking LLM Judges via Debate Speech Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05062)
*Noy Sternlicht,Ariel Gera,Roy Bar-Haim,Tom Hope,Noam Slonim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new benchmark to evaluate language models (LLMs) in the task of judging debate speeches, comparing their performance with human judges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore and benchmark the unique cognitive abilities required for evaluating debate speeches, such as assessing argument strength, coherence, and style, which have not been systematically examined in LLMs.

Method: The authors use a dataset of over 600 annotated debate speeches and compare the performance of state-of-the-art LLMs with human judges. They also evaluate LLMs' capabilities in generating persuasive speeches.

Result: Larger LLMs can approximate human judgments in certain respects but display substantial differences in overall evaluation behavior. They are capable of generating human-level persuasive speeches.

Conclusion: The study highlights the nuanced behavior of LLMs in evaluating debate speeches and their potential to perform at a human level in persuasive speech generation, emphasizing areas where they diverge from human judgment.

Abstract: We introduce Debate Speech Evaluation as a novel and challenging benchmark
for assessing LLM judges. Evaluating debate speeches requires a deep
understanding of the speech at multiple levels, including argument strength and
relevance, the coherence and organization of the speech, the appropriateness of
its style and tone, and so on. This task involves a unique set of cognitive
abilities that have previously received limited attention in systematic LLM
benchmarking. To explore such skills, we leverage a dataset of over 600
meticulously annotated debate speeches and present the first in-depth analysis
of how state-of-the-art LLMs compare to human judges on this task. Our findings
reveal a nuanced picture: while larger models can approximate individual human
judgments in some respects, they differ substantially in their overall judgment
behavior. We also investigate the ability of frontier LLMs to generate
persuasive, opinionated speeches, showing that models may perform at a human
level on this task.

### [108] [Does It Make Sense to Speak of Introspection in Large Language Models?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05068)
*Iulia Comşa,Murray Shanahan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper examines if Large Language Models (LLMs) can produce introspective self-reports and distinguishes between true introspection and algorithmic explanations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to address how self-reports from LLMs, due to their linguistic fluency, might relate to concepts of introspection and consciousness.

Method: The authors critique two specific examples of self-reports from LLMs to evaluate claims of introspection.

Result: The analysis reveals that one example is not introspection while the other demonstrates a minimal, valid case of parameter-based introspection.

Conclusion: LLMs may exhibit minimal introspective abilities in specific cases, but these examples lack any association with conscious experience.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit compelling linguistic behaviour, and
sometimes offer self-reports, that is to say statements about their own nature,
inner workings, or behaviour. In humans, such reports are often attributed to a
faculty of introspection and are typically linked to consciousness. This raises
the question of how to interpret self-reports produced by LLMs, given their
increasing linguistic fluency and cognitive capabilities. To what extent (if
any) can the concept of introspection be meaningfully applied to LLMs? Here, we
present and critique two examples of apparent introspective self-report from
LLMs. In the first example, an LLM attempts to describe the process behind its
own ``creative'' writing, and we argue this is not a valid example of
introspection. In the second example, an LLM correctly infers the value of its
own temperature parameter, and we argue that this can be legitimately
considered a minimal example of introspection, albeit one that is (presumably)
not accompanied by conscious experience.

*Tianjiao Li,Mengran Yu,Chenyu Shi,Yanjun Zhao,Xiaojing Liu,Qiang Zhang,Qi Zhang,Xuanjing Huang,Jiayin Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Existing LLMs struggle with colloquial subtitle translation due to offline reward model divergence. RIVAL, an adversarial training method, addresses this issue by aligning the reward model (RM) with the language model to produce better translations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving the performance of LLMs on colloquial subtitle translation tasks, where traditional reinforcement learning methods underperform due to model divergence.

Method: RIVAL employs adversarial training, framing translation as a min-max game between RM (distinguishing weak and strong translations) and the LLM (producing improved translations). Quantitative metrics like BLEU are also integrated for stabilization and better alignment with human evaluation.

Result: RIVAL significantly improves translation quality over baseline methods, showcasing its potential in handling subtitled language tasks.

Conclusion: Adversarial training via RIVAL effectively tackles distributional shifts between reward models and LLMs, enhancing colloquial subtitle translation capabilities.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) possess strong multilingual capabilities, and
combining Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) with translation
tasks has shown great potential. However, we observe that this paradigm
performs unexpectedly poorly when applied to colloquial subtitle translation
tasks. In this work, we investigate this issue and find that the offline reward
model (RM) gradually diverges from the online LLM due to distributional shift,
ultimately leading to undesirable training outcomes. To address this, we
propose RIVAL, an adversarial training framework that formulates the process as
a min-max game between the RM and the LLM. RIVAL iteratively updates the both
models, with the RM trained to distinguish strong from weak translations
(qualitative preference reward), and the LLM trained to enhance its translation
for closing this gap. To stabilize training and improve generalizability, we
also incorporate quantitative preference reward (e.g., BLEU) into the RM,
enabling reference-free quality modeling aligned with human evaluation. Through
extensive experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed adversarial training
framework significantly improves upon translation baselines.

*Soumitra Ghosh,Gopendra Vikram Singh,Shambhavi,Sabarna Choudhury,Asif Ekbal*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new framework to improve self-harm detection on social media via enhanced language-emoji understanding using a curated emoji set and a fine-tuned large language model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early detection of self-harm signs on social media can provide critical mental health support and suicide prevention but is hindered by the subtle and contextual nature of cues like emojis and casual language.

Method: The authors developed the Centennial Emoji Sensitivity Matrix (CESM-100), a curated emoji set, and the SHINES dataset with detailed annotations. They enriched inputs with CESM-100, fine-tuned LLMs for multi-task learning, and provided explainable rationales for predictions.

Result: The proposed framework effectively improved detection and explanation tasks, demonstrating better performance than existing methods when evaluated on state-of-the-art LLMs in various learning scenarios.

Conclusion: The study significantly strengthens self-harm detection capabilities of LLMs by integrating nuanced contextual understanding and intent differentiation, providing a publicly available dataset and resources for future research.

Abstract: Self-harm detection on social media is critical for early intervention and
mental health support, yet remains challenging due to the subtle,
context-dependent nature of such expressions. Identifying self-harm intent aids
suicide prevention by enabling timely responses, but current large language
models (LLMs) struggle to interpret implicit cues in casual language and
emojis. This work enhances LLMs' comprehension of self-harm by distinguishing
intent through nuanced language-emoji interplay. We present the Centennial
Emoji Sensitivity Matrix (CESM-100), a curated set of 100 emojis with
contextual self-harm interpretations and the Self-Harm Identification aNd
intent Extraction with Supportive emoji sensitivity (SHINES) dataset, offering
detailed annotations for self-harm labels, casual mentions (CMs), and serious
intents (SIs). Our unified framework: a) enriches inputs using CESM-100; b)
fine-tunes LLMs for multi-task learning: self-harm detection (primary) and
CM/SI span detection (auxiliary); c) generates explainable rationales for
self-harm predictions. We evaluate the framework on three state-of-the-art
LLMs-Llama 3, Mental-Alpaca, and MentalLlama, across zero-shot, few-shot, and
fine-tuned scenarios. By coupling intent differentiation with contextual cues,
our approach commendably enhances LLM performance in both detection and
explanation tasks, effectively addressing the inherent ambiguity in self-harm
signals. The SHINES dataset, CESM-100 and codebase are publicly available at:

*HaoTian Lan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper explores how street-level features, such as vehicle density and greenery, impact commercial and user satisfaction metrics on community-scale streets in Harbin, China, through an AI-driven framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the intricate relationship between street-level characteristics (e.g., vehicular accessibility, environmental quality) and commercial vitality, particularly for improving urban design and enhancing community spaces.

Method: The paper uses a combination of street-view imagery, a multimodal large language model (VisualGLM-6B), and GPT-4-based perception modeling to analyze spatial attributes. A Community Commercial Vitality Index (CCVI) is constructed from Meituan and Dianping data to explore these relationships.

Result: The study finds that moderate vehicle presence improves commercial access while excessive parking reduces walkability. Greenery and cleanliness positively influence satisfaction but have limited effects on pricing. Street width moderates these relationships, emphasizing the nuanced effects of spatial configurations.

Conclusion: The findings highlight the need for balanced parking management and street design to boost commercial vitality. The integration of AI-assisted tools and urban morphology is shown to effectively identify context-sensitive factors influencing commerce and satisfaction.

Abstract: The commercial vitality of community-scale streets in Chinese cities is
shaped by complex interactions between vehicular accessibility, environmental
quality, and pedestrian perception. This study proposes an interpretable,
image-based framework to examine how street-level features -- including parked
vehicle density, greenery, cleanliness, and street width -- impact retail
performance and user satisfaction in Harbin, China. Leveraging street view
imagery and a multimodal large language model (VisualGLM-6B), we construct a
Community Commercial Vitality Index (CCVI) from Meituan and Dianping data and
analyze its relationship with spatial attributes extracted via GPT-4-based
perception modeling. Our findings reveal that while moderate vehicle presence
may enhance commercial access, excessive on-street parking -- especially in
narrow streets -- erodes walkability and reduces both satisfaction and
shop-level pricing. In contrast, streets with higher perceived greenery and
cleanliness show significantly greater satisfaction scores but only weak
associations with pricing. Street width moderates the effects of vehicle
presence, underscoring the importance of spatial configuration. These results
demonstrate the value of integrating AI-assisted perception with urban
morphological analysis to capture non-linear and context-sensitive drivers of
commercial success. This study advances both theoretical and methodological
frontiers by highlighting the conditional role of vehicle activity in
neighborhood commerce and demonstrating the feasibility of multimodal AI for
perceptual urban diagnostics. The implications extend to urban design, parking
management, and scalable planning tools for community revitalization.

*Tianyi Huang,Zikun Cui,Cuiqianhe Du,Chia-En Chiang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces CL-ISR, a framework integrating contrastive learning and implicit stance reasoning to improve misleading text detection accuracy on social media.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Detecting misleading texts on social media is critical to prevent public misunderstanding, social panic, and economic losses.

Method: The authors combine contrastive learning for semantic differentiation with implicit stance reasoning for identifying emotional manipulation, integrating these into the novel CL-ISR framework.

Result: The CL-ISR framework enhances the ability to differentiate truthful from misleading texts and captures implicit stance tendencies more effectively, especially in complex linguistic scenarios.

Conclusion: CL-ISR significantly improves the detection of misleading texts by combining discriminative semantic analysis and in-depth stance reasoning.

Abstract: Misleading text detection on social media platforms is a critical research
area, as these texts can lead to public misunderstanding, social panic and even
economic losses. This paper proposes a novel framework - CL-ISR (Contrastive
Learning and Implicit Stance Reasoning), which combines contrastive learning
and implicit stance reasoning, to improve the detection accuracy of misleading
texts on social media. First, we use the contrastive learning algorithm to
improve the model's learning ability of semantic differences between truthful
and misleading texts. Contrastive learning could help the model to better
capture the distinguishing features between different categories by
constructing positive and negative sample pairs. This approach enables the
model to capture distinguishing features more effectively, particularly in
linguistically complicated situations. Second, we introduce the implicit stance
reasoning module, to explore the potential stance tendencies in the text and
their relationships with related topics. This method is effective for
identifying content that misleads through stance shifting or emotional
manipulation, because it can capture the implicit information behind the text.
Finally, we integrate these two algorithms together to form a new framework,
CL-ISR, which leverages the discriminative power of contrastive learning and
the interpretive depth of stance reasoning to significantly improve detection
effect.

*Hong-Yun Lin,Tien-Hong Lo,Yu-Hsuan Fang,Jhen-Ke Lin,Chung-Chun Wang,Hao-Chien Lu,Berlin Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a combined system integrating wav2vec 2.0 and Phi-4 MLLM to enhance spoken language assessment, achieving competitive performance in a major challenge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations in spoken language assessment when using neural models like BERT and wav2vec 2.0, as these models face challenges like lack of interpretability or failing to capture certain linguistic/acoustic cues.

Method: The authors propose combining wav2vec 2.0 with Phi-4 multimodal large language models using a score fusion strategy to leverage the strengths of both systems.

Result: The proposed system achieved a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.375 in the Speak & Improve Challenge 2025, earning second place out of multiple submissions, and outperformed the baseline and other competitive systems.

Conclusion: By integrating linguistic and acoustic modalities through advanced fusion of neural models, this research demonstrates a practical and effective solution for improving spoken language assessment.

Abstract: A recent line of research on spoken language assessment (SLA) employs neural
models such as BERT and wav2vec 2.0 (W2V) to evaluate speaking proficiency
across linguistic and acoustic modalities. Although both models effectively
capture features relevant to oral competence, each exhibits modality-specific
limitations. BERT-based methods rely on ASR transcripts, which often fail to
capture prosodic and phonetic cues for SLA. In contrast, W2V-based methods
excel at modeling acoustic features but lack semantic interpretability. To
overcome these limitations, we propose a system that integrates W2V with Phi-4
multimodal large language model (MLLM) through a score fusion strategy. The
proposed system achieves a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.375 on the
official test set of the Speak & Improve Challenge 2025, securing second place
in the competition. For comparison, the RMSEs of the top-ranked, third-ranked,
and official baseline systems are 0.364, 0.384, and 0.444, respectively.

*Tanmay Parekh,Kartik Mehta,Ninareh Mehrabi,Kai-Wei Chang,Nanyun Peng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DiCoRe is a framework for zero-shot Event Detection that leverages divergent-convergent reasoning to improve event coverage and precision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current large language models are overloaded and limited in utility for zero-shot event detection due to challenges like complex ontologies and domain-specific triggers.

Method: DiCoRe decouples the task into two components: 'Dreamer' for divergent reasoning (open-ended event discovery) and 'Grounder' for convergent reasoning (task-specific alignment). An LLM-Judge ensures high precision.

Result: DiCoRe achieves 4-7% average F1 improvements over the best baselines in experiments conducted on six datasets, five domains, and nine LLMs.

Conclusion: DiCoRe establishes itself as a robust zero-shot Event Detection framework outperforming prior methods while addressing precision and coverage challenges.

Abstract: Zero-shot Event Detection (ED), the task of identifying event mentions in
natural language text without any training data, is critical for document
understanding in specialized domains. Understanding the complex event ontology,
extracting domain-specific triggers from the passage, and structuring them
appropriately overloads and limits the utility of Large Language Models (LLMs)
for zero-shot ED. To this end, we propose DiCoRe, a divergent-convergent
reasoning framework that decouples the task of ED using Dreamer and Grounder.
Dreamer encourages divergent reasoning through open-ended event discovery,
which helps to boost event coverage. Conversely, Grounder introduces convergent
reasoning to align the free-form predictions with the task-specific
instructions using finite-state machine guided constrained decoding.
Additionally, an LLM-Judge verifies the final outputs to ensure high precision.
Through extensive experiments on six datasets across five domains and nine
LLMs, we demonstrate how DiCoRe consistently outperforms prior zero-shot,
transfer-learning, and reasoning baselines, achieving 4-7% average F1 gains
over the best baseline -- establishing DiCoRe as a strong zero-shot ED
framework.

*Taiga Someya,Anej Svete,Brian DuSell,Timothy J. O'Donnell,Mario Giulianelli,Ryan Cotterell*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates inductive biases in neural language models (LMs) and introduces a metric called $m$-local entropy to assess language learning difficulty.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inductive biases in neural LMs influence how they generalize from finite data, but it's unclear whether these biases align with human processing constraints.

Method: The paper introduces $m$-local entropy, an information-theoretic metric, to quantify local uncertainty in language and uses both perturbed natural corpora and probabilistic finite-state automata for experiments.

Result: Languages with higher $m$-local entropy are more difficult for Transformer and LSTM models to learn, highlighting their sensitivity to local statistical language structure.

Conclusion: Neural language models exhibit inductive biases similar to humans, being particularly sensitive to the local statistical properties of a language.

Abstract: Inductive biases are inherent in every machine learning system, shaping how
models generalize from finite data. In the case of neural language models
(LMs), debates persist as to whether these biases align with or diverge from
human processing constraints. To address this issue, we propose a quantitative
framework that allows for controlled investigations into the nature of these
biases. Within our framework, we introduce $m$-local entropy$\unicode{x2013}$an
information-theoretic measure derived from average lossy-context
surprisal$\unicode{x2013}$that captures the local uncertainty of a language by
quantifying how effectively the $m-1$ preceding symbols disambiguate the next
symbol. In experiments on both perturbed natural language corpora and languages
defined by probabilistic finite-state automata (PFSAs), we show that languages
with higher $m$-local entropy are more difficult for Transformer and LSTM LMs
to learn. These results suggest that neural LMs, much like humans, are highly
sensitive to the local statistical structure of a language.

TL;DR: This paper analyzes how large audio-language models (LALMs) internally perceive auditory attributes and suggests methods for improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how LALMs process auditory attributes and identify areas for performance enhancement.

Method: Vocabulary projection is applied to track how attribute information changes across layers and token positions within state-of-the-art LALMs.

Result: The study observes that attribute recognition generally decreases with layer depth and that earlier layer resolution correlates with higher accuracy. LALMs rely on querying auditory inputs for attributes instead of retaining the information in hidden states.

Conclusion: The findings provide insights into auditory attribute processing and introduce a method to improve LALM performance, which contributes to future research and development in this area.

Abstract: Understanding the internal mechanisms of large audio-language models (LALMs)
is crucial for interpreting their behavior and improving performance. This work
presents the first in-depth analysis of how LALMs internally perceive and
recognize auditory attributes. By applying vocabulary projection on three
state-of-the-art LALMs, we track how attribute information evolves across
layers and token positions. We find that attribute information generally
decreases with layer depth when recognition fails, and that resolving
attributes at earlier layers correlates with better accuracy. Moreover, LALMs
heavily rely on querying auditory inputs for predicting attributes instead of
aggregating necessary information in hidden states at attribute-mentioning
positions. Based on our findings, we demonstrate a method to enhance LALMs. Our
results offer insights into auditory attribute processing, paving the way for
future improvements.

*Diege Sun,Guanyi Chen,Fan Zhao,Xiaorong Cheng,Tingting He*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper investigates whether Large Language Models (LLMs) can replicate human judgments on error severity in image descriptions containing semantic errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the ability of LLMs to accurately replicate human error severity judgments, especially in contexts involving visual and textual data.

Method: A systematic comparison was done using unimodal (text-only) and multimodal (text + images) settings for semantic error evaluation across four types: age, gender, clothing type, and clothing colour.

Result: Humans exhibited varying severity levels for error types, influenced by visual context. Most LLMs diverged from human judgments, except for DeepSeek-V3, which demonstrated notable alignment.

Conclusion: LLMs struggle to replicate human-like sensitivity to errors due to lack of perceptual grounding, but some unimodal models like DeepSeek-V3 show promising alignment with human judgment.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used as automated evaluators in
natural language generation, yet it remains unclear whether they can accurately
replicate human judgments of error severity. In this study, we systematically
compare human and LLM assessments of image descriptions containing controlled
semantic errors. We extend the experimental framework of van Miltenburg et al.
(2020) to both unimodal (text-only) and multimodal (text + image) settings,
evaluating four error types: age, gender, clothing type, and clothing colour.
Our findings reveal that humans assign varying levels of severity to different
error types, with visual context significantly amplifying perceived severity
for colour and type errors. Notably, most LLMs assign low scores to gender
errors but disproportionately high scores to colour errors, unlike humans, who
judge both as highly severe but for different reasons. This suggests that these
models may have internalised social norms influencing gender judgments but lack
the perceptual grounding to emulate human sensitivity to colour, which is
shaped by distinct neural mechanisms. Only one of the evaluated LLMs, Doubao,
replicates the human-like ranking of error severity, but it fails to
distinguish between error types as clearly as humans. Surprisingly,
DeepSeek-V3, a unimodal LLM, achieves the highest alignment with human
judgments across both unimodal and multimodal conditions, outperforming even
state-of-the-art multimodal models.

TL;DR: The authors propose Knowledgeable-r1, a method that balances retrieved and inherent knowledge in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, enhancing robustness and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study seeks to address the imbalance in RAG systems, where there is excessive reliance on retrieved contexts over the model's inherent knowledge, especially when the retrieved contexts are misleading or excessive.

Method: Knowledgeable-r1 utilizes joint sampling and multi-policy distributions to encourage large language models to integrate both parametric and contextual knowledge.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that Knowledgeable-r1 improves reasoning accuracy and robustness, outperforming baseline models, particularly excelling in counterfactual scenarios by 17.07%.

Conclusion: Knowledgeable-r1 successfully balances the interplay between retrieved and inherent knowledge in RAG systems, achieving notable performance improvements across various tasks.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a mainstream method for improving
performance on knowledge-intensive tasks. However,current RAG systems often
place too much emphasis on retrieved contexts. This can lead to reliance on
inaccurate sources and overlook the model's inherent knowledge, especially when
dealing with misleading or excessive information. To resolve this imbalance, we
propose Knowledgeable-r1 that using joint sampling and define multi policy
distributions in knowledge capability exploration to stimulate large language
models'self-integrated utilization of parametric and contextual knowledge.
Experiments show that Knowledgeable-r1 significantly enhances robustness and
reasoning accuracy in both parameters and contextual conflict tasks and general
RAG tasks, especially outperforming baselines by 17.07% in counterfactual
scenarios and demonstrating consistent gains across RAG tasks. Our code are

*Bhavik Chandna,Zubair Bashir,Procheta Sen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates how biases (social, demographic, gender) are represented within LLMs, using GPT-2 and Llama2 as case studies, and identifies localized components responsible for these biases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Biases in LLMs, stemming from training data, lead to undesirable outcomes. Understanding how these biases are encoded is key to mitigating their effect.

Method: A mechanistic interpretability approach is used to study bias representation in LLMs. Metrics and systematic ablation are applied to locate and measure biased components across layers and variations.

Result: Bias computations are highly localized in specific layers. Removing these components reduces biased outputs but negatively impacts other tasks like named entity recognition.

Conclusion: The paper highlights challenges in addressing biases within LLMs without inadvertently affecting broader NLP functionalities, due to shared components between bias and other linguistic tasks.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are known to exhibit social, demographic, and
gender biases, often as a consequence of the data on which they are trained. In
this work, we adopt a mechanistic interpretability approach to analyze how such
biases are structurally represented within models such as GPT-2 and Llama2.
Focusing on demographic and gender biases, we explore different metrics to
identify the internal edges responsible for biased behavior. We then assess the
stability, localization, and generalizability of these components across
dataset and linguistic variations. Through systematic ablations, we demonstrate
that bias-related computations are highly localized, often concentrated in a
small subset of layers. Moreover, the identified components change across
fine-tuning settings, including those unrelated to bias. Finally, we show that
removing these components not only reduces biased outputs but also affects
other NLP tasks, such as named entity recognition and linguistic acceptability
judgment because of the sharing of important components with these tasks.

*Yeonseok Jeong,Jinsu Kim,Dohyeon Lee,Seung-won Hwang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces ECoRAG, a framework that enhances language model performance in Open-Domain QA by compressing and filtering retrieved documents based on evidentiality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve LLM performance in ODQA tasks and reduce computational overhead associated with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) by addressing limitations in previous context compression methods.

Method: The proposed ECoRAG framework compresses retrieved documents by filtering out non-evidential information, ensuring that the evidence supports answer generation. It also retrieves additional information when the compressed content is insufficient.

Result: ECoRAG demonstrated better ODQA performance compared to existing compression methods, achieving higher cost-efficiency by reducing latency and token usage.

Conclusion: The ECoRAG framework enhances the accuracy and efficiency of RAG in ODQA, making it an effective and cost-efficient solution.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance in Open-Domain
Question Answering (ODQA) by leveraging external documents through
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). To reduce RAG overhead, from longer
context, context compression is necessary. However, prior compression methods
do not focus on filtering out non-evidential information, which limit the
performance in LLM-based RAG. We thus propose Evidentiality-guided RAG, or
\textbf{ECoRAG} framework. ECoRAG improves LLM performance by compressing
retrieved documents based on evidentiality, ensuring whether answer generation
is supported by the correct evidence. As an additional step, ECoRAG reflects
whether the compressed content provides sufficient evidence, and if not,
retrieves more until sufficient. Experiments show that ECoRAG improves LLM
performance on ODQA tasks, outperforming existing compression methods.
Furthermore, ECoRAG is highly cost-efficient, as it not only reduces latency
but also minimizes token usage by retaining only the necessary information to
generate the correct answer. Code is available at

Conclusion: The Qwen3 Embedding series provides improved multilingual text embedding performance and flexibility with effective deployment options, and is openly shared to encourage community-driven innovation.

Abstract: In this work, we introduce the Qwen3 Embedding series, a significant
advancement over its predecessor, the GTE-Qwen series, in text embedding and
reranking capabilities, built upon the Qwen3 foundation models. Leveraging the
Qwen3 LLMs' robust capabilities in multilingual text understanding and
generation, our innovative multi-stage training pipeline combines large-scale
unsupervised pre-training with supervised fine-tuning on high-quality datasets.
Effective model merging strategies further ensure the robustness and
adaptability of the Qwen3 Embedding series. During the training process, the
Qwen3 LLMs serve not only as backbone models but also play a crucial role in
synthesizing high-quality, rich, and diverse training data across multiple
domains and languages, thus enhancing the training pipeline. The Qwen3
Embedding series offers a spectrum of model sizes (0.6B, 4B, 8B) for both
embedding and reranking tasks, addressing diverse deployment scenarios where
users can optimize for either efficiency or effectiveness. Empirical
evaluations demonstrate that the Qwen3 Embedding series achieves
state-of-the-art results across diverse benchmarks. Notably, it excels on the
multilingual evaluation benchmark MTEB for text embedding, as well as in
various retrieval tasks, including code retrieval, cross-lingual retrieval and
multilingual retrieval. To facilitate reproducibility and promote
community-driven research and development, the Qwen3 Embedding models are

*Moritz Miller,Bernhard Schölkopf,Siyuan Guo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper explores language models' (LMs) ability for in-context counterfactual reasoning using controlled setups like linear regression tasks that involve noise abduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors are motivated to investigate whether large-scale language models can perform counterfactual reasoning in different contexts, given their success with in-context learning.

Method: The study employs a synthetic linear regression task requiring noise abduction to evaluate counterfactual reasoning. It also examines factors like self-attention, model depth, and data diversity in Transformer models.

Result: The authors find that language models can perform counterfactual reasoning in controlled setups and show that data and model design strongly influence this capability. Results also hint at the models' potential for tasks like counterfactual story generation.

Conclusion: Language models, particularly Transformers, show promise in counterfactual reasoning. This capability could extend to broader tasks and applications beyond regression setups.

Abstract: Large-scale neural language models (LMs) exhibit remarkable performance in
in-context learning: the ability to learn and reason the input context on the
fly without parameter update. This work studies in-context counterfactual
reasoning in language models, that is, to predict the consequences of changes
under hypothetical scenarios. We focus on studying a well-defined synthetic
setup: a linear regression task that requires noise abduction, where accurate
prediction is based on inferring and copying the contextual noise from factual
observations. We show that language models are capable of counterfactual
reasoning in this controlled setup and provide insights that counterfactual
reasoning for a broad class of functions can be reduced to a transformation on
in-context observations; we find self-attention, model depth, and data
diversity in pre-training drive performance in Transformers. More
interestingly, our findings extend beyond regression tasks and show that
Transformers can perform noise abduction on sequential data, providing
preliminary evidence on the potential for counterfactual story generation. Our

*Jackson Petty,Michael Y. Hu,Wentao Wang,Shauli Ravfogel,William Merrill,Tal Linzen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Large language models (LLMs) were tested on the RELIC framework to evaluate their instruction-following capabilities via language recognition tasks, finding performance drops as task complexity increases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate LLMs' ability to follow instructions, specifically in tasks requiring comprehension and application of formal grammars, as current benchmarks may not test their capabilities for complex reasoning adequately.

Method: The paper introduces the RELIC framework, which uses synthetic grammar-based language recognition tasks of varying complexity to test instruction-following skills without contamination from prior training data.

Result: State-of-the-art LLMs show good performance on simple tasks but struggle with more complex grammars and increasingly challenging reasoning tasks, often relying on shallow heuristics instead of true understanding.

Conclusion: Current LLMs have significant limitations in performing complex reasoning tasks that require composing multiple instructions, indicating room for improvement in their instruction-following capabilities.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly expected to perform tasks based
only on a specification of the task provided in context, without examples of
inputs and outputs; this ability is referred to as instruction following. We
introduce the Recognition of Languages In-Context (RELIC) framework to evaluate
instruction following using language recognition: the task of determining if a
string is generated by formal grammar. Unlike many standard evaluations of
LLMs' ability to use their context, this task requires composing together a
large number of instructions (grammar productions) retrieved from the context.
Because the languages are synthetic, the task can be increased in complexity as
LLMs' skills improve, and new instances can be automatically generated,
mitigating data contamination. We evaluate state-of-the-art LLMs on RELIC and
find that their accuracy can be reliably predicted from the complexity of the
grammar and the individual example strings, and that even the most advanced
LLMs currently available show near-chance performance on more complex grammars
and samples, in line with theoretical expectations. We also use RELIC to
diagnose how LLMs attempt to solve increasingly difficult reasoning tasks,
finding that as the complexity of the language recognition task increases,
models switch to relying on shallow heuristics instead of following complex
instructions.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper presents the Common Pile v0.1, an 8TB openly licensed text dataset for training large language models (LLMs), along with the Comma v0.1 models trained on it, which show competitive performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address concerns over the use of unlicensed text in training LLMs by creating a large, high-quality dataset of openly licensed text.

Method: The authors collected and curated text from 30 diverse domains to form the Common Pile v0.1 dataset, validated it by training two 7B parameter LLMs on it and compared their performance to LLMs trained on unlicensed data.

Result: The two trained models, Comma v0.1-1T and Comma v0.1-2T, achieved performance comparable to LLaMA 1 and 2 models with similar computational budgets.

Conclusion: Openly licensed datasets like the Common Pile v0.1 can enable the ethical training of high-performing LLMs, and the released models and resources provide a foundation for further research.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are typically trained on enormous quantities of
unlicensed text, a practice that has led to scrutiny due to possible
intellectual property infringement and ethical concerns. Training LLMs on
openly licensed text presents a first step towards addressing these issues, but
prior data collection efforts have yielded datasets too small or low-quality to
produce performant LLMs. To address this gap, we collect, curate, and release
the Common Pile v0.1, an eight terabyte collection of openly licensed text
designed for LLM pretraining. The Common Pile comprises content from 30 sources
that span diverse domains including research papers, code, books,
encyclopedias, educational materials, audio transcripts, and more. Crucially,
we validate our efforts by training two 7 billion parameter LLMs on text from
the Common Pile: Comma v0.1-1T and Comma v0.1-2T, trained on 1 and 2 trillion
tokens respectively. Both models attain competitive performance to LLMs trained
on unlicensed text with similar computational budgets, such as Llama 1 and 2
7B. In addition to releasing the Common Pile v0.1 itself, we also release the
code used in its creation as well as the training mixture and checkpoints for
the Comma v0.1 models.

*Adam Wiemerslage,Katharina von der Wense*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores self-supervised auxiliary tasks for character-level morphological inflection in low-resource settings and tests 13 objectives across 19 languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of large-scale resources for many languages, particularly for character-level tasks, and improve morphological modeling in low-resource settings.

Method: The study trains encoder-decoder transformers for 19 languages on 13 auxiliary tasks, using unlabeled data and various self-supervised objectives like autoencoding and character masked language modeling (CMLM).

Result: Autoencoding is effective with limited data, while CMLM performs better as data quantity grows. Sampling masks based on morpheme boundaries consistently improves the model performance.

Conclusion: Self-supervised tasks can enhance low-resource morphological inflection, and integrating morpheme boundary knowledge offers further enhancements, though standard objectives like CMLM often dominate in performance.

Abstract: Self-supervised objectives have driven major advances in NLP by leveraging
large-scale unlabeled data, but such resources are scarce for many of the
world's languages. Surprisingly, they have not been explored much for
character-level tasks, where smaller amounts of data have the potential to be
beneficial. We investigate the effectiveness of self-supervised auxiliary tasks
for morphological inflection -- a character-level task highly relevant for
language documentation -- in extremely low-resource settings, training
encoder-decoder transformers for 19 languages and 13 auxiliary objectives.
Autoencoding yields the best performance when unlabeled data is very limited,
while character masked language modeling (CMLM) becomes more effective as data
availability increases. Though objectives with stronger inductive biases
influence model predictions intuitively, they rarely outperform standard CMLM.
However, sampling masks based on known morpheme boundaries consistently
improves performance, highlighting a promising direction for low-resource
morphological modeling.

### [126] [Towards a Unified System of Representation for Continuity and Discontinuity in Natural Language](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05235)
*Ratna Kandala,Prakash Mondal*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper shows a unified mathematical approach for analyzing both continuous and discontinuous linguistic structures, integrating three different grammar formalisms: PSG, DG, and CG.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the fragmentation in linguistic theory by finding a common representation for analyzing syntactic discontinuities and continuous structures, which are expressed differently in existing grammar formalisms.

Method: A unified mathematical derivation is proposed, integrating Phrase Structure Grammar, Dependency Grammar, and Categorial Grammar to analyze both continuous and discontinuous linguistic expressions.

Result: The paper demonstrates that the unified representation accommodates discontinuous structures while preserving compatibility with traditional models of syntactic continuity.

Conclusion: The approach bridges theoretical gaps and opens possibilities for a more holistic understanding and representation of linguistic structures, both continuous and discontinuous.

Abstract: Syntactic discontinuity is a grammatical phenomenon in which a constituent is
split into more than one part because of the insertion of an element which is
not part of the constituent. This is observed in many languages across the
world such as Turkish, Russian, Japanese, Warlpiri, Navajo, Hopi, Dyirbal,
Yidiny etc. Different formalisms/frameworks in current linguistic theory
approach the problem of discontinuous structures in different ways. Each
framework/formalism has widely been viewed as an independent and non-converging
system of analysis. In this paper, we propose a unified system of
representation for both continuity and discontinuity in structures of natural
languages by taking into account three formalisms, in particular, Phrase
Structure Grammar (PSG) for its widely used notion of constituency, Dependency
Grammar (DG) for its head-dependent relations, and Categorial Grammar (CG) for
its focus on functor-argument relations. We attempt to show that discontinuous
expressions as well as continuous structures can be analysed through a unified
mathematical derivation incorporating the representations of linguistic
structure in these three grammar formalisms.

### [127] [CLATTER: Comprehensive Entailment Reasoning for Hallucination Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05243)
*Ron Eliav,Arie Cattan,Eran Hirsch,Shahaf Bassan,Elias Stengel-Eskin,Mohit Bansal,Ido Dagan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a guided reasoning framework for hallucination detection, aimed at improving entailment decisions by decomposing claims and systematically finding supporting evidence for finer-grained and accurate classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Motivated by the challenges in hallucination detection using large language models (LLMs), the authors aim to enhance the reasoning process for entailment classification, as existing strategies often lack systematic evidence attribution.

Method: The paper introduces a 3-step reasoning framework: claim decomposition, sub-claim attribution and entailment classification, followed by aggregated classification. Additionally, an analysis scheme with metrics is proposed to evaluate the intermediate reasoning steps.

Result: The guided reasoning framework demonstrated improved performance in hallucination detection tasks, supported by the analysis scheme's metrics that showcased better intermediate reasoning.

Conclusion: Guiding LLMs to systematically perform a comprehensive reasoning process leads to higher quality entailment classification and better hallucination detection outcomes.

Abstract: A common approach to hallucination detection casts it as a natural language
inference (NLI) task, often using LLMs to classify whether the generated text
is entailed by corresponding reference texts. Since entailment classification
is a complex reasoning task, one would expect that LLMs could benefit from
generating an explicit reasoning process, as in CoT reasoning or the explicit
``thinking'' of recent reasoning models. In this work, we propose that guiding
such models to perform a systematic and comprehensive reasoning process -- one
that both decomposes the text into smaller facts and also finds evidence in the
source for each fact -- allows models to execute much finer-grained and
accurate entailment decisions, leading to increased performance. To that end,
we define a 3-step reasoning process, consisting of (i) claim decomposition,
(ii) sub-claim attribution and entailment classification, and (iii) aggregated
classification, showing that such guided reasoning indeed yields improved
hallucination detection. Following this reasoning framework, we introduce an
analysis scheme, consisting of several metrics that measure the quality of the
intermediate reasoning steps, which provided additional empirical evidence for
the improved quality of our guided reasoning scheme.

*Nan Huo,Jinyang Li,Bowen Qin,Ge Qu,Xiaolong Li,Xiaodong Li,Chenhao Ma,Reynold Cheng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents Micro-Act, a framework designed to address Knowledge Conflicts in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems by performing fine-grained comparisons of knowledge sources, enhancing QA accuracy across various conflict types and maintaining strong performance in non-conflicting scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RAG systems struggle with Knowledge Conflicts between retrieved and parametric knowledge, negatively impacting tasks such as question answering. This becomes more pronounced with current methods that overwhelm models by directly comparing lengthy or extraneous contexts.

Method: The authors introduce Micro-Act, a framework with a hierarchical action space that adaptively decomposes complex contexts into fine-grained, actionable comparisons. This approach promotes reasoning beyond superficial inconsistencies in knowledge.

Result: Experimental results across five benchmark datasets demonstrate Micro-Act's consistent improvement in QA accuracy over state-of-the-art baselines, especially excelling in cases of temporal and semantic conflicts.

Conclusion: Micro-Act not only outperforms in handling knowledge conflicts but also preserves robust performance for non-conflict scenarios, showing its effectiveness and practical utility in real-world RAG applications.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems commonly suffer from Knowledge
Conflicts, where retrieved external knowledge contradicts the inherent,
parametric knowledge of large language models (LLMs). It adversely affects
performance on downstream tasks such as question answering (QA). Existing
approaches often attempt to mitigate conflicts by directly comparing two
knowledge sources in a side-by-side manner, but this can overwhelm LLMs with
extraneous or lengthy contexts, ultimately hindering their ability to identify
and mitigate inconsistencies. To address this issue, we propose Micro-Act a
framework with a hierarchical action space that automatically perceives context
complexity and adaptively decomposes each knowledge source into a sequence of
fine-grained comparisons. These comparisons are represented as actionable
steps, enabling reasoning beyond the superficial context. Through extensive
experiments on five benchmark datasets, Micro-Act consistently achieves
significant increase in QA accuracy over state-of-the-art baselines across all
5 datasets and 3 conflict types, especially in temporal and semantic types
where all baselines fail significantly. More importantly, Micro-Act exhibits
robust performance on non-conflict questions simultaneously, highlighting its
practical value in real-world RAG applications.

TL;DR: ProRefine enhances AI agent workflows by dynamically refining prompts during inference using textual feedback, significantly improving performance on complex reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aimed to address issues in agentic workflows caused by suboptimal prompts leading to error propagation and inefficiency in collaborative AI systems.

Method: ProRefine involves inference-time prompt optimization using textual feedback from large language models, enabling dynamic refinement without extra training or labeled data.

Result: ProRefine outperforms zero-shot Chain-of-Thought baselines on five mathematical reasoning datasets, improving accuracy by 3-37% and making smaller models perform comparably to larger ones.

Conclusion: ProRefine improves multi-agent AI systems in efficiency and scalability, enhancing democratized access to high-performing AI and refining prompts for complex reasoning tasks without requiring extra training.

Abstract: Agentic workflows, where multiple AI agents collaborate to accomplish complex
tasks like reasoning or planning, are becoming increasingly prevalent. However,
these workflows often suffer from error propagation and sub-optimal
performance, largely due to poorly designed prompts that fail to effectively
guide individual agents. This is a critical problem because it limits the
reliability and scalability of these powerful systems. We introduce ProRefine,
an innovative inference-time prompt optimization method that leverages textual
feedback from large language models (LLMs) to address this challenge. ProRefine
dynamically refines prompts for multi-step reasoning tasks without additional
training or ground truth labels. Evaluated on five benchmark mathematical
reasoning datasets, ProRefine significantly surpasses zero-shot
Chain-of-Thought baselines by 3 to 37 percentage points. This approach not only
boosts accuracy but also allows smaller models to match the performance of
larger ones, highlighting its potential for efficient and scalable AI
deployment, and democratizing access to high-performing AI.

*Taha Entesari,Arman Hatami,Rinat Khaziev,Anil Ramakrishna,Mahyar Fazlyab*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new method for unlearning information in large language models (LLMs) that improves both forgetting and retention performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges in unlearning sensitive or proprietary information in LLMs without compromising performance on retained data.

Method: The authors propose reframing unlearning as a constrained optimization problem, using a novel logit-margin flattening loss for forgetting and a hard constraint mechanism for retention, solved via a primal-dual algorithm.

Result: The proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on the TOFU and MUSE benchmarks, achieving efficient and robust unlearning with minimal retention loss.

Conclusion: This approach offers a stable and scalable solution for selectively unlearning information in LLMs while retaining their downstream utility.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) deployed in real-world settings increasingly
face the need to unlearn sensitive, outdated, or proprietary information.
Existing unlearning methods typically formulate forgetting and retention as a
regularized trade-off, combining both objectives into a single scalarized loss.
This often leads to unstable optimization and degraded performance on retained
data, especially under aggressive forgetting. We propose a new formulation of
LLM unlearning as a constrained optimization problem: forgetting is enforced
via a novel logit-margin flattening loss that explicitly drives the output
distribution toward uniformity on a designated forget set, while retention is
preserved through a hard constraint on a separate retain set. Compared to
entropy-based objectives, our loss is softmax-free, numerically stable, and
maintains non-vanishing gradients, enabling more efficient and robust
optimization. We solve the constrained problem using a scalable primal-dual
algorithm that exposes the trade-off between forgetting and retention through
the dynamics of the dual variable. Evaluations on the TOFU and MUSE benchmarks
across diverse LLM architectures demonstrate that our approach consistently
matches or exceeds state-of-the-art baselines, effectively removing targeted
information while preserving downstream utility.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Search Arena, a dataset of over 24,000 search-augmented LLM interactions revealing user preferences influenced by citation practices, source credibility, and performance variations in search versus non-search settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limited scope and static nature of existing datasets analyzing search-augmented language models.

Method: Created a crowd-sourced dataset containing multi-turn interactions, user preferences, and citation analysis, paired with systematic comparison of search-augmented and conventional LLMs.

Result: User preferences are shaped by citation quantity and source type, exposing gaps in perceived vs actual credibility; performance varies based on search-driven contexts.

Conclusion: Search-augmented LLMs can enhance non-search scenarios without degrading quality, but their reliance on parametric knowledge impacts search-heavy contexts significantly.

Abstract: Search-augmented language models combine web search with Large Language
Models (LLMs) to improve response groundedness and freshness. However,
analyzing these systems remains challenging: existing datasets are limited in
scale and narrow in scope, often constrained to static, single-turn,
fact-checking questions. In this work, we introduce Search Arena, a
crowd-sourced, large-scale, human-preference dataset of over 24,000 paired
multi-turn user interactions with search-augmented LLMs. The dataset spans
diverse intents and languages, and contains full system traces with around
12,000 human preference votes. Our analysis reveals that user preferences are
influenced by the number of citations, even when the cited content does not
directly support the attributed claims, uncovering a gap between perceived and
actual credibility. Furthermore, user preferences vary across cited sources,
revealing that community-driven platforms are generally preferred and static
encyclopedic sources are not always appropriate and reliable. To assess
performance across different settings, we conduct cross-arena analyses by
testing search-augmented LLMs in a general-purpose chat environment and
conventional LLMs in search-intensive settings. We find that web search does
not degrade and may even improve performance in non-search settings; however,
the quality in search settings is significantly affected if solely relying on
the model's parametric knowledge. We open-sourced the dataset to support future
research in this direction. Our dataset and code are available at:

*Anirudh Bharadwaj,Chaitanya Malaviya,Nitish Joshi,Mark Yatskar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses how language models, used for human preference judgments, are biased due to training data, favoring superficial over substantive features. Through counterfactual examples and mitigation techniques, they show that debiasing enhances model calibration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the observation that language models miscalibrate human preferences by overly focusing on superficial features, resulting in problems like reward hacking and unreliable evaluations.

Method: The authors investigate miscalibration using controlled counterfactual pairs across several features (length, structure, jargon, etc.), measure the discrepancy between human and model preferences, and use counterfactual data augmentation to finetune and reduce biases.

Result: Their proposed finetuning method decreases miscalibration and skew differences significantly while maintaining overall performance on benchmarks.

Conclusion: Targeted debiasing efforts, particularly counterfactual data augmentation, can successfully address preference model miscalibration in language models.

Abstract: Language models serve as proxies for human preference judgements in alignment
and evaluation, yet they exhibit systematic miscalibration, prioritizing
superficial patterns over substantive qualities. This bias manifests as
overreliance on features like length, structure, and style, leading to issues
like reward hacking and unreliable evaluations. Evidence suggests these biases
originate in artifacts in human training data. In this work, we systematically
investigate the relationship between training data biases and preference model
miscalibration across five idiosyncratic features of language model
generations: length, structure, jargon, sycophancy and vagueness. Using
controlled counterfactual pairs, we first quantify the extent to which
preference models favor responses with magnified biases (skew), finding this
preference occurs in >60% of instances, and model preferences show high
miscalibration (~40%) compared to human preferences. Notably, bias features
only show mild negative correlations to human preference labels (mean r_human =
-0.12) but show moderately strong positive correlations with labels from a
strong reward model (mean r_model = +0.36), suggesting that models may overrely
on spurious cues. To mitigate these issues, we propose a simple post-training
method based on counterfactual data augmentation (CDA) using synthesized
contrastive examples. Finetuning models with CDA reduces average miscalibration
from 39.4% to 32.5% and average absolute skew difference from 20.5% to 10.0%,
while maintaining overall RewardBench performance, showing that targeted
debiasing is effective for building reliable preference models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces HSSBench, a benchmark designed to evaluate Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) on tasks specific to the Humanities and Social Sciences (HSS), which require interdisciplinary reasoning and integration of visual and conceptual knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the gap in current benchmarks, which focus on STEM tasks and ignore unique challenges posed by HSS tasks that demand horizontal, interdisciplinary thinking and linking abstract concepts with visual cues.

Method: A novel benchmark called HSSBench has been developed, focusing on interdisciplinary tasks in HSS. It includes over 13,000 samples in multiple languages and involves a data generation pipeline with domain experts and automated agents collaboratively refining each sample.

Result: The study benchmarks more than 20 mainstream MLLMs on HSSBench, highlighting that even state-of-the-art models face significant challenges when tackling HSS tasks.

Conclusion: The authors hope HSSBench will encourage further research to improve MLLMs' cross-disciplinary reasoning and ability to connect knowledge across various fields, catering to the distinct demands of HSS.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant
potential to advance a broad range of domains. However, current benchmarks for
evaluating MLLMs primarily emphasize general knowledge and vertical
step-by-step reasoning typical of STEM disciplines, while overlooking the
distinct needs and potential of the Humanities and Social Sciences (HSS). Tasks
in the HSS domain require more horizontal, interdisciplinary thinking and a
deep integration of knowledge across related fields, which presents unique
challenges for MLLMs, particularly in linking abstract concepts with
corresponding visual representations. Addressing this gap, we present HSSBench,
a dedicated benchmark designed to assess the capabilities of MLLMs on HSS tasks
in multiple languages, including the six official languages of the United
Nations. We also introduce a novel data generation pipeline tailored for HSS
scenarios, in which multiple domain experts and automated agents collaborate to
generate and iteratively refine each sample. HSSBench contains over 13,000
meticulously designed samples, covering six key categories. We benchmark more
than 20 mainstream MLLMs on HSSBench and demonstrate that it poses significant
challenges even for state-of-the-art models. We hope that this benchmark will
inspire further research into enhancing the cross-disciplinary reasoning
abilities of MLLMs, especially their capacity to internalize and connect
knowledge across fields.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Dynamic Epsilon Scheduling (DES), a method for adapting adversarial perturbation budgets per instance and training iteration, significantly improving robustness and accuracy in neural networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing adversarial training methods use a fixed perturbation budget, failing to account for the instance-specific robustness characteristics of data.

Method: Dynamic Epsilon Scheduling (DES) combines gradient-based distance to the decision boundary, prediction confidence, and model uncertainty into a unified, dynamic scheduling strategy for perturbation budgets.

Result: DES improves adversarial robustness and standard accuracy on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets, outperforming fixed-epsilon and prior adaptive methods.

Conclusion: DES provides a theoretically stable and effective approach for instance-aware adversarial training, opening pathways for more tailored, data-driven defenses in neural networks.

Abstract: Adversarial training is among the most effective strategies for defending
deep neural networks against adversarial examples. A key limitation of existing
adversarial training approaches lies in their reliance on a fixed perturbation
budget, which fails to account for instance-specific robustness
characteristics. While prior works such as IAAT and MMA introduce
instance-level adaptations, they often rely on heuristic or static
approximations of data robustness. In this paper, we propose Dynamic Epsilon
Scheduling (DES), a novel framework that adaptively adjusts the adversarial
perturbation budget per instance and per training iteration. DES integrates
three key factors: (1) the distance to the decision boundary approximated via
gradient-based proxies, (2) prediction confidence derived from softmax entropy,
and (3) model uncertainty estimated via Monte Carlo dropout. By combining these
cues into a unified scheduling strategy, DES tailors the perturbation budget
dynamically to guide more effective adversarial learning. Experimental results
on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 show that our method consistently improves both
adversarial robustness and standard accuracy compared to fixed-epsilon
baselines and prior adaptive methods. Moreover, we provide theoretical insights
into the stability and convergence of our scheduling policy. This work opens a
new avenue for instance-aware, data-driven adversarial training methods.

### [135] [RSVP: Reasoning Segmentation via Visual Prompting and Multi-modal Chain-of-Thought](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04277)
*Yi Lu,Jiawang Cao,Yongliang Wu,Bozheng Li,Licheng Tang,Yangguang Ji,Chong Wu,Jay Wu,Wenbo Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces RSVP, a novel framework that unifies multimodal reasoning and visual segmentation, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the gap between reasoning capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) and their lack of explicit mechanisms for visual grounding and segmentation.

Method: RSVP employs a two-stage framework: the first stage uses multimodal chain-of-thought visual prompts for reasoning and localization, while the second stage refines these localizations into segmentation masks using a Vision-Language Segmentation Module.

Result: The framework achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving metrics such as +6.5 gIoU and +9.2 cIoU on ReasonSeg, and achieves 49.7 mAP on SegInW in zero-shot scenarios.

Conclusion: RSVP bridges cognitive reasoning and visual perception, providing an interpretable and scalable framework for reasoning segmentation.

Abstract: Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
reasoning capability while lack explicit mechanisms for visual grounding and
segmentation, creating a gap between cognitive reasoning and visual perception.
To bridge this gap, we introduce Reasoning Segmentation via Visual Prompting
(RSVP), a novel framework that unifies multi-step multimodal reasoning with
grounded visual understanding. RSVP is a two-stage structuralized framework
that integrates reasoning-driven localization with segmentation refinement. In
the reasoning stage, RSVP employs multimodal chain-of-thought visual prompts to
help MLLMs understand queries and infer targets, generating interpretable
region proposals that enhance visual grounding. In segmentation stage, RSVP
refines these proposals with a Vision-Language Segmentation Module (VLSM),
seamlessly integrates textual and visual cues to produce precise segmentation
masks. By explicitly modelling the interaction between multimodal reasoning and
segmentation, RSVP introduces a new paradigm for interpretable reasoning
segmentation. It exploits MLLMs' inherent localization capabilities, enabling
the models to not only reason about objects but also generate structured visual
representations. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that RSVP achieves
state-of-the-art performance, surpasses state-of-the-art methods by up to +6.5
gIoU and +9.2 cIoU on ReasonSeg, and achieves 49.7 mAP on SegInW under
zero-shot settings. These results validate RSVP as an effective and scalable
framework for integrating cognitive reasoning with structured visual
understanding.

TL;DR: The paper presents MMRB, the first benchmark for evaluating structured reasoning in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) over multiple images, and finds that open-source MLLMs and multimodal reward models struggle with such tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MLLM benchmarks either focus on single-image reasoning or evaluate multi-image tasks only through final answers, failing to explore reasoning capabilities over multiple images.

Method: MMRB consists of 92 subtasks on spatial, temporal, and semantic reasoning, incorporating multi-solution, CoT-style annotations refined by experts. A sentence-level matching framework using open-source LLMs is also proposed for evaluation.

Result: Baseline experiments on 40 MLLMs highlight that open-source models significantly underperform compared to commercial ones in multi-image reasoning tasks. Multimodal reward models fail at multi-image ranking tasks.

Conclusion: Improved benchmarks and methods are necessary to advance the reasoning capabilities of both MLLMs and multimodal reward models in multi-image scenarios.

Abstract: With enhanced capabilities and widespread applications, Multimodal Large
Language Models (MLLMs) are increasingly required to process and reason over
multiple images simultaneously. However, existing MLLM benchmarks focus either
on single-image visual reasoning or on multi-image understanding tasks with
only final-answer evaluation, leaving the reasoning capabilities of MLLMs over
multi-image inputs largely underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce the
$\textbf{Multimodal Multi-image Reasoning Benchmark (MMRB)}$, the first
benchmark designed to evaluate structured visual reasoning across multiple
images. MMRB comprises $\textbf{92 sub-tasks}$ covering spatial, temporal, and
semantic reasoning, with multi-solution, CoT-style annotations generated by
GPT-4o and refined by human experts. A derivative subset is designed to
evaluate multimodal reward models in multi-image scenarios. To support fast and
scalable evaluation, we propose a sentence-level matching framework using
open-source LLMs. Extensive baseline experiments on $\textbf{40 MLLMs}$,
including 9 reasoning-specific models and 8 reward models, demonstrate that
open-source MLLMs still lag significantly behind commercial MLLMs in
multi-image reasoning tasks. Furthermore, current multimodal reward models are
nearly incapable of handling multi-image reward ranking tasks.

*Maksym Ivashechkin,Oscar Mendez,Richard Bowden*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents a novel pipeline to address challenges in text-prompt-based accurate 3D human generation, leveraging image diffusion models and transformer architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D human generation is crucial for computer vision and graphics but suffers from issues like poor realism, controlability, and annotation in image data. Addressing these is necessary for foundational advancements in this domain.

Method: The pipeline involves generating a photorealistic human dataset using image diffusion models, mapping image features to 3D point clouds via transformers, and closing the loop by training a point-cloud diffusion model conditioned on text prompts.

Result: The proposed solution significantly accelerates 3D human generation and improves text-prompt alignment, realism, and rendering quality compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The research enhances 3D human modeling by achieving speed-ups and quality improvements while offering tools and datasets for broader research accessibility.

Abstract: 3D human generation is an important problem with a wide range of applications
in computer vision and graphics. Despite recent progress in generative AI such
as diffusion models or rendering methods like Neural Radiance Fields or
Gaussian Splatting, controlling the generation of accurate 3D humans from text
prompts remains an open challenge. Current methods struggle with fine detail,
accurate rendering of hands and faces, human realism, and controlability over
appearance. The lack of diversity, realism, and annotation in human image data
also remains a challenge, hindering the development of a foundational 3D human
model. We present a weakly supervised pipeline that tries to address these
challenges. In the first step, we generate a photorealistic human image dataset
with controllable attributes such as appearance, race, gender, etc using a
state-of-the-art image diffusion model. Next, we propose an efficient mapping
approach from image features to 3D point clouds using a transformer-based
architecture. Finally, we close the loop by training a point-cloud diffusion
model that is conditioned on the same text prompts used to generate the
original samples. We demonstrate orders-of-magnitude speed-ups in 3D human
generation compared to the state-of-the-art approaches, along with
significantly improved text-prompt alignment, realism, and rendering quality.
We will make the code and dataset available.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ReXVQA introduces a benchmark with 696,000 questions on chest X-rays, outperforming human radiologists in accuracy, achieving 83.84% with the MedGemma model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the limitations and lack of diversity in existing benchmarks for radiological VQA by introducing a clinically authentic and comprehensive task suite focusing on core radiological reasoning skills.

Method: The authors created a large dataset paired with chest X-rays, introduced diverse tasks, and evaluated eight advanced multimodal large language models, comparing the best performing model against human radiologists.

Result: The best-performing multimodal model (MedGemma) achieved 83.84% accuracy, surpassing expert radiology residents, with distinct inter- and intra-reader agreement patterns observed in evaluation.

Conclusion: ReXVQA sets a new standard for evaluating radiological AI by demonstrating that AI can surpass expert human performance, laying the groundwork for advanced AI systems in medical reasoning.

Abstract: We present ReXVQA, the largest and most comprehensive benchmark for visual
question answering (VQA) in chest radiology, comprising approximately 696,000
questions paired with 160,000 chest X-rays studies across training, validation,
and test sets. Unlike prior efforts that rely heavily on template based
queries, ReXVQA introduces a diverse and clinically authentic task suite
reflecting five core radiological reasoning skills: presence assessment,
location analysis, negation detection, differential diagnosis, and geometric
reasoning. We evaluate eight state-of-the-art multimodal large language models,
including MedGemma-4B-it, Qwen2.5-VL, Janus-Pro-7B, and Eagle2-9B. The
best-performing model (MedGemma) achieves 83.24% overall accuracy. To bridge
the gap between AI performance and clinical expertise, we conducted a
comprehensive human reader study involving 3 radiology residents on 200
randomly sampled cases. Our evaluation demonstrates that MedGemma achieved
superior performance (83.84% accuracy) compared to human readers (best
radiology resident: 77.27%), representing a significant milestone where AI
performance exceeds expert human evaluation on chest X-ray interpretation. The
reader study reveals distinct performance patterns between AI models and human
experts, with strong inter-reader agreement among radiologists while showing
more variable agreement patterns between human readers and AI models. ReXVQA
establishes a new standard for evaluating generalist radiological AI systems,
offering public leaderboards, fine-grained evaluation splits, structured
explanations, and category-level breakdowns. This benchmark lays the foundation
for next-generation AI systems capable of mimicking expert-level clinical
reasoning beyond narrow pathology classification. Our dataset will be
open-sourced at https://huggingface.co/datasets/rajpurkarlab/ReXVQA

*Delong Chen,Willy Chung,Yejin Bang,Ziwei Ji,Pascale Fung*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces WorldPrediction, a benchmark for evaluating AI's ability in world modeling and procedural planning, contrasting with prior low-level focused benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how AI models, particularly generative ones, can effectively learn world models for action planning and assess this capability quantitatively.

Method: Introduced the WorldPrediction benchmark with two tasks: distinguishing proper actions (WorldPrediction-WM) and ordered sequences of actions (WorldPrediction-PP), using visual representations and formal frameworks.

Result: Current AI models achieve low accuracies (57% on WM and 38% on PP) compared to humans who solve perfectly, highlighting deficiencies in AI world modeling and planning.

Conclusion: The benchmark reveals significant gaps between AI and humans in procedural action planning and emphasizes the need for advancing AI world modeling capabilities.

Abstract: Humans are known to have an internal "world model" that enables us to carry
out action planning based on world states. AI agents need to have such a world
model for action planning as well. It is not clear how current AI models,
especially generative models, are able to learn such world models and carry out
procedural planning in diverse environments. We introduce WorldPrediction, a
video-based benchmark for evaluating world modeling and procedural planning
capabilities of different AI models. In contrast to prior benchmarks that focus
primarily on low-level world modeling and robotic motion planning,
WorldPrediction is the first benchmark that emphasizes actions with temporal
and semantic abstraction. Given initial and final world states, the task is to
distinguish the proper action (WorldPrediction-WM) or the properly ordered
sequence of actions (WorldPrediction-PP) from a set of counterfactual
distractors. This discriminative task setup enable us to evaluate different
types of world models and planners and realize a thorough comparison across
different hypothesis. The benchmark represents states and actions using visual
observations. In order to prevent models from exploiting low-level continuity
cues in background scenes, we provide "action equivalents" - identical actions
observed in different contexts - as candidates for selection. This benchmark is
grounded in a formal framework of partially observable semi-MDP, ensuring
better reliability and robustness of the evaluation. We conduct extensive human
filtering and validation on our benchmark and show that current frontier models
barely achieve 57% accuracy on WorldPrediction-WM and 38% on WorldPrediction-PP
whereas humans are able to solve both tasks perfectly.

*Liam Salass,Jerrin Bright,Amir Nazemi,Yuhao Chen,John Zelek,David Clausi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents PLUCC, a novel model for detecting pucks in ice hockey videos using player behavior as contextual cues, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenges of detecting pucks in ice hockey broadcast videos, which are hindered by occlusions, motion blur, scale inconsistencies, and small object size.

Method: PLUCC uses three components: a contextual encoder to leverage player behavior, a feature pyramid encoder for multiscale feature extraction, and a gating decoder to combine features using channel gating.

Result: PLUCC outperforms existing methods in puck detection on the PuckDataset, improving average precision by 12.2% and RSLE average precision by 25%.

Conclusion: Contextual understanding, particularly player behavior, plays a decisive role in advancing automated puck detection and opens doors for more nuanced sports analytics.

Abstract: Puck detection in ice hockey broadcast videos poses significant challenges
due to the puck's small size, frequent occlusions, motion blur, broadcast
artifacts, and scale inconsistencies due to varying camera zoom and broadcast
camera viewpoints. Prior works focus on appearance-based or motion-based cues
of the puck without explicitly modelling the cues derived from player
behaviour. Players consistently turn their bodies and direct their gaze toward
the puck. Motivated by this strong contextual cue, we propose Puck Localization
Using Contextual Cues (PLUCC), a novel approach for scale-aware and
context-driven single-frame puck detections. PLUCC consists of three
components: (a) a contextual encoder, which utilizes player orientations and
positioning as helpful priors; (b) a feature pyramid encoder, which extracts
multiscale features from the dual encoders; and (c) a gating decoder that
combines latent features with a channel gating mechanism. For evaluation, in
addition to standard average precision, we propose Rink Space Localization
Error (RSLE), a scale-invariant homography-based metric for removing
perspective bias from rink space evaluation. The experimental results of PLUCC
on the PuckDataset dataset demonstrated state-of-the-art detection performance,
surpassing previous baseline methods by an average precision improvement of
12.2\% and RSLE average precision of 25\%. Our research demonstrates the
critical role of contextual understanding in improving puck detection
performance, with broad implications for automated sports analysis.

*Jubayer Ahmed Bhuiyan Shawon,Hasan Mahmud,Kamrul Hasan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper fine-tunes state-of-the-art video transformer models (VideoMAE, ViViT, TimeSformer) for recognizing Bangla Sign Language (BdSL) on two datasets. Results show video transformers significantly outperform earlier methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to enhance accessibility for the hearing-impaired by improving automatic recognition of Bangla Sign Language (BdSL), a primary communication method for many in Bangladesh.

Method: The study fine-tunes video transformer architectures on BdSL datasets with 30 FPS videos using 10-fold cross-validation for balanced evaluation. Data augmentation techniques were used, and models were also benchmarked against public datasets.

Result: VideoMAE achieved the highest performance, with 95.5% accuracy on the smaller BdSLW60 dataset and 81.04% on the larger BdSLW401 dataset. Video transformers outperformed previous machine learning and deep learning methods.

Conclusion: Video transformer models such as VideoMAE demonstrate scalable and accurate performance for BdSL recognition, outperforming traditional approaches and showing promise for real-world applications.

Abstract: Sign Language Recognition (SLR) involves the automatic identification and
classification of sign gestures from images or video, converting them into text
or speech to improve accessibility for the hearing-impaired community. In
Bangladesh, Bangla Sign Language (BdSL) serves as the primary mode of
communication for many individuals with hearing impairments. This study
fine-tunes state-of-the-art video transformer architectures -- VideoMAE, ViViT,
and TimeSformer -- on BdSLW60 (arXiv:2402.08635), a small-scale BdSL dataset
with 60 frequent signs. We standardized the videos to 30 FPS, resulting in
9,307 user trial clips. To evaluate scalability and robustness, the models were
also fine-tuned on BdSLW401 (arXiv:2503.02360), a large-scale dataset with 401
sign classes. Additionally, we benchmark performance against public datasets,
including LSA64 and WLASL. Data augmentation techniques such as random
cropping, horizontal flipping, and short-side scaling were applied to improve
model robustness. To ensure balanced evaluation across folds during model
selection, we employed 10-fold stratified cross-validation on the training set,
while signer-independent evaluation was carried out using held-out test data
from unseen users U4 and U8. Results show that video transformer models
significantly outperform traditional machine learning and deep learning
approaches. Performance is influenced by factors such as dataset size, video
quality, frame distribution, frame rate, and model architecture. Among the
models, the VideoMAE variant (MCG-NJU/videomae-base-finetuned-kinetics)
achieved the highest accuracies of 95.5% on the frame rate corrected BdSLW60
dataset and 81.04% on the front-facing signs of BdSLW401 -- demonstrating
strong potential for scalable and accurate BdSL recognition.

*Matthew W. Shinkle,Mark D. Lescroart*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper demonstrates that activation maximization can successfully characterize and modulate human brain responses using deep neural networks, allowing detailed exploration of visual cortex selectivity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap in understanding specific visual features driving brain responses predicted by DNN-based encoding models.

Method: The authors applied activation maximization to DNN-based models by extracting features from multiple layers of a pretrained Inception V3 network and used linear regression to map them to fMRI responses.

Result: Generated images using activation maximization reliably evoked activity in targeted brain regions across both low- and high-level visual areas in human participants.

Conclusion: Using activation maximization improves the understanding and modulation of human brain visual responses without relying on natively generative models, offering insights into visual cortical selectivity.

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) trained on visual tasks develop feature
representations that resemble those in the human visual system. Although
DNN-based encoding models can accurately predict brain responses to visual
stimuli, they offer limited insight into the specific features driving these
responses. Here, we demonstrate that activation maximization -- a technique
designed to interpret vision DNNs -- can be applied to DNN-based encoding
models of the human brain. We extract and adaptively downsample activations
from multiple layers of a pretrained Inception V3 network, then use linear
regression to predict fMRI responses. This yields a full image-computable model
of brain responses. Next, we apply activation maximization to generate images
optimized for predicted responses in individual cortical voxels. We find that
these images contain visual characteristics that qualitatively correspond with
known selectivity and enable exploration of selectivity across the visual
cortex. We further extend our method to whole regions of interest (ROIs) of the
brain and validate its efficacy by presenting these images to human
participants in an fMRI study. We find that the generated images reliably drive
activity in targeted regions across both low- and high-level visual areas and
across subjects. These results demonstrate that activation maximization can be
successfully applied to DNN-based encoding models. By addressing key
limitations of alternative approaches that require natively generative models,
our approach enables flexible characterization and modulation of responses
across the human visual system.

*Qiuyu Tang,Bonor Ayambem,Mooi Choo Chuah,Aparna Bharati*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Current noise-based protection methods for images do not fully obstruct state-of-the-art diffusion models, like Stable Diffusion, from editing images as guided by given prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Given the dual-use nature of powerful diffusion models, there is a need to explore effective protection mechanisms for safeguarding images from unauthorized or malicious edits.

Method: The study evaluated perturbation-based image protection methods across multiple domains and editing tasks, assessing their effectiveness against diffusion-based image editing tools.

Result: Protected images often still produced desirable edited outputs that adhered to the editing prompts, sometimes even more so due to the added noise.

Conclusion: Perturbation-based protection approaches may not offer sufficient robustness to prevent misuse like unauthorized editing of images by diffusion models.

Abstract: The remarkable image generation capabilities of state-of-the-art diffusion
models, such as Stable Diffusion, can also be misused to spread misinformation
and plagiarize copyrighted materials. To mitigate the potential risks
associated with image editing, current image protection methods rely on adding
imperceptible perturbations to images to obstruct diffusion-based editing. A
fully successful protection for an image implies that the output of editing
attempts is an undesirable, noisy image which is completely unrelated to the
reference image. In our experiments with various perturbation-based image
protection methods across multiple domains (natural scene images and artworks)
and editing tasks (image-to-image generation and style editing), we discover
that such protection does not achieve this goal completely. In most scenarios,
diffusion-based editing of protected images generates a desirable output image
which adheres precisely to the guidance prompt. Our findings suggest that
adding noise to images may paradoxically increase their association with given
text prompts during the generation process, leading to unintended consequences
such as better resultant edits. Hence, we argue that perturbation-based methods
may not provide a sufficient solution for robust image protection against
diffusion-based editing.

### [144] [Normalize Filters! Classical Wisdom for Deep Vision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04401)
*Gustavo Perez,Stella X. Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a simple yet effective filter normalization technique for deep-learning models to enhance robustness, generalization, and response stability under atmospheric transfer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep-learning models use end-to-end learned filters that lack normalization, causing distortions and performance degradation, particularly under atmospheric transfer conditions.

Method: The approach introduces filter normalization, followed by learnable scaling and shifting, similar to batch normalization. This ensures atmosphere-equivariant and co-domain symmetric filter responses, aligning with classical filtering principles.

Result: Integrating filter normalization substantially improves performance on both artificial and natural intensity variation benchmarks. ResNet34, equipped with this method, consistently outperformed even advanced models like CLIP.

Conclusion: Filter normalization enhances the robustness, diversity, and generalization of deep-learning filters, resolving issues caused by unnormalized filters and aligning deep learning with classical image processing principles.

Abstract: Classical image filters, such as those for averaging or differencing, are
carefully normalized to ensure consistency, interpretability, and to avoid
artifacts like intensity shifts, halos, or ringing. In contrast, convolutional
filters learned end-to-end in deep networks lack such constraints. Although
they may resemble wavelets and blob/edge detectors, they are not normalized in
the same or any way. Consequently, when images undergo atmospheric transfer,
their responses become distorted, leading to incorrect outcomes. We address
this limitation by proposing filter normalization, followed by learnable
scaling and shifting, akin to batch normalization. This simple yet effective
modification ensures that the filters are atmosphere-equivariant, enabling
co-domain symmetry. By integrating classical filtering principles into deep
learning (applicable to both convolutional neural networks and
convolution-dependent vision transformers), our method achieves significant
improvements on artificial and natural intensity variation benchmarks. Our
ResNet34 could even outperform CLIP by a large margin. Our analysis reveals
that unnormalized filters degrade performance, whereas filter normalization
regularizes learning, promotes diversity, and improves robustness and
generalization.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper improves egocentric device-based photorealistic HDR scene reconstruction by focusing on precise timestamp calibration and incorporating a physical image formation model into Gaussian Splatting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in existing methods that overlook pixel-accurate scene details due to imprecise calibration and sensor modeling in rolling-shutter RGB cameras.

Method: The approach integrates Visual-Inertial Bundle Adjustment (VIBA) to calibrate rolling-shutter RGB cameras and incorporates a physical image formation model addressing sensor properties like rolling-shutter effect and dynamic range into Gaussian Splatting.

Result: The method improves visual quality by +1 dB PSNR from VIBA and an additional +1 dB from the image formation model, validated on Project Aria and Meta Quest3 under diverse conditions.

Conclusion: This approach provides consistent visual enhancements in HDR scene reconstruction and offers an accessible implementation pipeline for further usage.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the challenges associated with using egocentric
devices to photorealistic reconstruct the scene in high dynamic range. Existing
methodologies typically assume using frame-rate 6DoF pose estimated from the
device's visual-inertial odometry system, which may neglect crucial details
necessary for pixel-accurate reconstruction. This study presents two
significant findings. Firstly, in contrast to mainstream work treating RGB
camera as global shutter frame-rate camera, we emphasize the importance of
employing visual-inertial bundle adjustment (VIBA) to calibrate the precise
timestamps and movement of the rolling shutter RGB sensing camera in a high
frequency trajectory format, which ensures an accurate calibration of the
physical properties of the rolling-shutter camera. Secondly, we incorporate a
physical image formation model based into Gaussian Splatting, which effectively
addresses the sensor characteristics, including the rolling-shutter effect of
RGB cameras and the dynamic ranges measured by sensors. Our proposed
formulation is applicable to the widely-used variants of Gaussian Splats
representation. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of our pipeline using the
open-source Project Aria device under diverse indoor and outdoor lighting
conditions, and further validate it on a Meta Quest3 device. Across all
experiments, we observe a consistent visual enhancement of +1 dB in PSNR by
incorporating VIBA, with an additional +1 dB achieved through our proposed
image formation model. Our complete implementation, evaluation datasets, and
recording profile are available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Hierarchical Masked Auto-Regressive modeling (HMAR) to improve image quality, speed, and flexibility in autoregressive image generation, outperforming existing models like VAR and diffusion models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in Visual Auto-Regressive modeling (VAR), including reduced image quality, long sequence lengths, and lack of flexibility in changing sampling schedules.

Method: HMAR reformulates image generation using a Markovian process for next-scale prediction and introduces a controllable multi-step masked generation strategy. The method also employs efficient block-sparse attention kernels.

Result: HMAR achieves superior performance over VAR, diffusion models, and autoregressive baselines on ImageNet benchmarks. It is 2.5x faster in training, 1.75x faster in inference, reduces memory usage by over 3x, and allows flexible sampling schedules and zero-shot image editing.

Conclusion: HMAR provides a significant improvement in image quality, speed, and computational efficiency for image generation, all while adding flexibility to change sampling schedules or perform image edits.

Abstract: Visual Auto-Regressive modeling (VAR) has shown promise in bridging the speed
and quality gap between autoregressive image models and diffusion models. VAR
reformulates autoregressive modeling by decomposing an image into successive
resolution scales. During inference, an image is generated by predicting all
the tokens in the next (higher-resolution) scale, conditioned on all tokens in
all previous (lower-resolution) scales. However, this formulation suffers from
reduced image quality due to the parallel generation of all tokens in a
resolution scale; has sequence lengths scaling superlinearly in image
resolution; and requires retraining to change the sampling schedule.
  We introduce Hierarchical Masked Auto-Regressive modeling (HMAR), a new image
generation algorithm that alleviates these issues using next-scale prediction
and masked prediction to generate high-quality images with fast sampling. HMAR
reformulates next-scale prediction as a Markovian process, wherein the
prediction of each resolution scale is conditioned only on tokens in its
immediate predecessor instead of the tokens in all predecessor resolutions.
When predicting a resolution scale, HMAR uses a controllable multi-step masked
generation procedure to generate a subset of the tokens in each step. On
ImageNet 256x256 and 512x512 benchmarks, HMAR models match or outperform
parameter-matched VAR, diffusion, and autoregressive baselines. We develop
efficient IO-aware block-sparse attention kernels that allow HMAR to achieve
faster training and inference times over VAR by over 2.5x and 1.75x
respectively, as well as over 3x lower inference memory footprint. Finally,
HMAR yields additional flexibility over VAR; its sampling schedule can be
changed without further training, and it can be applied to image editing tasks

### [147] [Towards Large-Scale Pose-Invariant Face Recognition Using Face Defrontalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04496)
*Patrik Mesec,Alan Jović*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel approach called face defrontalization to improve pose-invariant face recognition, achieving better performance on large faces datasets compared to prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The task of face recognition under extreme head poses remains challenging. Current pose-invariant techniques like face frontalization are not practical for real-life applications and rely heavily on small datasets, which limits their generalization.

Method: The proposed method involves (1) training a face defrontalization FFWM model on frontal-profile datasets preprocessed using the authors' face alignment method, and (2) training a ResNet-50 model with ArcFace loss on a combined dataset of raw and randomly defrontalized images.

Result: The method showed superior performance on the LFW, AgeDB, and CFP datasets compared to existing methodologies but struggled on the extreme poses in the small Multi-PIE dataset.

Conclusion: Face defrontalization can effectively enhance pose-invariant face recognition in large datasets, indicating weaknesses in current methods when applied to larger, more realistic datasets rather than small, controlled datasets.

Abstract: Face recognition under extreme head poses is a challenging task. Ideally, a
face recognition system should perform well across different head poses, which
is known as pose-invariant face recognition. To achieve pose invariance,
current approaches rely on sophisticated methods, such as face frontalization
and various facial feature extraction model architectures. However, these
methods are somewhat impractical in real-life settings and are typically
evaluated on small scientific datasets, such as Multi-PIE. In this work, we
propose the inverse method of face frontalization, called face
defrontalization, to augment the training dataset of facial feature extraction
model. The method does not introduce any time overhead during the inference
step. The method is composed of: 1) training an adapted face defrontalization
FFWM model on a frontal-profile pairs dataset, which has been preprocessed
using our proposed face alignment method; 2) training a ResNet-50 facial
feature extraction model based on ArcFace loss on a raw and randomly
defrontalized large-scale dataset, where defrontalization was performed with
our previously trained face defrontalization model. Our method was compared
with the existing approaches on four open-access datasets: LFW, AgeDB, CFP, and
Multi-PIE. Defrontalization shows improved results compared to models without
defrontalization, while the proposed adjustments show clear superiority over
the state-of-the-art face frontalization FFWM method on three larger
open-access datasets, but not on the small Multi-PIE dataset for extreme poses
(75 and 90 degrees). The results suggest that at least some of the current
methods may be overfitted to small datasets.

*Shizhong Han,Hsin-Pai Cheng,Hong Cai,Jihad Masri,Soyeb Nagori,Fatih Porikli*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces FALO, a LiDAR 3D object detection method optimized for resource-constrained devices, offering state-of-the-art accuracy and high inference speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of running existing LiDAR 3D detection methods on edge devices due to irregular memory access and high computational costs.

Method: FALO arranges 3D point cloud data into a 1D sequence and employs ConvDotMix blocks, which combine large-kernel convolutions, Hadamard products, and linear layers for efficient spatial and embedding feature mixing. It also uses implicit grouping for tensor efficiency.

Result: FALO achieves competitive performance on benchmarks like nuScenes and Waymo, while being 1.6~9.8x faster than state-of-the-art methods on mobile GPUs and NPUs.

Conclusion: FALO offers a hardware-efficient solution for LiDAR 3D detection that is both accurate and fast, making it suitable for compact, embedded systems.

Abstract: Existing LiDAR 3D object detection methods predominantely rely on sparse
convolutions and/or transformers, which can be challenging to run on
resource-constrained edge devices, due to irregular memory access patterns and
high computational costs. In this paper, we propose FALO, a hardware-friendly
approach to LiDAR 3D detection, which offers both state-of-the-art (SOTA)
detection accuracy and fast inference speed. More specifically, given the 3D
point cloud and after voxelization, FALO first arranges sparse 3D voxels into a
1D sequence based on their coordinates and proximity. The sequence is then
processed by our proposed ConvDotMix blocks, consisting of large-kernel
convolutions, Hadamard products, and linear layers. ConvDotMix provides
sufficient mixing capability in both spatial and embedding dimensions, and
introduces higher-order nonlinear interaction among spatial features.
Furthermore, when going through the ConvDotMix layers, we introduce implicit
grouping, which balances the tensor dimensions for more efficient inference and
takes into account the growing receptive field. All these operations are
friendly to run on resource-constrained platforms and proposed FALO can readily
deploy on compact, embedded devices. Our extensive evaluation on LiDAR 3D
detection benchmarks such as nuScenes and Waymo shows that FALO achieves
competitive performance. Meanwhile, FALO is 1.6~9.8x faster than the latest
SOTA on mobile Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) and mobile Neural Processing Unit
(NPU).

### [149] [AuthGuard: Generalizable Deepfake Detection via Language Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04501)
*Guangyu Shen,Zhihua Li,Xiang Xu,Tianchen Zhao,Zheng Zhang,Dongsheng An,Zhuowen Tu,Yifan Xing,Qin Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces AuthGuard, a novel framework that combines vision and language guidance for improved detection of deepfakes. It achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and significant performance gains on multiple benchmark datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deepfake detection methods fail to generalize well to unseen forgery techniques due to reliance on statistical artifacts tied to specific generation methods.

Method: AuthGuard integrates language guidance from large language models (LLMs) with a vision encoder trained via both discriminative classification and image-text contrastive learning. It incorporates commonsense reasoning and uncertainty learning to improve robustness and adaptability.

Result: AuthGuard achieves AUC gains of 6.15% on DFDC dataset and 16.68% on DF40 dataset for detection accuracy. Additionally, it boosts deepfake reasoning performance by 24.69% on the DDVQA dataset.

Conclusion: AuthGuard effectively addresses the limitations of current deepfake detection techniques by combining statistical and commonsense cues, offering improved generalization and interpretability across unseen forgery methods.

Abstract: Existing deepfake detection techniques struggle to keep-up with the
ever-evolving novel, unseen forgeries methods. This limitation stems from their
reliance on statistical artifacts learned during training, which are often tied
to specific generation processes that may not be representative of samples from
new, unseen deepfake generation methods encountered at test time. We propose
that incorporating language guidance can improve deepfake detection
generalization by integrating human-like commonsense reasoning -- such as
recognizing logical inconsistencies and perceptual anomalies -- alongside
statistical cues. To achieve this, we train an expert deepfake vision encoder
by combining discriminative classification with image-text contrastive
learning, where the text is generated by generalist MLLMs using few-shot
prompting. This allows the encoder to extract both language-describable,
commonsense deepfake artifacts and statistical forgery artifacts from
pixel-level distributions. To further enhance robustness, we integrate data
uncertainty learning into vision-language contrastive learning, mitigating
noise in image-text supervision. Our expert vision encoder seamlessly
interfaces with an LLM, further enabling more generalized and interpretable
deepfake detection while also boosting accuracy. The resulting framework,
AuthGuard, achieves state-of-the-art deepfake detection accuracy in both
in-distribution and out-of-distribution settings, achieving AUC gains of 6.15%
on the DFDC dataset and 16.68% on the DF40 dataset. Additionally, AuthGuard
significantly enhances deepfake reasoning, improving performance by 24.69% on
the DDVQA dataset.

### [150] [Pruning Everything, Everywhere, All at Once](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04513)
*Gustavo Henrique do Nascimento,Ian Pons,Anna Helena Reali Costa,Artur Jordao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method for simultaneously pruning layers and neurons in deep learning models to reduce complexity and improve efficiency, using a selection process based on representation similarity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Model complexity grows with solving challenging tasks, increasing resource demands. Current pruning focuses separately on layers or neurons, leaving combined pruning unexplored.

Method: Proposed an iterative pruning method that evaluates and selects subnetworks (pruned models) based on the Centered Kernel Alignment metric, balancing layer and neuron pruning.

Result: The method achieves significant efficiency improvements with minimal accuracy loss and even robustness gains—e.g., 86.37% and 95.82% FLOPs reduction in ResNet56 and ResNet110 models.

Conclusion: The approach outperforms state-of-the-art pruning methods and contributes to GreenAI by reducing computational demands and carbon emissions.

Abstract: Deep learning stands as the modern paradigm for solving cognitive tasks.
However, as the problem complexity increases, models grow deeper and
computationally prohibitive, hindering advancements in real-world and
resource-constrained applications. Extensive studies reveal that pruning
structures in these models efficiently reduces model complexity and improves
computational efficiency. Successful strategies in this sphere include removing
neurons (i.e., filters, heads) or layers, but not both together. Therefore,
simultaneously pruning different structures remains an open problem. To fill
this gap and leverage the benefits of eliminating neurons and layers at once,
we propose a new method capable of pruning different structures within a model
as follows. Given two candidate subnetworks (pruned models), one from layer
pruning and the other from neuron pruning, our method decides which to choose
by selecting the one with the highest representation similarity to its parent
(the network that generates the subnetworks) using the Centered Kernel
Alignment metric. Iteratively repeating this process provides highly sparse
models that preserve the original predictive ability. Throughout extensive
experiments on standard architectures and benchmarks, we confirm the
effectiveness of our approach and show that it outperforms state-of-the-art
layer and filter pruning techniques. At high levels of Floating Point
Operations reduction, most state-of-the-art methods degrade accuracy, whereas
our approach either improves it or experiences only a minimal drop. Notably, on
the popular ResNet56 and ResNet110, we achieve a milestone of 86.37% and 95.82%
FLOPs reduction. Besides, our pruned models obtain robustness to adversarial
and out-of-distribution samples and take an important step towards GreenAI,
reducing carbon emissions by up to 83.31%. Overall, we believe our work opens a
new chapter in pruning.

*Shuo Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces EECD-Net, a multi-stage crack detection approach for road surfaces, achieving 98.6% accuracy while reducing energy consumption by 33%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve crack detection on road surfaces in resource-constrained environments where smart terminal devices face challenges like limited energy and low-resolution imaging.

Method: EECD-Net employs SRCNN for image resolution enhancement, SCU with CIF neurons for power-efficient image processing, and a GAT module for robust feature fusion and accurate crack detection.

Result: EECD-Net delivers 98.6% accuracy on the CrackVision12K benchmark, surpassing prior methods by 1.5%, and reduces energy consumption by 33% (5.6 mJ).

Conclusion: EECD-Net offers a scalable, energy-efficient solution for real-time infrastructure monitoring, setting a new benchmark in instrumentation-based crack detection.

Abstract: Crack detection on road surfaces is a critical measurement technology in the
instrumentation domain, essential for ensuring infrastructure safety and
transportation reliability. However, due to limited energy and low-resolution
imaging, smart terminal devices struggle to maintain real-time monitoring
performance. To overcome these challenges, this paper proposes a multi-stage
detection approach for road crack detection, EECD-Net, to enhance accuracy and
energy efficiency of instrumentation. Specifically, the sophisticated
Super-Resolution Convolutional Neural Network (SRCNN) is employed to address
the inherent challenges of low-quality images, which effectively enhance image
resolution while preserving critical structural details. Meanwhile, a Spike
Convolution Unit (SCU) with Continuous Integrate-and-Fire (CIF) neurons is
proposed to convert these images into sparse pulse sequences, significantly
reducing power consumption. Additionally, a Gated Attention Transformer (GAT)
module is designed to strategically fuse multi-scale feature representations
through adaptive attention mechanisms, effectively capturing both long-range
dependencies and intricate local crack patterns, and significantly enhancing
detection robustness across varying crack morphologies. The experiments on the
CrackVision12K benchmark demonstrate that EECD-Net achieves a remarkable 98.6\%
detection accuracy, surpassing state-of-the-art counterparts such as
Hybrid-Segmentor by a significant 1.5\%. Notably, the EECD-Net maintains
exceptional energy efficiency, consuming merely 5.6 mJ, which is a substantial
33\% reduction compared to baseline implementations. This work pioneers a
transformative approach in instrumentation-based crack detection, offering a
scalable, low-power solution for real-time, large-scale infrastructure
monitoring in resource-constrained environments.

*Heng Tian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces Learnable Separable Kernels (LSKs) for single-image super-resolution (SISR), reducing computational load by over 60% and improving image frequency component enhancement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SISR methods often rely on auxiliary structures to improve image quality, leading to a demand for direct methods enhancing frequency components efficiently.

Method: The paper proposes a module, LSKs, which are rank-one matrices decomposed into one-dimensional orthogonal kernels to enhance image frequency components in an interpretable and computationally efficient manner.

Result: LSKs significantly decrease the number of parameters and computational requirements while improving model performance for SISR tasks, especially for higher upscaling factors.

Conclusion: Models incorporating LSKs achieve superior image reconstruction efficiency and quality, validating the module's effectiveness for SISR tasks.

Abstract: Existing approaches often enhance the performance of single-image
super-resolution (SISR) methods by incorporating auxiliary structures, such as
specialized loss functions, to indirectly boost the quality of low-resolution
images. In this paper, we propose a plug-and-play module called Learnable
Separable Kernels (LSKs), which are formally rank-one matrices designed to
directly enhance image frequency components. We begin by explaining why LSKs
are particularly suitable for SISR tasks from a frequency perspective. Baseline
methods incorporating LSKs demonstrate a significant reduction of over 60\% in
both the number of parameters and computational requirements. This reduction is
achieved through the decomposition of LSKs into orthogonal and mergeable
one-dimensional kernels. Additionally, we perform an interpretable analysis of
the feature maps generated by LSKs. Visualization results reveal the capability
of LSKs to enhance image frequency components effectively. Extensive
experiments show that incorporating LSKs not only reduces the number of
parameters and computational load but also improves overall model performance.
Moreover, these experiments demonstrate that models utilizing LSKs exhibit
superior performance, particularly as the upscaling factor increases.

*Yunhao Gou,Kai Chen,Zhili Liu,Lanqing Hong,Xin Jin,Zhenguo Li,James T. Kwok,Yu Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces RACRO, a reasoning-guided reinforcement learning technique for multi-modal large language models to improve visual-to-language conversion aligned with reasoning tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the challenge of extending slow-thinking reasoning capabilities to multi-modal LLMs without incurring high costs of vision-language retraining, while ensuring faithful and informative visual descriptions for accurate downstream reasoning.

Method: The proposed RACRO method uses reinforcement learning to optimize the visual extractor's caption generation process. This aligns the generated captions with the reasoning objectives, closing the perception-reasoning loop.

Result: RACRO demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on multi-modal math and science benchmarks. It also enables scalability and seamless adaptation to advanced reasoning LLMs without requiring expensive multi-modal re-alignment.

Conclusion: RACRO effectively aligns visual perception with reasoning tasks, providing a cost-effective, scalable, and high-performing solution for multi-modal reasoning systems.

Abstract: Recent advances in slow-thinking language models (e.g., OpenAI-o1 and
DeepSeek-R1) have demonstrated remarkable abilities in complex reasoning tasks
by emulating human-like reflective cognition. However, extending such
capabilities to multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) remains challenging
due to the high cost of retraining vision-language alignments when upgrading
the underlying reasoner LLMs. A straightforward solution is to decouple
perception from reasoning, i.e., converting visual inputs into language
representations (e.g., captions) that are then passed to a powerful text-only
reasoner. However, this decoupling introduces a critical challenge: the visual
extractor must generate descriptions that are both faithful to the image and
informative enough to support accurate downstream reasoning. To address this,
we propose Reasoning-Aligned Perceptual Decoupling via Caption Reward
Optimization (RACRO) - a reasoning-guided reinforcement learning strategy that
aligns the extractor's captioning behavior with the reasoning objective. By
closing the perception-reasoning loop via reward-based optimization, RACRO
significantly enhances visual grounding and extracts reasoning-optimized
representations. Experiments on multi-modal math and science benchmarks show
that the proposed RACRO method achieves state-of-the-art average performance
while enabling superior scalability and plug-and-play adaptation to more
advanced reasoning LLMs without the necessity for costly multi-modal
re-alignment.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces LGM-Pose, a single-branch lightweight network for multi-person pose estimation, achieving faster speeds and better results through novel module designs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current lightweight pose estimation methods face challenges in capturing global context for complex keypoints and suffer from high latency due to redundant architectures.

Method: LGM-Pose employs a MobileViM Block with Lightweight Attentional Representation Module (LARM) for global information extraction, and a Shuffle-Integrated Fusion Module (SFusion) for better multi-scale information integration.

Result: The method outperforms mainstream lightweight methods in both performance and processing speed, with reduced parameter count, as validated on COCO and MPII datasets.

Conclusion: LGM-Pose effectively addresses the shortcomings of existing lightweight models, combining efficiency and accuracy in multi-person pose estimation.

Abstract: Most of the current top-down multi-person pose estimation lightweight methods
are based on multi-branch parallel pure CNN network architecture, which often
struggle to capture the global context required for detecting semantically
complex keypoints and are hindered by high latency due to their intricate and
redundant structures. In this article, an approximate single-branch lightweight
global modeling network (LGM-Pose) is proposed to address these challenges. In
the network, a lightweight MobileViM Block is designed with a proposed
Lightweight Attentional Representation Module (LARM), which integrates
information within and between patches using the Non-Parametric Transformation
Operation(NPT-Op) to extract global information. Additionally, a novel
Shuffle-Integrated Fusion Module (SFusion) is introduced to effectively
integrate multi-scale information, mitigating performance degradation often
observed in single-branch structures. Experimental evaluations on the COCO and
MPII datasets demonstrate that our approach not only reduces the number of
parameters compared to existing mainstream lightweight methods but also
achieves superior performance and faster processing speeds.

*Yue Ma,Kunyu Feng,Xinhua Zhang,Hongyu Liu,David Junhao Zhang,Jinbo Xing,Yinhan Zhang,Ayden Yang,Zeyu Wang,Qifeng Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents a 4D video creation and editing framework called Follow-Your-Creation, capable of generating and modifying 4D videos from a single monocular input video, leveraging video inpainting techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of effective methods for creating and editing 4D content from monocular videos, particularly for tasks requiring temporal consistency and multi-view coherence.

Method: The framework uses a video inpainting foundation model as a generative prior and reformulates 4D content generation as a video inpainting task. Composite masks combining invisibility and editing masks are created to fine-tune the model, and a self-iterative tuning strategy along with a temporal packaging module ensures temporal consistency and high-quality outputs.

Result: The proposed method achieves consistent multi-view coherence, facilitates prompt-based content editing, and delivers superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods in both quality and flexibility.

Conclusion: The framework effectively leverages generative priors without degrading base performance, providing a robust and adaptable solution for creating and editing 4D videos from monocular inputs, advancing the state of the art.

Abstract: We introduce Follow-Your-Creation, a novel 4D video creation framework
capable of both generating and editing 4D content from a single monocular video
input. By leveraging a powerful video inpainting foundation model as a
generative prior, we reformulate 4D video creation as a video inpainting task,
enabling the model to fill in missing content caused by camera trajectory
changes or user edits. To facilitate this, we generate composite masked
inpainting video data to effectively fine-tune the model for 4D video
generation. Given an input video and its associated camera trajectory, we first
perform depth-based point cloud rendering to obtain invisibility masks that
indicate the regions that should be completed. Simultaneously, editing masks
are introduced to specify user-defined modifications, and these are combined
with the invisibility masks to create a composite masks dataset. During
training, we randomly sample different types of masks to construct diverse and
challenging inpainting scenarios, enhancing the model's generalization and
robustness in various 4D editing and generation tasks. To handle temporal
consistency under large camera motion, we design a self-iterative tuning
strategy that gradually increases the viewing angles during training, where the
model is used to generate the next-stage training data after each fine-tuning
iteration. Moreover, we introduce a temporal packaging module during inference
to enhance generation quality. Our method effectively leverages the prior
knowledge of the base model without degrading its original performance,
enabling the generation of 4D videos with consistent multi-view coherence. In
addition, our approach supports prompt-based content editing, demonstrating
strong flexibility and significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods in
both quality and versatility.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces a new Hierarchical Embodied Continual Learning framework (HEC) for agents, complemented by a novel method (Task-aware MoILE) aimed at improving task recognition and overcoming catastrophic forgetting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing continual learning frameworks for embodied intelligence lack high-level planning and multi-level knowledge integration.

Method: Proposed HEC divides learning into high-level instructions and low-level actions. Task-aware MoILE clusters visual-text embeddings for task recognition and uses routers to select LoRA experts. SVD is applied to LoRA parameters for managing catastrophic forgetting.

Result: The proposed method demonstrates superior performance in reducing forgetting of old tasks compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: Task-aware MoILE effectively supports continual learning by helping agents retain prior knowledge while learning new tasks.

Abstract: Previous continual learning setups for embodied intelligence focused on
executing low-level actions based on human commands, neglecting the ability to
learn high-level planning and multi-level knowledge. To address these issues,
we propose the Hierarchical Embodied Continual Learning Setups (HEC) that
divide the agent's continual learning process into two layers: high-level
instructions and low-level actions, and define five embodied continual learning
sub-setups. Building on these setups, we introduce the Task-aware Mixture of
Incremental LoRA Experts (Task-aware MoILE) method. This approach achieves task
recognition by clustering visual-text embeddings and uses both a task-level
router and a token-level router to select the appropriate LoRA experts. To
effectively address the issue of catastrophic forgetting, we apply Singular
Value Decomposition (SVD) to the LoRA parameters obtained from prior tasks,
preserving key components while orthogonally training the remaining parts. The
experimental results show that our method stands out in reducing the forgetting
of old tasks compared to other methods, effectively supporting agents in
retaining prior knowledge while continuously learning new tasks.

TL;DR: SmartAvatar generates fully rigged 3D human avatars from a single image or text prompt, using a framework that combines vision-language models with parametric human generators for precision and customization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses limitations in diffusion-based 3D object generation methods, which struggle with control over human identity, body shape, and animation readiness, by presenting a more interactive and accurate framework.

Method: SmartAvatar uses a vision-language model in combination with parametric human generators and introduces an autonomous verification loop to iteratively refine avatars based on feedback and natural language interactions.

Result: SmartAvatar demonstrates superior performance in mesh quality, identity fidelity, attribute accuracy, and animation readiness compared to other state-of-the-art avatar generation systems.

Conclusion: SmartAvatar offers a versatile, user-interactive tool for creating realistic and customizable 3D avatars suitable for animation, making it accessible on consumer-grade hardware.

Abstract: SmartAvatar is a vision-language-agent-driven framework for generating fully
rigged, animation-ready 3D human avatars from a single photo or textual prompt.
While diffusion-based methods have made progress in general 3D object
generation, they continue to struggle with precise control over human identity,
body shape, and animation readiness. In contrast, SmartAvatar leverages the
commonsense reasoning capabilities of large vision-language models (VLMs) in
combination with off-the-shelf parametric human generators to deliver
high-quality, customizable avatars. A key innovation is an autonomous
verification loop, where the agent renders draft avatars, evaluates facial
similarity, anatomical plausibility, and prompt alignment, and iteratively
adjusts generation parameters for convergence. This interactive, AI-guided
refinement process promotes fine-grained control over both facial and body
features, enabling users to iteratively refine their avatars via
natural-language conversations. Unlike diffusion models that rely on static
pre-trained datasets and offer limited flexibility, SmartAvatar brings users
into the modeling loop and ensures continuous improvement through an LLM-driven
procedural generation and verification system. The generated avatars are fully
rigged and support pose manipulation with consistent identity and appearance,
making them suitable for downstream animation and interactive applications.
Quantitative benchmarks and user studies demonstrate that SmartAvatar
outperforms recent text- and image-driven avatar generation systems in terms of
reconstructed mesh quality, identity fidelity, attribute accuracy, and
animation readiness, making it a versatile tool for realistic, customizable
avatar creation on consumer-grade hardware.

TL;DR: The paper presents a two-stage method for enhancing sensor depth using diffusion models to detect unreliable regions and refine depth maps for accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address unreliable depth measurements and improve the quality and reliability of sensor depth data for applications in robotics, autonomous driving, and immersive technologies.

Method: The approach has two stages: stochastic estimation to identify unreliable regions and infer structure, followed by deterministic refinement that ensures consistency and pixel-level accuracy.

Result: The method delivers dense and artifact-free depth maps, achieving robustness, reliability, and scalability, validated through experiments and theoretical analysis.

Conclusion: The proposed framework outperforms existing methods and sets a benchmark for sensor depth enhancement, proving its applicability to real-world scenarios.

Abstract: We propose a novel two-stage framework for sensor depth enhancement, called
Perfecting Depth. This framework leverages the stochastic nature of diffusion
models to automatically detect unreliable depth regions while preserving
geometric cues. In the first stage (stochastic estimation), the method
identifies unreliable measurements and infers geometric structure by leveraging
a training-inference domain gap. In the second stage (deterministic
refinement), it enforces structural consistency and pixel-level accuracy using
the uncertainty map derived from the first stage. By combining stochastic
uncertainty modeling with deterministic refinement, our method yields dense,
artifact-free depth maps with improved reliability. Experimental results
demonstrate its effectiveness across diverse real-world scenarios. Furthermore,
theoretical analysis, various experiments, and qualitative visualizations
validate its robustness and scalability. Our framework sets a new baseline for
sensor depth enhancement, with potential applications in autonomous driving,
robotics, and immersive technologies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations of traditional image matching pipelines in challenging scenarios by analyzing and categorizing deep learning advancements in this field.

Method: The paper creates a taxonomy aligned with traditional image matching pipelines and reviews how deep learning replaces individual steps or combines them into end-to-end modules. It benchmarks methods on pose recovery, homography estimation, and visual localization.

Result: Deep learning improves image matching robustness and accuracy, with design principles and limitations discussed for alternative and end-to-end methods, and methods benchmarked on multiple tasks.

Conclusion: The survey provides a systematic categorization of strategies, evaluates their performance in critical tasks, and outlines challenges and future directions, advancing the field of image matching through deep learning integration.

Abstract: Image matching, which establishes correspondences between two-view images to
recover 3D structure and camera geometry, serves as a cornerstone in computer
vision and underpins a wide range of applications, including visual
localization, 3D reconstruction, and simultaneous localization and mapping
(SLAM). Traditional pipelines composed of ``detector-descriptor, feature
matcher, outlier filter, and geometric estimator'' falter in challenging
scenarios. Recent deep-learning advances have significantly boosted both
robustness and accuracy. This survey adopts a unique perspective by
comprehensively reviewing how deep learning has incrementally transformed the
classical image matching pipeline. Our taxonomy highly aligns with the
traditional pipeline in two key aspects: i) the replacement of individual steps
in the traditional pipeline with learnable alternatives, including learnable
detector-descriptor, outlier filter, and geometric estimator; and ii) the
merging of multiple steps into end-to-end learnable modules, encompassing
middle-end sparse matcher, end-to-end semi-dense/dense matcher, and pose
regressor. We first examine the design principles, advantages, and limitations
of both aspects, and then benchmark representative methods on relative pose
recovery, homography estimation, and visual localization tasks. Finally, we
discuss open challenges and outline promising directions for future research.
By systematically categorizing and evaluating deep learning-driven strategies,
this survey offers a clear overview of the evolving image matching landscape
and highlights key avenues for further innovation.

TL;DR: The paper introduces STARE, a benchmark for evaluating multimodal AI models on tasks requiring multi-step visual simulation, highlighting challenges in complex spatial reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the gap in existing AI benchmarks that focus on verbal reasoning but fail to evaluate the complexities of non-verbal, multi-step visual simulation tasks.

Method: The authors created STARE, a benchmark composed of 4K tasks covering geometric transformations, integrated spatial reasoning, and real-world spatial reasoning to assess multimodal AI models.

Result: Findings show that while models perform well on simple 2D tasks, they struggle significantly with complex 3D tasks and puzzles, showcasing inconsistencies in leveraging intermediate visual simulations. Humans achieve near-perfect accuracy but require more time for complex tasks.

Conclusion: STARE highlights the deficiencies in current AI models for complex spatial reasoning tasks and emphasizes the need for better strategies to utilize intermediate visual information in AI reasoning.

Abstract: Spatial cognition is essential for human intelligence, enabling
problem-solving through visual simulations rather than solely relying on verbal
reasoning. However, existing AI benchmarks primarily assess verbal reasoning,
neglecting the complexities of non-verbal, multi-step visual simulation. We
introduce STARE(Spatial Transformations and Reasoning Evaluation), a benchmark
designed to rigorously evaluate multimodal large language models on tasks
better solved through multi-step visual simulation. STARE features 4K tasks
spanning foundational geometric transformations (2D and 3D), integrated spatial
reasoning (cube net folding and tangram puzzles), and real-world spatial
reasoning (perspective and temporal reasoning), reflecting practical cognitive
challenges like object assembly, mechanical diagram interpretation, and
everyday spatial navigation. Our evaluations show that models excel at
reasoning over simpler 2D transformations, but perform close to random chance
on more complex tasks like 3D cube net folding and tangram puzzles that require
multi-step visual simulations. Humans achieve near-perfect accuracy but take
considerable time (up to 28.9s) on complex tasks, significantly speeding up
(down by 7.5 seconds on average) with intermediate visual simulations. In
contrast, models exhibit inconsistent performance gains from visual
simulations, improving on most tasks but declining in specific cases like
tangram puzzles (GPT-4o, o1) and cube net folding (Claude-3.5, Gemini-2.0
Flash), indicating that models may not know how to effectively leverage
intermediate visual information.

*Qiming Hu,Linlong Fan,Yiyan Luo,Yuhang Yu,Xiaojie Guo,Qingnan Fan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces TADiSR, a novel diffusion-based framework for improving text fidelity in image super-resolution (SR). It combines text-aware attention, joint segmentation decoders, and a robust image synthesis pipeline.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing generative models for image SR struggle with fidelity issues, especially in preserving textual structures.

Method: The framework, TADiSR, applies text-aware attention, employs joint segmentation decoders, and synthesizes high-quality images with text masks to recover degraded text regions.

Result: Experiments demonstrate substantial enhancement in text legibility in super-resolved images, achieving state-of-the-art performance and robustness in real-world scenarios.

Conclusion: TADiSR advances real-world image super-resolution by improving both natural detail recovery and the structural fidelity of textual regions.

Abstract: The introduction of generative models has significantly advanced image
super-resolution (SR) in handling real-world degradations. However, they often
incur fidelity-related issues, particularly distorting textual structures. In
this paper, we introduce a novel diffusion-based SR framework, namely TADiSR,
which integrates text-aware attention and joint segmentation decoders to
recover not only natural details but also the structural fidelity of text
regions in degraded real-world images. Moreover, we propose a complete pipeline
for synthesizing high-quality images with fine-grained full-image text masks,
combining realistic foreground text regions with detailed background content.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach substantially enhances text
legibility in super-resolved images, achieving state-of-the-art performance
across multiple evaluation metrics and exhibiting strong generalization to
real-world scenarios. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents FPSAttention, a novel training-aware co-design approach that combines FP8 quantization and sparsity to accelerate video generation without compromising quality, achieving significant speedups.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion generative models excel at video generation but are hindered by slow inference times and high computational requirements. Existing methods combining quantization and sparsity suffer from performance degradation due to a lack of joint optimization.

Method: The authors introduce FPSAttention, which integrates 3D tile-wise granularity for quantization and sparsity, a denoising step-aware strategy tailored to the noise schedule, and a hardware-friendly kernel based on FlashAttention optimized for Hopper architecture.

Result: FPSAttention achieves a 7.09x speedup for attention operations and a 4.96x end-to-end speedup at 720p video generation compared to the BF16 baseline, with no loss in generation quality.

Conclusion: FPSAttention successfully addresses the inefficiencies of diffusion models by leveraging hardware-optimized quantization and sparsity techniques, paving the way for faster and practical video generation without sacrifice in output fidelity.

Abstract: Diffusion generative models have become the standard for producing
high-quality, coherent video content, yet their slow inference speeds and high
computational demands hinder practical deployment. Although both quantization
and sparsity can independently accelerate inference while maintaining
generation quality, naively combining these techniques in existing
training-free approaches leads to significant performance degradation due to
the lack of joint optimization.We introduce FPSAttention, a novel
training-aware co-design of FP8 quantization and sparsity for video generation,
with a focus on the 3D bi-directional attention mechanism. Our approach
features three key innovations: 1) A unified 3D tile-wise granularity that
simultaneously supports both quantization and sparsity; 2) A denoising
step-aware strategy that adapts to the noise schedule, addressing the strong
correlation between quantization/sparsity errors and denoising steps; 3) A
native, hardware-friendly kernel that leverages FlashAttention and is
implemented with optimized Hopper architecture features for highly efficient
execution. Trained on Wan2.1's 1.3B and 14B models and evaluated on the VBench
benchmark, FPSAttention achieves a 7.09x kernel speedup for attention
operations and a 4.96x end-to-end speedup for video generation compared to the
BF16 baseline at 720p resolution-without sacrificing generation quality.

*Takayuki Komatsu,Yoshiyuki Ohmura,Kayato Nishitsunoi,Yasuo Kuniyoshi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method based on group decomposition in Galois algebra theory combined with feature extraction and object segmentation to improve representation learning on realistic datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional representation learning often assumes disentangled features as good representations but fails with conditional independence. The research aims to solve this issue by introducing a generalizable approach.

Method: The method involves replacing pixel-level transformations with feature-level translations and incorporating object segmentation into the process using group decomposition.

Result: The proposed method was validated on a practical dataset with real-world objects and backgrounds, demonstrating its applicability to realistic scenarios.

Conclusion: This model improves representation learning and provides insights into human object recognition development, making it more applicable to real-world sensory inputs.

Abstract: The main goal of representation learning is to acquire meaningful
representations from real-world sensory inputs without supervision.
Representation learning explains some aspects of human development. Various
neural network (NN) models have been proposed that acquire empirically good
representations. However, the formulation of a good representation has not been
established. We recently proposed a method for categorizing changes between a
pair of sensory inputs. A unique feature of this approach is that
transformations between two sensory inputs are learned to satisfy algebraic
structural constraints. Conventional representation learning often assumes that
disentangled independent feature axes is a good representation; however, we
found that such a representation cannot account for conditional independence.
To overcome this problem, we proposed a new method using group decomposition in
Galois algebra theory. Although this method is promising for defining a more
general representation, it assumes pixel-to-pixel translation without feature
extraction, and can only process low-resolution images with no background,
which prevents real-world application. In this study, we provide a simple
method to apply our group decomposition theory to a more realistic scenario by
combining feature extraction and object segmentation. We replace pixel
translation with feature translation and formulate object segmentation as
grouping features under the same transformation. We validated the proposed
method on a practical dataset containing both real-world object and background.
We believe that our model will lead to a better understanding of human
development of object recognition in the real world.

*Zhong Ji,Rongshuai Wei,Jingren Liu,Yanwei Pang,Jungong Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework (FSPCC) to improve the performance and interpretability of self-explainable models in data-scarce scenarios using parameter-efficient adaptation and enhanced feature alignment strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of self-explainable models in low-data scenarios, which lead to suboptimal performance and hinder interpretability.

Method: FSPCC framework uses a Mixture of LoRA Experts (MoLE) for balanced parameter-efficient adaptation, cross-module concept guidance for feature alignment, a multi-level feature preservation strategy, and a geometry-aware concept discrimination loss to improve interpretability and reduce concept overlap.

Result: The approach achieves a 4.2%-8.7% performance gain in 5-way 5-shot classification tasks across six benchmarks, outperforming existing self-explainable models.

Conclusion: Coupling few-shot learning with prototypical concept models improves both accuracy and interpretability of visual recognition systems, offering a path toward more transparent AI models.

Abstract: Self-Explainable Models (SEMs) rely on Prototypical Concept Learning (PCL) to
enable their visual recognition processes more interpretable, but they often
struggle in data-scarce settings where insufficient training samples lead to
suboptimal performance.To address this limitation, we propose a Few-Shot
Prototypical Concept Classification (FSPCC) framework that systematically
mitigates two key challenges under low-data regimes: parametric imbalance and
representation misalignment. Specifically, our approach leverages a Mixture of
LoRA Experts (MoLE) for parameter-efficient adaptation, ensuring a balanced
allocation of trainable parameters between the backbone and the PCL
module.Meanwhile, cross-module concept guidance enforces tight alignment
between the backbone's feature representations and the prototypical concept
activation patterns.In addition, we incorporate a multi-level feature
preservation strategy that fuses spatial and semantic cues across various
layers, thereby enriching the learned representations and mitigating the
challenges posed by limited data availability.Finally, to enhance
interpretability and minimize concept overlap, we introduce a geometry-aware
concept discrimination loss that enforces orthogonality among concepts,
encouraging more disentangled and transparent decision boundaries.Experimental
results on six popular benchmarks (CUB-200-2011, mini-ImageNet, CIFAR-FS,
Stanford Cars, FGVC-Aircraft, and DTD) demonstrate that our approach
consistently outperforms existing SEMs by a notable margin, with 4.2%-8.7%
relative gains in 5-way 5-shot classification.These findings highlight the
efficacy of coupling concept learning with few-shot adaptation to achieve both
higher accuracy and clearer model interpretability, paving the way for more
transparent visual recognition systems.

*Jing-En Huang,I-Sheng Fang,Tzuhsuan Huang,Chih-Yu Wang,Jun-Cheng Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces Gen-n-Val, a novel framework that leverages Large Language Models, Vision Language Models, and Layer Diffusion to generate high-quality synthetic data for tasks like object detection and instance segmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in computer vision tasks, including data scarcity and label noise, by improving synthetic data generation techniques, which often face issues like multiple objects per mask and mislabeled categories.

Method: The approach involves two agents: (1) an LLM (Layer Diffusion prompt agent) for generating single-object instance images with accurate segmentation masks, and (2) a VLLM (data validation agent) to filter low-quality data. Image harmonization is also employed to combine multiple objects. The system uses optimized prompts refined through TextGrad.

Result: Gen-n-Val achieves a significant reduction in invalid synthetic data (from 50% to 7%) and improves mAP scores by 1% on rare classes in instance segmentation and by 7.1% on open-vocabulary object detection benchmarks compared to other state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The proposed Gen-n-Val framework demonstrates substantial improvements in synthetic data generation quality and enhances performance in object detection and instance segmentation tasks, outperforming current benchmarks.

Abstract: Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision Large Language Models
(VLLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance as agents across various tasks
while data scarcity and label noise remain significant challenges in computer
vision tasks, such as object detection and instance segmentation. A common
solution for resolving these issues is to generate synthetic data. However,
current synthetic data generation methods struggle with issues, such as
multiple objects per mask, inaccurate segmentation, and incorrect category
labels, limiting their effectiveness. To address these issues, we introduce
Gen-n-Val, a novel agentic data generation framework that leverages Layer
Diffusion (LD), LLMs, and VLLMs to produce high-quality, single-object masks
and diverse backgrounds. Gen-n-Val consists of two agents: (1) The LD prompt
agent, an LLM, optimizes prompts for LD to generate high-quality foreground
instance images and segmentation masks. These optimized prompts ensure the
generation of single-object synthetic data with precise instance masks and
clean backgrounds. (2) The data validation agent, a VLLM, which filters out
low-quality synthetic instance images. The system prompts for both agents are
refined through TextGrad. Additionally, we use image harmonization to combine
multiple instances within scenes. Compared to state-of-the-art synthetic data
approaches like MosaicFusion, our approach reduces invalid synthetic data from
50% to 7% and improves performance by 1% mAP on rare classes in COCO instance
segmentation with YOLOv9c and YOLO11m. Furthermore, Gen-n-Val shows significant
improvements (7. 1% mAP) over YOLO-Worldv2-M in open-vocabulary object
detection benchmarks with YOLO11m. Moreover, Gen-n-Val improves the performance
of YOLOv9 and YOLO11 families in instance segmentation and object detection.

TL;DR: This paper introduces MARS, a method for reconstructing accurate radio maps using CNNs and Transformers with multi-scale feature fusion, addressing limitations in environmental awareness and generalization faced by existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reconstructing accurate radio maps is critical for applications like smart cities and IoT, but current methods struggle with sparse measurements and lack generalization or environmental awareness.

Method: The proposed MARS method combines CNNs and Transformers with multi-scale feature fusion and residual connections to enhance feature representation and improve reconstruction accuracy.

Result: Experiments on different scenarios show that MARS outperforms baseline models in MSE and SSIM metrics while maintaining low computational cost.

Conclusion: MARS demonstrates strong practical potential by addressing the challenges of radio map reconstruction, offering better accuracy and efficiency.

Abstract: Radio maps reflect the spatial distribution of signal strength and are
essential for applications like smart cities, IoT, and wireless network
planning. However, reconstructing accurate radio maps from sparse measurements
remains challenging. Traditional interpolation and inpainting methods lack
environmental awareness, while many deep learning approaches depend on detailed
scene data, limiting generalization. To address this, we propose MARS, a
Multi-scale Aware Radiomap Super-resolution method that combines CNNs and
Transformers with multi-scale feature fusion and residual connections. MARS
focuses on both global and local feature extraction, enhancing feature
representation across different receptive fields and improving reconstruction
accuracy. Experiments across different scenes and antenna locations show that
MARS outperforms baseline models in both MSE and SSIM, while maintaining low
computational cost, demonstrating strong practical potential.

*Youngwan Lee,Kangsan Kim,Kwanyong Park,Ilcahe Jung,Soojin Jang,Seanie Lee,Yong-Ju Lee,Sung Ju Hwang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper develops a novel benchmark and model aimed at improving the safety of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) against harmful content through architectural innovations and broad dataset coverage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Vision-Language Models are prone to unsafe behavior due to limited dataset coverage and a lack of architectural focus on safety. Current methods inadequately address how image-text interactions may produce harmful responses.

Method: The authors introduce HoliSafe, a comprehensive safety dataset covering diverse safe/unsafe image-text scenarios, and SafeLLaVA, a VLM with a learnable safety meta token and dedicated safety head for intrinsically safer responses.

Result: SafeLLaVA achieves state-of-the-art safety performance across multiple benchmarks and the HoliSafe dataset exposes vulnerabilities in existing models.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates a significant advancement in VLM safety, providing tools like HoliSafe and SafeLLaVA that set new standards for safety evaluation and robustness in multimodal AI systems.

Abstract: Despite emerging efforts to enhance the safety of Vision-Language Models
(VLMs), current approaches face two main shortcomings. 1) Existing
safety-tuning datasets and benchmarks only partially consider how image-text
interactions can yield harmful content, often overlooking contextually unsafe
outcomes from seemingly benign pairs. This narrow coverage leaves VLMs
vulnerable to jailbreak attacks in unseen configurations. 2) Prior methods rely
primarily on data-centric tuning, with limited architectural innovations to
intrinsically strengthen safety. We address these gaps by introducing a
holistic safety dataset and benchmark, HoliSafe, that spans all five
safe/unsafe image-text combinations, providing a more robust basis for both
training and evaluation. We further propose SafeLLaVA, a novel VLM augmented
with a learnable safety meta token and a dedicated safety head. The meta token
encodes harmful visual cues during training, intrinsically guiding the language
model toward safer responses, while the safety head offers interpretable
harmfulness classification aligned with refusal rationales. Experiments show
that SafeLLaVA, trained on HoliSafe, achieves state-of-the-art safety
performance across multiple VLM benchmarks. Additionally, the HoliSafe
benchmark itself reveals critical vulnerabilities in existing models. We hope
that HoliSafe and SafeLLaVA will spur further research into robust and
interpretable VLM safety, expanding future avenues for multimodal alignment.

TL;DR: The paper investigates how multimodal models represent images in hidden activations, focusing on LlaVA-Next, using tools like Sparse Autoencoders to uncover interpretable features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand multimodal models' internal representations of images and the interaction between textual and visual modalities.

Method: Linear decoding of features, targeted editing of outputs, training Sparse Autoencoders to increase interpretability and feature diversity.

Result: Image concepts are represented in linearly decodable features; feature representations of modalities become increasingly shared in deeper layers.

Conclusion: Multimodal models such as LlaVA-Next exhibit disjoint modality representations initially, but deeper layers reveal a convergence in representation, enhancing multimodal understanding.

Abstract: Language models can be equipped with multimodal capabilities by fine-tuning
on embeddings of visual inputs. But how do such multimodal models represent
images in their hidden activations? We explore representations of image
concepts within LlaVA-Next, a popular open-source VLLM. We find a diverse set
of ImageNet classes represented via linearly decodable features in the residual
stream. We show that the features are causal by performing targeted edits on
the model output. In order to increase the diversity of the studied linear
features, we train multimodal Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs), creating a highly
interpretable dictionary of text and image features. We find that although
model representations across modalities are quite disjoint, they become
increasingly shared in deeper layers.

### [169] [Robust Few-Shot Vision-Language Model Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04713)
*Hanxin Wang,Tian Liu,Shu Kong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper evaluates robust adaptation methods for pretrained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in few-shot settings to improve both in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) performance, proposing a novel two-stage method, SRAPF.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhancing the generalization of pretrained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for both ID and OOD data is crucial during few-shot adaptation, given the necessity to deal with OOD scenarios in practical applications.

Method: The study benchmarks adaptation methods (prompt tuning, linear probing, contrastive finetuning, and full finetuning) and proposes a two-stage approach called SRAPF. This includes (1) partial finetuning with retrieved data augmentation and (2) adversarial partial finetuning.

Result: SRAPF achieves state-of-the-art performance for both ID and OOD scenarios on the ImageNet OOD benchmarks, addressing the trade-offs between ID and OOD accuracy through its staged approach.

Conclusion: Partial finetuning of VLMs, empowered with techniques like retrieval and adversarial augmentation, is effective for improving both robustness and accuracy in few-shot scenarios. The novel SRAPF method resolves ID/OOD trade-offs and sets a new benchmark.

Abstract: Pretrained VLMs achieve strong performance on downstream tasks when adapted
with just a few labeled examples. As the adapted models inevitably encounter
out-of-distribution (OOD) test data that deviates from the in-distribution (ID)
task-specific training data, enhancing OOD generalization in few-shot
adaptation is critically important. We study robust few-shot VLM adaptation,
aiming to increase both ID and OOD accuracy. By comparing different adaptation
methods (e.g., prompt tuning, linear probing, contrastive finetuning, and full
finetuning), we uncover three key findings: (1) finetuning with proper
hyperparameters significantly outperforms the popular VLM adaptation methods
prompt tuning and linear probing; (2) visual encoder-only finetuning achieves
better efficiency and accuracy than contrastively finetuning both visual and
textual encoders; (3) finetuning the top layers of the visual encoder provides
the best balance between ID and OOD accuracy. Building on these findings, we
propose partial finetuning of the visual encoder empowered with two simple
augmentation techniques: (1) retrieval augmentation which retrieves
task-relevant data from the VLM's pretraining dataset to enhance adaptation,
and (2) adversarial perturbation which promotes robustness during finetuning.
Results show that the former/latter boosts OOD/ID accuracy while slightly
sacrificing the ID/OOD accuracy. Yet, perhaps understandably, naively combining
the two does not maintain their best OOD/ID accuracy. We address this dilemma
with the developed SRAPF, Stage-wise Retrieval Augmentation-based Adversarial
Partial Finetuning. SRAPF consists of two stages: (1) partial finetuning the
visual encoder using both ID and retrieved data, and (2) adversarial partial
finetuning with few-shot ID data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SRAPF
achieves the state-of-the-art ID and OOD accuracy on the ImageNet OOD
benchmarks.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel method to assess the visual quality of AI-Generated Videos (AIGVs), decomposing quality into three dimensions and using large language models with fine-tuning for quality regression.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI-Generated Videos often suffer from visual quality defects like noise, blurriness, and frame jitter, which impact viewer experience. Effective automatic assessment is needed for regulation and model improvement.

Method: The authors decompose visual quality into three dimensions: technical quality, motion quality, and video semantics. They use encoders for feature representation and integrate large language models with multi-modal prompt engineering and LoRA fine-tuning for quality regression.

Result: The method achieved second place in the NTIRE 2025 Quality Assessment of AI-Generated Content Challenge: Track 2, proving its utility.

Conclusion: The proposed approach is effective in enhancing visual quality evaluation for AIGVs, combining dimension-specific features with advanced language model techniques.

Abstract: The development of AI-Generated Video (AIGV) technology has been remarkable
in recent years, significantly transforming the paradigm of video content
production. However, AIGVs still suffer from noticeable visual quality defects,
such as noise, blurriness, frame jitter and low dynamic degree, which severely
impact the user's viewing experience. Therefore, an effective automatic visual
quality assessment is of great importance for AIGV content regulation and
generative model improvement. In this work, we decompose the visual quality of
AIGVs into three dimensions: technical quality, motion quality, and video
semantics. For each dimension, we design corresponding encoder to achieve
effective feature representation. Moreover, considering the outstanding
performance of large language models (LLMs) in various vision and language
tasks, we introduce a LLM as the quality regression module. To better enable
the LLM to establish reasoning associations between multi-dimensional features
and visual quality, we propose a specially designed multi-modal prompt
engineering framework. Additionally, we incorporate LoRA fine-tuning technology
during the training phase, allowing the LLM to better adapt to specific tasks.
Our proposed method achieved \textbf{second place} in the NTIRE 2025 Quality

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents an advanced imitation learning method, iDPOE, aimed at predicting surgical dissection trajectories in Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection (ESD) videos for better skill training and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to overcome challenges in trajectory prediction during ESD, such as handling movement uncertainty, learning geometric symmetries, and generalizing across diverse surgical scenarios.

Method: The paper introduces iDPOE (Implicit Diffusion Policy with Equivariant Representations), which combines diffusion modeling with equivariant learning for robust imitation learning of expert trajectories.

Result: iDPOE demonstrated improved prediction accuracy and generalization across surgical scenarios on an ESD video dataset with nearly 2,000 clips, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: iDPOE is a pioneering application of imitation learning in surgical skill training, offering robust trajectory prediction and advancing automation in medical procedures.

Abstract: Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection (ESD) is a well-established technique for
removing epithelial lesions. Predicting dissection trajectories in ESD videos
offers significant potential for enhancing surgical skill training and
simplifying the learning process, yet this area remains underexplored. While
imitation learning has shown promise in acquiring skills from expert
demonstrations, challenges persist in handling uncertain future movements,
learning geometric symmetries, and generalizing to diverse surgical scenarios.
To address these, we introduce a novel approach: Implicit Diffusion Policy with
Equivariant Representations for Imitation Learning (iDPOE). Our method models
expert behavior through a joint state action distribution, capturing the
stochastic nature of dissection trajectories and enabling robust visual
representation learning across various endoscopic views. By incorporating a
diffusion model into policy learning, iDPOE ensures efficient training and
sampling, leading to more accurate predictions and better generalization.
Additionally, we enhance the model's ability to generalize to geometric
symmetries by embedding equivariance into the learning process. To address
state mismatches, we develop a forward-process guided action inference strategy
for conditional sampling. Using an ESD video dataset of nearly 2000 clips,
experimental results show that our approach surpasses state-of-the-art methods,
both explicit and implicit, in trajectory prediction. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first application of imitation learning to surgical
skill development for dissection trajectory prediction.

Motivation: To reduce the high manual effort required for labeling in industrial display panel defect detection tasks.

Method: The system combines the SegGPT architecture with domain-specific training and a scribble-based annotation mechanism in a two-stage training approach.

Result: The system achieves an IoU increase of 0.22 and 14% boost in recall while maintaining 60% auto-labeling coverage, showing that auto-labeled data matches human-labeled data performance.

Conclusion: This approach offers a practical solution for minimizing manual annotation effort in industrial inspection processes.

Abstract: This paper presents an AI-assisted auto-labeling system for display panel

enhance the SegGPT architecture with several domain-specific training
techniques and introduce a scribble-based annotation mechanism to streamline
the labeling process. Our two-stage training approach, validated on industrial
display panel datasets, demonstrates significant improvements over the baseline
model, achieving an average IoU increase of 0.22 and a 14% improvement in
recall across multiple product types, while maintaining approximately 60%

*Mikhail Kennerley,Angelica Alives-Reviro,Carola-Bibiane Schönlieb,Robby T. Tan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Label-Aligned Transfer (LAT), a framework for transferring annotations from diverse datasets to align with a target label space, tackling class-level and bounding box inconsistencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To facilitate the integration of multiple object detection datasets for improved generalization while addressing inconsistencies in class semantics and bounding box annotations.

Method: The LAT framework trains dataset-specific detectors to generate pseudo-labels, combines them with ground-truth annotations using a Privileged Proposal Generator (PPG), and refines region features with a Semantic Feature Fusion (SFF) module.

Result: Using LAT leads to semantically and spatially aligned representations, yielding improvements of up to +4.8AP in target-domain detection performance compared to semi-supervised baselines.

Conclusion: LAT effectively enables label space transfer across heterogeneous datasets, addressing annotation inconsistencies without requiring shared label spaces or manual relabeling, demonstrating robust improvements in detection tasks.

Abstract: Combining multiple object detection datasets offers a path to improved
generalisation but is hindered by inconsistencies in class semantics and
bounding box annotations. Some methods to address this assume shared label
taxonomies and address only spatial inconsistencies; others require manual
relabelling, or produce a unified label space, which may be unsuitable when a
fixed target label space is required. We propose Label-Aligned Transfer (LAT),
a label transfer framework that systematically projects annotations from
diverse source datasets into the label space of a target dataset. LAT begins by
training dataset-specific detectors to generate pseudo-labels, which are then
combined with ground-truth annotations via a Privileged Proposal Generator
(PPG) that replaces the region proposal network in two-stage detectors. To
further refine region features, a Semantic Feature Fusion (SFF) module injects
class-aware context and features from overlapping proposals using a
confidence-weighted attention mechanism. This pipeline preserves
dataset-specific annotation granularity while enabling many-to-one label space
transfer across heterogeneous datasets, resulting in a semantically and
spatially aligned representation suitable for training a downstream detector.
LAT thus jointly addresses both class-level misalignments and bounding box
inconsistencies without relying on shared label spaces or manual annotations.
Across multiple benchmarks, LAT demonstrates consistent improvements in
target-domain detection performance, achieving gains of up to +4.8AP over
semi-supervised baselines.

*Shuhan Xu,Siyuan Liang,Hongling Zheng,Yong Luo,Aishan Liu,Dacheng Tao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) face stealthy backdoor attacks that control captions post-training. Semantic Reward Defense (SRD) mitigates these attacks using a reinforcement learning framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are vulnerable to stealthy backdoor attacks that compromise the integrity and security of their generated image captions.

Method: Semantic Reward Defense (SRD) applies reinforcement learning via a Deep Q-Network, introducing specific image perturbations to disrupt malicious behaviors without reliance on prior knowledge of triggers.

Result: Experiments show SRD reduces backdoor attack success rates to 5.6%, while maintaining caption quality within a performance drop of less than 10%.

Conclusion: SRD provides a trigger-agnostic, effective, and interpretable defense strategy for safeguarding VLMs against covert backdoor attacks.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable performance in image
captioning, but recent studies show they are vulnerable to backdoor attacks.
Attackers can inject imperceptible perturbations-such as local pixel triggers
or global semantic phrases-into the training data, causing the model to
generate malicious, attacker-controlled captions for specific inputs. These
attacks are hard to detect and defend due to their stealthiness and cross-modal
nature. By analyzing attack samples, we identify two key vulnerabilities: (1)
abnormal attention concentration on specific image regions, and (2) semantic
drift and incoherence in generated captions. To counter this, we propose
Semantic Reward Defense (SRD), a reinforcement learning framework that
mitigates backdoor behavior without prior knowledge of triggers. SRD uses a
Deep Q-Network to learn policies for applying discrete perturbations (e.g.,
occlusion, color masking) to sensitive image regions, aiming to disrupt the
activation of malicious pathways. We design a semantic fidelity score as the
reward signal, which jointly evaluates semantic consistency and linguistic
fluency of the output, guiding the agent toward generating robust yet faithful
captions. Experiments across mainstream VLMs and datasets show SRD reduces
attack success rates to 5.6%, while preserving caption quality on clean inputs
with less than 10% performance drop. SRD offers a trigger-agnostic,
interpretable defense paradigm against stealthy backdoor threats in multimodal
generative models.

*Niki Martinel,Rita Pucci*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a dual-stream architecture that enhances underwater images using a physics model and capsule clustering, achieving state-of-the-art results with high efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to advance underwater image enhancement techniques by integrating physical models and feature learning to overcome challenges like spatially varying background light and semantic preservation.

Method: The method combines a physics estimator for transmission maps and background light with capsule clustering for feature extraction. It uses a unique optimization objective for physical and perceptual fidelity.

Result: The proposed approach achieves +0.5dB PSNR improvement over the best methods while reducing computational costs, or +1dB PSNR improvement over similarly efficient methods.

Conclusion: This physics-guided dual-stream method delivers superior underwater image enhancement in terms of both quality and efficiency, setting a new state-of-the-art standard.

Abstract: We present a novel dual-stream architecture that achieves state-of-the-art
underwater image enhancement by explicitly integrating the Jaffe-McGlamery
physical model with capsule clustering-based feature representation learning.
Our method simultaneously estimates transmission maps and spatially-varying
background light through a dedicated physics estimator while extracting
entity-level features via capsule clustering in a parallel stream. This
physics-guided approach enables parameter-free enhancement that respects
underwater formation constraints while preserving semantic structures and
fine-grained details. Our approach also features a novel optimization objective
ensuring both physical adherence and perceptual quality across multiple spatial
frequencies. To validate our approach, we conducted extensive experiments
across six challenging benchmarks. Results demonstrate consistent improvements
of $+0.5$dB PSNR over the best existing methods while requiring only one-third
of their computational complexity (FLOPs), or alternatively, more than $+1$dB
PSNR improvement when compared to methods with similar computational budgets.

*Shenshen Li,Kaiyuan Deng,Lei Wang,Hao Yang,Chong Peng,Peng Yan,Fumin Shen,Heng Tao Shen,Xing Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces RAP (Reasoning Activation Potential), a data selection method allowing MLLMs to outperform traditional methods with just 9.3% of the training data by focusing on vital samples and reducing reliance on redundant ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-modal large language models require extensive training data, resulting in redundancy and high computational costs. The authors aim to explore whether smaller, high-value datasets could deliver comparable or superior reasoning capabilities.

Method: The RAP method identifies critical ‘cognitive samples’ that enhance multi-modal reasoning through two processes: Causal Discrepancy Estimator (CDE) filters samples that overly depend on language priors, and Attention Confidence Estimator (ACE) removes irrelevant but emphasized tokens. Additionally, a Difficulty-aware Replacement Module (DRM) replaces trivial instances with challenging yet essential ones.

Result: The proposed RAP method achieves better performance across six datasets using just 9.3% of training data. It also reduces computational costs by over 43%.

Conclusion: RAP effectively demonstrates that focusing on high-value cognitive samples can achieve or surpass traditional performance while significantly reducing data and computational requirements.

Abstract: While multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have made significant
progress in complex reasoning tasks via reinforcement learning, it is commonly
believed that extensive training data is necessary for improving multi-modal
reasoning ability, inevitably leading to data redundancy and substantial
computational costs. However, can smaller high-value datasets match or
outperform full corpora for multi-modal reasoning in MLLMs? In this work, we
challenge this assumption through a key observation: meaningful multi-modal
reasoning is triggered by only a sparse subset of training samples, termed
cognitive samples, whereas the majority contribute marginally. Building on this
insight, we propose a novel data selection paradigm termed Reasoning Activation
Potential (RAP), which identifies cognitive samples by estimating each sample's
potential to stimulate genuine multi-modal reasoning by two complementary
estimators: 1) Causal Discrepancy Estimator (CDE) based on the potential
outcome model principle, eliminates samples that overly rely on language priors
by comparing outputs between multi-modal and text-only inputs; 2) Attention
Confidence Estimator (ACE), which exploits token-level self-attention to
discard samples dominated by irrelevant but over-emphasized tokens in
intermediate reasoning stages. Moreover, we introduce a Difficulty-aware
Replacement Module (DRM) to substitute trivial instances with cognitively
challenging ones, thereby ensuring complexity for robust multi-modal reasoning.
Experiments on six datasets show that our RAP method consistently achieves
superior performance using only 9.3% of the training data, while reducing
computational costs by over 43%. Our code is available at
https://github.com/Leo-ssl/RAP.

### [177] [Toward Better SSIM Loss for Unsupervised Monocular Depth Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04758)
*Yijun Cao,Fuya Luo,Yongjie Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new form of SSIM function for unsupervised monocular depth estimation, achieving higher performance and smoother gradients.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations in current SSIM components and hyperparameters for improving unsupervised monocular depth learning.

Method: They used a novel SSIM formulation, combining its components (luminance, contrast, structural similarity) additively, and conducted extensive experiments to determine optimal parameters.

Result: The optimized SSIM loss function significantly outperforms the baseline on the KITTI-2015 outdoor dataset.

Conclusion: The new SSIM form improves training of depth estimation models by offering smoother gradients and better results compared to conventional methods.

Abstract: Unsupervised monocular depth learning generally relies on the photometric
relation among temporally adjacent images. Most of previous works use both mean
absolute error (MAE) and structure similarity index measure (SSIM) with
conventional form as training loss. However, they ignore the effect of
different components in the SSIM function and the corresponding hyperparameters
on the training. To address these issues, this work proposes a new form of
SSIM. Compared with original SSIM function, the proposed new form uses addition
rather than multiplication to combine the luminance, contrast, and structural
similarity related components in SSIM. The loss function constructed with this
scheme helps result in smoother gradients and achieve higher performance on
unsupervised depth estimation. We conduct extensive experiments to determine
the relatively optimal combination of parameters for our new SSIM. Based on the
popular MonoDepth approach, the optimized SSIM loss function can remarkably
outperform the baseline on the KITTI-2015 outdoor dataset.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HypeVPR is a novel framework for Visual Place Recognition (VPR) using hyperbolic space for handling diverse query images, achieving faster and more accurate results than state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to handle the diversity of query images in real-world applications of Visual Place Recognition (VPR), especially when utilizing panoramic views, which require effective representation of hierarchical structures in visual environments.

Method: HypeVPR introduces a hierarchical embedding framework in hyperbolic space, employing hierarchical feature aggregation and a coarse-to-fine search strategy to achieve efficient and robust matching across differing image types.

Result: HypeVPR outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and retrieval time, offering up to 5x faster retrieval across various benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: Using hyperbolic space for hierarchical feature representation and a novel search strategy, HypeVPR offers a robust, efficient solution to the challenges of P2E VPR in real-world applications.

Abstract: When applying Visual Place Recognition (VPR) to real-world mobile robots and
similar applications, perspective-to-equirectangular (P2E) formulation
naturally emerges as a suitable approach to accommodate diverse query images
captured from various viewpoints. In this paper, we introduce HypeVPR, a novel
hierarchical embedding framework in hyperbolic space, designed to address the
unique challenges of P2E VPR. The key idea behind HypeVPR is that visual
environments captured by panoramic views exhibit inherent hierarchical
structures. To leverage this property, we employ hyperbolic space to represent
hierarchical feature relationships and preserve distance properties within the
feature space. To achieve this, we propose a hierarchical feature aggregation
mechanism that organizes local-to-global feature representations within
hyperbolic space. Additionally, HypeVPR adopts an efficient coarse-to-fine
search strategy, optimally balancing speed and accuracy to ensure robust
matching, even between descriptors from different image types. This approach
enables HypeVPR to outperform state-of-the-art methods while significantly
reducing retrieval time, achieving up to 5x faster retrieval across diverse
benchmark datasets. The code and models will be released at

*Gaia Di Lorenzo,Federico Tombari,Marc Pollefeys,Daniel Barath*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents Object-X, a multi-modal framework that encodes object representations and supports various tasks while using significantly less storage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in current task-specific 3D embeddings, enabling reusable and rich object representations across diverse tasks.

Method: The Object-X framework geometrically grounds modalities in a 3D voxel grid, learns unstructured embeddings, and performs tasks through 3D Gaussian Splatting.

Result: Object-X provides high-fidelity geometric reconstructions and performs competitively in tasks like scene alignment and localization while reducing storage requirements.

Conclusion: Object-X is a practical, scalable framework delivering effective multi-modal 3D representations for various applications.

Abstract: Learning effective multi-modal 3D representations of objects is essential for
numerous applications, such as augmented reality and robotics. Existing methods
often rely on task-specific embeddings that are tailored either for semantic
understanding or geometric reconstruction. As a result, these embeddings
typically cannot be decoded into explicit geometry and simultaneously reused
across tasks. In this paper, we propose Object-X, a versatile multi-modal
object representation framework capable of encoding rich object embeddings
(e.g. images, point cloud, text) and decoding them back into detailed geometric
and visual reconstructions. Object-X operates by geometrically grounding the
captured modalities in a 3D voxel grid and learning an unstructured embedding
fusing the information from the voxels with the object attributes. The learned
embedding enables 3D Gaussian Splatting-based object reconstruction, while also
supporting a range of downstream tasks, including scene alignment, single-image
3D object reconstruction, and localization. Evaluations on two challenging
real-world datasets demonstrate that Object-X produces high-fidelity novel-view
synthesis comparable to standard 3D Gaussian Splatting, while significantly
improving geometric accuracy. Moreover, Object-X achieves competitive
performance with specialized methods in scene alignment and localization.
Critically, our object-centric descriptors require 3-4 orders of magnitude less
storage compared to traditional image- or point cloud-based approaches,
establishing Object-X as a scalable and highly practical solution for
multi-modal 3D scene representation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces LotusFilter, a module aimed at enhancing diversity in approximate nearest neighbor search (ANNS) results by removing redundant vectors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the issue of overly similar results in ANNS, which can reduce effectiveness in applications like retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), particularly when diverse results are needed.

Method: LotusFilter uses a precomputed cutoff table summarizing closely related vectors and performs greedy filtering during the search to eliminate redundant vectors, increasing diversity in the results.

Result: LotusFilter operates quickly (0.02 ms/query) and has been demonstrated in real-world-like RAG settings using OpenAI embeddings.

Conclusion: LotusFilter effectively improves diversity in ANNS results without a significant computational overhead, and the solution is made publicly available for integration by others.

Abstract: Approximate nearest neighbor search (ANNS) is an essential building block for
applications like RAG but can sometimes yield results that are overly similar
to each other. In certain scenarios, search results should be similar to the
query and yet diverse. We propose LotusFilter, a post-processing module to
diversify ANNS results. We precompute a cutoff table summarizing vectors that
are close to each other. During the filtering, LotusFilter greedily looks up
the table to delete redundant vectors from the candidates. We demonstrated that
the LotusFilter operates fast (0.02 [ms/query]) in settings resembling
real-world RAG applications, utilizing features such as OpenAI embeddings. Our
code is publicly available at https://github.com/matsui528/lotf.

TL;DR: This paper proposes SupeRANSAC, a unified RANSAC pipeline, improving estimation accuracy and consistently outperforming state-of-the-art methods in geometric model estimation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the performance inconsistency across different problem areas in geometric model estimation using RANSAC, which is often limited by implementation details and problem-specific optimizations.

Method: The proposed method, SupeRANSAC, offers a novel unified RANSAC pipeline designed to achieve consistent high performance through a detailed analysis of techniques for various vision tasks such as homography and pose estimation.

Result: SupeRANSAC achieved significant improvements, such as an average increase of 6 AUC points for fundamental matrix estimation, and outperformed state-of-the-art methods on several problems and datasets.

Conclusion: SupeRANSAC demonstrates that a unified and well-optimized RANSAC pipeline can consistently provide superior performance across diverse computer vision tasks, addressing the shortcomings of existing methods.

Abstract: Robust estimation is a cornerstone in computer vision, particularly for tasks
like Structure-from-Motion and Simultaneous Localization and Mapping. RANSAC
and its variants are the gold standard for estimating geometric models (e.g.,
homographies, relative/absolute poses) from outlier-contaminated data. Despite
RANSAC's apparent simplicity, achieving consistently high performance across
different problems is challenging. While recent research often focuses on
improving specific RANSAC components (e.g., sampling, scoring), overall
performance is frequently more influenced by the "bells and whistles" (i.e.,
the implementation details and problem-specific optimizations) within a given
library. Popular frameworks like OpenCV and PoseLib demonstrate varying
performance, excelling in some tasks but lagging in others. We introduce
SupeRANSAC, a novel unified RANSAC pipeline, and provide a detailed analysis of
the techniques that make RANSAC effective for specific vision tasks, including
homography, fundamental/essential matrix, and absolute/rigid pose estimation.
SupeRANSAC is designed for consistent accuracy across these tasks, improving
upon the best existing methods by, for example, 6 AUC points on average for
fundamental matrix estimation. We demonstrate significant performance
improvements over the state-of-the-art on multiple problems and datasets. Code:

TL;DR: The paper introduces MegaHan97K, a dataset with 97,455 Chinese character categories, addressing the challenge of mega-category OCR and aiming to preserve cultural heritage while enabling digital applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limited scope of existing OCR datasets which hinder comprehensive recognition of Chinese characters, essential for cultural preservation and digital applications.

Method: The paper introduces MegaHan97K, a large-scale dataset containing handwritten, historical, and synthetic subsets with balanced samples across 97,455 categories, supporting the GB18030-2022 standard.

Result: The MegaHan97K dataset covers over six times more categories than current datasets and highlights challenges in storage demands, similar character recognition, and zero-shot learning.

Conclusion: MegaHan97K sets a new benchmark for mega-category OCR and pattern recognition, presenting both challenges and opportunities for advancing research in this area.

Abstract: Foundational to the Chinese language and culture, Chinese characters
encompass extraordinarily extensive and ever-expanding categories, with the
latest Chinese GB18030-2022 standard containing 87,887 categories. The accurate
recognition of this vast number of characters, termed mega-category
recognition, presents a formidable yet crucial challenge for cultural heritage
preservation and digital applications. Despite significant advances in Optical
Character Recognition (OCR), mega-category recognition remains unexplored due
to the absence of comprehensive datasets, with the largest existing dataset
containing merely 16,151 categories. To bridge this critical gap, we introduce
MegaHan97K, a mega-category, large-scale dataset covering an unprecedented
97,455 categories of Chinese characters. Our work offers three major
contributions: (1) MegaHan97K is the first dataset to fully support the latest
GB18030-2022 standard, providing at least six times more categories than
existing datasets; (2) It effectively addresses the long-tail distribution
problem by providing balanced samples across all categories through its three
distinct subsets: handwritten, historical and synthetic subsets; (3)
Comprehensive benchmarking experiments reveal new challenges in mega-category
scenarios, including increased storage demands, morphologically similar
character recognition, and zero-shot learning difficulties, while also
unlocking substantial opportunities for future research. To the best of our
knowledge, the MetaHan97K is likely the dataset with the largest classes not
only in the field of OCR but may also in the broader domain of pattern
recognition. The dataset is available at

TL;DR: Spike-TBR is a new method for processing event camera data that combines traditional Temporal Binary Representation with spiking neurons, improving noise resilience and performance in both clean and noisy scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Event cameras provide high temporal resolution but face challenges when integrating into standard computer vision workflows, especially due to noise in the data.

Method: The paper introduces Spike-TBR, which uses spiking neurons to enhance Temporal Binary Representation and filter noise effectively.

Result: Spike-TBR demonstrates superior performance on noise-impacted datasets while enhancing results on clean data, evaluated using four variants of the method.

Conclusion: Spike-TBR bridges spike-based and frame-based processing, offering a noise-resilient solution suitable for event-driven vision applications.

Abstract: Event cameras offer significant advantages over traditional frame-based
sensors, including higher temporal resolution, lower latency and dynamic range.
However, efficiently converting event streams into formats compatible with
standard computer vision pipelines remains a challenging problem, particularly
in the presence of noise. In this paper, we propose Spike-TBR, a novel
event-based encoding strategy based on Temporal Binary Representation (TBR),
addressing its vulnerability to noise by integrating spiking neurons. Spike-TBR
combines the frame-based advantages of TBR with the noise-filtering
capabilities of spiking neural networks, creating a more robust representation
of event streams. We evaluate four variants of Spike-TBR, each using different
spiking neurons, across multiple datasets, demonstrating superior performance
in noise-affected scenarios while improving the results on clean data. Our
method bridges the gap between spike-based and frame-based processing, offering
a simple noise-resilient solution for event-driven vision applications.

Motivation: To address the lack of focus on traffic light detectors in the study of adversarial attacks in autonomous vehicle systems.

Method: Proposes a threat model attacking each traffic light instance with patches and implements adversarial training strategies for CNNs.

Result: Demonstrates successful label-flipping and pictogram classification attacks in both universal and real-world settings.

Conclusion: Adversarial printed patches can compromise traffic light detection systems, posing safety risks for autonomous vehicles in practical environments.

Abstract: Realistic adversarial attacks on various camera-based perception tasks of
autonomous vehicles have been successfully demonstrated so far. However, only a
few works considered attacks on traffic light detectors. This work shows how
CNNs for traffic light detection can be attacked with printed patches. We
propose a threat model, where each instance of a traffic light is attacked with
a patch placed under it, and describe a training strategy. We demonstrate
successful adversarial patch attacks in universal settings. Our experiments
show realistic targeted red-to-green label-flipping attacks and attacks on
pictogram classification. Finally, we perform a real-world evaluation with
printed patches and demonstrate attacks in the lab settings with a mobile

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Transformer-based models have progressed in video understanding, but face challenges in video super-resolution requiring pixel-level precision. This paper introduces a Dual Axial Spatial×Temporal Transformer (DualX-VSR) using orthogonal spatial-temporal attention for effective real-world VSR without motion compensation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing transformer-based models face limitations in pixel-level precision and real-world video super-resolution due to tokenization, sequential mechanisms, restricted receptive fields, and optical flow inaccuracies.

Method: DualX-VSR employs a novel dual axial spatial×temporal attention mechanism, integrating spatial and temporal data orthogonally, eliminating motion compensation, and offering a simplified structure.

Result: DualX-VSR achieves high fidelity and outperforms prior methods in real-world video super-resolution tasks.

Conclusion: DualX-VSR simplifies the architecture of video super-resolution models while improving accuracy and eliminating the dependency on motion compensation methods, revolutionizing real-world VSR performance.

Abstract: Transformer-based models like ViViT and TimeSformer have advanced video
understanding by effectively modeling spatiotemporal dependencies. Recent video
generation models, such as Sora and Vidu, further highlight the power of
transformers in long-range feature extraction and holistic spatiotemporal
modeling. However, directly applying these models to real-world video
super-resolution (VSR) is challenging, as VSR demands pixel-level precision,
which can be compromised by tokenization and sequential attention mechanisms.
While recent transformer-based VSR models attempt to address these issues using
smaller patches and local attention, they still face limitations such as
restricted receptive fields and dependence on optical flow-based alignment,
which can introduce inaccuracies in real-world settings. To overcome these
issues, we propose Dual Axial Spatial$\times$Temporal Transformer for
Real-World Video Super-Resolution (DualX-VSR), which introduces a novel dual
axial spatial$\times$temporal attention mechanism that integrates spatial and
temporal information along orthogonal directions. DualX-VSR eliminates the need
for motion compensation, offering a simplified structure that provides a
cohesive representation of spatiotemporal information. As a result, DualX-VSR
achieves high fidelity and superior performance in real-world VSR task.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current perception systems are limited in 3D reasoning segmentation and rely heavily on explicit user instructions, lacking frameworks that interpret implicit intentions akin to 2D systems.

Method: The proposed OpenMaskDINO3D incorporates a SEG token and object identifier to process point cloud data and text prompts, enabling high-precision 3D segmentation mask generation.

Result: OpenMaskDINO3D demonstrated effectiveness in generating accurate segmentation masks through experiments on the ScanNet dataset.

Conclusion: OpenMaskDINO3D bridges the gap in 3D reasoning segmentation by leveraging natural language instructions, pushing beyond traditional methods reliant on explicit categories or instructions.

Abstract: Although perception systems have made remarkable advancements in recent
years, particularly in 2D reasoning segmentation, these systems still rely on
explicit human instruction or pre-defined categories to identify target objects
before executing visual recognition tasks. Such systems have matured
significantly, demonstrating the ability to reason and comprehend implicit user
intentions in two-dimensional contexts, producing accurate segmentation masks
based on complex and implicit query text. However, a comparable framework and
structure for 3D reasoning segmentation remain absent. This paper introduces
OpenMaskDINO3D, a LLM designed for comprehensive 3D understanding and
segmentation. OpenMaskDINO3D processes point cloud data and text prompts to
produce instance segmentation masks, excelling in many 3D tasks. By introducing
a SEG token and object identifier, we achieve high-precision 3D segmentation
mask generation, enabling the model to directly produce accurate point cloud
segmentation results from natural language instructions. Experimental results
on large-scale ScanNet datasets validate the effectiveness of our
OpenMaskDINO3D across various tasks.

### [188] [Invisible Backdoor Triggers in Image Editing Model via Deep Watermarking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04879)
*Yu-Feng Chen,Tzuhsuan Huang,Pin-Yen Chiu,Jun-Cheng Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces an advanced framework for backdoor attacks in image editing by utilizing invisible triggers encoded with deep watermarking models, showcasing effective attack success rates and maintaining normal functionality for clean images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing studies focus heavily on backdoor attacks in image generation while neglecting image editing. Furthermore, methods using visible triggers are impractical for real-world applications because they cause noticeable changes to input images.

Method: The researchers embed imperceptible triggers, or watermarks, into the training data using deep watermarking models. These triggers allow the edited model to specifically misbehave with watermarked inputs while processing clean images normally.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate high attack success rates and validate the efficacy of using invisible watermark-based triggers. Moreover, analyzing the watermark characteristics reinforces the proposed framework's viability.

Conclusion: This work broadens the understanding of backdoor threats in image editing, presenting a novel and effective approach by leveraging invisible trigger-based mechanisms. The availability of the code promotes further research in this domain.

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable progress in both image generation
and editing. However, recent studies have revealed their vulnerability to
backdoor attacks, in which specific patterns embedded in the input can
manipulate the model's behavior. Most existing research in this area has
proposed attack frameworks focused on the image generation pipeline, leaving
backdoor attacks in image editing relatively unexplored. Among the few studies
targeting image editing, most utilize visible triggers, which are impractical
because they introduce noticeable alterations to the input image before
editing. In this paper, we propose a novel attack framework that embeds
invisible triggers into the image editing process via poisoned training data.
We leverage off-the-shelf deep watermarking models to encode imperceptible
watermarks as backdoor triggers. Our goal is to make the model produce the
predefined backdoor target when it receives watermarked inputs, while editing
clean images normally according to the given prompt. With extensive experiments
across different watermarking models, the proposed method achieves promising
attack success rates. In addition, the analysis results of the watermark
characteristics in term of backdoor attack further support the effectiveness of
our approach. The code is available

*Andrew Hamara,Greg Hamerly,Pablo Rivas,Andrew C. Freeman*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes an intuition-driven chess planning model using a transformer that evaluates game states via embeddings, achieving a 2593 Elo rating with limited search depth.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To design a chess engine that mimics human-like intuition in move selection rather than relying on computationally intensive deep searches.

Method: A transformer encoder trained with supervised contrastive learning embeds board states into a latent space that reflects evaluation, enabling move selection via transitions in this space.

Result: The model achieved a 2593 Elo rating using only a 6-ply beam search, with performance improving as model size and embedding dimensionality increase.

Conclusion: The embedding-based planning approach offers a promising, interpretable alternative to deep search and can generalize to other perfect-information games.

Abstract: Modern chess engines achieve superhuman performance through deep tree search
and regressive evaluation, while human players rely on intuition to select
candidate moves followed by a shallow search to validate them. To model this
intuition-driven planning process, we train a transformer encoder using
supervised contrastive learning to embed board states into a latent space
structured by positional evaluation. In this space, distance reflects
evaluative similarity, and visualized trajectories display interpretable
transitions between game states. We demonstrate that move selection can occur
entirely within this embedding space by advancing toward favorable regions,
without relying on deep search. Despite using only a 6-ply beam search, our
model achieves an estimated Elo rating of 2593. Performance improves with both
model size and embedding dimensionality, suggesting that latent planning may
offer a viable alternative to traditional search. Although we focus on chess,
the proposed embedding-based planning method can be generalized to other
perfect-information games where state evaluations are learnable. All source

### [190] [From Objects to Anywhere: A Holistic Benchmark for Multi-level Visual Grounding in 3D Scenes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04897)
*Tianxu Wang,Zhuofan Zhang,Ziyu Zhu,Yue Fan,Jing Xiong,Pengxiang Li,Xiaojian Ma,Qing Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces Anywhere3D-Bench, a benchmark for advancing 3D visual grounding to include areas and object parts beyond simple object localization, highlighting significant challenges in spatial reasoning and fine-grained perception.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to explore 3D visual grounding beyond object-level understanding, addressing gaps in spatial reasoning and fine-grained perception of complex scenes.

Method: The authors developed a benchmark, Anywhere3D-Bench, with 2,632 pairs covering diverse grounding levels, and evaluated state-of-the-art 3D visual grounding methods alongside LLMs and MLLMs.

Result: OpenAI o4-mini achieved the best performance but significantly struggled with space-level (23.57% accuracy) and part-level (33.94% accuracy) tasks compared to area-level and object-level tasks.

Conclusion: Existing models lack the capability for comprehensive 3D reasoning and fine-grained compositional understanding, emphasizing the need for advancements in these areas.

Abstract: 3D visual grounding has made notable progress in localizing objects within
complex 3D scenes. However, grounding referring expressions beyond objects in
3D scenes remains unexplored. In this paper, we introduce Anywhere3D-Bench, a
holistic 3D visual grounding benchmark consisting of 2,632 referring
expression-3D bounding box pairs spanning four different grounding levels:
human-activity areas, unoccupied space beyond objects, objects in the scene,
and fine-grained object parts. We assess a range of state-of-the-art 3D visual
grounding methods alongside large language models (LLMs) and multimodal LLMs
(MLLMs) on Anywhere3D-Bench. Experimental results reveal that space-level and
part-level visual grounding pose the greatest challenges: space-level tasks
require a more comprehensive spatial reasoning ability, for example, modeling
distances and spatial relations within 3D space, while part-level tasks demand
fine-grained perception of object composition. Even the best performance model,
OpenAI o4-mini, achieves only 23.57% accuracy on space-level tasks and 33.94%
on part-level tasks, significantly lower than its performance on area-level and
object-level tasks. These findings underscore a critical gap in current models'
capacity to understand and reason about 3D scene beyond object-level semantics.

*Filip Slezak,Magnus K. Gjerde,Joakim B. Haurum,Ivan Nikolov,Morten S. Laursen,Thomas B. Moeslund*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents a framework based on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) for creating stereo datasets, aiming to offer an efficient alternative to NeRF-based approaches. It assesses geometry reconstruction via FoundationStereo and highlights strengths and areas needing improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in stereo dataset generation, particularly the inefficiencies associated with NeRF-based methods, while aiming for effective zero-shot generalization benchmarks.

Method: The authors explore 3DGS-based pipeline with geometry estimates derived from 3D explicit representations and FoundationStereo depth estimates, emphasizing dataset creation and fine-tuning deep stereo models using expert knowledge transfer.

Result: Fine-tuning stereo models on 3DGS-generated datasets showed competitive performance and revealed that FoundationStereo's depth estimates provided cleaner data, leading to better results on benchmarks than directly using reconstructed geometry.

Conclusion: This study advocates for adopting 3DGS pipelines for efficient dataset generation and highlights its benefits for cost and fidelity. However, it also identifies robustness issues with Gaussian Splatting methods in challenging real-world scenarios.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)-based pipeline for
stereo dataset generation, offering an efficient alternative to Neural Radiance
Fields (NeRF)-based methods. To obtain useful geometry estimates, we explore
utilizing the reconstructed geometry from the explicit 3D representations as
well as depth estimates from the FoundationStereo model in an expert knowledge
transfer setup. We find that when fine-tuning stereo models on 3DGS-generated
datasets, we demonstrate competitive performance in zero-shot generalization
benchmarks. When using the reconstructed geometry directly, we observe that it
is often noisy and contains artifacts, which propagate noise to the trained
model. In contrast, we find that the disparity estimates from FoundationStereo
are cleaner and consequently result in a better performance on the zero-shot
generalization benchmarks. Our method highlights the potential for low-cost,
high-fidelity dataset creation and fast fine-tuning for deep stereo models.
Moreover, we also reveal that while the latest Gaussian Splatting based methods
have achieved superior performance on established benchmarks, their robustness
falls short in challenging in-the-wild settings warranting further exploration.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper discusses the creation of digital twins for heritage objects, recommending case-specific 3D digitization methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the growing need for digitizing heritage objects effectively through suitable methods.

Method: Provided examples from the musée d'Archéologie nationale collection to illustrate that digitization methods should be adapted to specific objects and their future uses.

Result: Concluded that no universal method suits all heritage objects, and method selection must involve collaboration between heritage and digital professionals.

Conclusion: Advocates for a deliberate, object-specific approach to 3D digitization, emphasizing collaboration and adaptability over universal classification of methods.

Abstract: The need to digitize heritage objects is now widely accepted. This article
presents the very fashionable context of the creation of ''digital twins''. It
illustrates the diversity of photographic 3D digitization methods, but this is
not its only objective. Using a selection of objects from the collections of
the mus{\'e}e d'Arch{\'e}ologie nationale, it shows that no single method is
suitable for all cases. Rather, the method to be recommended for a given object
should be the result of a concerted choice between those involved in heritage
and those involved in the digital domain, as each new object may require the
adaptation of existing tools. It would therefore be pointless to attempt an
absolute classification of 3D digitization methods. On the contrary, we need to
find the digital tool best suited to each object, taking into account not only
its characteristics, but also the future use of its digital twin.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CzechLynx is a large dataset for studying Eurasian lynx, providing images for identity recognition, pose estimation, and segmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of comprehensive datasets for studying Eurasian lynx traits and individual identification.

Method: The dataset includes real data from 15 years of monitoring and synthetic data generated via Unity and diffusion-based modeling.

Result: Provides annotated data of over 30k real images and 100k synthetic images, with protocols for testing spatial and temporal generalization.

Conclusion: CzechLynx aids in benchmarking machine learning models and developing innovative solutions for animal re-identification and related tasks.

Abstract: We introduce CzechLynx, the first large-scale, open-access dataset for
individual identification, 2D pose estimation, and instance segmentation of the
Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx). CzechLynx includes more than 30k camera trap images
annotated with segmentation masks, identity labels, and 20-point skeletons and
covers 219 unique individuals across 15 years of systematic monitoring in two
geographically distinct regions: Southwest Bohemia and the Western Carpathians.
To increase the data variability, we create a complementary synthetic set with
more than 100k photorealistic images generated via a Unity-based pipeline and
diffusion-driven text-to-texture modeling, covering diverse environments,
poses, and coat-pattern variations. To allow testing generalization across
spatial and temporal domains, we define three tailored evaluation
protocols/splits: (i) geo-aware, (ii) time-aware open-set, and (iii) time-aware
closed-set. This dataset is targeted to be instrumental in benchmarking
state-of-the-art models and the development of novel methods for not just
individual animal re-identification.

*Yong Sun,Yipeng Wang,Junyu Shi,Zhiyuan Zhang,Yanmei Xiao,Lei Zhu,Manxi Jiang,Qiang Nie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This study introduces Video-Based Embryo Grading, which uses time-lapse monitoring videos for more comprehensive embryo evaluations in IVF, presenting the CoSTeM framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve embryo selection process in IVF by addressing limitations in current approaches that lack holistic quality assessments and are confounded by external factors.

Method: Proposed the CoSTeM framework with two branches: morphological and morphokinetic, integrating spatial and temporal patterns via sophisticated AI models like cross-attentive experts and transformers.

Result: The proposed CoSTeM framework outperformed existing methods, offering better embryo grading aligned with clinical quality assessments.

Conclusion: Introduced a novel task and framework that enhances AI-assisted embryo selection in IVF by mimicking expert evaluations, with plans to make the dataset and code publicly available.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence has recently shown promise in automated embryo
selection for In-Vitro Fertilization (IVF). However, current approaches either
address partial embryo evaluation lacking holistic quality assessment or target
clinical outcomes inevitably confounded by extra-embryonic factors, both
limiting clinical utility. To bridge this gap, we propose a new task called
Video-Based Embryo Grading - the first paradigm that directly utilizes
full-length time-lapse monitoring (TLM) videos to predict embryologists'
overall quality assessments. To support this task, we curate a real-world
clinical dataset comprising over 2,500 TLM videos, each annotated with a
grading label indicating the overall quality of embryos. Grounded in clinical
decision-making principles, we propose a Complementary Spatial-Temporal Pattern
Mining (CoSTeM) framework that conceptually replicates embryologists'
evaluation process. The CoSTeM comprises two branches: (1) a morphological
branch using a Mixture of Cross-Attentive Experts layer and a Temporal
Selection Block to select discriminative local structural features, and (2) a
morphokinetic branch employing a Temporal Transformer to model global
developmental trajectories, synergistically integrating static and dynamic
determinants for grading embryos. Extensive experimental results demonstrate
the superiority of our design. This work provides a valuable methodological
framework for AI-assisted embryo selection. The dataset and source code will be
publicly available upon acceptance.

*Igor Meleshin,Anna Chistyakova,Anastasia Antsiferova,Dmitriy Vatolin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel approach to make Image Quality Assessment (IQA) models robust against adversarial manipulations by focusing on architectural design rather than traditional data-driven defenses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the instability and susceptibility of IQA models to adversarial attacks, which inflate scores and undermine trust in real-world applications.

Method: The authors enforce orthogonal information flow and norm-preserving operations within the network. They further stabilize IQA models via pruning and fine-tuning to suppress sensitivity from the ground up.

Result: The proposed IQA architecture becomes resistant to adversarial attacks without necessitating adversarial training or major modifications to the original model.

Conclusion: This paper presents robustness as a design principle for perceptual models, advocating a shift from learning-based optimization to architectural engineering for improved stability.

Abstract: Image Quality Assessment (IQA) models are increasingly relied upon to
evaluate image quality in real-world systems -- from compression and
enhancement to generation and streaming. Yet their adoption brings a
fundamental risk: these models are inherently unstable. Adversarial
manipulations can easily fool them, inflating scores and undermining trust.
Traditionally, such vulnerabilities are addressed through data-driven defenses
-- adversarial retraining, regularization, or input purification. But what if
this is the wrong lens? What if robustness in perceptual models is not
something to learn but something to design? In this work, we propose a
provocative idea: robustness as an architectural prior. Rather than training
models to resist perturbations, we reshape their internal structure to suppress
sensitivity from the ground up. We achieve this by enforcing orthogonal
information flow, constraining the network to norm-preserving operations -- and
further stabilizing the system through pruning and fine-tuning. The result is a
robust IQA architecture that withstands adversarial attacks without requiring
adversarial training or significant changes to the original model. This
approach suggests a shift in perspective: from optimizing robustness through
data to engineering it through design.

*Hong Gao,Yiming Bao,Xuezhan Tu,Bin Zhong,Minling Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces APVR, a training-free framework for efficient hour-long video processing using hierarchical visual information retrieval, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal models struggle with hour-long video understanding due to computational and information extraction limits.

Method: APVR employs two components: Pivot Frame Retrieval for semantic video frame selection and Pivot Token Retrieval for token-level attention-driven processing.

Result: APVR demonstrates substantial performance improvements and achieves state-of-the-art results in both training-free and training-based settings.

Conclusion: APVR overcomes memory constraints and efficiently processes prolonged video using a modular approach that integrates seamlessly with current multimodal architectures.

Abstract: Current video-based multimodal large language models struggle with hour-level
video understanding due to computational constraints and inefficient
information extraction from extensive temporal sequences. We propose APVR
(Adaptive Pivot Visual information Retrieval), a training-free framework that
addresses the memory wall limitation through hierarchical visual information
retrieval. APVR operates via two complementary components: Pivot Frame
Retrieval employs semantic expansion and multi-modal confidence scoring to
identify semantically relevant video frames, while Pivot Token Retrieval
performs query-aware attention-driven token selection within the pivot frames.
This dual granularity approach enables processing of hour-long videos while
maintaining semantic fidelity. Experimental validation on LongVideoBench and
VideoMME demonstrates significant performance improvements, establishing
state-of-the-art results for not only training-free but also training-based
approaches while providing plug-and-play integration capability with existing
MLLM architectures.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces FEAT, a Transformer-based model for synthesizing high-quality dynamic medical videos, which addresses limitations like insufficient interactions and high computational overhead, achieving superior performance on benchmarks and tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address existing challenges in synthesizing dynamic medical videos, such as modeling spatial and temporal consistency, and overcoming limitations in current Transformer-based approaches.

Method: The paper proposes FEAT, a Transformer model with (1) sequential spatial, temporal, and channel attention mechanisms, (2) linear-complexity attention methods, and (3) a residual value guidance module for fine pixel-level noise adaptation.

Result: FEAT-S achieves comparable or superior performance to state-of-the-art models like Endora with fewer parameters, while FEAT-L surpasses these models across multiple datasets.

Conclusion: FEAT demonstrates both superior effectiveness and scalability for dynamic medical video synthesis, offering advancements in computational efficiency and model performance growth.

Abstract: Synthesizing high-quality dynamic medical videos remains a significant
challenge due to the need for modeling both spatial consistency and temporal
dynamics. Existing Transformer-based approaches face critical limitations,
including insufficient channel interactions, high computational complexity from
self-attention, and coarse denoising guidance from timestep embeddings when
handling varying noise levels. In this work, we propose FEAT, a
full-dimensional efficient attention Transformer, which addresses these issues
through three key innovations: (1) a unified paradigm with sequential
spatial-temporal-channel attention mechanisms to capture global dependencies
across all dimensions, (2) a linear-complexity design for attention mechanisms
in each dimension, utilizing weighted key-value attention and global channel
attention, and (3) a residual value guidance module that provides fine-grained
pixel-level guidance to adapt to different noise levels. We evaluate FEAT on
standard benchmarks and downstream tasks, demonstrating that FEAT-S, with only
23\% of the parameters of the state-of-the-art model Endora, achieves
comparable or even superior performance. Furthermore, FEAT-L surpasses all
comparison methods across multiple datasets, showcasing both superior
effectiveness and scalability. Code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper evaluates the use of the Segment Anything Model (SAM) and DSM elevation data for automatically segmenting tree crowns in drone imagery of various forest types, presenting "BalSAM" as a promising approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the high cost, time, and labor of traditional ground measurement for forest monitoring, and leverage advancements in drone remote sensing and computer vision for broad-scale, individual tree mapping.

Method: The study compares SAM-based tree crown segmentation in boreal, temperate, and tropical forests, combining SAM with DSM elevation data, while also benchmarking it against a custom Mask R-CNN model.

Result: Out-of-the-box SAM does not outperform a custom Mask R-CNN, but the BalSAM model, which integrates SAM with DSM data and end-to-end fine-tuning, shows promise, especially for plantations.

Conclusion: Integrating DSM information and fine-tuning pre-trained models like SAM are key methods for improving tree crown segmentation. BalSAM demonstrates potential for certain forest use cases.

Abstract: Information on trees at the individual level is crucial for monitoring forest
ecosystems and planning forest management. Current monitoring methods involve
ground measurements, requiring extensive cost, time and labor. Advances in
drone remote sensing and computer vision offer great potential for mapping
individual trees from aerial imagery at broad-scale. Large pre-trained vision
models, such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM), represent a particularly
compelling choice given limited labeled data. In this work, we compare methods
leveraging SAM for the task of automatic tree crown instance segmentation in
high resolution drone imagery in three use cases: 1) boreal plantations, 2)
temperate forests and 3) tropical forests. We also study the integration of
elevation data into models, in the form of Digital Surface Model (DSM)
information, which can readily be obtained at no additional cost from RGB drone
imagery. We present BalSAM, a model leveraging SAM and DSM information, which
shows potential over other methods, particularly in the context of plantations.
We find that methods using SAM out-of-the-box do not outperform a custom Mask
R-CNN, even with well-designed prompts. However, efficiently tuning SAM
end-to-end and integrating DSM information are both promising avenues for tree
crown instance segmentation models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces TextVidBench, a benchmark for evaluating long-video text question answering. It provides extensive long-video coverage, a three-stage evaluation framework, fine-grained annotations, and proposes methods to enhance large multimodal models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for Text-Visual Question Answering cannot adequately evaluate the capabilities of multimodal large language models on long videos, leading to limited understanding of their potential.

Method: The paper introduces TextVidBench, comprising long-video evaluation across key domains, a new three-stage evaluation framework, and semantic annotations. Additionally, it proposes mechanisms like IT-Rope and temporal engineering to enhance models.

Result: TextVidBench contains 5,000 question-answer pairs and spans 9 video domains with length averaging 2306 seconds, showing challenges to existing multimodal models. Proposed methods yield better long-video text understanding.

Conclusion: TextVidBench fills the evaluation gap for long-video understanding and enhances model capabilities with innovative approaches, offering a robust benchmark for future improvements in multimodal language models.

Abstract: Despite recent progress on the short-video Text-Visual Question Answering
(ViteVQA) task - largely driven by benchmarks such as M4-ViteVQA - existing
datasets still suffer from limited video duration and narrow evaluation scopes,
making it difficult to adequately assess the growing capabilities of powerful
multimodal large language models (MLLMs). To address these limitations, we
introduce TextVidBench, the first benchmark specifically designed for
long-video text question answering (>3 minutes). TextVidBench makes three key
contributions: 1) Cross-domain long-video coverage: Spanning 9 categories
(e.g., news, sports, gaming), with an average video length of 2306 seconds,
enabling more realistic evaluation of long-video understanding. 2) A
three-stage evaluation framework: "Text Needle-in-Haystack -> Temporal
Grounding -> Text Dynamics Captioning". 3) High-quality fine-grained
annotations: Containing over 5,000 question-answer pairs with detailed semantic
labeling. Furthermore, we propose an efficient paradigm for improving large
models through: (i) introducing the IT-Rope mechanism and temporal prompt
engineering to enhance temporal perception, (ii) adopting non-uniform
positional encoding to better handle long video sequences, and (iii) applying
lightweight fine-tuning on video-text data. Extensive experiments on multiple
public datasets as well as TextVidBench demonstrate that our new benchmark
presents significant challenges to existing models, while our proposed method
offers valuable insights into improving long-video scene text understanding
capabilities.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses Image Super Resolution (ISR) by improving Visual Auto-Regressive (VAR) modeling, introducing a hierarchical image tokenization approach and direct preference optimization, achieving state-of-the-art results with a smaller model and no external training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the capabilities of Visual Auto-Regressive (VAR) modeling for ISR by overcoming limitations like fixed resolution outputs and reliance on large, private datasets.

Method: The authors propose two innovations: a hierarchical multi-scale image tokenization to represent images at varying scales and ensure overlap, and a direct preference optimization (DPO) regularization term to train semantic consistency across scales.

Result: The model outperforms state-of-the-art ISR methods with a smaller model size (300M parameters vs. 1B in VARSR) and achieves this without using external training datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed VAR-based approach improves efficiency, flexibility, and performance in ISR tasks by enabling multi-scale super-resolution and addressing existing limitations in prior methods.

Abstract: In this paper we tackle Image Super Resolution (ISR), using recent advances
in Visual Auto-Regressive (VAR) modeling. VAR iteratively estimates the
residual in latent space between gradually increasing image scales, a process
referred to as next-scale prediction. Thus, the strong priors learned during
pre-training align well with the downstream task (ISR). To our knowledge, only
VARSR has exploited this synergy so far, showing promising results. However,
due to the limitations of existing residual quantizers, VARSR works only at a
fixed resolution, i.e. it fails to map intermediate outputs to the
corresponding image scales. Additionally, it relies on a 1B transformer
architecture (VAR-d24), and leverages a large-scale private dataset to achieve
state-of-the-art results. We address these limitations through two novel
components: a) a Hierarchical Image Tokenization approach with a multi-scale
image tokenizer that progressively represents images at different scales while
simultaneously enforcing token overlap across scales, and b) a Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO) regularization term that, relying solely on the
LR and HR tokenizations, encourages the transformer to produce the latter over
the former. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time a quantizer is
trained to force semantically consistent residuals at different scales, and the
first time that preference-based optimization is used to train a VAR. Using
these two components, our model can denoise the LR image and super-resolve at
half and full target upscale factors in a single forward pass. Additionally, we
achieve \textit{state-of-the-art results on ISR}, while using a small model
(300M params vs ~1B params of VARSR), and without using external training data.

*Edoardo Bianchi,Antonio Liotta*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel video sampling method called Proficiency-Aware Temporal Sampling (PATS) that adapts to preserve key movement patterns to improve skill assessments in sports.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video sampling disrupts the temporal continuity of movements, which is essential for assessing proficiency in sports and other skills.

Method: The proposed approach, PATS, adaptively segments videos to preserve complete fundamental movements in temporally continuous portions for multi-view skill evaluation while maximizing coverage.

Result: PATS achieves state-of-the-art accuracy improvements on the EgoExo4D benchmark for multiple sports and skill domains, with gains ranging from +0.65% to +26.22%, depending on the activity.

Conclusion: PATS offers an effective, adaptive framework for temporal video sampling, advancing automated skill assessment across various dynamic and sequential activities.

Abstract: Automated sports skill assessment requires capturing fundamental movement
patterns that distinguish expert from novice performance, yet current video
sampling methods disrupt the temporal continuity essential for proficiency
evaluation. To this end, we introduce Proficiency-Aware Temporal Sampling
(PATS), a novel sampling strategy that preserves complete fundamental movements
within continuous temporal segments for multi-view skill assessment. PATS
adaptively segments videos to ensure each analyzed portion contains full
execution of critical performance components, repeating this process across
multiple segments to maximize information coverage while maintaining temporal
coherence. Evaluated on the EgoExo4D benchmark with SkillFormer, PATS surpasses
the state-of-the-art accuracy across all viewing configurations (+0.65% to
+3.05%) and delivers substantial gains in challenging domains (+26.22%
bouldering, +2.39% music, +1.13% basketball). Systematic analysis reveals that
PATS successfully adapts to diverse activity characteristics-from
high-frequency sampling for dynamic sports to fine-grained segmentation for
sequential skills-demonstrating its effectiveness as an adaptive approach to
temporal sampling that advances automated skill assessment for real-world
applications.

*Gengluo Li,Huawen Shen,Yu Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new benchmark, DL-CSVTR, and proposes a model, CSTR-CLIP, to improve Chinese scene text retrieval, achieving 18.82% better accuracy than previous models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the inadequacy of existing methods, which are adapted from English scene text retrieval and fail to handle the complex and diverse layouts of Chinese text.

Method: They establish a new benchmark, DL-CSVTR, and propose a two-stage training model called CSTR-CLIP that focuses on integrating global visual info with multi-granularity alignment training.

Result: CSTR-CLIP surpasses the previous state-of-the-art model by 18.82% and enables faster inference speeds while handling diverse text layouts effectively.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that CSTR-CLIP excels in Chinese scene text retrieval across various layouts, promoting further research by publicly sharing the dataset and code.

Abstract: Chinese scene text retrieval is a practical task that aims to search for
images containing visual instances of a Chinese query text. This task is
extremely challenging because Chinese text often features complex and diverse
layouts in real-world scenes. Current efforts tend to inherit the solution for
English scene text retrieval, failing to achieve satisfactory performance. In
this paper, we establish a Diversified Layout benchmark for Chinese Street View
Text Retrieval (DL-CSVTR), which is specifically designed to evaluate retrieval
performance across various text layouts, including vertical, cross-line, and
partial alignments. To address the limitations in existing methods, we propose
Chinese Scene Text Retrieval CLIP (CSTR-CLIP), a novel model that integrates
global visual information with multi-granularity alignment training. CSTR-CLIP
applies a two-stage training process to overcome previous limitations, such as
the exclusion of visual features outside the text region and reliance on
single-granularity alignment, thereby enabling the model to effectively handle
diverse text layouts. Experiments on existing benchmark show that CSTR-CLIP
outperforms the previous state-of-the-art model by 18.82% accuracy and also
provides faster inference speed. Further analysis on DL-CSVTR confirms the
superior performance of CSTR-CLIP in handling various text layouts. The dataset
and code will be publicly available to facilitate research in Chinese scene
text retrieval.

*Fuyi Zhang,Zhu Yu,Chunhao Li,Runmin Zhang,Xiaokai Bai,Zili Zhou,Si-Yuan Cao,Wang Wang,Hui-Liang Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper explores advancements in monocular depth estimation, focusing on addressing domain generalization challenges and leveraging affine-invariant loss for better structural detail extraction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the limitation of generalizing monocular depth estimation models to unseen domains and improve depth prediction accuracy.

Method: The research builds on prior advancements like multi-scale fusion networks, classification reinterpretation, and multi-dataset joint training using affine-invariant loss. It also references leading methods like Depth Anything to highlight structural information extraction.

Result: The paper indicates that Depth Anything demonstrates strong performance in zero-shot monocular depth estimation, successfully capturing structural details even without explicit depth cues.

Conclusion: While the model improves structural depth estimation, achieving accurate metric depth remains a challenge, indicating room for further innovation in the field.

Abstract: Monocular depth estimation aims to determine the depth of each pixel from an
RGB image captured by a monocular camera. The development of deep learning has
significantly advanced this field by facilitating the learning of depth
features from some well-annotated datasets
\cite{Geiger_Lenz_Stiller_Urtasun_2013,silberman2012indoor}. Eigen \textit{et
al.} \cite{eigen2014depth} first introduce a multi-scale fusion network for
depth regression. Following this, subsequent improvements have come from
reinterpreting the regression task as a classification problem
\cite{bhat2021adabins,Li_Wang_Liu_Jiang_2022}, incorporating additional priors
\cite{shao2023nddepth,yang2023gedepth}, and developing more effective objective
function \cite{xian2020structure,Yin_Liu_Shen_Yan_2019}. Despite these
advances, generalizing to unseen domains remains a challenge. Recently, several
methods have employed affine-invariant loss to enable multi-dataset joint
training \cite{MiDaS,ZeroDepth,guizilini2023towards,Dany}. Among them, Depth
Anything \cite{Dany} has shown leading performance in zero-shot monocular depth
estimation. While it struggles to estimate accurate metric depth due to the
lack of explicit depth cues, it excels at extracting structural information
from unseen images, producing structure-detailed monocular depth.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a pipeline for generating synthetic point cloud datasets for 3D point cloud segmentation using simulated agricultural vehicle models and evaluates their impact on various segmentation models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world 3D point cloud data collection and annotation are expensive and time-consuming, motivating the need for realistic synthetic alternatives.

Method: The authors use 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) and Gaussian Opacity Fields (GOF) to create realistic 3D models of agricultural vehicles, embed them in simulated environments, and generate point clouds using virtual LiDAR sensors.

Result: The pipeline achieved high segmentation accuracy with a PTv3 model yielding an mIoU of 91.35% solely trained on synthetic data. Synthetic datasets occasionally outperformed real-world data in segmentation tasks.

Conclusion: The synthetic pipeline effectively aids model training, demonstrating strong generalization across semantic classes and eliminating dependence on real-world data.

Abstract: Training neural networks for tasks such as 3D point cloud semantic
segmentation demands extensive datasets, yet obtaining and annotating
real-world point clouds is costly and labor-intensive. This work aims to
introduce a novel pipeline for generating realistic synthetic data, by
leveraging 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) and Gaussian Opacity Fields (GOF) to
generate 3D assets of multiple different agricultural vehicles instead of using
generic models. These assets are placed in a simulated environment, where the
point clouds are generated using a simulated LiDAR. This is a flexible approach
that allows changing the LiDAR specifications without incurring additional
costs. We evaluated the impact of synthetic data on segmentation models such as
PointNet++, Point Transformer V3, and OACNN, by training and validating the
models only on synthetic data. Remarkably, the PTv3 model had an mIoU of
91.35\%, a noteworthy result given that the model had neither been trained nor
validated on any real data. Further studies even suggested that in certain
scenarios the models trained only on synthetically generated data performed
better than models trained on real-world data. Finally, experiments
demonstrated that the models can generalize across semantic classes, enabling
accurate predictions on mesh models they were never trained on.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces UAV4D for photorealistic rendering of UAV-captured dynamic scenes with multiple moving pedestrians using monocular video, overcoming challenges like scene scale ambiguity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address challenges in UAV-captured scenes, such as monocular video setups, top-down perspectives, and multiple small dynamic human subjects, which are inadequately represented in existing datasets.

Method: UAV4D combines a 3D foundation model and a human mesh reconstruction model to reconstruct both scene backgrounds and humans. It resolves scene scale ambiguities using human-scene contact points and initializes Gaussian splats for holistic rendering.

Result: UAV4D shows measurable improvement on VisDrone, Manipal-UAV, and Okutama-Action datasets, achieving a 1.5 dB PSNR gain and better visual sharpness compared to other methods.

Conclusion: UAV4D effectively addresses the challenges in dynamic scene reconstruction for UAV-captured videos, outperforming existing methods in photorealistic rendering and novel view synthesis.

Abstract: Despite significant advancements in dynamic neural rendering, existing
methods fail to address the unique challenges posed by UAV-captured scenarios,
particularly those involving monocular camera setups, top-down perspective, and
multiple small, moving humans, which are not adequately represented in existing
datasets. In this work, we introduce UAV4D, a framework for enabling
photorealistic rendering for dynamic real-world scenes captured by UAVs.
Specifically, we address the challenge of reconstructing dynamic scenes with
multiple moving pedestrians from monocular video data without the need for
additional sensors. We use a combination of a 3D foundation model and a human
mesh reconstruction model to reconstruct both the scene background and humans.
We propose a novel approach to resolve the scene scale ambiguity and place both
humans and the scene in world coordinates by identifying human-scene contact
points. Additionally, we exploit the SMPL model and background mesh to
initialize Gaussian splats, enabling holistic scene rendering. We evaluated our
method on three complex UAV-captured datasets: VisDrone, Manipal-UAV, and
Okutama-Action, each with distinct characteristics and 10~50 humans. Our
results demonstrate the benefits of our approach over existing methods in novel
view synthesis, achieving a 1.5 dB PSNR improvement and superior visual
sharpness.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel physical annotation system for generating ML training data using pointer-based in-situ interaction and projector-based guidance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional screen-based annotation methods are inefficient and less intuitive for annotating objects, prompting the need for a system that directly captures physical trajectories and human expertise.

Method: The system employs calibrated, tracked pointers to directly record user interactions on objects, transforming them into standardized annotation formats compatible with open-source software like CVAT. A projector-based interface provides visual guidance.

Result: Preliminary evaluations confirm the system's feasibility for capturing detailed annotations and successfully integrating with CVAT to streamline ML training workflows.

Conclusion: The system bridges human expertise and ML data generation, enabling non-IT experts to contribute efficiently. It shows promise for enhancing future automated optical inspection pipelines.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel physical annotation system designed to generate
training data for automated optical inspection. The system uses pointer-based
in-situ interaction to transfer the valuable expertise of trained inspection
personnel directly into a machine learning (ML) training pipeline. Unlike
conventional screen-based annotation methods, our system captures physical
trajectories and contours directly on the object, providing a more intuitive
and efficient way to label data. The core technology uses calibrated, tracked
pointers to accurately record user input and transform these spatial
interactions into standardised annotation formats that are compatible with
open-source annotation software. Additionally, a simple projector-based
interface projects visual guidance onto the object to assist users during the
annotation process, ensuring greater accuracy and consistency. The proposed
concept bridges the gap between human expertise and automated data generation,
enabling non-IT experts to contribute to the ML training pipeline and
preventing the loss of valuable training samples. Preliminary evaluation
results confirm the feasibility of capturing detailed annotation trajectories
and demonstrate that integration with CVAT streamlines the workflow for
subsequent ML tasks. This paper details the system architecture, calibration
procedures and interface design, and discusses its potential contribution to
future ML data generation for automated optical inspection.

*Guangzhao Li,Yanming Yang,Chenxi Song,Chi Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FlowDirector is a novel framework for text-driven video editing that avoids typical inversion-related issues and achieves superior editing quality and consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text-driven video editing methods often lead to issues like temporal inconsistency and loss of structural fidelity due to reliance on inversion-based techniques.

Method: FlowDirector introduces an inversion-free editing process modeled as an Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) on the video’s spatiotemporal manifold, combined with an attention-guided masking mechanism and a guidance-enhanced editing strategy inspired by Classifier-Free Guidance.

Result: FlowDirector demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in instruction adherence, temporal consistency, and preservation of background details across benchmarks.

Conclusion: FlowDirector offers a paradigm-shifting method for efficient and coherent video editing, successfully mitigating the limitations of inversion-based approaches while ensuring high-quality editing results.

Abstract: Text-driven video editing aims to modify video content according to natural
language instructions. While recent training-free approaches have made progress
by leveraging pre-trained diffusion models, they typically rely on
inversion-based techniques that map input videos into the latent space, which
often leads to temporal inconsistencies and degraded structural fidelity. To
address this, we propose FlowDirector, a novel inversion-free video editing
framework. Our framework models the editing process as a direct evolution in
data space, guiding the video via an Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) to
smoothly transition along its inherent spatiotemporal manifold, thereby
preserving temporal coherence and structural details. To achieve localized and
controllable edits, we introduce an attention-guided masking mechanism that
modulates the ODE velocity field, preserving non-target regions both spatially
and temporally. Furthermore, to address incomplete edits and enhance semantic
alignment with editing instructions, we present a guidance-enhanced editing
strategy inspired by Classifier-Free Guidance, which leverages differential
signals between multiple candidate flows to steer the editing trajectory toward
stronger semantic alignment without compromising structural consistency.
Extensive experiments across benchmarks demonstrate that FlowDirector achieves
state-of-the-art performance in instruction adherence, temporal consistency,
and background preservation, establishing a new paradigm for efficient and
coherent video editing without inversion.

Abstract: Vietnamese document analysis and recognition (DAR) is a crucial field with
applications in digitization, information retrieval, and automation. Despite
advancements in OCR and NLP, Vietnamese text recognition faces unique
challenges due to its complex diacritics, tonal variations, and lack of
large-scale annotated datasets. Traditional OCR methods often struggle with
real-world document variations, while deep learning approaches have shown
promise but remain limited by data scarcity and generalization issues.
Recently, large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models have
demonstrated remarkable improvements in text recognition and document
understanding, offering a new direction for Vietnamese DAR. However, challenges
such as domain adaptation, multimodal learning, and computational efficiency
persist. This survey provide a comprehensive review of existing techniques in
Vietnamese document recognition, highlights key limitations, and explores how
LLMs can revolutionize the field. We discuss future research directions,
including dataset development, model optimization, and the integration of
multimodal approaches for improved document intelligence. By addressing these
gaps, we aim to foster advancements in Vietnamese DAR and encourage
community-driven solutions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to improve real image editing, specifically focusing on enhancing edit instruction adherence and preserving original image content effectively.

Method: The paper introduces a meta-info paradigm and embedding strategy for efficient data mixing, connects visual language models (VLM) with diffusion models, and implements joint learning of diffusion and reward losses.

Result: SeedEdit 3.0 demonstrates superior performance on benchmarks with a usability rate of 56.1%, outperforming the previous version and competitors like GPT4o and Gemini 2.0.

Conclusion: With innovations in data curation, embedding strategies, and joint learning pipelines, SeedEdit 3.0 significantly advances image editing capabilities and usability.

Abstract: We introduce SeedEdit 3.0, in companion with our T2I model Seedream 3.0 [22],
which significantly improves over our previous version [27] in both aspects of
edit instruction following and image content (e.g., ID/IP) preservation on real
image inputs. Additional to model upgrading with T2I, in this report, we
present several key improvements. First, we develop an enhanced data curation
pipeline with a meta-info paradigm and meta-info embedding strategy that help
mix images from multiple data sources. This allows us to scale editing data
effectively, and meta information is helpfult to connect VLM with diffusion
model more closely. Second, we introduce a joint learning pipeline for
computing a diffusion loss and a reward loss. Finally, we evaluate SeedEdit 3.0
on our testing benchmarks, for real image editing, where it achieves a best
trade-off between multiple aspects, yielding a high usability rate of 56.1%,
compared to SeedEdit 1.6 (38.4%), GPT4o (37.1%) and Gemini 2.0 (30.3%).

*HaoTian Lan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a Multimodal Street Evaluation Framework (MSEF) combining AI models to assess streetscapes based on both objective metrics and subjective perceptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current urban analytical tools lack the ability to capture subjective perceptions critical for inclusive urban design.

Method: The paper developed the MSEF framework by integrating VisualGLM-6B and GPT-4, leveraging over 15,000 annotated street-view images and fine-tuning with LoRA and P-Tuning v2.

Result: MSEF achieved high assessment accuracy: an F1 score of 0.84 for objective features and 89.3% agreement with resident perceptions.

Conclusion: MSEF bridges sensory data with socio-affective inference, offering innovation in urban perception modeling and practical planning tools that align infrastructure with lived experience.

Abstract: While objective street metrics derived from imagery or GIS have become
standard in urban analytics, they remain insufficient to capture subjective
perceptions essential to inclusive urban design. This study introduces a novel
Multimodal Street Evaluation Framework (MSEF) that fuses a vision transformer
(VisualGLM-6B) with a large language model (GPT-4), enabling interpretable
dual-output assessment of streetscapes. Leveraging over 15,000 annotated
street-view images from Harbin, China, we fine-tune the framework using LoRA
and P-Tuning v2 for parameter-efficient adaptation. The model achieves an F1
score of 0.84 on objective features and 89.3 percent agreement with aggregated
resident perceptions, validated across stratified socioeconomic geographies.
Beyond classification accuracy, MSEF captures context-dependent contradictions:
for instance, informal commerce boosts perceived vibrancy while simultaneously
reducing pedestrian comfort. It also identifies nonlinear and semantically
contingent patterns -- such as the divergent perceptual effects of
architectural transparency across residential and commercial zones -- revealing
the limits of universal spatial heuristics. By generating natural-language
rationales grounded in attention mechanisms, the framework bridges sensory data
with socio-affective inference, enabling transparent diagnostics aligned with
SDG 11. This work offers both methodological innovation in urban perception
modeling and practical utility for planning systems seeking to reconcile
infrastructural precision with lived experience.

*Haosong Liu,Yuge Cheng,Zihan Liu,Aiyue Chen,Yiwu Yao,Chen Chen,Jingwen Leng,Yu Feng,Minyi Guo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents ASTRAEA, a framework that optimizes text-to-video generation in vDiTs by speeding up inference while preserving video quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High computational demands of video diffusion transformers make them impractical for widespread use, necessitating a more efficient method.

Method: ASTRAEA employs a token selection mechanism, sparse attention strategy, and an evolutionary algorithm for efficient token budget allocation to enhance inference speed.

Result: ASTRAEA achieves up to 2.4x speedup on a single GPU (13.2x on 8 GPUs) with minimal video quality loss (<0.5% on VBench score).

Conclusion: ASTRAEA balances efficiency and quality in text-to-video generation, proving scalable and effective for practical usage.

Abstract: Video diffusion transformers (vDiTs) have made impressive progress in
text-to-video generation, but their high computational demands present major
challenges for practical deployment. While existing acceleration methods reduce
workload at various granularities, they often rely on heuristics, limiting
their applicability.
  We introduce ASTRAEA, an automatic framework that searches for near-optimal
configurations for vDiT-based video generation. At its core, ASTRAEA proposes a
lightweight token selection mechanism and a memory-efficient, GPU-parallel
sparse attention strategy, enabling linear reductions in execution time with
minimal impact on generation quality. To determine optimal token reduction for
different timesteps, we further design a search framework that leverages a
classic evolutionary algorithm to automatically determine the distribution of
the token budget effectively. Together, ASTRAEA achieves up to 2.4x inference
speedup on a single GPU with great scalability (up to 13.2x speedup on 8 GPUs)
while retaining better video quality compared to the state-of-the-art methods
(<0.5% loss on the VBench score compared to the baseline vDiT models).

### [213] [DIMCIM: A Quantitative Evaluation Framework for Default-mode Diversity and Generalization in Text-to-Image Generative Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05108)
*Revant Teotia,Candace Ross,Karen Ullrich,Sumit Chopra,Adriana Romero-Soriano,Melissa Hall,Matthew J. Muckley*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces DIM-CIM, a framework and benchmark (COCO-DIMCIM) to evaluate the diversity and generalization of text-to-image (T2I) models, enabling better interpretability and adaptability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-to-image models lack diversity in representation, and existing evaluation methods are limited as they require reference datasets or lack specificity in measuring diversity.

Method: The authors propose DIM-CIM, a reference-free framework consisting of two metrics: 'Does-it' for default-mode diversity (checking if models generate images with expected attributes) and 'Can-it' for generalization capacity (checking if models can generate diverse attributes for a concept). They seeded COCO-DIMCIM with COCO concepts and captions, augmented through a large language model.

Result: Findings include that larger T2I models improve generalization while sacrificing default-mode diversity. DIM-CIM highlights specific failure cases like under-delivering attributes when explicitly requested. A correlation of 0.85 was observed between the diversity in training images and the model's default-mode diversity.

Conclusion: DIM-CIM offers a flexible, interpretable way to understand T2I model diversity and generalization capabilities, addressing gaps in current evaluation metrics and providing deeper insights into model performance.

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-image (T2I) models have achieved impressive
quality and consistency. However, this has come at the cost of representation
diversity. While automatic evaluation methods exist for benchmarking model
diversity, they either require reference image datasets or lack specificity
about the kind of diversity measured, limiting their adaptability and
interpretability. To address this gap, we introduce the Does-it/Can-it
framework, DIM-CIM, a reference-free measurement of default-mode diversity
("Does" the model generate images with expected attributes?) and generalization
capacity ("Can" the model generate diverse attributes for a particular
concept?). We construct the COCO-DIMCIM benchmark, which is seeded with COCO
concepts and captions and augmented by a large language model. With
COCO-DIMCIM, we find that widely-used models improve in generalization at the
cost of default-mode diversity when scaling from 1.5B to 8.1B parameters.
DIMCIM also identifies fine-grained failure cases, such as attributes that are
generated with generic prompts but are rarely generated when explicitly
requested. Finally, we use DIMCIM to evaluate the training data of a T2I model
and observe a correlation of 0.85 between diversity in training images and
default-mode diversity. Our work provides a flexible and interpretable
framework for assessing T2I model diversity and generalization, enabling a more
comprehensive understanding of model performance.

*Benedikt Hopf,Radu Timofte*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a Practical Manipulation Model (PMM) to enhance the robustness of deepfake detection under non-ideal conditions, achieving notable performance improvements on benchmark datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the instability and circumvention issues in current deepfake detection models, particularly under non-ideal conditions and real-world degradations.

Method: The researchers developed PMM, which expands the diversity of training data by incorporating Poisson blending, varied masks, generator artifacts, and distractors. They also introduced strong degradations to training images to improve robustness and generality.

Result: The proposed method demonstrated significant improvements in detection robustness against degradations and showed AUC increases of 3.51% on DFDC and 6.21% on DFDCP datasets over the state-of-the-art LAA backbone.

Conclusion: The PMM model successfully improves the robustness and generality of deepfake detectors, making them more effective for real-world applications and highlighting shortcomings in prior approaches.

Abstract: Modern deepfake detection models have achieved strong performance even on the
challenging cross-dataset task. However, detection performance under non-ideal
conditions remains very unstable, limiting success on some benchmark datasets
and making it easy to circumvent detection. Inspired by the move to a more
real-world degradation model in the area of image super-resolution, we have
developed a Practical Manipulation Model (PMM) that covers a larger set of
possible forgeries. We extend the space of pseudo-fakes by using Poisson
blending, more diverse masks, generator artifacts, and distractors.
Additionally, we improve the detectors' generality and robustness by adding
strong degradations to the training images. We demonstrate that these changes
not only significantly enhance the model's robustness to common image
degradations but also improve performance on standard benchmark datasets.
Specifically, we show clear increases of $3.51\%$ and $6.21\%$ AUC on the DFDC
and DFDCP datasets, respectively, over the s-o-t-a LAA backbone. Furthermore,
we highlight the lack of robustness in previous detectors and our improvements
in this regard. Code can be found at https://github.com/BenediktHopf/PMM

TL;DR: This study introduces CIVET, a framework for systematically evaluating Vision-Language Models' (VLMs) understanding of object properties and relationships, exposing their limitations and comparing them to human performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore and address the gaps in Vision-Language Models' (VLMs) understanding of object properties and relationships within scenes, as existing benchmarks do not sufficiently assess these capabilities in a systematic way.

Method: The study introduces CIVET, a controlled and extensible framework specifically designed to evaluate VLMs' understanding through statistically rigorous and bias-free stimuli.

Result: The results show that VLMs have limited capability in recognizing basic object properties, their performance depends on object positioning, and they struggle to comprehend basic object relationships. They are still far from achieving human-level performance.

Conclusion: VLMs require significant improvements to accurately understand and represent the structure and semantics of scenes, as evidenced by their performance on the CIVET evaluations.

Abstract: While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved competitive performance in
various tasks, their comprehension of the underlying structure and semantics of
a scene remains understudied. To investigate the understanding of VLMs, we
study their capability regarding object properties and relations in a
controlled and interpretable manner. To this scope, we introduce CIVET, a novel
and extensible framework for systematiC evaluatIon Via controllEd sTimuli.
CIVET addresses the lack of standardized systematic evaluation for assessing
VLMs' understanding, enabling researchers to test hypotheses with statistical
rigor. With CIVET, we evaluate five state-of-the-art VLMs on exhaustive sets of
stimuli, free from annotation noise, dataset-specific biases, and uncontrolled
scene complexity. Our findings reveal that 1) current VLMs can accurately
recognize only a limited set of basic object properties; 2) their performance
heavily depends on the position of the object in the scene; 3) they struggle to
understand basic relations among objects. Furthermore, a comparative evaluation
with human annotators reveals that VLMs still fall short of achieving
human-level accuracy.

Method: The authors developed FRED with over 7 hours of annotated drone data using 5 drone models, incorporating challenging conditions like rain and adverse lighting.

Result: FRED provides reproducible evaluation protocols, detailed metrics, and addresses drone-specific motion patterns with multimodal data.

Conclusion: FRED aims to enhance research in high-speed drone detection and multimodal spatiotemporal understanding.

Abstract: Small, fast, and lightweight drones present significant challenges for
traditional RGB cameras due to their limitations in capturing fast-moving

an ideal solution, providing high temporal definition and dynamic range, yet
existing benchmarks often lack fine temporal resolution or drone-specific
motion patterns, hindering progress in these areas. This paper introduces the
Florence RGB-Event Drone dataset (FRED), a novel multimodal dataset
specifically designed for drone detection, tracking, and trajectory
forecasting, combining RGB video and event streams. FRED features more than 7
hours of densely annotated drone trajectories, using 5 different drone models
and including challenging scenarios such as rain and adverse lighting
conditions. We provide detailed evaluation protocols and standard metrics for
each task, facilitating reproducible benchmarking. The authors hope FRED will
advance research in high-speed drone perception and multimodal spatiotemporal
understanding.

Motivation: The author believes that recent focus on training through neural networks for TWR HAR lacks physical interpretability and overlooks traditional methods rooted in theoretical signal processing.

Method: The proposed method involves generating range-time and Doppler-time maps, segmenting features using corner detection and active contour modeling, discretizing them into point clouds, and using the Mapper algorithm to calculate topological similarity for activity recognition.

Result: The method's effectiveness is validated through numerical simulations and experimental data, showing comparable performance to neural network models.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates that intelligent TWR HAR can be achieved without neural networks, offering strong physical interpretability through traditional signal analysis methods.

Abstract: After a few years of research in the field of through-the-wall radar (TWR)
human activity recognition (HAR), I found that we seem to be stuck in the
mindset of training on radar image data through neural network models. The
earliest related works in this field based on template matching did not require
a training process, and I believe they have never died. Because these methods
possess a strong physical interpretability and are closer to the basis of
theoretical signal processing research. In this paper, I would like to try to
return to the original path by attempting to eschew neural networks to achieve
the TWR HAR task and challenge to achieve intelligent recognition as neural
network models. In detail, the range-time map and Doppler-time map of TWR are
first generated. Then, the initial regions of the human target foreground and
noise background on the maps are determined using corner detection method, and
the micro-Doppler signature is segmented using the multiphase active contour
model. The micro-Doppler segmentation feature is discretized into a
two-dimensional point cloud. Finally, the topological similarity between the
resulting point cloud and the point clouds of the template data is calculated
using Mapper algorithm to obtain the recognition results. The effectiveness of
the proposed method is demonstrated by numerical simulated and measured
experiments. The open-source code of this work is released at:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces TAO, a framework that enhances video anomaly detection by focusing on pixel-level tracking of anomalies, improving precision without threshold tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods in Video Anomaly Detection lack fine-grained analysis like pixel-level tracking, limiting their ability to detect a wider range of anomalies.

Method: The TAO framework integrates detection, segmentation, and tracking to localize fine-grained anomalous objects in videos. It avoids threshold tuning by linking anomaly scores to downstream tasks.

Result: Experiments show that TAO achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and robustness for video anomaly detection over extended, complex sequences.

Conclusion: TAO offers a more granular, efficient, and precise method for detecting video anomalies, setting new benchmarks in the field.

Abstract: Video anomaly detection (VAD) is crucial in scenarios such as surveillance
and autonomous driving, where timely detection of unexpected activities is
essential. Although existing methods have primarily focused on detecting
anomalous objects in videos -- either by identifying anomalous frames or
objects -- they often neglect finer-grained analysis, such as anomalous pixels,
which limits their ability to capture a broader range of anomalies. To address
this challenge, we propose a new framework called Track Any Anomalous Object
(TAO), which introduces a granular video anomaly detection pipeline that, for
the first time, integrates the detection of multiple fine-grained anomalous
objects into a unified framework. Unlike methods that assign anomaly scores to
every pixel, our approach transforms the problem into pixel-level tracking of
anomalous objects. By linking anomaly scores to downstream tasks such as
segmentation and tracking, our method removes the need for threshold tuning and
achieves more precise anomaly localization in long and complex video sequences.
Experiments demonstrate that TAO sets new benchmarks in accuracy and
robustness. Project page available online.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces TAPFM, a novel adaptation technique for pathology foundation models using single-GPU processing for clinical tasks like mutation prediction in whole slide images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pretrained pathology foundation models are powerful but challenging to adapt for specific clinical tasks due to weak WSI-level labels and gigapixel image sizes.

Method: TAPFM leverages vision transformer attention for multiple instance learning, optimizing feature representations and attention weights, and separates computational graphs for stability in training dynamics.

Result: TAPFM outperforms conventional methods in mutation prediction for bladder cancer and lung adenocarcinoma, demonstrating effective multi-label classification.

Conclusion: TAPFM facilitates practical adaptation of pretrained models to standard hardware, improving clinical applicability in pathology image analysis.

Abstract: Pathology foundation models (PFMs) have emerged as powerful tools for
analyzing whole slide images (WSIs). However, adapting these pretrained PFMs
for specific clinical tasks presents considerable challenges, primarily due to
the availability of only weak (WSI-level) labels for gigapixel images,
necessitating multiple instance learning (MIL) paradigm for effective WSI
analysis. This paper proposes a novel approach for single-GPU \textbf{T}ask
\textbf{A}daptation of \textbf{PFM}s (TAPFM) that uses vision transformer
(\vit) attention for MIL aggregation while optimizing both for feature
representations and attention weights. The proposed approach maintains separate
computational graphs for MIL aggregator and the PFM to create stable training
dynamics that align with downstream task objectives during end-to-end
adaptation. Evaluated on mutation prediction tasks for bladder cancer and lung
adenocarcinoma across institutional and TCGA cohorts, TAPFM consistently
outperforms conventional approaches, with H-Optimus-0 (TAPFM) outperforming the
benchmarks. TAPFM effectively handles multi-label classification of actionable
mutations as well. Thus, TAPFM makes adaptation of powerful pre-trained PFMs
practical on standard hardware for various clinical applications.

### [220] [MokA: Multimodal Low-Rank Adaptation for MLLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05191)
*Yake Wei,Yu Miao,Dongzhan Zhou,Di Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MokA, a multimodal-aware fine-tuning strategy for multimodal large language models (MLLMs) that includes unimodal and cross-modal adaptations, improving efficiency across various multimodal contexts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current fine-tuning methods for multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are largely adapted from those of large language models (LLMs), ignoring multimodal-specific challenges and leading to suboptimal utilization of all modalities.

Method: The MokA approach combines unimodal adaptation with cross-modal adaptation by designing modality-specific parameters to compress unimodal information and explicitly fostering cross-modal interaction.

Result: Experiments on multimodal scenarios (audio-visual-text, visual-text, and speech-text) with various LLM backbones consistently show improved performance across tasks.

Conclusion: MokA is a multimodal-aware solution that addresses specific characteristics of multimodal adaptation, proving effective and efficient in fine-tuning MLLMs while paving the way for further advancements.

Abstract: In this paper, we reveal that most current efficient multimodal fine-tuning
methods are hindered by a key limitation: they are directly borrowed from LLMs,
often neglecting the intrinsic differences of multimodal scenarios and even
affecting the full utilization of all modalities. Inspired by our empirical
observation, we argue that unimodal adaptation and cross-modal adaptation are
two essential parts for the effective fine-tuning of MLLMs. From this
perspective, we propose Multimodal low-rank Adaptation (MokA), a
multimodal-aware efficient fine-tuning strategy that takes multimodal
characteristics into consideration. It compresses unimodal information by
modality-specific parameters while explicitly enhancing cross-modal
interaction, ensuring both unimodal and cross-modal adaptation. Extensive
experiments cover three representative multimodal scenarios (audio-visual-text,
visual-text, and speech-text), and multiple LLM backbones (LLaMA2/3, Qwen2,
Qwen2.5-VL, etc). Consistent improvements indicate the efficacy and versatility
of the proposed method. Ablation studies and efficiency evaluation are also
conducted to fully asses our method. Overall, we think MokA provides a more
targeted solution for efficient adaptation of MLLMs, paving the way for further
exploration. The project page is at https://gewu-lab.github.io/MokA.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents a system using a motorized metallic plate and a camera to enhance mmWave communication in challenging environments by optimizing signal reflections.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the difficulty of reliable mmWave communication in NLoS scenarios, particularly in urban or resource-constrained areas.

Method: A vision-aided reflector system is introduced, leveraging a monocular camera to detect ArUco markers, estimate angles, and dynamically adjust reflections for optimal mmWave signal redirection.

Result: Experiments at 60 GHz showed an average 23 dB signal strength gain and a 0.89 probability of maintaining connection above -65 dB in an indoor setting.

Conclusion: The system offers a resilient and effective solution for improving mmWave connectivity in challenging conditions without requiring external infrastructure or GPS.

Abstract: Reliable millimeter-wave (mmWave) communication in non-line-of-sight (NLoS)
conditions remains a major challenge for both military and civilian operations,
especially in urban or infrastructure-limited environments. This paper presents
a vision-aided autonomous reflector system designed to enhance mmWave link
performance by dynamically steering signal reflections using a motorized
metallic plate. The proposed system leverages a monocular camera to detect
ArUco markers on allied transmitter and receiver nodes, estimate their angles
of arrival, and align the reflector in real time for optimal signal
redirection. This approach enables selective beam coverage by serving only
authenticated targets with visible markers and reduces the risk of unintended
signal exposure. The designed prototype, built on a Raspberry Pi 4 and
low-power hardware, operates autonomously without reliance on external
infrastructure or GPS. Experimental results at 60\,GHz demonstrate a 23\,dB
average gain in received signal strength and an 0.89 probability of maintaining
signal reception above a target threshold of -65 dB in an indoor environment,
far exceeding the static and no-reflector baselines. These results demonstrate
the system's potential for resilient and adaptive mmWave connectivity in
complex and dynamic environments.

*Yuxin Wen,Yangsibo Huang,Tom Goldstein,Ravi Kumar,Badih Ghazi,Chiyuan Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper investigates cross-modal memorization in vision-language models, using a synthetic persona dataset to explore how facts learned in one modality transfer to another.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand neural network memorization for better privacy and robust knowledge acquisition, especially in emerging unified multimodal models.

Method: They propose a systematic study using a synthetic persona dataset, training models in one modality, and evaluating performance and transferability in another.

Result: Facts transfer across modalities, but with a significant gap in information recall between the source and target modality, persisting across scenarios like machine unlearning and more capable models.

Conclusion: A baseline method is proposed to improve cross-modal transferability, with a call for future research to develop stronger multimodal learning techniques.

Abstract: Understanding what and how neural networks memorize during training is
crucial, both from the perspective of unintentional memorization of potentially
sensitive information and from the standpoint of effective knowledge
acquisition for real-world, knowledge-intensive tasks. While previous studies
primarily investigate memorization within a single modality, such as text
memorization in large language models or image memorization in diffusion
models, unified multimodal models are becoming increasingly prevalent in
practical applications. In this work, we focus on the unique characteristics of
cross-modality memorization and conduct a systematic study centered on
vision-language models. To facilitate controlled experiments, we first
introduce a synthetic persona dataset comprising diverse synthetic person
images and textual descriptions. We quantify factual knowledge memorization and
cross-modal transferability by training models on a single modality and
evaluating their performance in the other. Our results reveal that facts
learned in one modality transfer to the other, but a significant gap exists
between recalling information in the source and target modalities. Furthermore,
we observe that this gap exists across various scenarios, including more
capable models, machine unlearning, and the multi-hop case. At the end, we
propose a baseline method to mitigate this challenge. We hope our study can
inspire future research on developing more robust multimodal learning
techniques to enhance cross-modal transferability.

*Yani Zhang,Dongming Wu,Hao Shi,Yingfei Liu,Tiancai Wang,Haoqiang Fan,Xingping Dong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper explores embodied 3D grounding, finding that detection models surprisingly outperform grounding models trained with language instructions. They introduce DEGround, which unifies detection and grounding using shared DETR queries, achieving superior performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Examine whether embodied 3D grounding benefits significantly from detection models, challenging traditional two-stage paradigms.

Method: Propose DEGround framework that shares DETR queries for detection and grounding while including modules for regional activation and query-wise modulation for improved language-instruction understanding.

Result: DEGround improves overall accuracy by 7.52% compared to state-of-the-art models on the EmbodiedScan validation set.

Conclusion: Detection-level grounding models perform well even without instruction-specific training, and DEGround's unified approach strengthens context-aware and category-level embodied grounding.

Abstract: Embodied 3D grounding aims to localize target objects described in human
instructions from ego-centric viewpoint. Most methods typically follow a
two-stage paradigm where a trained 3D detector's optimized backbone parameters
are used to initialize a grounding model. In this study, we explore a
fundamental question: Does embodied 3D grounding benefit enough from detection?
To answer this question, we assess the grounding performance of detection
models using predicted boxes filtered by the target category. Surprisingly,
these detection models without any instruction-specific training outperform the
grounding models explicitly trained with language instructions. This indicates
that even category-level embodied 3D grounding may not be well resolved, let
alone more fine-grained context-aware grounding. Motivated by this finding, we
propose DEGround, which shares DETR queries as object representation for both
DEtection and Grounding and enables the grounding to benefit from basic
category classification and box detection. Based on this framework, we further
introduce a regional activation grounding module that highlights
instruction-related regions and a query-wise modulation module that
incorporates sentence-level semantic into the query representation,
strengthening the context-aware understanding of language instructions.
Remarkably, DEGround outperforms state-of-the-art model BIP3D by 7.52\% at
overall accuracy on the EmbodiedScan validation set. The source code will be
publicly available at https://github.com/zyn213/DEGround.

*Yanbo Wang,Ziyi Wang,Wenzhao Zheng,Jie Zhou,Jiwen Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OGGSplat introduces an open Gaussian-based method for semantic-aware 3D scene reconstruction from sparse views, emphasizing better field-of-view expansion and generative quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research is motivated by the increasing demands of applications like virtual reality and embodied AI, which require efficient and semantic-aware 3D scene reconstruction from sparse image views.

Method: OGGSplat initializes open Gaussians from sparse views, employs an RGB-semantic consistent inpainting module for bidirectional control, and uses the resulting inpainted regions to optimize Gaussian parameters for 3D scene reconstruction.

Result: A new Gaussian Outpainting (GO) benchmark is established to evaluate both semantic and generative qualities, showcasing OGGSplat's effectiveness in reconstructing open-vocabulary scenes using even minimal input, such as two smartphone images.

Conclusion: OGGSplat demonstrates promising advancements in semantic-aware 3D reconstruction using a novel Gaussian-based approach, highlighting its generative capabilities and practical applications in sparse view settings.

Abstract: Reconstructing semantic-aware 3D scenes from sparse views is a challenging
yet essential research direction, driven by the demands of emerging
applications such as virtual reality and embodied AI. Existing per-scene
optimization methods require dense input views and incur high computational
costs, while generalizable approaches often struggle to reconstruct regions
outside the input view cone. In this paper, we propose OGGSplat, an open
Gaussian growing method that expands the field-of-view in generalizable 3D
reconstruction. Our key insight is that the semantic attributes of open
Gaussians provide strong priors for image extrapolation, enabling both semantic
consistency and visual plausibility. Specifically, once open Gaussians are
initialized from sparse views, we introduce an RGB-semantic consistent
inpainting module applied to selected rendered views. This module enforces
bidirectional control between an image diffusion model and a semantic diffusion
model. The inpainted regions are then lifted back into 3D space for efficient
and progressive Gaussian parameter optimization. To evaluate our method, we
establish a Gaussian Outpainting (GO) benchmark that assesses both semantic and
generative quality of reconstructed open-vocabulary scenes. OGGSplat also
demonstrates promising semantic-aware scene reconstruction capabilities when
provided with two view images captured directly from a smartphone camera.

TL;DR: The paper introduces "Follow-Your-Motion," a framework aimed at improving motion transfer in video diffusion transformers by enhancing motion consistency and tuning efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video diffusion transformers face challenges in motion transfer, particularly with motion inconsistency and inefficient two-stage finetuning processes.

Method: The method introduces a spatial-temporal decoupled LoRA during tuning stages, along with sparse motion sampling and adaptive RoPE for faster and more effective adjustments.

Result: Follow-Your-Motion demonstrates improved motion transfer capabilities and faster tuning, verified through extensive evaluations on the newly proposed MotionBench benchmark.

Conclusion: The framework provides a significant advance in video diffusion motion transfer, offering better consistency, efficiency, and benchmark testing for diverse motion scenarios.

Abstract: Recently, breakthroughs in the video diffusion transformer have shown
remarkable capabilities in diverse motion generations. As for the
motion-transfer task, current methods mainly use two-stage Low-Rank Adaptations
(LoRAs) finetuning to obtain better performance. However, existing
adaptation-based motion transfer still suffers from motion inconsistency and
tuning inefficiency when applied to large video diffusion transformers. Naive
two-stage LoRA tuning struggles to maintain motion consistency between
generated and input videos due to the inherent spatial-temporal coupling in the
3D attention operator. Additionally, they require time-consuming fine-tuning
processes in both stages. To tackle these issues, we propose
Follow-Your-Motion, an efficient two-stage video motion transfer framework that
finetunes a powerful video diffusion transformer to synthesize complex
motion.Specifically, we propose a spatial-temporal decoupled LoRA to decouple
the attention architecture for spatial appearance and temporal motion
processing. During the second training stage, we design the sparse motion
sampling and adaptive RoPE to accelerate the tuning speed. To address the lack
of a benchmark for this field, we introduce MotionBench, a comprehensive
benchmark comprising diverse motion, including creative camera motion, single
object motion, multiple object motion, and complex human motion. We show
extensive evaluations on MotionBench to verify the superiority of
Follow-Your-Motion.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes DSG-World, a framework to build efficient 3D world models from limited observations using dual state information for improved visibility and reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D world modeling techniques face challenges such as limited physical consistency, difficulty in training, occlusion issues, and reliance on multi-stage pipelines.

Method: The method uses two perturbed observations of the same scene under different object configurations to construct segmentation-aware 3D Gaussian fields. It incorporates bidirectional consistency, pseudo intermediate states, and collaborative co-pruning strategies for better reconstruction.

Result: The framework supports efficient real-to-simulation transfer, enabling high-fidelity rendering and scene manipulation while generalizing well to novel views and scene states.

Conclusion: DSG-World shows promise for real-world 3D reconstruction and simulation, addressing challenges like occlusions and dependency on dense observations with its novel, end-to-end approach.

Abstract: Building an efficient and physically consistent world model from limited
observations is a long standing challenge in vision and robotics. Many existing
world modeling pipelines are based on implicit generative models, which are
hard to train and often lack 3D or physical consistency. On the other hand,
explicit 3D methods built from a single state often require multi-stage
processing-such as segmentation, background completion, and inpainting-due to
occlusions. To address this, we leverage two perturbed observations of the same
scene under different object configurations. These dual states offer
complementary visibility, alleviating occlusion issues during state transitions
and enabling more stable and complete reconstruction. In this paper, we present
DSG-World, a novel end-to-end framework that explicitly constructs a 3D
Gaussian World model from Dual State observations. Our approach builds dual
segmentation-aware Gaussian fields and enforces bidirectional photometric and
semantic consistency. We further introduce a pseudo intermediate state for
symmetric alignment and design collaborative co-pruning trategies to refine
geometric completeness. DSG-World enables efficient real-to-simulation transfer
purely in the explicit Gaussian representation space, supporting high-fidelity
rendering and object-level scene manipulation without relying on dense
observations or multi-stage pipelines. Extensive experiments demonstrate strong
generalization to novel views and scene states, highlighting the effectiveness
of our approach for real-world 3D reconstruction and simulation.

TL;DR: MonkeyOCR introduces an efficient and accurate vision-language model for document parsing using the Structure-Recognition-Relation (SRR) approach, outperforming existing benchmarks in accuracy and speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Simplifying complex document parsing workflows and balancing precision and efficiency by addressing limitations in current methods like modular pipelines and large multimodal models.

Method: MonkeyOCR leverages the SRR triplet framework to abstract document parsing into three fundamental questions regarding structure, recognition, and relation. It utilizes the MonkeyDoc dataset for training and testing.

Result: MonkeyOCR achieves an average accuracy improvement of 5.1% over MinerU, excels in difficult cases like formulas (+15%) and tables (+8.6%), surpasses larger models (e.g., Qwen-VL), and processes documents faster, handling 0.84 pages per second.

Conclusion: MonkeyOCR sets a new standard in document parsing by combining scalability, precision, and speed, with its capability to be deployed on accessible hardware, making it a promising tool for real-world applications.

Abstract: We introduce MonkeyOCR, a vision-language model for document parsing that
advances the state of the art by leveraging a Structure-Recognition-Relation
(SRR) triplet paradigm. This design simplifies what would otherwise be a
complex multi-tool pipeline (as in MinerU's modular approach) and avoids the
inefficiencies of processing full pages with giant end-to-end models (e.g.,
large multimodal LLMs like Qwen-VL). In SRR, document parsing is abstracted
into three fundamental questions - "Where is it?" (structure), "What is it?"
(recognition), and "How is it organized?" (relation) - corresponding to layout
analysis, content identification, and logical ordering. This focused
decomposition balances accuracy and speed: it enables efficient, scalable
processing without sacrificing precision. To train and evaluate this approach,
we introduce the MonkeyDoc (the most comprehensive document parsing dataset to
date), with 3.9 million instances spanning over ten document types in both
Chinese and English. Experiments show that MonkeyOCR outperforms MinerU by an
average of 5.1%, with particularly notable improvements on challenging content
such as formulas (+15.0%) and tables (+8.6%). Remarkably, our 3B-parameter
model surpasses much larger and top-performing models, including Qwen2.5-VL
(72B) and Gemini 2.5 Pro, achieving state-of-the-art average performance on
English document parsing tasks. In addition, MonkeyOCR processes multi-page
documents significantly faster (0.84 pages per second compared to 0.65 for
MinerU and 0.12 for Qwen2.5-VL-7B). The 3B model can be efficiently deployed
for inference on a single NVIDIA 3090 GPU. Code and models will be released at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method called SAM-aware Test-Time Adaptation (SAM-TTA) to enhance SAM's medical image segmentation without sacrificing its generalization capability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing adaptations to SAM for medical imaging enhance performance but limit generalization to new data, necessitating a solution that balances enhanced segmentation and universal adaptability.

Method: The SAM-TTA framework includes Self-adaptive Bezier Curve-based Transformation (SBCT) for input adaptation and Dual-scale Uncertainty-driven Mean Teacher adaptation (DUMT) for semantic adaptation, improving SAM compatibility with medical images.

Result: The proposed SAM-TTA technique is shown through experiments to outperform existing Test-Time Adaptation methods and fine-tuned models like MedSAM in specific cases across five datasets.

Conclusion: SAM-TTA represents a novel approach that improves medical image segmentation performance while preserving SAM's broad generalization, offering a new standard for universal medical image segmentation.

Abstract: Universal medical image segmentation using the Segment Anything Model (SAM)
remains challenging due to its limited adaptability to medical domains.
Existing adaptations, such as MedSAM, enhance SAM's performance in medical
imaging but at the cost of reduced generalization to unseen data. Therefore, in
this paper, we propose SAM-aware Test-Time Adaptation (SAM-TTA), a
fundamentally different pipeline that preserves the generalization of SAM while
improving its segmentation performance in medical imaging via a test-time
framework. SAM-TTA tackles two key challenges: (1) input-level discrepancies
caused by differences in image acquisition between natural and medical images
and (2) semantic-level discrepancies due to fundamental differences in object
definition between natural and medical domains (e.g., clear boundaries vs.
ambiguous structures). Specifically, our SAM-TTA framework comprises (1)
Self-adaptive Bezier Curve-based Transformation (SBCT), which adaptively
converts single-channel medical images into three-channel SAM-compatible inputs
while maintaining structural integrity, to mitigate the input gap between
medical and natural images, and (2) Dual-scale Uncertainty-driven Mean Teacher
adaptation (DUMT), which employs consistency learning to align SAM's internal
representations to medical semantics, enabling efficient adaptation without
auxiliary supervision or expensive retraining. Extensive experiments on five
public datasets demonstrate that our SAM-TTA outperforms existing TTA
approaches and even surpasses fully fine-tuned models such as MedSAM in certain
scenarios, establishing a new paradigm for universal medical image
segmentation. Code can be found at https://github.com/JianghaoWu/SAM-TTA.

*Zhiyun Deng,Dongmyeong Lee,Amanda Adkins,Jesse Quattrociocchi,Christian Ellis,Joydeep Biswas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces MoViX, a cross-view video localization framework for accurate 3-DoF localization in GPS-denied environments, achieving state-of-the-art results in off-road scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenges of GPS-denied off-road localization, particularly issues caused by perceptual ambiguities, such as repetitive vegetation, and seasonal shifts that alter the scene's appearance.

Method: MoViX combines a self-supervised approach with various novel strategies. It employs a pose-dependent sampling strategy, hard negative mining, motion-informed frame sampling, and a lightweight temporal aggregator. During inference, it incorporates Monte Carlo Localization with entropy-guided scaling for robust multi-hypothesis tracking.

Result: On the TartanDrive 2.0 dataset, MoViX achieved localization accuracy within 25 meters of ground truth 93% of the time, and 100% of the time within 50 meters, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines despite using outdated satellite imagery.

Conclusion: MoViX is effective for 3-DoF localization in challenging off-road environments without requiring environment-specific tuning. It generalizes well to distinct geographic and robotic setups.

Abstract: Robust cross-view 3-DoF localization in GPS-denied, off-road environments
remains challenging due to (1) perceptual ambiguities from repetitive
vegetation and unstructured terrain, and (2) seasonal shifts that significantly
alter scene appearance, hindering alignment with outdated satellite imagery. To
address this, we introduce MoViX, a self-supervised cross-view video
localization framework that learns viewpoint- and season-invariant
representations while preserving directional awareness essential for accurate
localization. MoViX employs a pose-dependent positive sampling strategy to
enhance directional discrimination and temporally aligned hard negative mining
to discourage shortcut learning from seasonal cues. A motion-informed frame
sampler selects spatially diverse frames, and a lightweight temporal aggregator
emphasizes geometrically aligned observations while downweighting ambiguous
ones. At inference, MoViX runs within a Monte Carlo Localization framework,
using a learned cross-view matching module in place of handcrafted models.
Entropy-guided temperature scaling enables robust multi-hypothesis tracking and
confident convergence under visual ambiguity. We evaluate MoViX on the

of ground truth 93% of the time, and within 50 meters 100% of the time in
unseen regions, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines without
environment-specific tuning. We further demonstrate generalization on a
real-world off-road dataset from a geographically distinct site with a
different robot platform.

### [231] [LeanPO: Lean Preference Optimization for Likelihood Alignment in Video-LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05260)
*Xiaodong Wang,Jinfa Huang,Li Yuan,Peixi Peng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper addresses challenges in Video-LLMs' preference alignment and proposes Lean Preference Optimization (LeanPO) as a solution to improve model reliability and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to resolve the unintended drop in likelihoods for both winning and losing responses during preference alignment training in Video-LLMs, which is exacerbated by the complexity of video content.

Method: The proposed LeanPO method uses a reference-free approach to redefine implicit rewards, a self-generated preference data pipeline informed by prior knowledge, self-reflection, and a dynamic label smoothing strategy to handle noise.

Result: The experiments show that LeanPO significantly improves the performance of state-of-the-art Video-LLMs efficiently without substantial additional training.

Conclusion: LeanPO provides a robust method to align Video-LLMs with human trustworthiness and offers a scalable solution to enhance reliability and efficiency in video-based large language models.

Abstract: Most Video Large Language Models (Video-LLMs) adopt preference alignment
techniques, e.g., DPO~\citep{rafailov2024dpo}, to optimize the reward margin
between a winning response ($y_w$) and a losing response ($y_l$). However, the
likelihood displacement observed in DPO indicates that both $\log \pi_\theta
(y_w\mid x)$ and $\log \pi_\theta (y_l\mid x) $ often decrease during training,
inadvertently boosting the probabilities of non-target responses. In this
paper, we systematically revisit this phenomenon from LLMs to Video-LLMs,
showing that it intensifies when dealing with the redundant complexity of video
content. To alleviate the impact of this phenomenon, we propose \emph{Lean
Preference Optimization} (LeanPO), a reference-free approach that reformulates
the implicit reward as the average likelihood of the response with respect to
the policy model. A key component of LeanPO is the reward-trustworthiness
correlated self-generated preference data pipeline, which carefully infuses
relevant prior knowledge into the model while continuously refining the
preference data via self-reflection. This allows the policy model to obtain
high-quality paired data and accurately estimate the newly defined reward, thus
mitigating the unintended drop. In addition, we introduce a dynamic label
smoothing strategy that mitigates the impact of noise in responses from diverse
video content, preventing the model from overfitting to spurious details.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that LeanPO significantly enhances the
performance of state-of-the-art Video-LLMs, consistently boosting baselines of
varying capacities with minimal additional training overhead. Moreover, LeanPO
offers a simple yet effective solution for aligning Video-LLM preferences with
human trustworthiness, paving the way toward the reliable and efficient
Video-LLMs.

### [232] [Can Foundation Models Generalise the Presentation Attack Detection Capabilities on ID Cards?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05263)
*Juan E. Tapia,Christoph Busch*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper studies the use of Foundation Models (FM) to improve generalization in Presentation Attack Detection (PAD) for ID cards across different countries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Achieving better generalization for PAD systems for ID cards, as most current models fail to perform well when tested on unseen ID cards from different countries.

Method: Using Foundation Models (FM) trained on large datasets, they compared zero-shot and fine-tuning approaches using two ID card datasets—one private (Chilean IDs) and one open-set (Finland, Spain, Slovakia).

Result: Their experiments showed that bona fide images (authentic ID images) are essential for enhancing cross-country PAD generalization.

Conclusion: Foundation Models can significantly improve the generalization capability of PAD systems, with authentic ID images playing a vital role in achieving cross-country robustness.

Abstract: Nowadays, one of the main challenges in presentation attack detection (PAD)
on ID cards is obtaining generalisation capabilities for a diversity of
countries that are issuing ID cards. Most PAD systems are trained on one, two,
or three ID documents because of privacy protection concerns. As a result, they
do not obtain competitive results for commercial purposes when tested in an
unknown new ID card country. In this scenario, Foundation Models (FM) trained
on huge datasets can help to improve generalisation capabilities. This work
intends to improve and benchmark the capabilities of FM and how to use them to
adapt the generalisation on PAD of ID Documents. Different test protocols were
used, considering zero-shot and fine-tuning and two different ID card datasets.
One private dataset based on Chilean IDs and one open-set based on three ID
countries: Finland, Spain, and Slovakia. Our findings indicate that bona fide
images are the key to generalisation.

### [233] [From Play to Replay: Composed Video Retrieval for Temporally Fine-Grained Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05274)
*Animesh Gupta,Jay Parmar,Ishan Rajendrakumar Dave,Mubarak Shah*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TF-CoVR introduces a benchmark for temporally fine-grained composed video retrieval, focusing on gymnastics and diving with 180K triplets, alongside a novel TF-CoVR-Base framework for retrieval tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for video retrieval do not adequately address subtle, fast-paced temporal differences, limiting their applicability to practical real-world scenarios.

Method: This paper develops TF-CoVR, a benchmark constructed using LLM prompts to create temporally fine-grained query-target pairs from different videos and introduces TF-CoVR-Base framework combining video encoder pre-training and contrastive learning.

Result: TF-CoVR-Base achieved a significant performance improvement in both zero-shot retrieval (mAP@50 from 5.92 to 7.51) and fine-tuned retrieval (mAP@50 from 19.83 to 25.82).

Conclusion: The proposed benchmark and framework pave the way for improved video retrieval models, demonstrating effectiveness in handling fine-grained temporal dynamics.

Abstract: Composed Video Retrieval (CoVR) retrieves a target video given a query video
and a modification text describing the intended change. Existing CoVR
benchmarks emphasize appearance shifts or coarse event changes and therefore do
not test the ability to capture subtle, fast-paced temporal differences. We
introduce TF-CoVR, the first large-scale benchmark dedicated to temporally
fine-grained CoVR. TF-CoVR focuses on gymnastics and diving and provides 180K
triplets drawn from FineGym and FineDiving. Previous CoVR benchmarks focusing
on temporal aspect, link each query to a single target segment taken from the
same video, limiting practical usefulness. In TF-CoVR, we instead construct
each <query, modification> pair by prompting an LLM with the label differences
between clips drawn from different videos; every pair is thus associated with
multiple valid target videos (3.9 on average), reflecting real-world tasks such
as sports-highlight generation. To model these temporal dynamics we propose
TF-CoVR-Base, a concise two-stage training framework: (i) pre-train a video
encoder on fine-grained action classification to obtain temporally
discriminative embeddings; (ii) align the composed query with candidate videos
using contrastive learning. We conduct the first comprehensive study of image,
video, and general multimodal embedding (GME) models on temporally fine-grained
composed retrieval in both zero-shot and fine-tuning regimes. On TF-CoVR,
TF-CoVR-Base improves zero-shot mAP@50 from 5.92 (LanguageBind) to 7.51, and
after fine-tuning raises the state-of-the-art from 19.83 to 25.82.

### [234] [Unifying Appearance Codes and Bilateral Grids for Driving Scene Gaussian Splatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05280)
*Nan Wang,Yuantao Chen,Lixing Xiao,Weiqing Xiao,Bohan Li,Zhaoxi Chen,Chongjie Ye,Shaocong Xu,Saining Zhang,Ziyang Yan,Pierre Merriaux,Lei Lei,Tianfan Xue,Hao Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel multi-scale bilateral grid blending appearance codes and bilateral grids for better geometric accuracy in autonomous driving scene reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Photometric inconsistencies in real-world imagery hinder high-quality reconstruction. Existing approaches like appearance codes and bilateral grids have limitations in addressing this effectively.

Method: The authors propose a multi-scale bilateral grid that unifies the strengths of appearance codes and conventional bilateral grids for per-pixel color mapping and improved geometric reconstructions.

Result: The proposed method yields enhanced geometric accuracy and eliminates visual artifacts ('floaters') caused by photometric inconsistencies across four datasets: Waymo, NuScenes, Argoverse, and PandaSet.

Conclusion: The multi-scale bilateral grid improves reconstruction quality in autonomous driving tasks, making it suitable for applications requiring precise geometric understanding like obstacle avoidance.

Abstract: Neural rendering techniques, including NeRF and Gaussian Splatting (GS), rely
on photometric consistency to produce high-quality reconstructions. However, in
real-world scenarios, it is challenging to guarantee perfect photometric
consistency in acquired images. Appearance codes have been widely used to
address this issue, but their modeling capability is limited, as a single code
is applied to the entire image. Recently, the bilateral grid was introduced to
perform pixel-wise color mapping, but it is difficult to optimize and constrain
effectively. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-scale bilateral grid that
unifies appearance codes and bilateral grids. We demonstrate that this approach
significantly improves geometric accuracy in dynamic, decoupled autonomous
driving scene reconstruction, outperforming both appearance codes and bilateral
grids. This is crucial for autonomous driving, where accurate geometry is
important for obstacle avoidance and control. Our method shows strong results
across four datasets: Waymo, NuScenes, Argoverse, and PandaSet. We further
demonstrate that the improvement in geometry is driven by the multi-scale
bilateral grid, which effectively reduces floaters caused by photometric
inconsistency.

*Tao Sun,Liyuan Zhu,Shengyu Huang,Shuran Song,Iro Armeni*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces Rectified Point Flow, a unified framework for point cloud registration and shape assembly problems, achieving state-of-the-art results using a self-supervised encoder and a continuous point-wise velocity field.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to unify the tasks of point cloud registration and multi-part shape assembly under a single generative framework, addressing limitations such as handling symmetries and noisy data.

Method: The method learns a continuous point-wise velocity field to transport noisy points to target positions and uses a self-supervised encoder to focus on overlapping points, enabling intrinsic learning of assembly symmetries without additional labels.

Result: Rectified Point Flow achieves state-of-the-art performance on six benchmarks, benefiting from joint training on diverse datasets and leveraging shared geometric priors to enhance accuracy.

Conclusion: This work demonstrates the effectiveness of a unified generative approach to address pairwise point cloud registration and shape assembly, pushing performance boundaries without explicit symmetry labeling.

Abstract: We introduce Rectified Point Flow, a unified parameterization that formulates
pairwise point cloud registration and multi-part shape assembly as a single
conditional generative problem. Given unposed point clouds, our method learns a
continuous point-wise velocity field that transports noisy points toward their
target positions, from which part poses are recovered. In contrast to prior
work that regresses part-wise poses with ad-hoc symmetry handling, our method
intrinsically learns assembly symmetries without symmetry labels. Together with
a self-supervised encoder focused on overlapping points, our method achieves a
new state-of-the-art performance on six benchmarks spanning pairwise
registration and shape assembly. Notably, our unified formulation enables
effective joint training on diverse datasets, facilitating the learning of
shared geometric priors and consequently boosting accuracy. Project page:

*Tong Wu,Shuai Yang,Ryan Po,Yinghao Xu,Ziwei Liu,Dahua Lin,Gordon Wetzstein*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel framework for video world models using geometry-grounded long-term spatial memory to improve consistency and context length.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: World models face challenges in maintaining scene consistency, particularly during revisits, due to limited temporal context windows.

Method: They introduce a geometry-grounded spatial memory framework with custom datasets for training and evaluation, including storing and retrieving mechanisms.

Result: The proposed approach increases the quality, consistency, and context length of video world models compared to baselines.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates potential for achieving long-term consistent video world generation by incorporating a spatial memory inspired by human memory.

Abstract: Emerging world models autoregressively generate video frames in response to
actions, such as camera movements and text prompts, among other control
signals. Due to limited temporal context window sizes, these models often
struggle to maintain scene consistency during revisits, leading to severe
forgetting of previously generated environments. Inspired by the mechanisms of
human memory, we introduce a novel framework to enhancing long-term consistency
of video world models through a geometry-grounded long-term spatial memory. Our
framework includes mechanisms to store and retrieve information from the
long-term spatial memory and we curate custom datasets to train and evaluate
world models with explicitly stored 3D memory mechanisms. Our evaluations show
improved quality, consistency, and context length compared to relevant
baselines, paving the way towards long-term consistent world generation.

*Bardienus P. Duisterhof,Jan Oberst,Bowen Wen,Stan Birchfield,Deva Ramanan,Jeffrey Ichnowski*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RaySt3R introduces a novel method for 3D shape completion by reinterpreting the task as a view synthesis problem, achieving superior results compared to existing approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current solutions for 3D shape completion suffer from issues like lack of 3D consistency, high computational costs, and poor sharp object boundary identification, creating a need for a more robust method.

Method: RaySt3R uses a feedforward transformer model to predict depth maps, object masks, and pixel confidence scores from single RGB-D images and novel viewpoints (query rays), and then fuses these predictions across views to reconstruct 3D shapes.

Result: RaySt3R achieves up to 44% improvement in 3D chamfer distance compared to existing methods, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance on both synthetic and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: RaySt3R successfully addresses limitations in 3D shape completion methods and provides an efficient, consistent, and accurate framework for reconstructing 3D objects and scenes.

Abstract: 3D shape completion has broad applications in robotics, digital twin
reconstruction, and extended reality (XR). Although recent advances in 3D
object and scene completion have achieved impressive results, existing methods
lack 3D consistency, are computationally expensive, and struggle to capture
sharp object boundaries. Our work (RaySt3R) addresses these limitations by
recasting 3D shape completion as a novel view synthesis problem. Specifically,
given a single RGB-D image and a novel viewpoint (encoded as a collection of
query rays), we train a feedforward transformer to predict depth maps, object
masks, and per-pixel confidence scores for those query rays. RaySt3R fuses
these predictions across multiple query views to reconstruct complete 3D
shapes. We evaluate RaySt3R on synthetic and real-world datasets, and observe
it achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming the baselines on all
datasets by up to 44% in 3D chamfer distance. Project page:

*Lijie Hu,Songning Lai,Yuan Hua,Shu Yang,Jingfeng Zhang,Di Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Vision Concept Transformer (VCT) and Stable Vision Concept Transformer (SVCT) to improve faithfulness and performance of Concept Bottleneck Models in medical applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the transparency challenges in AI used in the medical field, specifically improving Concept Bottleneck Models' interpretability, accuracy, and stability under perturbations.

Method: Proposing VCT and SVCT, leveraging Vision Transformer (ViT) as backbone, fusing conceptual and image features for enhanced decision-making, and incorporating Denoised Diffusion Smoothing for stable explanations.

Result: Experiments on four medical datasets showed that VCT and SVCT maintained accuracy, improved interpretability, and provided consistent, stable explanations under input perturbations.

Conclusion: SVCT successfully balances accuracy and interpretability while addressing faithfulness issues, making it suitable for the medical field.

Abstract: Transparency is a paramount concern in the medical field, prompting
researchers to delve into the realm of explainable AI (XAI). Among these XAI
methods, Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) aim to restrict the model's latent
space to human-understandable high-level concepts by generating a conceptual
layer for extracting conceptual features, which has drawn much attention
recently. However, existing methods rely solely on concept features to
determine the model's predictions, which overlook the intrinsic feature
embeddings within medical images. To address this utility gap between the
original models and concept-based models, we propose Vision Concept Transformer
(VCT). Furthermore, despite their benefits, CBMs have been found to negatively
impact model performance and fail to provide stable explanations when faced
with input perturbations, which limits their application in the medical field.
To address this faithfulness issue, this paper further proposes the Stable
Vision Concept Transformer (SVCT) based on VCT, which leverages the vision
transformer (ViT) as its backbone and incorporates a conceptual layer. SVCT
employs conceptual features to enhance decision-making capabilities by fusing
them with image features and ensures model faithfulness through the integration
of Denoised Diffusion Smoothing. Comprehensive experiments on four medical
datasets demonstrate that our VCT and SVCT maintain accuracy while remaining
interpretable compared to baselines. Furthermore, even when subjected to
perturbations, our SVCT model consistently provides faithful explanations, thus
meeting the needs of the medical field.

TL;DR: This paper introduces EOC-Bench, a benchmark focused on assessing object-centric cognition in dynamic egocentric scenarios, incorporating annotated QA pairs and a temporal evaluation metric.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of benchmarks evaluating dynamic changes caused by user interactions in egocentric vision applications, which are overlooked by existing embodied benchmarks.

Method: The paper develops EOC-Bench, incorporating 3,277 QA pairs classified across temporal categories, human-in-the-loop annotation, and a new multi-scale temporal accuracy metric.

Result: EOC-Bench systematically evaluates MLLMs, including proprietary, open-source, and object-level systems, offering insights into their handling of dynamic changes in egocentric settings.

Conclusion: EOC-Bench establishes a foundation to enhance the cognitive abilities of MLLMs in dynamic object-centric scenarios, supporting advancements in embodied system development.

Abstract: The emergence of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has driven
breakthroughs in egocentric vision applications. These applications necessitate
persistent, context-aware understanding of objects, as users interact with
tools in dynamic and cluttered environments. However, existing embodied
benchmarks primarily focus on static scene exploration, emphasizing object's
appearance and spatial attributes while neglecting the assessment of dynamic
changes arising from users' interactions. To address this gap, we introduce
EOC-Bench, an innovative benchmark designed to systematically evaluate
object-centric embodied cognition in dynamic egocentric scenarios. Specially,
EOC-Bench features 3,277 meticulously annotated QA pairs categorized into three
temporal categories: Past, Present, and Future, covering 11 fine-grained
evaluation dimensions and 3 visual object referencing types. To ensure thorough
assessment, we develop a mixed-format human-in-the-loop annotation framework
with four types of questions and design a novel multi-scale temporal accuracy
metric for open-ended temporal evaluation. Based on EOC-Bench, we conduct
comprehensive evaluations of various proprietary, open-source, and object-level
MLLMs. EOC-Bench serves as a crucial tool for advancing the embodied object
cognitive capabilities of MLLMs, establishing a robust foundation for
developing reliable core models for embodied systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel Aligned Tokenizer (AliTok) to improve autoregressive image generation by aligning token encoding methods with autoregressive generation models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing image tokenizers use bidirectional dependencies for token compression, making it difficult to effectively model autoregressive image generation.

Method: The authors propose AliTok, which uses a causal decoder for unidirectional token dependencies, adds prefix tokens, and employs two-stage training to ensure reconstruction consistency and generation-friendly properties.

Result: AliTok achieves strong results on the ImageNet-256 benchmark, with a gFID score of 1.50 and IS of 305.9 using a 177M parameter model, and outperforms state-of-the-art methods with larger models.

Conclusion: AliTok aligns the tokenization process with autoregressive generation, showing improved performance and faster sampling speeds, thus offering an effective solution for image generation. Code and weights are provided for further exploration.

Abstract: Autoregressive image generation aims to predict the next token based on
previous ones. However, existing image tokenizers encode tokens with
bidirectional dependencies during the compression process, which hinders the
effective modeling by autoregressive models. In this paper, we propose a novel
Aligned Tokenizer (AliTok), which utilizes a causal decoder to establish
unidirectional dependencies among encoded tokens, thereby aligning the token
modeling approach between the tokenizer and autoregressive model. Furthermore,
by incorporating prefix tokens and employing two-stage tokenizer training to
enhance reconstruction consistency, AliTok achieves great reconstruction
performance while being generation-friendly. On ImageNet-256 benchmark, using a
standard decoder-only autoregressive model as the generator with only 177M
parameters, AliTok achieves a gFID score of 1.50 and an IS of 305.9. When the
parameter count is increased to 662M, AliTok achieves a gFID score of 1.35,
surpassing the state-of-the-art diffusion method with 10x faster sampling
speed. The code and weights are available at

TL;DR: The paper introduces SeedVR2, a one-step diffusion-based video restoration (VR) method, optimizing computation and performance for high-resolution videos.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the high computational cost of existing diffusion-based VR methods and the challenges in adapting distillation-based approaches for high-resolution real-world videos.

Method: SeedVR2 uses adversarial training against real data with improvements like adaptive window attention for resolution handling and a feature matching loss for effective training.

Result: Experiments confirm that SeedVR2 achieves comparable or superior performance to existing methods while operating in a single step.

Conclusion: SeedVR2 proves to be an efficient and effective solution for high-resolution video restoration, reducing computational overhead without compromising quality.

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion-based video restoration (VR) demonstrate
significant improvement in visual quality, yet yield a prohibitive
computational cost during inference. While several distillation-based
approaches have exhibited the potential of one-step image restoration,
extending existing approaches to VR remains challenging and underexplored,
particularly when dealing with high-resolution video in real-world settings. In
this work, we propose a one-step diffusion-based VR model, termed as SeedVR2,
which performs adversarial VR training against real data. To handle the
challenging high-resolution VR within a single step, we introduce several
enhancements to both model architecture and training procedures. Specifically,
an adaptive window attention mechanism is proposed, where the window size is
dynamically adjusted to fit the output resolutions, avoiding window
inconsistency observed under high-resolution VR using window attention with a
predefined window size. To stabilize and improve the adversarial post-training
towards VR, we further verify the effectiveness of a series of losses,
including a proposed feature matching loss without significantly sacrificing
training efficiency. Extensive experiments show that SeedVR2 can achieve
comparable or even better performance compared with existing VR approaches in a
single step.

Motivation: The goal is to enable comprehensive and efficient region-level visual understanding in images and videos, overcoming limitations of segmentation models by integrating multimodal semantic capabilities.

Method: PAM extends the SAM 2 segmentation model by incorporating LLMs and introducing the Semantic Perceiver component to convert visual features into multimodal tokens. The model development is supported by a refined dataset of 1.5M image and 0.6M video annotations.

Result: PAM is 1.2-2.4x faster and uses less GPU memory compared to previous methods. It shows strong performance across various region understanding tasks.

Conclusion: PAM combines efficiency with effectiveness in region-level visual understanding tasks and sets a solid baseline for future research in the field.

Abstract: We present Perceive Anything Model (PAM), a conceptually straightforward and
efficient framework for comprehensive region-level visual understanding in
images and videos. Our approach extends the powerful segmentation model SAM 2
by integrating Large Language Models (LLMs), enabling simultaneous object
segmentation with the generation of diverse, region-specific semantic outputs,
including categories, label definition, functional explanations, and detailed
captions. A key component, Semantic Perceiver, is introduced to efficiently
transform SAM 2's rich visual features, which inherently carry general vision,
localization, and semantic priors into multi-modal tokens for LLM
comprehension. To support robust multi-granularity understanding, we also
develop a dedicated data refinement and augmentation pipeline, yielding a
high-quality dataset of 1.5M image and 0.6M video region-semantic annotations,
including novel region-level streaming video caption data. PAM is designed for
lightweightness and efficiency, while also demonstrates strong performance
across a diverse range of region understanding tasks. It runs 1.2-2.4x faster
and consumes less GPU memory than prior approaches, offering a practical
solution for real-world applications. We believe that our effective approach
will serve as a strong baseline for future research in region-level visual
understanding.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a 3D-aware pseudo-labeling method to improve semantic matching in images, significantly outperforming previous approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in semantic correspondence, especially for symmetric objects and repeated parts, which remain ambiguous with large pre-trained vision models.

Method: The method involves training an adapter to refine features using 3D-aware pseudo-labeling, cyclic consistency filtering, and 3D spherical prototype mapping constraints.

Result: Achieves a new state-of-the-art on SPair-71k with over a 4% absolute gain and a 7% improvement over similar supervision methods.

Conclusion: The proposed approach enhances semantic correspondence estimation while reducing dataset-specific annotations, showing potential for application across diverse data sources.

Abstract: Finding correspondences between semantically similar points across images and
object instances is one of the everlasting challenges in computer vision. While
large pre-trained vision models have recently been demonstrated as effective
priors for semantic matching, they still suffer from ambiguities for symmetric
objects or repeated object parts. We propose to improve semantic correspondence
estimation via 3D-aware pseudo-labeling. Specifically, we train an adapter to
refine off-the-shelf features using pseudo-labels obtained via 3D-aware
chaining, filtering wrong labels through relaxed cyclic consistency, and 3D
spherical prototype mapping constraints. While reducing the need for dataset
specific annotations compared to prior work, we set a new state-of-the-art on
SPair-71k by over 4% absolute gain and by over 7% against methods with similar
supervision requirements. The generality of our proposed approach simplifies
extension of training to other data sources, which we demonstrate in our
experiments.

TL;DR: This paper introduces MARBLE, a method to blend and edit object materials in images using CLIP-space embeddings and pre-trained text-to-image models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Material editing in images is a challenging task requiring precise control over fine-grained material attributes like roughness and transparency.

Method: MARBLE identifies a block in denoising UNet responsible for material attribution, blends materials via CLIP-space directions, and uses a shallow network for parametric control over attributes.

Result: Experiments show MARBLE's effectiveness in blending materials, controlling attributes, performing multiple edits in a single pass, and applying it to painting tasks.

Conclusion: MARBLE offers a novel, effective approach to material editing and enables intuitive parametric control over attributes, pushing boundaries in exemplar-based editing methods.

Abstract: Editing materials of objects in images based on exemplar images is an active
area of research in computer vision and graphics. We propose MARBLE, a method
for performing material blending and recomposing fine-grained material
properties by finding material embeddings in CLIP-space and using that to
control pre-trained text-to-image models. We improve exemplar-based material
editing by finding a block in the denoising UNet responsible for material
attribution. Given two material exemplar-images, we find directions in the
CLIP-space for blending the materials. Further, we can achieve parametric
control over fine-grained material attributes such as roughness, metallic,
transparency, and glow using a shallow network to predict the direction for the
desired material attribute change. We perform qualitative and quantitative
analysis to demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed method. We also present
the ability of our method to perform multiple edits in a single forward pass
and applicability to painting.

Result: Experiments on PAC-NeRF and Spring-Gaus datasets show ProJo4D achieves better performance than existing methods in 4D future state prediction, novel view rendering, and material parameter estimation.

Conclusion: ProJo4D provides an efficient and effective solution for physically grounded 4D scene understanding, showing potential for applications like robotics and XR.

Abstract: Neural rendering has made significant strides in 3D reconstruction and novel
view synthesis. With the integration with physics, it opens up new
applications. The inverse problem of estimating physics from visual data,
however, still remains challenging, limiting its effectiveness for applications
like physically accurate digital twin creation in robotics and XR. Existing
methods that incorporate physics into neural rendering frameworks typically
require dense multi-view videos as input, making them impractical for scalable,
real-world use. When presented with sparse multi-view videos, the sequential
optimization strategy used by existing approaches introduces significant error
accumulation, e.g., poor initial 3D reconstruction leads to bad material
parameter estimation in subsequent stages. Instead of sequential optimization,
directly optimizing all parameters at the same time also fails due to the
highly non-convex and often non-differentiable nature of the problem. We
propose ProJo4D, a progressive joint optimization framework that gradually
increases the set of jointly optimized parameters guided by their sensitivity,
leading to fully joint optimization over geometry, appearance, physical state,
and material property. Evaluations on PAC-NeRF and Spring-Gaus datasets show
that ProJo4D outperforms prior work in 4D future state prediction, novel view
rendering of future state, and material parameter estimation, demonstrating its
effectiveness in physically grounded 4D scene understanding. For demos, please

### [246] [Does Your 3D Encoder Really Work? When Pretrain-SFT from 2D VLMs Meets 3D VLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05318)
*Haoyuan Li,Yanpeng Zhou,Yufei Gao,Tao Tang,Jianhua Han,Yujie Yuan,Dave Zhenyu Chen,Jiawang Bian,Hang Xu,Xiaodan Liang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper evaluates 3D Vision-Language Models, noting that scene-centric ones lag behind object-centric and 2D image-based counterparts due to over-reliance on linguistic cues and lack of effective pre-training. To improve 3D understanding, a specialized QA dataset is proposed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the gap between the performance of 3D scene-centric Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and their object-centric or 2D counterparts in tasks requiring understanding of 3D spatial structures.

Method: The paper introduces a deep analysis of existing 3D VLMs and their reliance on 3D scene encoders. It also proposes a novel QA dataset designed to disrupt shortcut learning and foster actual 3D understanding.

Result: The analysis revealed that scene-centric 3D VLMs underperform due to limited dependence on 3D encoders, ineffective pre-training, and over-reliance on linguistic cues. The dataset emphasizes genuine 3D scene understanding.

Conclusion: Existing 3D scene-centric VLMs need improved evaluation methods and strategies for leveraging 3D encoder capabilities, highlighting the importance of the proposed dataset for this progression.

Abstract: Remarkable progress in 2D Vision-Language Models (VLMs) has spurred interest
in extending them to 3D settings for tasks like 3D Question Answering, Dense
Captioning, and Visual Grounding. Unlike 2D VLMs that typically process images
through an image encoder, 3D scenes, with their intricate spatial structures,
allow for diverse model architectures. Based on their encoder design, this
paper categorizes recent 3D VLMs into 3D object-centric, 2D image-based, and 3D
scene-centric approaches. Despite the architectural similarity of 3D
scene-centric VLMs to their 2D counterparts, they have exhibited comparatively
lower performance compared with the latest 3D object-centric and 2D image-based
approaches. To understand this gap, we conduct an in-depth analysis, revealing
that 3D scene-centric VLMs show limited reliance on the 3D scene encoder, and
the pre-train stage appears less effective than in 2D VLMs. Furthermore, we
observe that data scaling benefits are less pronounced on larger datasets. Our
investigation suggests that while these models possess cross-modal alignment
capabilities, they tend to over-rely on linguistic cues and overfit to frequent
answer distributions, thereby diminishing the effective utilization of the 3D
encoder. To address these limitations and encourage genuine 3D scene
understanding, we introduce a novel 3D Relevance Discrimination QA dataset
designed to disrupt shortcut learning and improve 3D understanding. Our
findings highlight the need for advanced evaluation and improved strategies for
better 3D understanding in 3D VLMs.

*Duochao Shi,Weijie Wang,Donny Y. Chen,Zeyu Zhang,Jia-Wang Bian,Bohan Zhuang,Chunhua Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces "PM-Loss", a regularization loss that improves depth maps for 3D Gaussian Splatting pipelines, leading to better rendering quality by addressing depth discontinuities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Depth maps, used in generating 3D point clouds for novel view synthesis, often suffer from issues at object boundaries, resulting in degraded rendering quality. This paper aims to tackle depth discontinuities that limit depth-based representations.

Method: The authors propose "PM-Loss", a new regularization loss derived from a pointmap predicted by a pre-trained transformer. The pointmap enforces geometric smoothness, especially around object boundaries, thus enhancing depth maps.

Result: PM-Loss notably improves the depth map quality, leading to significant enhancements in rendering results across various architectures and scenes in 3D Gaussian Splatting pipelines.

Conclusion: Using PM-Loss enables feed-forward 3DGS pipelines to achieve better rendering outcomes by addressing depth map fragmentation, leveraging geometric smoothness even at boundaries.

Abstract: Depth maps are widely used in feed-forward 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)
pipelines by unprojecting them into 3D point clouds for novel view synthesis.
This approach offers advantages such as efficient training, the use of known
camera poses, and accurate geometry estimation. However, depth discontinuities
at object boundaries often lead to fragmented or sparse point clouds, degrading
rendering quality -- a well-known limitation of depth-based representations. To
tackle this issue, we introduce PM-Loss, a novel regularization loss based on a
pointmap predicted by a pre-trained transformer. Although the pointmap itself
may be less accurate than the depth map, it effectively enforces geometric
smoothness, especially around object boundaries. With the improved depth map,
our method significantly improves the feed-forward 3DGS across various
architectures and scenes, delivering consistently better rendering results. Our

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new benchmark for multimodal counting tasks in video understanding and proposes a model for improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations in existing benchmarks and models for counting tasks in video understanding.

Method: Introduced CG-AV-Counting benchmark and proposed AV-Reasoner model using GRPO and curriculum learning.

Result: AV-Reasoner achieved state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks.

Conclusion: While AV-Reasoner excels in domain-specific benchmarks, reinforcement learning in language reasoning struggles in out-of-domain scenarios.

Abstract: Despite progress in video understanding, current MLLMs struggle with counting
tasks. Existing benchmarks are limited by short videos, close-set queries, lack
of clue annotations, and weak multimodal coverage. In this paper, we introduce
CG-AV-Counting, a manually-annotated clue-grounded counting benchmark with
1,027 multimodal questions and 5,845 annotated clues over 497 long videos. It
supports both black-box and white-box evaluation, serving as a comprehensive
testbed for both end-to-end and reasoning-based counting. To explore ways to
improve model's counting capability, we propose AV-Reasoner, a model trained
with GRPO and curriculum learning to generalize counting ability from related
tasks. AV-Reasoner achieves state-of-the-art results across multiple
benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of reinforcement learning. However,
experiments show that on out-of-domain benchmarks, reasoning in the language
space fails to bring performance gains. The code and benchmark have been
realeased on https://av-reasoner.github.io.

*Xinyan Chen,Renrui Zhang,Dongzhi Jiang,Aojun Zhou,Shilin Yan,Weifeng Lin,Hongsheng Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MINT-CoT, a method that integrates visual tokens dynamically into textual reasoning for solving mathematical multimodal problems, outperforming existing methods significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The aim is to address limitations in current multimodal reasoning methods for math problems, such as reliance on rigid image regions, limited math-specific visual perception, and external modifications for visual input.

Method: MINT-CoT employs dynamically interleaved visual tokens and textual reasoning steps, supported by a newly curated dataset of 54K math problems and a three-stage training process combining SFT and RL.

Result: MINT-CoT achieves substantial improvements across multiple benchmarks, outperforming baselines by up to 34.08%.

Conclusion: MINT-CoT effectively improves multimodal mathematical reasoning by interleaving visual and textual information, setting a new standard in the domain.

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) has widely enhanced mathematical reasoning in Large
Language Models (LLMs), but it still remains challenging for extending it to
multimodal domains. Existing works either adopt a similar textual reasoning for
image input, or seek to interleave visual signals into mathematical CoT.
However, they face three key limitations for math problem-solving: reliance on
coarse-grained box-shaped image regions, limited perception of vision encoders
on math content, and dependence on external capabilities for visual
modification. In this paper, we propose MINT-CoT, introducing Mathematical
INterleaved Tokens for Chain-of-Thought visual reasoning. MINT-CoT adaptively
interleaves relevant visual tokens into textual reasoning steps via an
Interleave Token, which dynamically selects visual regions of any shapes within
math figures. To empower this capability, we construct the MINT-CoT dataset,
containing 54K mathematical problems aligning each reasoning step with visual
regions at the token level, accompanied by a rigorous data generation pipeline.
We further present a three-stage MINT-CoT training strategy, progressively
combining text-only CoT SFT, interleaved CoT SFT, and interleaved CoT RL, which
derives our MINT-CoT-7B model. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method for effective visual interleaved reasoning in
mathematical domains, where MINT-CoT-7B outperforms the baseline model by
+34.08% on MathVista, +28.78% on GeoQA, and +23.2% on MMStar, respectively. Our
code and data are available at https://github.com/xinyan-cxy/MINT-CoT

TL;DR: The paper introduces VideoMarathon, a large-scale dataset of hour-long videos with detailed annotations, alongside Hour-LLaVA, a model designed for efficient hour-long video-language understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of well-annotated hour-long video datasets and push advancements in long-form video-language modeling.

Method: A large-scale dataset called VideoMarathon with 9,700 hours of annotated videos is created, and Hour-LLaVA employs a memory augmentation module for efficient long-video comprehension.

Result: Hour-LLaVA, trained with VideoMarathon, achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks for long video-language understanding.

Conclusion: The VideoMarathon dataset and Hour-LLaVA model significantly advance hour-long video-language comprehension, offering capabilities for both short- and long-term tasks.

Abstract: Recent long-form video-language understanding benchmarks have driven progress
in video large multimodal models (Video-LMMs). However, the scarcity of
well-annotated long videos has left the training of hour-long Video-LLMs
underexplored. To close this gap, we present VideoMarathon, a large-scale
hour-long video instruction-following dataset. This dataset includes around
9,700 hours of long videos sourced from diverse domains, ranging from 3 to 60
minutes per video. Specifically, it contains 3.3M high-quality QA pairs,
spanning six fundamental topics: temporality, spatiality, object, action,
scene, and event. Compared to existing video instruction datasets,
VideoMarathon significantly extends training video durations up to 1 hour, and
supports 22 diverse tasks requiring both short- and long-term video
comprehension. Building on VideoMarathon, we propose Hour-LLaVA, a powerful and
efficient Video-LMM for hour-scale video-language modeling. It enables
hour-long video training and inference at 1-FPS sampling by leveraging a memory
augmentation module, which adaptively integrates user question-relevant and
spatiotemporal-informative semantics from a cached full video context. In our
experiments, Hour-LLaVA achieves the best performance on multiple long
video-language benchmarks, demonstrating the high quality of the VideoMarathon
dataset and the superiority of the Hour-LLaVA model.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VideoMolmo, a novel multimodal model, enhances spatio-temporal pointing accuracy in videos using textual descriptions. Its design leverages temporal attention mechanisms and a mask fusion pipeline.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video-based models lack sophisticated reasoning capabilities, hindering contextual understanding and generalization in spatio-temporal tasks.

Method: VideoMolmo integrates a temporal module with attention mechanisms for temporal consistency and employs a mask fusion pipeline for coherent segmentation. A curated dataset of 72k video-caption pairs and 100k object points supports training.

Result: VideoMolmo significantly improves spatio-temporal pointing accuracy and reasoning in challenging real-world scenarios and benchmarks.

Conclusion: The model demonstrates substantial improvements in complex tasks, proving its value for broad applications like Cell Tracking, Autonomous Driving, and Robotics.

Abstract: Spatio-temporal localization is vital for precise interactions across diverse
domains, from biological research to autonomous navigation and interactive
interfaces. Current video-based approaches, while proficient in tracking, lack
the sophisticated reasoning capabilities of large language models, limiting
their contextual understanding and generalization. We introduce VideoMolmo, a
large multimodal model tailored for fine-grained spatio-temporal pointing
conditioned on textual descriptions. Building upon the Molmo architecture,
VideoMolmo incorporates a temporal module utilizing an attention mechanism to
condition each frame on preceding frames, ensuring temporal consistency.
Additionally, our novel temporal mask fusion pipeline employs SAM2 for
bidirectional point propagation, significantly enhancing coherence across video
sequences. This two-step decomposition, i.e., first using the LLM to generate
precise pointing coordinates, then relying on a sequential mask-fusion module
to produce coherent segmentation, not only simplifies the task for the language
model but also enhances interpretability. Due to the lack of suitable datasets,
we curate a comprehensive dataset comprising 72k video-caption pairs annotated
with 100k object points. To evaluate the generalization of VideoMolmo, we
introduce VPoS-Bench, a challenging out-of-distribution benchmark spanning five
real-world scenarios: Cell Tracking, Egocentric Vision, Autonomous Driving,
Video-GUI Interaction, and Robotics. We also evaluate our model on Referring
Video Object Segmentation (Refer-VOS) and Reasoning VOS tasks. In comparison to
existing models, VideoMolmo substantially improves spatio-temporal pointing
accuracy and reasoning capability. Our code and models are publicly available

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents a pipeline to remove furniture from indoor textured meshes and panoramic images, creating simpler defurnished versions while retaining quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve visualization and asset creation by generating defurnished indoor scenes with high fidelity, addressing limitations of existing neural radiance fields and RGB-D inpainting methods.

Method: A pipeline first segments and removes furniture from mesh, fills planes and holes, then utilizes Canny edge detection and ControlNet inpainting to guide panorama editing, ensuring consistent geometric information for retexturing the mesh.

Result: The proposed method outperforms existing approaches, avoiding low-resolution and hallucination issues, and producing high-quality defurnished assets.

Conclusion: This approach provides an effective solution for defurnishing indoor scenes while maintaining high geometric and textural quality, setting a new standard over older methods like neural radiance fields and RGB-D inpainting.

Abstract: We present a pipeline for generating defurnished replicas of indoor spaces
represented as textured meshes and corresponding multi-view panoramic images.
To achieve this, we first segment and remove furniture from the mesh
representation, extend planes, and fill holes, obtaining a simplified
defurnished mesh (SDM). This SDM acts as an ``X-ray'' of the scene's underlying
structure, guiding the defurnishing process. We extract Canny edges from depth
and normal images rendered from the SDM. We then use these as a guide to remove
the furniture from panorama images via ControlNet inpainting. This control
signal ensures the availability of global geometric information that may be
hidden from a particular panoramic view by the furniture being removed. The
inpainted panoramas are used to texture the mesh. We show that our approach
produces higher quality assets than methods that rely on neural radiance
fields, which tend to produce blurry low-resolution images, or RGB-D
inpainting, which is highly susceptible to hallucinations.

*Xingjian Ran,Yixuan Li,Linning Xu,Mulin Yu,Bo Dai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces DirectLayout, a framework for synthesizing 3D indoor scene layouts directly from text descriptions, leveraging large language models for spatial reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of generating 3D indoor scenes that are detailed, flexible, and user-instruction-aligned, overcoming limitations like overfitting and reliance on predefined constraints.

Method: DirectLayout employs a three-stage process: generating a Bird's-Eye View (BEV) layout, lifting it to 3D space, and refining object placements, incorporating Chain-of-Thought (CoT) activation and generative layout rewards.

Result: DirectLayout shows strong performance in terms of semantic consistency, generalization, and physical plausibility, as demonstrated by extensive experiments.

Conclusion: DirectLayout successfully enables open-vocabulary, fine-grained user-controlled 3D indoor scene synthesis, emphasizing generalization and spatial reasoning.

Abstract: Realistic 3D indoor scene synthesis is vital for embodied AI and digital
content creation. It can be naturally divided into two subtasks: object
generation and layout generation. While recent generative models have
significantly advanced object-level quality and controllability, layout
generation remains challenging due to limited datasets. Existing methods either
overfit to these datasets or rely on predefined constraints to optimize
numerical layout that sacrifice flexibility. As a result, they fail to generate
scenes that are both open-vocabulary and aligned with fine-grained user
instructions. We introduce DirectLayout, a framework that directly generates
numerical 3D layouts from text descriptions using generalizable spatial
reasoning of large language models (LLMs). DirectLayout decomposes the
generation into three stages: producing a Bird's-Eye View (BEV) layout, lifting
it into 3D space, and refining object placements. To enable explicit spatial
reasoning and help the model grasp basic principles of object placement, we
employ Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Activation based on the 3D-Front dataset.
Additionally, we design CoT-Grounded Generative Layout Reward to enhance
generalization and spatial planning. During inference, DirectLayout addresses
asset-layout mismatches via Iterative Asset-Layout Alignment through in-context
learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DirectLayout achieves
impressive semantic consistency, generalization and physical plausibility.

A novel framework, RAS, is developed to achieve superior performance on various segmentation tasks, supported by new benchmark datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current image segmentation models fail to link visual comprehension with complex language prompts, limiting user-friendly interactions.

Method: The framework 'Refer to Any Segmentation Mask Group' (RAS) enhances multimodal segmentation understanding by incorporating mask-centric approaches. Two datasets, MaskGroups-2M and MaskGroups-HQ, were created for training and benchmarking.

Result: The RAS framework outperforms existing methods in both the introduced ORES task and established RES and GRES tasks according to extensive evaluations.

Conclusion: The integration of language-vision prompts in segmentation demonstrates improved capability, addressing previous limitations with newly designed methods and datasets.

Abstract: Recent image segmentation models have advanced to segment images into
high-quality masks for visual entities, and yet they cannot provide
comprehensive semantic understanding for complex queries based on both language
and vision. This limitation reduces their effectiveness in applications that
require user-friendly interactions driven by vision-language prompts. To bridge
this gap, we introduce a novel task of omnimodal referring expression
segmentation (ORES). In this task, a model produces a group of masks based on
arbitrary prompts specified by text only or text plus reference visual
entities. To address this new challenge, we propose a novel framework to "Refer
to Any Segmentation Mask Group" (RAS), which augments segmentation models with
complex multimodal interactions and comprehension via a mask-centric large
multimodal model. For training and benchmarking ORES models, we create datasets
MaskGroups-2M and MaskGroups-HQ to include diverse mask groups specified by
text and reference entities. Through extensive evaluation, we demonstrate
superior performance of RAS on our new ORES task, as well as classic referring
expression segmentation (RES) and generalized referring expression segmentation
(GRES) tasks. Project page: https://Ref2Any.github.io.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper investigates attention mechanisms in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) and introduces SparseMM, a KV-Cache optimization strategy, leveraging sparsity in visual attention heads to achieve faster and memory-efficient inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To better understand how MLLMs process visual inputs and exploit this understanding to enhance computational efficiency.

Method: The authors analyze head-level visual relevance in attention mechanisms of MLLMs using a training-free framework and develop SparseMM, a KV-Cache strategy that allocates computation budgets based on visual scores.

Result: SparseMM achieves 1.38x acceleration and 52% memory savings during inference while retaining competitive performance on multiple mainstream multimodal benchmarks.

Conclusion: Sparsity in visual attention heads can be effectively leveraged for improving the efficiency of MLLMs without compromising their performance.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are commonly derived by extending
pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) with visual capabilities. In this
work, we investigate how MLLMs process visual inputs by analyzing their
attention mechanisms. We reveal a surprising sparsity phenomenon: only a small
subset (approximately less than 5%) of attention heads in LLMs actively
contribute to visual understanding, termed visual heads. To identify these
heads efficiently, we design a training-free framework that quantifies
head-level visual relevance through targeted response analysis. Building on
this discovery, we introduce SparseMM, a KV-Cache optimization strategy that
allocates asymmetric computation budgets to heads in LLMs based on their visual
scores, leveraging the sparity of visual heads for accelerating the inference
of MLLMs. Compared with prior KV-Cache acceleration methods that ignore the
particularity of visual, SparseMM prioritizes stress and retaining visual
semantics during decoding. Extensive evaluations across mainstream multimodal
benchmarks demonstrate that SparseMM achieves superior accuracy-efficiency
trade-offs. Notably, SparseMM delivers 1.38x real-time acceleration and 52%
memory reduction during generation while maintaining performance parity on
efficiency test. Our project is open sourced at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve 3D reconstruction and light transport modeling by overcoming limitations caused by strong indirect light using multi-viewpoint video measurements.

Method: It extends neural radiance caching to be time-resolved, capturing infinite-bounce radiance for accurate handling of direct and indirect light transport.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art 3D reconstruction, view synthesis, and decomposition of direct/indirect light components from flash lidar data.

Conclusion: The system significantly enhances capabilities in light transport modeling, enabling novel applications such as time-resolved relighting.

Abstract: We present the first system for physically based, neural inverse rendering
from multi-viewpoint videos of propagating light. Our approach relies on a
time-resolved extension of neural radiance caching -- a technique that
accelerates inverse rendering by storing infinite-bounce radiance arriving at
any point from any direction. The resulting model accurately accounts for
direct and indirect light transport effects and, when applied to captured
measurements from a flash lidar system, enables state-of-the-art 3D
reconstruction in the presence of strong indirect light. Further, we
demonstrate view synthesis of propagating light, automatic decomposition of
captured measurements into direct and indirect components, as well as novel
capabilities such as multi-view time-resolved relighting of captured scenes.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces FreeTimeGS, a method to improve rendering quality in dynamic 3D scene reconstruction with complex motions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle to handle complex motions in dynamic 3D scenes due to optimization difficulties in deformation fields.

Method: FreeTimeGS uses a novel 4D representation where Gaussian primitives can appear at arbitrary times and locations, combined with a motion function to reduce temporal redundancy.

Result: FreeTimeGS significantly outperforms recent methods in rendering quality across several datasets.

Conclusion: FreeTimeGS enhances the flexibility and capability of modeling dynamic 3D scenes, effectively handling complex motions.

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of reconstructing dynamic 3D scenes with
complex motions. Some recent works define 3D Gaussian primitives in the
canonical space and use deformation fields to map canonical primitives to
observation spaces, achieving real-time dynamic view synthesis. However, these
methods often struggle to handle scenes with complex motions due to the
difficulty of optimizing deformation fields. To overcome this problem, we
propose FreeTimeGS, a novel 4D representation that allows Gaussian primitives
to appear at arbitrary time and locations. In contrast to canonical Gaussian
primitives, our representation possesses the strong flexibility, thus improving
the ability to model dynamic 3D scenes. In addition, we endow each Gaussian
primitive with an motion function, allowing it to move to neighboring regions
over time, which reduces the temporal redundancy. Experiments results on
several datasets show that the rendering quality of our method outperforms
recent methods by a large margin.

TL;DR: VideoMathQA evaluates multimodal mathematical reasoning in videos by testing models across visual, auditory, and textual contexts to solve complex, temporally-extended problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal mathematical reasoning in real-world videos requires understanding noisy, complex data across visual, auditory, and textual streams — a limitation in current AI models.

Method: Introduce VideoMathQA as a benchmark spanning 10 domains and multimodal contexts, with expert annotations and structured challenges, to assess reasoning capabilities.

Result: VideoMathQA identifies weaknesses in existing models by providing systematic evaluation of cross-modal mathematical problem-solving across diverse contexts.

Conclusion: VideoMathQA establishes a framework for improving AI's ability to reason in complex real-world video-based scenarios, emphasizing reasoning over perception.

Abstract: Mathematical reasoning in real-world video settings presents a fundamentally
different challenge than in static images or text. It requires interpreting
fine-grained visual information, accurately reading handwritten or digital
text, and integrating spoken cues, often dispersed non-linearly over time. In
such multimodal contexts, success hinges not just on perception, but on
selectively identifying and integrating the right contextual details from a
rich and noisy stream of content. To this end, we introduce VideoMathQA, a
benchmark designed to evaluate whether models can perform such temporally
extended cross-modal reasoning on videos. The benchmark spans 10 diverse
mathematical domains, covering videos ranging from 10 seconds to over 1 hour.
It requires models to interpret structured visual content, understand
instructional narratives, and jointly ground concepts across visual, audio, and
textual modalities. We employ graduate-level experts to ensure high quality,
totaling over $920$ man-hours of annotation. To reflect real-world scenarios,
questions are designed around three core reasoning challenges: direct problem
solving, where answers are grounded in the presented question; conceptual
transfer, which requires applying learned methods to new problems; and deep
instructional comprehension, involving multi-step reasoning over extended
explanations and partially worked-out solutions. Each question includes
multi-step reasoning annotations, enabling fine-grained diagnosis of model
capabilities. Through this benchmark, we highlight the limitations of existing
approaches and establish a systematic evaluation framework for models that must
reason, rather than merely perceive, across temporally extended and
modality-rich mathematical problem settings. Our benchmark and evaluation code
are available at: https://mbzuai-oryx.github.io/VideoMathQA

### [260] [Contrastive Flow Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05350)
*George Stoica,Vivek Ramanujan,Xiang Fan,Ali Farhadi,Ranjay Krishna,Judy Hoffman*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study proposes Contrastive Flow Matching, enhancing conditional flow models with a contrastive objective to ensure flow uniqueness and condition separation, achieving faster training, reduced de-noising steps, and better results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conditional flow models often face challenges with ambiguity due to overlapping flows from different conditions, reducing the generative quality. The motivation is to improve condition separation and reduce ambiguity for better results.

Method: The method extends the flow-matching objective by adding a contrastive objective, which maximizes dissimilarities across flows of arbitrary sample pairs, ensuring conditional uniqueness.

Result: The proposed approach demonstrated improvements across benchmarks like ImageNet-1k and CC3M, showing 9x faster training, up to 5x fewer de-noising steps, and a significantly lower FID score by 8.9.

Conclusion: Contrastive Flow Matching outperformed traditional flow matching methods in conditional settings, proving efficient and effective, with potential applications for high-quality, resource-efficient generative models.

Abstract: Unconditional flow-matching trains diffusion models to transport samples from
a source distribution to a target distribution by enforcing that the flows
between sample pairs are unique. However, in conditional settings (e.g.,
class-conditioned models), this uniqueness is no longer guaranteed--flows from
different conditions may overlap, leading to more ambiguous generations. We
introduce Contrastive Flow Matching, an extension to the flow matching
objective that explicitly enforces uniqueness across all conditional flows,
enhancing condition separation. Our approach adds a contrastive objective that
maximizes dissimilarities between predicted flows from arbitrary sample pairs.
We validate Contrastive Flow Matching by conducting extensive experiments
across varying model architectures on both class-conditioned (ImageNet-1k) and
text-to-image (CC3M) benchmarks. Notably, we find that training models with
Contrastive Flow Matching (1) improves training speed by a factor of up to 9x,
(2) requires up to 5x fewer de-noising steps and (3) lowers FID by up to 8.9
compared to training the same models with flow matching. We release our code
at: https://github.com/gstoica27/DeltaFM.git.

*Preethika Pradeep,Eyhab Al-Masri*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper introduces GreenPod, a TOPSIS-based Kubernetes scheduler that optimizes energy efficiency and performance for AIoT workloads in heterogeneous environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of multi-criteria optimization in Kubernetes' default scheduler, especially in terms of energy efficiency and workload orchestration for AIoT applications.

Method: The authors developed GreenPod, which uses the TOPSIS (Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution) methodology to optimize pod placement based on multiple criteria such as execution time, energy consumption, core and memory availability, and resource balance.

Result: GreenPod demonstrated improved energy efficiency, achieving up to 39.1% energy savings over the Kubernetes default scheduler when tested on a heterogeneous Google Kubernetes cluster.

Conclusion: GreenPod provides a practical solution to enhance sustainability and performance for AIoT workloads by optimizing scheduling with multi-criteria evaluation, despite minor latency trade-offs.

Abstract: AIoT workloads demand energy-efficient orchestration across cloud-edge
infrastructures, but Kubernetes' default scheduler lacks multi-criteria
optimization for heterogeneous environments. This paper presents GreenPod, a
TOPSIS-based scheduler optimizing pod placement based on execution time, energy
consumption, processing core, memory availability, and resource balance. Tested
on a heterogeneous Google Kubernetes cluster, GreenPod improves energy
efficiency by up to 39.1% over the default Kubernetes (K8s) scheduler,
particularly with energy-centric weighting schemes. Medium complexity workloads
showed the highest energy savings, despite slight scheduling latency. GreenPod
effectively balances sustainability and performance for AIoT applications.

*Aayush Gupta,Gopal Pandurangan*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper presents a distributed protocol for maintaining sparse, resilient P2P topologies with high expansion under high churn and Byzantine node presence, enabling robust distributed computing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of constructing and maintaining dynamic P2P network topologies with properties like low diameter and high expansion, even amidst high churn and numerous Byzantine nodes.

Method: A randomized, fully-distributed protocol is proposed, which uses local initial knowledge to maintain constant degree graphs with high expansion under adversarial conditions.

Result: The protocol achieves resilience against up to $o(n/poly\log(n))$ Byzantine nodes, ensures efficient topology maintenance with polylogarithmic overhead per node, and supports robust algorithms for distributed computing tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed protocol provides a scalable and efficient foundation for solving critical distributed computing problems in dynamic and adversarial P2P networks.

Abstract: We address a fundamental problem in Peer-to-Peer (P2P) networks, namely,
constructing and maintaining dynamic P2P overlay network topologies with
essential properties such as connectivity, low diameter, and high expansion,
that are resilient to continuous high churn and the presence of a large number
of malicious (Byzantine) nodes. Our main goal is to construct and maintain a
sparse (bounded degree) expander topology despite high churn and a large number
of Byzantine nodes. Such an expander topology has logarithmic diameter, high
expansion, and is robust to churn and the presence of a large number of bad
nodes, and facilitates efficient and robust algorithms for fundamental problems
in distributed computing, such as agreement, broadcasting, routing, etc.
  Our main contribution is a randomized, fully-distributed dynamic P2P protocol
that works with only local initial knowledge and guarantees, with a high
probability, the maintenance of a constant degree graph with high expansion
even under continuous churn and in the presence of a large number of Byzantine
nodes. Our protocol can tolerate up to $o(n/poly\log(n))$ Byzantine nodes
(where $n$ is the stable network size). Our protocol is efficient, lightweight,
and scalable, and it incurs only $O(poly\log(n))$ overhead for topology
maintenance: only polylogarithmic (in $n$) bits need to be processed and sent
by each honest node per round, and any honest node's computation cost per round
is also polylogarithmic.
  Our protocol can be used as a building block for solving fundamental
distributed computing problems in highly dynamic networks, such as Byzantine
agreement and Byzantine leader election, and enables fast and scalable
algorithms for these problems.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel method, KATO, combining deep learning and iterative optimization for efficient task offloading in vehicle edge computing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current task offloading methods in vehicle edge computing are often computationally expensive or yield suboptimal solutions.

Method: The proposed method, KATO, uses an attention-inspired encoder-decoder to select RSUs and an iterative algorithm for task allocation optimization.

Result: Simulations validate KATO's ability to achieve optimal or near-optimal task processing times while maintaining low computational overhead across diverse network settings.

Conclusion: KATO effectively combines learning-based techniques and optimization for efficient, scalable task offloading in vehicle edge computing environments.

Abstract: Vehicle edge computing (VEC) brings abundant computing resources close to
vehicles by deploying them at roadside units (RSUs) or base stations, thereby
enabling diverse computation-intensive and delay sensitive applications.
Existing task offloading strategies are often computationally expensive to
execute or generate suboptimal solutions. In this paper, we propose a novel
learning-based approach, Knowledge-guided Attention-inspired Task Offloading
(KATO), designed to efficiently offload tasks from moving vehicles to nearby
RSUs. KATO integrates an attention-inspired encoder-decoder model for selecting
a subset of RSUs that can reduce overall task processing time, along with an
efficient iterative algorithm for computing optimal task allocation among the
selected RSUs. Simulation results demonstrate that KATO achieves optimal or
near-optimal performance with significantly lower computational overhead and
generalizes well across networks of varying sizes and configurations.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: FlashDMoE is a fully GPU-resident Mixture-of-Experts operator that resolves challenges in latency, GPU utilization, and scaling inefficiencies by integrating a persistent GPU kernel that improves expert computation and inter-GPU communication.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models suffer from inefficiencies like low GPU utilization, high latency, and an inability to exploit task locality due to CPU-managed constraints, necessitating a more efficient, GPU-native solution.

Method: FlashDMoE was developed as a GPU-resident operator that combines expert computation and inter-GPU communication into a single persistent GPU kernel, enabling fine-grained pipelining of critical phases and introducing payload-efficient device-initiated communication.

Result: FlashDMoE achieves up to 6x lower latency, 5.7x higher throughput, 4x better weak scaling efficiency, and 9x higher GPU utilization than state-of-the-art approaches, even using FP32, over an 8-H100 GPU node.

Conclusion: FlashDMoE demonstrates the power of GPU kernel-hardware co-design for achieving significant performance improvements in large-scale distributed ML workloads.

Abstract: The computational sparsity of Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models enables
sub-linear growth in compute cost as model size increases, offering a scalable
path to training massive neural networks. However, existing implementations
suffer from \emph{low GPU utilization}, \emph{significant latency overhead},
and a fundamental \emph{inability to leverage task locality}, primarily due to
CPU-managed scheduling, host-initiated communication, and frequent kernel
launches. To overcome these limitations, we develop FlashDMoE, a fully
GPU-resident MoE operator that fuses expert computation and inter-GPU
communication into a \emph{single persistent GPU kernel}. FlashDMoE enables
fine-grained pipelining of dispatch, compute, and combine phases, eliminating
launch overheads and reducing idle gaps. Its device-initiated communication
protocol introduces \emph{payload-efficient} data transfers, significantly
shrinking buffer sizes in sparsely activated MoE layers. When evaluated on a
single 8-H100 GPU node with MoE models having up to 128 experts and 16K token
sequences, FlashDMoE achieves up to \textbf{6}x lower latency, \textbf{5,7}x
higher throughput, \textbf{4}x better weak scaling efficiency, and \textbf{9}x
higher GPU utilization compared to state-of-the-art baselines, despite using
FP32 while baselines use FP16. FlashDMoE demonstrates that principled GPU
kernel-hardware co-design is key to unlocking the performance ceiling of
large-scale distributed ML workloads.

### [268] [Improved Byzantine Agreement under an Adaptive Adversary](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04919)
*Fabien Dufoulon,Gopal Pandurangan*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new synchronous randomized Byzantine agreement protocol for adaptive adversaries, improving the round complexity compared to previous works.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance protocols for Byzantine agreement under adaptive adversaries, where prior methods faced limitations in efficiency and adversary resilience.

Method: The study proposes a randomized protocol using assumptions of adaptive rushing adversaries with full information access.

Result: The protocol achieves a round complexity of $O(\min\{t^2\log n/n, t/\log n\})$, surpassing earlier protocols with $O(t/\log n)$ complexity.

Conclusion: This work significantly advances Byzantine agreement protocols by reducing round complexity under challenging adversarial conditions.

Abstract: Byzantine agreement is a fundamental problem in fault-tolerant distributed
computing that has been studied intensively for the last four decades. Much of
the research has focused on a static Byzantine adversary, where the adversary
is constrained to choose the Byzantine nodes in advance of the protocol's
execution. This work focuses on the harder case of an adaptive Byzantine
adversary that can choose the Byzantine nodes \emph{adaptively} based on the
protocol's execution. While efficient $O(\log n)$-round protocols ($n$ is the
total number of nodes) are known for the static adversary (Goldwasser, Pavlov,
and Vaikuntanathan, FOCS 2006) tolerating up to $t < n/(3+\epsilon)$ Byzantine
nodes, $\Omega(t/\sqrt{n \log n})$ rounds is a well-known lower bound for
adaptive adversary [Bar-Joseph and Ben-Or, PODC 1998]. The best-known protocol
for adaptive adversary runs in $O(t/\log n)$ rounds [Chor and Coan, IEEE Trans.
Soft. Engg., 1985].
  This work presents a synchronous randomized Byzantine agreement protocol
under an adaptive adversary that improves over previous results. Our protocol
works under the powerful \emph{adaptive rushing adversary in the full
information model}. That is, we assume that the Byzantine nodes can behave
arbitrarily and maliciously, have knowledge about the entire state of the
network at every round, including random choices made by all the nodes up to
and including the current round, have unlimited computational power, and may
collude among themselves. Furthermore, the adversary can \emph{adaptively}
corrupt up to $t < n/3$ nodes based on the protocol's execution. We present a
simple randomized Byzantine agreement protocol that runs in $O(\min\{t^2\log
n/n, t/\log n\})$ rounds that improves over the long-standing bound of
$O(t/\log n)$ rounds due to Chor and Coan [IEEE Trans. Soft. Engg., 1985].

*Ivan Vegner,Sydelle de Souza,Valentin Forch,Martha Lewis,Leonidas A. A. Doumas*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper studies systematicity in machine learning (ML) models, focusing on the distinction between systematicity of representations and behavior. It reviews benchmarks for behavioral systematicity and suggests directions to assess representational systematicity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhancing systematic generalization in ML models is key for allowing them to apply learned knowledge in novel situations. Despite prior work focusing on behavioral systematicity, there remains a lack of attention to systematicity in representations, which is crucial for addressing Fodor and Pylyshyn's challenge.

Method: The paper revisits Hadley's (1994) taxonomy on systematic generalization and evaluates existing benchmarks in language and vision for their coverage of behavioral systematicity. It also explores methods from mechanistic interpretability to assess systematicity of representations.

Result: Key benchmarks in the literature mainly assess behavioral systematicity, often neglecting systematicity of representations. The authors propose alternative approaches for evaluating representations in line with practices from mechanistic interpretability.

Conclusion: A clear distinction between systematicity of representations and behavior is necessary. Future benchmarks and models should more comprehensively address representational systematicity to advance the field of systematic generalization in ML.

Abstract: A core aspect of compositionality, systematicity is a desirable property in
ML models as it enables strong generalization to novel contexts. This has led
to numerous studies proposing benchmarks to assess systematic generalization,
as well as models and training regimes designed to enhance it. Many of these
efforts are framed as addressing the challenge posed by Fodor and Pylyshyn.
However, while they argue for systematicity of representations, existing
benchmarks and models primarily focus on the systematicity of behaviour. We
emphasize the crucial nature of this distinction. Furthermore, building on
Hadley's (1994) taxonomy of systematic generalization, we analyze the extent to
which behavioural systematicity is tested by key benchmarks in the literature
across language and vision. Finally, we highlight ways of assessing
systematicity of representations in ML models as practiced in the field of
mechanistic interpretability.

### [270] [Clustering and Median Aggregation Improve Differentially Private Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04566)
*Kareem Amin,Salman Avestimehr,Sara Babakniya,Alex Bie,Weiwei Kong,Natalia Ponomareva,Umar Syed*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents an improved method for generating high-quality synthetic text under differential privacy (DP), addressing limitations in prior approaches through data clustering and a new median-based aggregation algorithm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of uniform sampling in DP language model inference, specifically the degradation in text quality when generating privately synthesized data from heterogeneous input topics.

Method: The researchers propose clustering input data before creating inference batches, and introduce a median-based aggregation algorithm for next-token prediction to reduce local sensitivity and achieve data-dependent DP guarantees.

Result: The proposed method enhances representativeness metrics like MAUVE and demonstrates superior downstream task performance, producing high-quality synthetic data at a lower privacy cost compared to previous methods.

Conclusion: The clustering and median-based aggregation approach effectively improves the quality of DP-synthetic text generation while maintaining strong privacy guarantees, offering a better alternative over prior state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Differentially private (DP) language model inference is an approach for
generating private synthetic text. A sensitive input example is used to prompt
an off-the-shelf large language model (LLM) to produce a similar example.
Multiple examples can be aggregated together to formally satisfy the DP
guarantee.
  Prior work creates inference batches by sampling sensitive inputs uniformly
at random. We show that uniform sampling degrades the quality of privately
generated text, especially when the sensitive examples concern heterogeneous
topics.
  We remedy this problem by clustering the input data before selecting
inference batches. Next, we observe that clustering also leads to more similar
next-token predictions across inferences. We use this insight to introduce a
new algorithm that aggregates next token statistics by privately computing
medians instead of averages. This approach leverages the fact that the median
has decreased local sensitivity when next token predictions are similar,
allowing us to state a data-dependent and ex-post DP guarantee about the
privacy properties of this algorithm. Finally, we demonstrate improvements in
terms of representativeness metrics (e.g., MAUVE) as well as downstream task
performance. We show that our method produces high-quality synthetic data at
significantly lower privacy cost than a previous state-of-the-art method.

Motivation: Safeguarding user privacy while extracting meaningful insights from LLM chatbot interactions.

Method: Urania utilizes private clustering, keyword extraction methods (frequency, TF-IDF, LLM-guided), differential privacy tools, and empirical privacy evaluations.

Result: Urania successfully extracts conversational insights with strong privacy protections compared to non-private methods.

Conclusion: The framework achieves a balance between data utility and privacy, advancing private conversational analysis techniques.

Abstract: We introduce $Urania$, a novel framework for generating insights about LLM
chatbot interactions with rigorous differential privacy (DP) guarantees. The
framework employs a private clustering mechanism and innovative keyword
extraction methods, including frequency-based, TF-IDF-based, and LLM-guided
approaches. By leveraging DP tools such as clustering, partition selection, and
histogram-based summarization, $Urania$ provides end-to-end privacy protection.
Our evaluation assesses lexical and semantic content preservation, pair
similarity, and LLM-based metrics, benchmarking against a non-private
Clio-inspired pipeline (Tamkin et al., 2024). Moreover, we develop a simple
empirical privacy evaluation that demonstrates the enhanced robustness of our
DP pipeline. The results show the framework's ability to extract meaningful
conversational insights while maintaining stringent user privacy, effectively
balancing data utility with privacy preservation.

Motivation: To address the challenges of managing complex, heterogeneous patient data and enable personalized care by creating a holistic understanding of patient health.

Method: The authors developed EHR2Path, a pathway prediction model transforming EHR data into structured representations with a novel temporal summary mechanism for token efficiency.

Result: EHR2Path outperformed competitive baselines in time-step prediction and simulations, showcasing adaptability across tasks like forecasting vital signs and patient stay duration.

Conclusion: EHR2Path's capabilities advance predictive modeling and personalized healthcare by leveraging holistic representations of EHR data.

Abstract: Healthcare systems face significant challenges in managing and interpreting
vast, heterogeneous patient data for personalized care. Existing approaches
often focus on narrow use cases with a limited feature space, overlooking the

structured representation and designing a holistic pathway prediction model,
EHR2Path, optimized to predict future health trajectories. Further, we
introduce a novel summary mechanism that embeds long-term temporal context into
topic-specific summary tokens, improving performance over text-only models,
while being much more token-efficient. EHR2Path demonstrates strong performance
in both next time-step prediction and longitudinal simulation, outperforming
competitive baselines. It enables detailed simulations of patient trajectories,
inherently targeting diverse evaluation tasks, such as forecasting vital signs,
lab test results, or length-of-stay, opening a path towards predictive and
personalized healthcare.

TL;DR: The paper investigates reinforcement learning (RL) for long-context reasoning models, focusing on three aspects: the impact of positive and negative samples, data inefficiency, and performance instability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address open questions and counterintuitive behaviors in training long-context reasoning models using RL and improve their generalization, robustness, efficiency, and stability.

Method: The authors conducted systematic analysis on sample roles, explored strategies for addressing data inefficiency, and examined performance instability across models and benchmarks.

Result: Positive samples help with data fitting, while negative samples enhance generalization and robustness. Training solely on negative samples achieves competitive performance. Data inefficiency was identified, and strategies like relative length rewards and offline sample injection improved reasoning efficiency. Multiple evaluation runs reduced performance instability.

Conclusion: Negative samples are key to generalization. Addressing data inefficiency and instability improves RL for reasoning models, enhancing their robustness and reliability.

Abstract: Despite recent progress in training long-context reasoning models via
reinforcement learning (RL), several open questions and counterintuitive
behaviors remain. This work focuses on three key aspects: (1) We systematically
analyze the roles of positive and negative samples in RL, revealing that
positive samples mainly facilitate data fitting, whereas negative samples
significantly enhance generalization and robustness. Interestingly, training
solely on negative samples can rival standard RL training performance. (2) We
identify substantial data inefficiency in group relative policy optimization,
where over half of the samples yield zero advantage. To address this, we
explore two straightforward strategies, including relative length rewards and
offline sample injection, to better leverage these data and enhance reasoning
efficiency and capability. (3) We investigate unstable performance across
various reasoning models and benchmarks, attributing instability to uncertain
problems with ambiguous outcomes, and demonstrate that multiple evaluation runs
mitigate this issue.

*Jingyu Hu,Hongbo Bo,Jun Hong,Xiaowei Liu,Weiru Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses degree bias in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) during node classification tasks. Using the Hardness Adaptive Reweighted (HAR) contrastive loss and a framework named SHARP, they mitigate bias and achieve improved performance across datasets compared to baseline approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) exhibit degree bias, where nodes with varying degrees show differing classification performance. Existing Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL)-based approaches haven’t sufficiently resolved this due to limitations in positive pair generation and uniform weighting of pairs.

Method: The authors introduce Hardness Adaptive Reweighted (HAR) contrastive loss, which increases positive pairs by using node labels and applies adaptive weighting based on the difficulty of learning those pairs. Additionally, they develop the SHARP experimental framework to apply HAR across diverse scenarios.

Result: Theoretical analysis and experimental evaluations confirm the effectiveness of SHARP. Experimental results across four datasets show enhanced performance at both global scale and for nodes with varying degrees compared to baseline methods.

Conclusion: HAR and SHARP successfully mitigate degree bias in GNNs, improving classification performance for nodes with different degrees and outperforming baseline methods in various scenarios.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) often suffer from degree bias in node
classification tasks, where prediction performance varies across nodes with
different degrees. Several approaches, which adopt Graph Contrastive Learning
(GCL), have been proposed to mitigate this bias. However, the limited number of
positive pairs and the equal weighting of all positives and negatives in GCL
still lead to low-degree nodes acquiring insufficient and noisy information.
This paper proposes the Hardness Adaptive Reweighted (HAR) contrastive loss to
mitigate degree bias. It adds more positive pairs by leveraging node labels and
adaptively weights positive and negative pairs based on their learning
hardness. In addition, we develop an experimental framework named SHARP to
extend HAR to a broader range of scenarios. Both our theoretical analysis and
experiments validate the effectiveness of SHARP. The experimental results
across four datasets show that SHARP achieves better performance against

### [275] [Diagonal Batching Unlocks Parallelism in Recurrent Memory Transformers for Long Contexts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05229)
*Danil Sivtsov,Ivan Rodkin,Gleb Kuzmin,Yuri Kuratov,Ivan Oseledets*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses the limitations of Recurrent Memory Transformers (RMTs) in efficiently handling long contexts by introducing a method called Diagonal Batching. This technique improves inference speed and reduces latency without requiring retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer models, particularly Recurrent Memory Transformers (RMTs), face challenges with handling long contexts efficiently due to sequential execution bottlenecks, despite their linear time and constant memory advantages.

Method: The authors propose Diagonal Batching, a scheduling scheme that introduces parallelism in RMTs by reordering computations at runtime. This preserves exact recurrence and eliminates the need for sequential processing.

Result: The Diagonal Batching method achieves a 3.3x speedup compared to full-attention LLaMA-1B models and a 1.8x speedup compared to sequential RMT implementations when applied to 131,072-token sequences.

Conclusion: Diagonal Batching significantly reduces inference latency and cost, making RMTs more practical for real-world applications requiring long-context processing.

Abstract: Transformer models struggle with long-context inference due to their
quadratic time and linear memory complexity. Recurrent Memory Transformers
(RMTs) offer a solution by reducing the asymptotic cost to linear time and
constant memory usage. However, their memory update mechanism leads to
sequential execution, causing a performance bottleneck.
  We introduce Diagonal Batching, a scheduling scheme that unlocks parallelism
across segments in RMTs while preserving exact recurrence. This approach
eliminates the sequential constraint, enabling efficient GPU inference even for
single long-context inputs without complex batching and pipelining techniques.
Because the technique is purely a run-time computation reordering, existing RMT
models adopt it with no retraining.
  Applied to a LLaMA-1B ARMT model, Diagonal Batching yields a 3.3x speedup
over standard full-attention LLaMA-1B and a 1.8x speedup over the sequential
RMT implementation on 131,072-token sequences. By removing sequential
bottleneck, Diagonal Batching reduces inference cost and latency, thereby
strengthening RMTs as a practical solution for real-world, long-context
applications.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The authors propose a new recurrent layer for language modeling that leverages in-context optimization with a fast conjugate gradient solver, achieving better performance yet with increased test-time compute.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of causal transformers in terms of memory and compute scaling during inference and improve long-context understanding performance in sequence modeling.

Method: The paper introduces a numerically stable, chunkwise parallelizable Mesa layer derived from in-context optimization, leveraging a fast conjugate gradient solver for recurrent layer computations.

Result: Experimentally, the proposed method achieves lower perplexities and higher performance on downstream benchmarks compared to prior RNNs, especially in tasks demanding long-context understanding.

Conclusion: The findings highlight the trade-off between increased test-time compute and improved performance, aligning with trends of leveraging more compute during inference for enhanced model capabilities.

Abstract: Sequence modeling is currently dominated by causal transformer architectures
that use softmax self-attention. Although widely adopted, transformers require
scaling memory and compute linearly during inference. A recent stream of work
linearized the softmax operation, resulting in powerful recurrent neural
network (RNN) models with constant memory and compute costs such as DeltaNet,
Mamba or xLSTM. These models can be unified by noting that their recurrent
layer dynamics can all be derived from an in-context regression objective,
approximately optimized through an online learning rule. Here, we join this
line of work and introduce a numerically stable, chunkwise parallelizable
version of the recently proposed Mesa layer (von Oswald et al., 2024), and
study it in language modeling at the billion-parameter scale. This layer again
stems from an in-context loss, but which is now minimized to optimality at
every time point using a fast conjugate gradient solver. Through an extensive
suite of experiments, we show that optimal test-time training enables reaching
lower language modeling perplexity and higher downstream benchmark performance
than previous RNNs, especially on tasks requiring long context understanding.
This performance gain comes at the cost of additional flops spent during
inference time. Our results are therefore intriguingly related to recent trends
of increasing test-time compute to improve performance -- here by spending
compute to solve sequential optimization problems within the neural network
itself.

*Yifan Sun,Jingyan Shen,Yibin Wang,Tianyu Chen,Zhendong Wang,Mingyuan Zhou,Huan Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces techniques to improve data efficiency during RL fine-tuning of large language models, significantly reducing computation costs while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the resource-intensive challenge of RL fine-tuning for LLMs by improving data efficiency, which has been largely overlooked in existing work.

Method: Two techniques are proposed: (1) adaptive difficulty-targeted online data selection using an attention-based framework, and (2) rollout replay to reuse recent rollouts, reducing computation for stable updates.

Result: Experiments across 6 LLM-dataset combinations showed reduced RL fine-tuning time by 25% to 65%, achieving equivalent performance compared to the original GRPO algorithm.

Conclusion: The proposed techniques demonstrate significant improvements in data efficiency and computational cost reduction for RL fine-tuning of LLMs, offering practical benefits for resource-intensive tasks.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become an effective approach for fine-tuning
large language models (LLMs), particularly to enhance their reasoning
capabilities. However, RL fine-tuning remains highly resource-intensive, and
existing work has largely overlooked the problem of data efficiency. In this
paper, we propose two techniques to improve data efficiency in LLM RL
fine-tuning: difficulty-targeted online data selection and rollout replay. We
introduce the notion of adaptive difficulty to guide online data selection,
prioritizing questions of moderate difficulty that are more likely to yield
informative learning signals. To estimate adaptive difficulty efficiently, we
develop an attention-based framework that requires rollouts for only a small
reference set of questions. The adaptive difficulty of the remaining questions
is then estimated based on their similarity to this set. To further reduce
rollout cost, we introduce a rollout replay mechanism that reuses recent
rollouts, lowering per-step computation while maintaining stable updates.
Extensive experiments across 6 LLM-dataset combinations show that our method
reduces RL fine-tuning time by 25% to 65% to reach the same level of
performance as the original GRPO algorithm.

*Ranajoy Sadhukhan,Zhuoming Chen,Haizhong Zheng,Yang Zhou,Emma Strubell,Beidi Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Kinetics Scaling Law, emphasizing that larger models are more efficient during test-time compute due to attention costs and proposes sparse attention for better performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the overestimation of smaller model efficiency during inference, highlighting the overlooked memory bottlenecks in test-time scaling strategies.

Method: The study performs a comprehensive analysis across models varying from 0.6B to 32B parameters, introducing the Kinetics Scaling Law that integrates both computation and memory access costs. Additionally, it proposes a sparse attention framework for enhanced efficiency.

Result: Sparse attention models outperform dense counterparts, yielding over 60-point gains in low-cost regimes and over 5-point gains in high-cost regimes for problem-solving accuracy.

Conclusion: The research demonstrates that sparse attention is integral to optimizing test-time scaling, as it provides superior accuracy and efficiency compared to dense attention models.

Abstract: We rethink test-time scaling laws from a practical efficiency perspective,
revealing that the effectiveness of smaller models is significantly
overestimated. Prior work, grounded in compute-optimality, overlooks critical
memory access bottlenecks introduced by inference-time strategies (e.g.,
Best-of-$N$, long CoTs). Our holistic analysis, spanning models from 0.6B to
32B parameters, reveals a new Kinetics Scaling Law that better guides resource
allocation by incorporating both computation and memory access costs. Kinetics
Scaling Law suggests that test-time compute is more effective when used on
models above a threshold than smaller ones. A key reason is that in TTS,
attention, rather than parameter count, emerges as the dominant cost factor.
Motivated by this, we propose a new scaling paradigm centered on sparse
attention, which lowers per-token cost and enables longer generations and more
parallel samples within the same resource budget. Empirically, we show that
sparse attention models consistently outperform dense counterparts, achieving
over 60 points gains in low-cost regimes and over 5 points gains in high-cost
regimes for problem-solving accuracy on AIME, encompassing evaluations on
state-of-the-art MoEs. These results suggest that sparse attention is essential
for realizing the full potential of test-time scaling because, unlike training,
where parameter scaling saturates, test-time accuracy continues to improve
through increased generation. The code is available at

*Adrian Łańcucki,Konrad Staniszewski,Piotr Nawrot,Edoardo M. Ponti*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes Dynamic Memory Sparsification (DMS) to compress key-value caches in Transformer LLMs, enabling inference-time hyper-scaling and improving accuracy without exceeding compute budgets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the computational bottleneck in Transformer LLMs due to key-value cache size and explore mechanisms for scaling inference-time efficiency and accuracy.

Method: Introduce Dynamic Memory Sparsification (DMS) to compress key-value caches by delaying token eviction and merging representations for high compression accuracy.

Result: DMS achieves 8× compression with minimal training steps while maintaining superior accuracy, boosting various LLMs like Qwen-R1 32B in tasks such as AIME, GPQA, and LiveCodeBench.

Conclusion: DMS demonstrates a practical solution for inference-time hyper-scaling, enhancing reasoning accuracy for comparable computational constraints, making it viable for broader adoption in LLM applications.

Abstract: Inference-time scaling trades efficiency for increased reasoning accuracy by
generating longer or more parallel sequences. However, in Transformer LLMs,
generation cost is bottlenecked by the size of the key-value (KV) cache, rather
than the number of generated tokens. Hence, we explore inference-time
hyper-scaling: by compressing the KV cache, we can generate more tokens within
the same compute budget and further improve the accuracy of scaled inference.
The success of this approach, however, hinges on the ability of compression
methods to preserve accuracy even at high compression ratios. To make
hyper-scaling practical, we introduce Dynamic Memory Sparsification (DMS), a
novel method for sparsifying KV caches that only requires 1K training steps to
achieve 8$\times$ compression, while maintaining better accuracy than
training-free sparse attention. Instead of prematurely discarding cached
tokens, DMS delays token eviction, implicitly merging representations and
preserving critical information. We demonstrate the effectiveness of
inference-time hyper-scaling with DMS on multiple families of LLMs, showing
that it boosts accuracy for comparable inference runtime and memory load. For
instance, we enhance Qwen-R1 32B by an average of 9.1 points on AIME 24, 7.6 on
GPQA, and 9.6 on LiveCodeBench across compute budgets.

### [280] [You Only Train Once](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04349)
*Christos Sakaridis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: YOTO proposes a method to optimize loss hyperparameters and network parameters jointly in one training phase, outperforming traditional grid search approaches in key computer vision tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to reduce the inefficiency of traditional grid-search methods for hyperparameter optimization, particularly focusing on loss weights in learned models.

Method: YOTO automatically optimizes loss weight hyperparameters using gradient-based optimization, integrating their learning as part of the neural network's parameters through a differentiable loss formulation and a novel regularization strategy.

Result: Experiments on 3D estimation and semantic segmentation tasks demonstrate that YOTO consistently achieves better performance than grid-search optimized models on unseen test data.

Conclusion: YOTO successfully streamlines the hyperparameter optimization process for loss weights, proving efficient and effective in end-to-end model training, with improved results over traditional methods.

Abstract: The title of this paper is perhaps an overclaim. Of course, the process of
creating and optimizing a learned model inevitably involves multiple training
runs which potentially feature different architectural designs, input and
output encodings, and losses. However, our method, You Only Train Once (YOTO),
indeed contributes to limiting training to one shot for the latter aspect of
losses selection and weighting. We achieve this by automatically optimizing
loss weight hyperparameters of learned models in one shot via standard
gradient-based optimization, treating these hyperparameters as regular
parameters of the networks and learning them. To this end, we leverage the
differentiability of the composite loss formulation which is widely used for
optimizing multiple empirical losses simultaneously and model it as a novel
layer which is parameterized with a softmax operation that satisfies the
inherent positivity constraints on loss hyperparameters while avoiding
degenerate empirical gradients. We complete our joint end-to-end optimization
scheme by defining a novel regularization loss on the learned hyperparameters,
which models a uniformity prior among the employed losses while ensuring
boundedness of the identified optima. We evidence the efficacy of YOTO in
jointly optimizing loss hyperparameters and regular model parameters in one
shot by comparing it to the commonly used brute-force grid search across
state-of-the-art networks solving two key problems in computer vision, i.e. 3D
estimation and semantic segmentation, and showing that it consistently
outperforms the best grid-search model on unseen test data. Code will be made
publicly available.

*Ranjith Merugu,Bryan Bo Cao,Shubham Jain*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: StatsMerging is a method for model merging that utilizes weight distribution statistics and singular value decomposition to improve adaptation and generalization, avoiding the need for ground-truth labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing size of large models necessitates efficient solutions for merging multiple models within memory constraints without compromising performance.

Method: StatsMerging employs singular value decomposition to model weight distributions as proxies for task importance, uses a lightweight learner named StatsMergeLearner for generalization, and introduces Task-Specific Teacher Distillation for merging heterogeneous vision models without ground-truth labels.

Result: Extensive experiments across eight tasks showed StatsMerging's superior performance in accuracy, generalization to new tasks, and robustness compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: StatsMerging provides an effective, lightweight, and robust approach to model merging, outperforming current methods and enabling adaptation to unseen tasks.

Abstract: Model merging has emerged as a promising solution to accommodate multiple
large models within constrained memory budgets. We present StatsMerging, a
novel lightweight learning-based model merging method guided by weight
distribution statistics without requiring ground truth labels or test samples.
StatsMerging offers three key advantages: (1) It uniquely leverages singular
values from singular value decomposition (SVD) to capture task-specific weight
distributions, serving as a proxy for task importance to guide task coefficient
prediction; (2) It employs a lightweight learner StatsMergeLearner to model the
weight distributions of task-specific pre-trained models, improving
generalization and enhancing adaptation to unseen samples; (3) It introduces
Task-Specific Teacher Distillation for merging vision models with heterogeneous
architectures, a merging learning paradigm that avoids costly ground-truth
labels by task-specific teacher distillation. Notably, we present two types of
knowledge distillation, (a) distilling knowledge from task-specific models to
StatsMergeLearner; and (b) distilling knowledge from models with heterogeneous
architectures prior to merging. Extensive experiments across eight tasks
demonstrate the effectiveness of StatsMerging. Our results show that
StatsMerging outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in terms of overall
accuracy, generalization to unseen tasks, and robustness to image quality
variations.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper investigates scaling laws' application for comparing pre-training methods of language-vision foundation models, focusing on CLIP and MaMMUT. Their findings highlight MaMMUT's sample efficiency and performance improvement with scale.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate and use scaling laws for comparing the performance of foundation models and datasets, as well as optimizing procedures for pre-training methods in a systematic way.

Method: Scaling laws are derived based on dense measurements across varying scales of models and sample datasets. Comparisons are conducted using downstream tasks and open datasets, and alternative scaling law derivation methods are explored for efficiency.

Result: MaMMUT demonstrates stronger improvements with scale and better sample efficiency compared to CLIP. Trends are consistently observed across various tasks and datasets. Open pre-trained models, checkpoints, and data for reproducibility are provided.

Conclusion: Accurate scaling law derivation enables systematic model and dataset comparisons across scales, mitigating misleading single-scale evaluations and facilitating foundation model advancements. The pre-trained MaMMUT-L/14 model achieves promising zero-shot accuracy.

Abstract: In studies of transferable learning, scaling laws are obtained for various
important foundation models to predict their properties and performance at
larger scales. We show here how scaling law derivation can also be used for
model and dataset comparison, allowing to decide which procedure is to be
preferred for pre-training. For the first time, full scaling laws based on
dense measurements across a wide span of model and samples seen scales are
derived for two important language-vision learning procedures, CLIP and MaMMUT,
that use either contrastive only or contrastive and captioning text generative
loss. Ensuring sufficient prediction accuracy for held out points, we use
derived scaling laws to compare both models, obtaining evidence for MaMMUT's
stronger improvement with scale and better sample efficiency than standard
CLIP. To strengthen validity of the comparison, we show scaling laws for
various downstream tasks, classification, retrieval, and segmentation, and for
different open datasets, DataComp, DFN and Re-LAION, observing consistently the
same trends. We show that comparison can also be performed when deriving
scaling laws with a constant learning rate schedule, reducing compute cost.
Accurate derivation of scaling laws provides thus means to perform model and
dataset comparison across scale spans, avoiding misleading conclusions based on
measurements from single reference scales only, paving the road for systematic
comparison and improvement of open foundation models and datasets for their
creation. We release all the pre-trained models with their intermediate
checkpoints, including openMaMMUT-L/14, which achieves $80.3\%$ zero-shot
ImageNet-1k accuracy, trained on 12.8B samples from DataComp-1.4B. Code for

*Cong Geng,Jia Wang,Li Chen,Zhiyong Gao,Jes Frellsen,Søren Hauberg*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes bidirectional bounds for training energy-based models to achieve stable training and improved density estimation and sampling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Energy-based models are promising for estimating unnormalized densities but are difficult to train due to instabilities in existing methods.

Method: The paper introduces bidirectional bounds for EBM training by maximizing lower bounds and minimizing upper bounds using approaches based on singular values, mutual information, gradient penalties, and diffusion processes.

Result: Bidirectional bounds stabilize EBM training and provide algorithms, leading to better density estimations and sample generation.

Conclusion: Bidirectional bounds offer a reliable framework for training EBMs by alleviating instability issues and enhancing model performance and training stability.

Abstract: Energy-based models (EBMs) estimate unnormalized densities in an elegant
framework, but they are generally difficult to train. Recent work has linked
EBMs to generative adversarial networks, by noting that they can be trained
through a minimax game using a variational lower bound. To avoid the
instabilities caused by minimizing a lower bound, we propose to instead work
with bidirectional bounds, meaning that we maximize a lower bound and minimize
an upper bound when training the EBM. We investigate four different bounds on
the log-likelihood derived from different perspectives. We derive lower bounds
based on the singular values of the generator Jacobian and on mutual
information. To upper bound the negative log-likelihood, we consider a gradient
penalty-like bound, as well as one based on diffusion processes. In all cases,
we provide algorithms for evaluating the bounds. We compare the different
bounds to investigate, the pros and cons of the different approaches. Finally,
we demonstrate that the use of bidirectional bounds stabilizes EBM training and
yields high-quality density estimation and sample generation.

*Zeming Wei,Yiwen Guo,Yisen Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates adversarial training (AT) through class-wise feature attribution, introducing cross-class features as impactful for robustness and exploring their dynamics during training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of understanding of the internal mechanisms and dynamics of adversarial training, particularly from the perspective of feature attribution.

Method: The paper uses theoretical analysis through synthetic data models and systematic empirical studies across different deep neural network architectures and training settings.

Result: The study identifies that during adversarial training, models initially prioritize learning cross-class features for robust classification, but robust overfitting later shifts focus to class-specific features.

Conclusion: These findings offer a new perspective on adversarial training mechanisms, unifying properties like soft-label training and robust overfitting, and enhancing the understanding of how models achieve robustness.

Abstract: Adversarial training (AT) has been considered one of the most effective
methods for making deep neural networks robust against adversarial attacks,
while the training mechanisms and dynamics of AT remain open research problems.
In this paper, we present a novel perspective on studying AT through the lens
of class-wise feature attribution. Specifically, we identify the impact of a
key family of features on AT that are shared by multiple classes, which we call
cross-class features. These features are typically useful for robust
classification, which we offer theoretical evidence to illustrate through a
synthetic data model. Through systematic studies across multiple model
architectures and settings, we find that during the initial stage of AT, the
model tends to learn more cross-class features until the best robustness
checkpoint. As AT further squeezes the training robust loss and causes robust
overfitting, the model tends to make decisions based on more class-specific
features. Based on these discoveries, we further provide a unified view of two
existing properties of AT, including the advantage of soft-label training and
robust overfitting. Overall, these insights refine the current understanding of
AT mechanisms and provide new perspectives on studying them. Our code is
available at https://github.com/PKU-ML/Cross-Class-Features-AT.

*Yizhuo Li,Yuying Ge,Yixiao Ge,Ying Shan,Ping Luo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to align latent spaces to target distributions using flow-based generative models without requiring costly likelihood computations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for aligning latent spaces to target distributions involve computationally expensive evaluations, creating a need for more efficient approaches.

Method: A flow model is pretrained on target distributions and used to regularize latent space via an alignment loss reformulated as a surrogate for log-likelihood maximization.

Result: The framework demonstrates theoretical validation, aligns well with target distributions, and shows effectiveness through controlled experiments and ImageNet large-scale tests.

Conclusion: The method provides a computationally efficient way to align latent spaces, validated by both theoretical proofs and empirical results, offering a new approach in generative modeling.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel framework for aligning learnable latent spaces to
arbitrary target distributions by leveraging flow-based generative models as
priors. Our method first pretrains a flow model on the target features to
capture the underlying distribution. This fixed flow model subsequently
regularizes the latent space via an alignment loss, which reformulates the flow
matching objective to treat the latents as optimization targets. We formally
prove that minimizing this alignment loss establishes a computationally
tractable surrogate objective for maximizing a variational lower bound on the
log-likelihood of latents under the target distribution. Notably, the proposed
method eliminates computationally expensive likelihood evaluations and avoids
ODE solving during optimization. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate in a
controlled setting that the alignment loss landscape closely approximates the
negative log-likelihood of the target distribution. We further validate the
effectiveness of our approach through large-scale image generation experiments
on ImageNet with diverse target distributions, accompanied by detailed
discussions and ablation studies. With both theoretical and empirical
validation, our framework paves a new way for latent space alignment.

This paper surveys risks, solutions, and future directions for improving their reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the challenges making Concept-based Models less reliable in sensitive applications, such as medical diagnosis and financial predictions, aiming for trustworthy AI systems.

Method: The paper conducts a survey aggregating challenges, architectural solutions, and recent research advancements for both supervised and unsupervised approaches.

Result: Findings highlight risks like concept leakage and adversarial vulnerabilities, alongside architectural choices that address these issues.

Conclusion: Concept-based Models are promising but require improvements in robustness, reliability, and the efficacy of human interventions for sensitive real-world applications.

Abstract: Concept-based Models are a class of inherently explainable networks that
improve upon standard Deep Neural Networks by providing a rationale behind
their predictions using human-understandable `concepts'. With these models
being highly successful in critical applications like medical diagnosis and
financial risk prediction, there is a natural push toward their wider adoption
in sensitive domains to instill greater trust among diverse stakeholders.
However, recent research has uncovered significant limitations in the structure
of such networks, their training procedure, underlying assumptions, and their
susceptibility to adversarial vulnerabilities. In particular, issues such as
concept leakage, entangled representations, and limited robustness to
perturbations pose challenges to their reliability and generalization.
Additionally, the effectiveness of human interventions in these models remains
an open question, raising concerns about their real-world applicability. In
this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey on the risks and limitations
associated with Concept-based Models. In particular, we focus on aggregating
commonly encountered challenges and the architecture choices mitigating these
challenges for Supervised and Unsupervised paradigms. We also examine recent
advances in improving their reliability and discuss open problems and promising
avenues of future research in this domain.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current OOD detection methods rely heavily on statistical models but lack sufficient explainability and integration of probabilistic reasoning.

Method: The paper integrates MLNs into OOD detection, leveraging weighted logical constraints and introducing an algorithm to learn these constraints from datasets.

Result: Experiments show MLNs boost the effectiveness of various OOD detectors across datasets while maintaining computational efficiency.

Conclusion: MLNs improve performance and explainability for OOD detection, making them a powerful addition to existing methods.

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is essential for ensuring the reliability
of deep learning models operating in open-world scenarios. Current OOD
detectors mainly rely on statistical models to identify unusual patterns in the
latent representations of a deep neural network. This work proposes to augment
existing OOD detectors with probabilistic reasoning, utilizing Markov logic
networks (MLNs). MLNs connect first-order logic with probabilistic reasoning to
assign probabilities to inputs based on weighted logical constraints defined
over human-understandable concepts, which offers improved explainability.
Through extensive experiments on multiple datasets, we demonstrate that MLNs
can significantly enhance the performance of a wide range of existing OOD
detectors while maintaining computational efficiency. Furthermore, we introduce
a simple algorithm for learning logical constraints for OOD detection from a

TL;DR: Perturbative Gradient Training (PGT) introduces a new way to train neural networks by approximating gradient updates through random perturbations, enabling training without backpropagation, and demonstrating comparable performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Physical reservoir computing struggles with training through backpropagation due to its black-box nature, creating a need for alternative training methods.

Method: PGT leverages perturbation theory to approximate gradient updates via random perturbations in parameters, using forward passes in simulated and experimental systems.

Result: PGT achieves similar performance to standard backpropagation methods in simulated neural networks and magnonic hardware, enabling practical training without backpropagation.

Conclusion: PGT shows potential for deeper integration of physical reservoirs into AI, unlocking energy-efficient training approaches for neural networks.

Abstract: We introduce Perturbative Gradient Training (PGT), a novel training paradigm
that overcomes a critical limitation of physical reservoir computing: the
inability to perform backpropagation due to the black-box nature of physical
reservoirs. Drawing inspiration from perturbation theory in physics, PGT uses
random perturbations in the network's parameter space to approximate gradient
updates using only forward passes. We demonstrate the feasibility of this
approach on both simulated neural network architectures, including a dense
network and a transformer model with a reservoir layer, and on experimental
hardware using a magnonic auto-oscillation ring as the physical reservoir. Our
results show that PGT can achieve performance comparable to that of standard
backpropagation methods in cases where backpropagation is impractical or
impossible. PGT represents a promising step toward integrating physical
reservoirs into deeper neural network architectures and achieving significant
energy efficiency gains in AI training.

*Warayut Dokduea,Weerachart Tangchirapat,Sompote Youwai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a Triple Attention Transformer Architecture to enhance time-dependent concrete creep prediction by treating it as a sequential modeling problem, achieving high accuracy and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current models inadequately handle the sequential nature of time-dependent concrete creep and treat time as a static input, leading to limitations in understanding and predicting deformation development.

Method: The paper employs a novel Triple Attention Transformer Architecture with three attention streams: temporal, feature, and batch attention. It models concrete creep prediction as an autoregressive sequence modeling task, leveraging self-attention mechanisms used in transformers.

Result: The model achieves a mean absolute percentage error of 1.63% and R2 values of 0.999 across datasets, outperforming empirical and machine learning models. Key features like Young's modulus are highlighted through SHAP analysis for interpretability.

Conclusion: Transformers are demonstrated to be effective for materials science, offering accurate predictions, deeper insights, and practical implementations, thus revolutionizing structural behavior prediction and engineering design.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel Triple Attention Transformer Architecture for
predicting time-dependent concrete creep, addressing fundamental limitations in
current approaches that treat time as merely an input parameter rather than
modeling the sequential nature of deformation development. By transforming
concrete creep prediction into an autoregressive sequence modeling task similar
to language processing, our architecture leverages the transformer's
self-attention mechanisms to capture long-range dependencies in historical
creep patterns. The model implements a triple-stream attention framework
incorporating temporal attention for sequential progression, feature attention
for material property interactions, and batch attention for inter-sample
relationships. Evaluated on experimental datasets with standardized daily
measurements spanning 160 days, the architecture achieves exceptional
performance with mean absolute percentage error of 1.63% and R2 values of 0.999
across all datasets, substantially outperforming traditional empirical models
and existing machine learning approaches. Ablation studies confirm the critical
role of attention mechanisms, with attention pooling contributing most
significantly to model performance. SHAP analysis reveals Young's modulus as
the primary predictive feature, followed by density and compressive strength,
providing interpretability essential for engineering applications. A deployed
web-based interface facilitates practical implementation, enabling real-time
predictions using standard laboratory parameters. This work establishes the
viability of applying transformer architectures to materials science problems,
demonstrating the potential for data-driven approaches to revolutionize
structural behavior prediction and engineering design practices.

### [290] [The Cost of Dynamic Reasoning: Demystifying AI Agents and Test-Time Scaling from an AI Infrastructure Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04301)
*Jiin Kim,Byeongjun Shin,Jinha Chung,Minsoo Rhu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LLM-based AI agents improve task generalization through multi-turn workflows but face efficiency and sustainability challenges. The study analyzes their resource demands, highlighting the need for compute-efficient designs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiencies, growing costs, and sustainability challenges introduced by the multi-turn workflows of LLM-based AI agents.

Method: The paper conducted a system-level analysis quantifying resource usage, latency, energy, and datacenter demands of various AI agent designs, and examined design choices like prompting and reasoning depth.

Result: Findings showed that accuracy improvements come with diminishing returns and heightened computational demands, leading to unsustainable infrastructure costs.

Conclusion: A shift toward compute-efficient design in AI agents is needed to balance performance and practicality under real-world constraints.

Abstract: Large-language-model (LLM)-based AI agents have recently showcased impressive
versatility by employing dynamic reasoning, an adaptive, multi-step process
that coordinates with external tools. This shift from static, single-turn
inference to agentic, multi-turn workflows broadens task generalization and
behavioral flexibility, but it also introduces serious concerns about
system-level cost, efficiency, and sustainability. This paper presents the
first comprehensive system-level analysis of AI agents, quantifying their
resource usage, latency behavior, energy consumption, and datacenter-wide power
consumption demands across diverse agent designs and test-time scaling
strategies. We further characterize how AI agent design choices, such as
few-shot prompting, reflection depth, and parallel reasoning, impact
accuracy-cost tradeoffs. Our findings reveal that while agents improve accuracy
with increased compute, they suffer from rapidly diminishing returns, widening
latency variance, and unsustainable infrastructure costs. Through detailed
evaluation of representative agents, we highlight the profound computational
demands introduced by AI agent workflows, uncovering a looming sustainability
crisis. These results call for a paradigm shift in agent design toward
compute-efficient reasoning, balancing performance with deployability under
real-world constraints.

*Shaona Ghosh,Amrita Bhattacharjee,Yftah Ziser,Christopher Parisien*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes SafeSteer, a method for achieving customizable safety control in large language models (LLMs) through unsupervised latent activation steering without needing explicit safe data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this paper is to address the challenge of adapting large language models to dynamic safety policies in a cost-effective and practical way, leveraging mechanistic interpretability for inference-time control.

Method: The paper introduces SafeSteer, which employs category-specific steering vectors and a gradient-free unsupervised method to enable precise control of LLM outputs, ensuring safety without affecting the text's quality or topic relevance.

Result: SafeSteer demonstrated effectiveness across various LLMs, risk categories, and datasets, successfully providing precise control, avoiding blanket refusals, and steering models towards safe yet relevant content.

Conclusion: Simple methods like SafeSteer can outperform more complex alternatives in activation steering, making them highly effective for customizable safety adjustments in LLMs while maintaining their output quality and relevance.

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) to adapt to evolving safety policies
is costly and impractical. Mechanistic interpretability enables inference-time
control through latent activation steering, yet its potential for precise,
customizable safety adjustments remains largely untapped. This paper
investigates an approach called SafeSteer for guiding the outputs of LLMs by:
(i) leveraging category-specific steering vectors for more precise control,
(ii) employing a simple, gradient-free unsupervised method to enhance safety
steering while preserving text quality, topic relevance, and without explicit
refusal, and (iii) accomplishing this without a hard requirement of contrastive
pairwise safe data. We also highlight that our method, being simple and
effective, aligns with recent studies suggesting that simple techniques often
outperform more complex ones in activation steering. We showcase the
effectiveness of our approach across various LLMs, datasets, and risk
categories, demonstrating its ability to provide precise control, prevent
blanket refusals, and guide models toward generating safe content while
maintaining topic relevance.

*Nicolas Caron,Christophe Guyeux,Hassan Noura,Benjamin Aynes*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses forest fire prediction using AI, aiming to provide region-specific risk assessments for firefighting units in metropolitan France, and introduces a national-scale AI benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve forest fire prediction accuracy by moving beyond binary classification tasks and to develop context-sensitive, actionable, and region-specific risk assessments in light of increasing fire hazards due to climate change.

Method: The method involves introducing a novel AI approach tailored to departmental contexts and implementing a national-scale AI benchmark for metropolitan France using state-of-the-art models.

Result: The result is the development of a national AI benchmark and actionable fire risk predictions tailored to local firefighting units, based on a previously underutilized dataset.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that creating localized risk assessments significantly enhances the operational utility for firefighting units, and provides a roadmap for future research in this domain, with supplementary materials available on GitHub.

Abstract: Forest fire prediction involves estimating the likelihood of fire ignition or
related risk levels in a specific area over a defined time period. With climate
change intensifying fire behavior and frequency, accurate prediction has become
one of the most pressing challenges in Artificial Intelligence (AI).
Traditionally, fire ignition is approached as a binary classification task in
the literature. However, this formulation oversimplifies the problem,
especially from the perspective of end-users such as firefighters. In general,
as is the case in France, firefighting units are organized by department, each
with its terrain, climate conditions, and historical experience with fire
events. Consequently, fire risk should be modeled in a way that is sensitive to
local conditions and does not assume uniform risk across all regions. This
paper proposes a new approach that tailors fire risk assessment to departmental
contexts, offering more actionable and region-specific predictions for
operational use. With this, we present the first national-scale AI benchmark
for metropolitan France using state-of-the-art AI models on a relatively
unexplored dataset. Finally, we offer a summary of important future works that
should be taken into account. Supplementary materials are available on GitHub.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces MUC-G4, a framework for efficiently verifying compressed deep learning models, addressing challenges from quantization and pruning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle inefficiencies in existing verification methods for compressed neural networks, especially in handling structural changes like pruning or quantization.

Method: MUC-G4 leverages Minimal Unsat Cores (MUCs) of the original network and encodes both original and compressed models into SMT formulas to guide incremental verification.

Result: The framework demonstrated high proof reuse rates and substantial speedup in verification time over traditional methods, validating its efficiency and effectiveness.

Conclusion: MUC-G4 enhances the safety and reliability of deploying compressed neural networks on edge devices, advancing the field of neural network verification.

Abstract: The rapid development of deep learning has led to challenges in deploying
neural networks on edge devices, mainly due to their high memory and runtime
complexity. Network compression techniques, such as quantization and pruning,
aim to reduce this complexity while maintaining accuracy. However, existing
incremental verification methods often focus only on quantization and struggle
with structural changes. This paper presents MUC-G4 (Minimal Unsat Core-Guided
Incremental Verification), a novel framework for incremental verification of
compressed deep neural networks. It encodes both the original and compressed
networks into SMT formulas, classifies changes, and use \emph{Minimal Unsat
Cores (MUCs)} from the original network to guide efficient verification for the
compressed network. Experimental results show its effectiveness in handling
quantization and pruning, with high proof reuse rates and significant speedup
in verification time compared to traditional methods. MUC-G4 hence offers a
promising solution for ensuring the safety and reliability of compressed neural
networks in practical applications.

*Jesse Geerts,Stephanie Chan,Claudia Clopath,Kimberly Stachenfeld*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores how transformer models handle the transitive inference task, revealing differences in generalization between in-weights learning and in-context learning regimes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the mechanisms behind transformer reasoning capabilities in relational inference, inspired by classic psychological concepts.

Method: Comparing transformer performance on transitive inference through in-weights learning (information encoded in model parameters) and in-context learning (utilizing input sequence information). Mechanistic analysis investigates induction circuits and pre-training effects.

Result: In-weights learning naturally generalizes transitive inference despite limited training, while in-context learning requires pre-training on structured tasks to generalize relational reasoning.

Conclusion: Structured task pre-training enables representations necessary for effective relational reasoning, bridging differences between learning regimes.

Abstract: Transformer-based models have demonstrated remarkable reasoning abilities,
but the mechanisms underlying relational reasoning in different learning
regimes remain poorly understood. In this work, we investigate how transformers
perform a classic relational reasoning task from the Psychology literature,
\textit{transitive inference}, which requires inference about indirectly
related items by integrating information across observed adjacent item pairs
(e.g., if A>B and B>C, then A>C). We compare transitive inference behavior
across two distinct learning regimes: in-weights learning (IWL), where models
store information in network parameters, and in-context learning (ICL), where
models flexibly utilize information presented within the input sequence. Our
findings reveal that IWL naturally induces a generalization bias towards
transitive inference, despite being trained only on adjacent items, whereas ICL
models trained solely on adjacent items do not generalize transitively.
Mechanistic analysis shows that ICL models develop induction circuits that
implement a simple match-and-copy strategy that performs well at relating
adjacent pairs, but does not encoding hierarchical relationships among
indirectly related items. Interestingly, when pre-trained on in-context linear
regression tasks, transformers successfully exhibit in-context generalizable
transitive inference. Moreover, like IWL, they display both \textit{symbolic
distance} and \textit{terminal item effects} characteristic of human and animal
performance, without forming induction circuits. These results suggest that
pre-training on tasks with underlying structure promotes the development of
representations that can scaffold in-context relational reasoning.

TL;DR: The study investigates the sampling distribution's influence on Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and its training dynamics, revealing the role of high-quality responses in enhancing policy learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how the sampling distribution impacts both the solution space and training dynamics in DPO for better policy learning.

Method: The study analyzes response distributions' effects, introduces a simplified alignment model, and derives quantitative insights to highlight the importance of high-quality responses in optimizing DPO training.

Result: Frequent high-quality responses amplify gradient signals and improve optimization landscapes, making policy learning more effective. Theoretical insights were confirmed through empirical experiments.

Conclusion: High-quality sampled responses critically optimize the DPO framework, justifying online approaches for practical applications.

Abstract: We study the role of the sampling distribution in Direct Preference
Optimization (DPO) and aim to understand its impact on DPO's training dynamics.
Our analyses show that both the solution space and the convergence behavior of
DPO depend on the support and quality of the generating distribution. We first
analyze how distribution of responses influences policy updates during gradient
descent, drawing connections to common phenomena found in practice. We then
design a simplified yet well-structured alignment model as a proxy, and develop
quantitative results showing how more frequent high-quality responses amplify
the gradient signal and improve the optimization landscape, leading to more
effective policy learning. Our theoretical findings are supported by empirical
experiments and provide a principled justification for the online DPO framework
in practice.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This study tackles the challenges in forecasting compound floods stemming from multiple interacting factors like meteorological and oceanographic conditions. It introduces a dataset, SF2Bench, to evaluate various machine learning models for flood prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Compound floods, driven by complex interactions of multiple factors, are becoming more critical due to increasing climate risks. Current physics-based methods are inefficient, and comprehensive datasets for machine learning analysis are scarce.

Method: The paper introduces SF2Bench, a time series dataset that incorporates tide, rainfall, groundwater, and human management activities. Six types of machine learning models (MLPs, CNNs, RNNs, GNNs, Transformers, and LLMs) are assessed for flood forecasting.

Result: Different machine learning approaches showed diverse strengths in modeling the complex temporal and spatial dependencies of compound flooding. Key features impacting prediction accuracy were identified in experiments.

Conclusion: The SF2Bench dataset enables detailed analyses of flood predictors and facilitates improved forecasting methods by addressing gaps in existing datasets and leveraging advanced machine learning techniques.

Abstract: Forecasting compound floods presents a significant challenge due to the
intricate interplay of meteorological, hydrological, and oceanographic factors.
Analyzing compound floods has become more critical as the global climate
increases flood risks. Traditional physics-based methods, such as the
Hydrologic Engineering Center's River Analysis System, are often
time-inefficient. Machine learning has recently demonstrated promise in both
modeling accuracy and computational efficiency. However, the scarcity of
comprehensive datasets currently hinders systematic analysis. Existing
water-related datasets are often limited by a sparse network of monitoring
stations and incomplete coverage of relevant factors. To address this
challenge, we introduce SF2Bench, a comprehensive time series collection on
compound floods in South Florida, which integrates four key factors: tide,
rainfall, groundwater, and human management activities (gate and pump
controlling). This integration allows for a more detailed analysis of the
individual contributions of these drivers to compound flooding and informs the
development of improved flood forecasting approaches. To comprehensively
evaluate the potential of various modeling paradigms, we assess the performance
of six categories of methods, encompassing Multilayer Perceptrons,
Convolutional Neural Networks, Recurrent Neural Networks, Graph Neural
Networks, Transformers, and Large Language Models. We verified the impact of
different key features on flood forecasting through experiments. Our analysis
examines temporal and spatial aspects, providing insights into the influence of
historical data and spatial dependencies. The varying performance across these
approaches underscores the diverse capabilities of each in capturing complex
temporal and spatial dependencies inherent in compound floods.

Motivation: Understanding the trade-off between cost per token and serial token generation speed when using LLMs for inference at scale.

Method: A theoretical model incorporating factors such as arithmetic, memory bandwidth, and network latency constraints to optimize parallelism setups and batch sizes.

Result: The study computes Pareto frontiers of serial speed versus cost per token for popular language models.

Conclusion: Optimizing serial inference speed at a given cost enables better deployment strategies for LLMs in large-scale applications.

Abstract: We develop a theoretical model that addresses the economic trade-off between
cost per token versus serial token generation speed when deploying LLMs for
inference at scale. Our model takes into account arithmetic, memory bandwidth,
network bandwidth and latency constraints; and optimizes over different
parallelism setups and batch sizes to find the ones that optimize serial
inference speed at a given cost per token. We use the model to compute Pareto
frontiers of serial speed versus cost per token for popular language models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces NOBLE, a deep learning framework that learns computational neuron properties and achieves efficient synthetic neuron modeling, validated with experimental data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current neuron modeling approaches face scalability issues and fail to adequately capture variability and biophysical complexity in neural dynamics.

Method: NOBLE uses a neural operator framework to map interpretable neuron features to somatic voltage responses, based on biophysically realistic models and continuous frequency-modulated embeddings.

Result: NOBLE achieves a 4200× speedup compared to numerical solvers and predicts neural dynamics distributions consistent with experimental variability.

Conclusion: This framework advances computational neuroscience by better understanding neurons, optimizing neuroAI applications, enhancing large-scale models of brain circuits, and enabling neuromorphic architectures.

Abstract: Characterizing the diverse computational properties of human neurons via
multimodal electrophysiological, transcriptomic, and morphological data
provides the foundation for constructing and validating bio-realistic neuron
models that can advance our understanding of fundamental mechanisms underlying
brain function. However, current modeling approaches remain constrained by the
limited availability and intrinsic variability of experimental neuronal data.
To capture variability, ensembles of deterministic models are often used, but
are difficult to scale as model generation requires repeating computationally
expensive optimization for each neuron. While deep learning is becoming
increasingly relevant in this space, it fails to capture the full biophysical
complexity of neurons, their nonlinear voltage dynamics, and variability. To
address these shortcomings, we introduce NOBLE, a neural operator framework
that learns a mapping from a continuous frequency-modulated embedding of
interpretable neuron features to the somatic voltage response induced by
current injection. Trained on data generated from biophysically realistic
neuron models, NOBLE predicts distributions of neural dynamics accounting for
the intrinsic experimental variability. Unlike conventional bio-realistic
neuron models, interpolating within the embedding space offers models whose
dynamics are consistent with experimentally observed responses. NOBLE is the
first scaled-up deep learning framework validated on real experimental data,
enabling efficient generation of synthetic neurons that exhibit trial-to-trial
variability and achieve a $4200\times$ speedup over numerical solvers. To this
end, NOBLE captures fundamental neural properties, opening the door to a better
understanding of cellular composition and computations, neuromorphic
architectures, large-scale brain circuits, and general neuroAI applications.

### [299] [Grokking and Generalization Collapse: Insights from \texttt{HTSR} theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04434)
*Hari K. Prakash,Charles H. Martin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study identifies a new phenomenon in neural networks called 'anti-grokking' during late-stage training on a subset of MNIST data using a 3-layer MLP. The phase is characterized by test accuracy collapsing despite perfect training accuracy and is associated with the appearance of 'Correlation Traps' in layer weight matrices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the well-known grokking phenomena in neural networks and analyze stages of training using novel heavy-tailed self-regularization metrics.

Method: A 3-layer MLP is trained on a subset of MNIST data with and without weight decay for extensive periods. The novel layer quality metric $\, \alpha \, "$ through the WeightWatcher tool is utilized to delineate phases of training.

Result: The study identifies three training phases -- pre-grokking, grokking, and anti-grokking. The anti-grokking phase introduces a new dimension to understanding overfitting, characterized by $\, \alpha \, <$ 2 and correlation traps, with test accuracy collapse.

Conclusion: The HTSR layer quality metric $(\alpha)$ proves superior in monitoring training phases and detecting overfitting without test data. Anti-grokking underscores critical implications for generalization and model evaluation.

Abstract: We study the well-known grokking phenomena in neural networks (NNs) using a
3-layer MLP trained on 1 k-sample subset of MNIST, with and without weight
decay, and discover a novel third phase -- \emph{anti-grokking} -- that occurs
very late in training and resembles but is distinct from the familiar
\emph{pre-grokking} phases: test accuracy collapses while training accuracy
stays perfect. This late-stage collapse is distinct, from the known
pre-grokking and grokking phases, and is not detected by other proposed
grokking progress measures. Leveraging Heavy-Tailed Self-Regularization HTSR
through the open-source WeightWatcher tool, we show that the HTSR layer quality
metric $\alpha$ alone delineates all three phases, whereas the best competing
metrics detect only the first two. The \emph{anti-grokking} is revealed by
training for $10^7$ and is invariably heralded by $\alpha < 2$ and the
appearance of \emph{Correlation Traps} -- outlier singular values in the
randomized layer weight matrices that make the layer weight matrix atypical and
signal overfitting of the training set. Such traps are verified by visual
inspection of the layer-wise empirical spectral densities, and by using
Kolmogorov--Smirnov tests on randomized spectra. Comparative metrics, including
activation sparsity, absolute weight entropy, circuit complexity, and $l^2$
weight norms track pre-grokking and grokking but fail to distinguish grokking
from anti-grokking. This discovery provides a way to measure overfitting and
generalization collapse without direct access to the test data. These results
strengthen the claim that the \emph{HTSR} $\alpha$ provides universal
layer-convergence target at $\alpha \approx 2$ and underscore the value of
using the HTSR alpha $(\alpha)$ metric as a measure of generalization.

*Runxiang Wang,Boxiao Wang,Kai Li,Yifan Zhang,Jian Cheng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DrSR introduces a symbolic regression framework combining LLM's reasoning with data-driven insights and a feedback loop, improving discovery accuracy over prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing symbolic regression methods overly depend on LLM's internal biases and lack explicit engagement with the data and systematic refinement during equation generation.

Method: DrSR leverages structural analysis of data (e.g., monotonicity, nonlinearity) and utilizes feedback loops to monitor equation performance, refining subsequent iterations.

Result: DrSR demonstrated improved valid equation rates, accuracy, generalization, and efficiency over classical and LLM-based methods across datasets spanning physics, chemistry, biology, and materials science.

Conclusion: DrSR showcases enhanced robustness and discovery potential for scientific equation derivation, outperforming traditional and recent LLM approaches.

Abstract: Symbolic regression is a fundamental tool for discovering interpretable
mathematical expressions from data, with broad applications across scientific
and engineering domains. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have
demonstrated strong performance in this task, leveraging embedded scientific
priors and reasoning capabilities to surpass traditional methods. However,
existing LLM-based approaches, such as LLM-SR, often over-rely on internal
priors, lacking explicit data understanding and systematic reflection during
equation generation. To address these limitations, we propose DrSR (Dual
Reasoning Symbolic Regression), a framework that combines data-driven insight
with reflective learning to enhance both robustness and discovery capability.
Specifically, DrSR guides LLMs to analyze structural relationships (e.g.,
monotonicity, nonlinearity, and correlation) within the data to generate
structured descriptions. Simultaneously, it monitors equation performance and
establishes a feedback loop to refine subsequent generations. By integrating
data understanding and generation reflection in a closed loop, DrSR enables
more efficient exploration of the symbolic expression space. Experiments across
interdisciplinary datasets in physics, chemistry, biology, and materials
science demonstrate that DrSR substantially improves the valid equation rate
and consistently outperforms both classical and recent LLM-based methods in
terms of accuracy, generalization, and search efficiency. These results
underscore its potential for scientific equation discovery.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper examines the link between generative diffusion and associative memory models, emphasizing Morse-Smale systems and their stability under low noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the universal properties and stability of generative diffusion and associative memory models, particularly in scenarios of diminishing noise.

Method: The authors utilized Morse-Smale dynamical systems to approximate associative memory models and diffusion models while analyzing stability through gradient dynamics and bifurcations.

Result: Structural stability is confirmed for associative memory and diffusion under low noise, exhibiting stability except for isolated bifurcation points during transitions.

Conclusion: Morse-Smale dynamics provide a universal structure embedded within associative memory and generative diffusion, ensuring stability under diminishing noise while characterizing transitions between stable systems.

Abstract: Connections between generative diffusion and continuous-state associative
memory models are studied. Morse-Smale dynamical systems are emphasized as
universal approximators of gradient-based associative memory models and
diffusion models as white-noise perturbed systems thereof. Universal properties
of associative memory that follow from this description are described and used
to characterize a generic transition from generation to memory as noise levels
diminish. Structural stability inherited by Morse-Smale flows is shown to imply
a notion of stability for diffusions at vanishing noise levels. Applied to one-
and two-parameter families of gradients, this indicates stability at all but
isolated points of associative memory learning landscapes and the learning and
generation landscapes of diffusion models with gradient drift in the zero-noise
limit, at which small sets of generic bifurcations characterize qualitative
transitions between stable systems. Examples illustrating the characterization
of these landscapes by sequences of these bifurcations are given, along with
structural stability criterion for classic and modern Hopfield networks
(equivalently, the attention mechanism).

*C. Evans Hedges*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Orthogonalizing gradients during training (using $\perp$Grad) enhances model calibration (e.g., reduces overconfidence, increases predictive entropy) without reducing accuracy, even under challenging conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issue of model calibration (confidence in predictions), which is often suboptimal in standard training methods like SGD.

Method: The authors propose $\perp$Grad, a method to orthogonalize gradients during training. It is shown to be optimizer-agnostic, incurs minimal computational overhead, and aligns well with post-hoc calibration techniques.

Result: On CIFAR-10 (with limited labeled data) and CIFAR-10C (corrupted input), $\perp$Grad matches SGD in accuracy but systematically improves calibration metrics, degrades more gracefully under extended training, and works efficiently with temperature scaling.

Conclusion: $\perp$Grad enhances model calibration metrics without hampering accuracy, is theoretically well-supported, and can benefit diverse machine learning applications.

Abstract: We provide evidence that orthogonalizing gradients during training improves
model calibration without sacrificing accuracy. On CIFAR-10 with 10% labeled
data, $\perp$Grad matches SGD in accuracy but yields consistently improved
calibration metrics such as lower test loss, reduced softmax overconfidence,
and higher predictive entropy. These benefits persist under input corruption
(CIFAR-10C) and extended training, where $\perp$Grad models degrade more
gracefully than SGD-trained counterparts. $\perp$Grad is optimizer-agnostic,
incurs minimal overhead, and works well with post-hoc calibration techniques
like temperature scaling.
  Theoretically, we prove convergence of a simplified version of $\perp$Grad
under mild assumptions and characterize its stationary points in positive
homogeneous networks: $\perp$Grad converges to solutions where further loss
reduction requires confidence scaling rather than decision boundary
improvement.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Physics Aware Neuromorphic Network (PANN) to detect natural disaster-induced changes in satellite images onboard, significantly reducing data downlink latency and resource consumption.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the bandwidth bottleneck in downlinking satellite data needed for timely disaster response by processing data onboard and prioritizing relevant information.

Method: A Physics Aware Neuromorphic Network (PANN) inspired by memristors is proposed; it operates in a training-free manner to detect changes in multi-spectral satellite images, generating a physics-constrained dynamical output.

Result: The PANN demonstrated comparable or superior detection performance compared to a state-of-the-art AI model in identifying natural disasters across various categories.

Conclusion: PANN offers an efficient, resource-constrained solution for onboard satellite data processing, facilitating low-latency disaster response by prioritizing critical data for downlinking.

Abstract: Earth observations from low Earth orbit satellites provide vital information
for decision makers to better manage time-sensitive events such as natural
disasters. For the data to be most effective for first responders, low latency
is required between data capture and its arrival to decision makers. A major
bottleneck is in the bandwidth-limited downlinking of the data from satellites
to ground stations. One approach to overcome this challenge is to process at
least some of the data on-board and prioritise pertinent data to be downlinked.
In this work we propose a Physics Aware Neuromorphic Network (PANN) to detect
changes caused by natural disasters from a sequence of multi-spectral satellite
images and produce a change map, enabling relevant data to be prioritised for
downlinking. The PANN used in this study is motivated by physical neural
networks comprised of nano-electronic circuit elements known as "memristors"
(nonlinear resistors with memory). The weights in the network are dynamic and
update in response to varying input signals according to memristor equations of
state and electrical circuit conservation laws. The PANN thus generates
physics-constrained dynamical output features which are used to detect changes
in a natural disaster detection task by applying a distance-based metric.
Importantly, this makes the whole model training-free, allowing it to be
implemented with minimal computing resources. The PANN was benchmarked against
a state-of-the-art AI model and achieved comparable or better results in each
natural disaster category. It thus presents a promising solution to the
challenge of resource-constrained on-board processing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite the extensive use of unsupervised machine learning for scientific exploration, the lack of standard workflows poses challenges for reliable and reproducible discoveries.

Method: The authors propose a workflow that involves formulating robust scientific questions, preparing and exploring data thoroughly, applying varied modeling techniques, validating results rigorously, and ensuring reproducible documentation.

Result: Using astronomy as a case study, the workflow helped refine understanding of Milky Way globular clusters based on chemical composition, demonstrating the importance of validation.

Conclusion: A structured approach to unsupervised learning can enhance the reproducibility of scientific discoveries while promoting methodological robustness, as demonstrated in the astronomical case study.

Abstract: Unsupervised machine learning is widely used to mine large, unlabeled
datasets to make data-driven discoveries in critical domains such as climate
science, biomedicine, astronomy, chemistry, and more. However, despite its
widespread utilization, there is a lack of standardization in unsupervised
learning workflows for making reliable and reproducible scientific discoveries.
In this paper, we present a structured workflow for using unsupervised learning
techniques in science. We highlight and discuss best practices starting with
formulating validatable scientific questions, conducting robust data
preparation and exploration, using a range of modeling techniques, performing
rigorous validation by evaluating the stability and generalizability of
unsupervised learning conclusions, and promoting effective communication and
documentation of results to ensure reproducible scientific discoveries. To
illustrate our proposed workflow, we present a case study from astronomy,
seeking to refine globular clusters of Milky Way stars based upon their
chemical composition. Our case study highlights the importance of validation
and illustrates how the benefits of a carefully-designed workflow for
unsupervised learning can advance scientific discovery.

*Jae Wan Park,Junhyeok Kim,Youngjun Jun,Hyunah Ko,Seong Jae Hwang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Backbone Augmented Training (BAT) and an algorithm ALBAT to improve adaptation training by augmenting the adaptation dataset using backbone data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the issue of limited adaptation data in training large backbone models such as diffusion models and transformers.

Method: The method, BAT, uses backbone data to augment the adaptation dataset, supported by mathematical proofs and a data selection scheme implemented via the ALBAT algorithm.

Result: BAT and ALBAT demonstrate improved adaptation training in tasks involving personalization and language generation when data is scarce.

Conclusion: The approach shows that leveraging backbone data can address data scarcity challenges in adaptation training, enhancing both efficiency and performance.

Abstract: Adaptations facilitate efficient training of large backbone models, including
diffusion models for image generation and transformer-based language models.
While various adaptation techniques enhance performance with minimal
computational resources, limited adaptation data often leads to challenges in
training. To address this, we focus on the enormous amount of backbone data
used to pre-train the backbone models. We propose Backbone Augmented Training
(BAT), a method that leverages backbone data to augment the adaptation dataset.
First, we formulate and prove two mathematical key propositions: one
establishes the validity of BAT, while the other identifies a condition under
which BAT benefits adaptation. Furthermore, we introduce an advanced data
selection scheme that satisfies these propositions and present ALBAT algorithm
to implement this approach. ALBAT efficiently enhances adaptation training in
both personalization and language generation tasks with scarce data.

Result: Achieved over 96% accuracy in distinguishing normal from abnormal readings, above 78% precision in detecting anomalies, and memory usage below 160 KB during model training.

Conclusion: The results demonstrate the suitability of FLiForest for resource-constrained edge systems while supporting federated learning's principles of privacy and collaborative learning.

Abstract: Recently, federated learning frameworks such as Python TestBed for Federated

*Daniel Berg Thomsen,Adrien Taylor,Aymeric Dieuleveut*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper provides a precise analysis of error feedback methods ($\mathrm{EF}$, $\mathrm{EF}^{21}$) in distributed learning, deriving optimal convergence rates and comparing them rigorously.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the communication bottleneck in distributed learning by analyzing and improving compressed communication methods with accurate performance guarantees.

Method: The authors use a principled analysis approach, finding the optimal Lyapunov function for error feedback methods and establishing matching lower bounds for convergence rates.

Result: They derive best possible convergence rates for $\mathrm{EF}$ and $\mathrm{EF}^{21}$ methods and provide a rigorous comparison with compressed gradient descent.

Conclusion: Their findings offer sharp performance guarantees, enabling a better understanding and comparison of compressed communication techniques in distributed learning.

Abstract: Communication between agents often constitutes a major computational
bottleneck in distributed learning. One of the most common mitigation
strategies is to compress the information exchanged, thereby reducing
communication overhead. To counteract the degradation in convergence associated
with compressed communication, error feedback schemes -- most notably
$\mathrm{EF}$ and $\mathrm{EF}^{21}$ -- were introduced. In this work, we
provide a tight analysis of both of these methods. Specifically, we find the
Lyapunov function that yields the best possible convergence rate for each
method -- with matching lower bounds. This principled approach yields sharp
performance guarantees and enables a rigorous, apples-to-apples comparison
between $\mathrm{EF}$, $\mathrm{EF}^{21}$, and compressed gradient descent. Our
analysis is carried out in a simplified yet representative setting, which
allows for clean theoretical insights and fair comparison of the underlying
mechanisms.

### [308] [On the Mechanism of Reasoning Pattern Selection in Reinforcement Learning for Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04695)
*Xingwu Chen,Tianle Li,Difan Zou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates how reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) enhances reasoning in models, finding that RL primarily optimizes reasoning pattern selection and explores the training dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the knowledge gap in understanding how reinforcement learning improves reasoning abilities in large language models.

Method: The paper systematically studies RLVR through experiments and theoretical analyses, examining reasoning pattern selection, gradient flow, and training convergence across models of varying initial strengths.

Result: RLVR improves reasoning by selecting high-success-rate patterns without degrading individual reasoning patterns. Training convergence varies based on model strength, with weaker models benefiting significantly from supervised fine-tuning prior to RLVR.

Conclusion: The study provides theoretical and empirical insights into RL's role in fine-tuning reasoning abilities, offering recommendations on optimizing weaker models' training dynamics for enhanced reasoning.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated remarkable success in enhancing
model capabilities, including instruction-following, preference learning, and
reasoning. Yet despite its empirical successes, the mechanisms by which RL
improves reasoning abilities remain poorly understood. We present a systematic
study of Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), showing that
its primary benefit comes from optimizing the selection of existing reasoning
patterns. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that RLVR-trained
models preferentially adopt high-success-rate reasoning patterns while mostly
maintaining stable performance on individual patterns. We further develop
theoretical analyses on the convergence and training dynamics of RLVR based on
a simplified question-reason-answer model. We study the gradient flow and show
that RLVR can indeed find the solution that selects the reason pattern with the
highest success rate. Besides, our theoretical results
  reveal two distinct regimes regarding the convergence of RLVR training: (1)
rapid convergence for models with relatively strong initial reasoning
capabilities versus (2) slower optimization dynamics for weaker models.
Furthermore, we show that the slower optimization for weaker models can be
mitigated by applying the supervised fine-tuning (SFT) before RLVR, when using
a feasibly high-quality SFT dataset. We validate the theoretical findings
through extensive experiments. This work advances our theoretical understanding
of RL's role in LLM fine-tuning and offers insights for further enhancing
reasoning capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address complex optimization challenges arising with the proliferation of IoT devices by effectively integrating Lyapunov Drift-Plus-Penalty with reinforcement learning.

Method: Developed the LDPTRLQ algorithm, combining Lyapunov Drift-Plus-Penalty and reinforcement learning through theoretical analysis and simulation evaluations.

Result: Simulation results validate that LDPTRLQ outperforms baseline methods in compatibility, stability, and optimization compared to traditional Lyapunov Drift-Plus-Penalty and RL approaches.

Conclusion: LDPTRLQ represents a significant advancement in combining Lyapunov queue stability methods with RL, offering superior performance and broad utility for optimization in IoT applications.

Abstract: With the proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) devices, the demand for
addressing complex optimization challenges has intensified. The Lyapunov
Drift-Plus-Penalty algorithm is a widely adopted approach for ensuring queue
stability, and some research has preliminarily explored its integration with
reinforcement learning (RL). In this paper, we investigate the adaptation of
the Lyapunov Drift-Plus-Penalty algorithm for RL applications, deriving an
effective method for combining Lyapunov Drift-Plus-Penalty with RL under a set
of common and reasonable conditions through rigorous theoretical analysis.
Unlike existing approaches that directly merge the two frameworks, our proposed
algorithm, termed Lyapunov drift-plus-penalty method tailored for reinforcement
learning with queue stability (LDPTRLQ) algorithm, offers theoretical
superiority by effectively balancing the greedy optimization of Lyapunov
Drift-Plus-Penalty with the long-term perspective of RL. Simulation results for
multiple problems demonstrate that LDPTRLQ outperforms the baseline methods
using the Lyapunov drift-plus-penalty method and RL, corroborating the validity
of our theoretical derivations. The results also demonstrate that our proposed
algorithm outperforms other benchmarks in terms of compatibility and stability.

*José Manuel de Frutos,Manuel A. Vázquez,Pablo M. Olmos,Joaquín Míguez*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces dual-ISL, a rank-based, likelihood-free objective for training implicit generative models with enhanced stability and performance compared to classical ISL and other methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in classical divergences like KL and Wasserstein distances, such as lack of convexity or weak convergence, and to create an objective function that improves training stability and effectiveness for implicit generative models.

Method: The paper develops dual-ISL, a novel rank-based discrepancy framework that involves optimizing over model densities using a convex objective. It interprets the discrepancy as an $L^2$-projection onto a Bernstein polynomial basis, provides theoretical validation, and extends it to the multivariate case using sliced divergences.

Result: Dual-ISL achieves theoretical guarantees including convexity and continuity, precise convergence rates, and error bounds. Practically, it shows faster convergence, smoother/stable training, resilience to mode collapse, and provides an explicit density approximation in empirical benchmarks.

Conclusion: Dual-ISL provides a theoretically grounded, robust, and practically superior approach for training implicit generative models, advancing the state-of-the-art over classical ISL and other methods.

Abstract: Rank-based statistical metrics, such as the invariant statistical loss (ISL),
have recently emerged as robust and practically effective tools for training
implicit generative models. In this work, we introduce dual-ISL, a novel
likelihood-free objective for training implicit generative models that
interchanges the roles of the target and model distributions in the ISL
framework, yielding a convex optimization problem in the space of model
densities. We prove that the resulting rank-based discrepancy $d_K$ is i)
continuous under weak convergence and with respect to the $L^1$ norm, and ii)
convex in its first argument-properties not shared by classical divergences
such as KL or Wasserstein distances. Building on this, we develop a theoretical
framework that interprets $d_K$ as an $L^2$-projection of the density ratio $q
= p/\tilde p$ onto a Bernstein polynomial basis, from which we derive exact
bounds on the truncation error, precise convergence rates, and a closed-form
expression for the truncated density approximation. We further extend our
analysis to the multivariate setting via random one-dimensional projections,
defining a sliced dual-ISL divergence that retains both convexity and
continuity. We empirically show that these theoretical advantages translate
into practical ones. Specifically, across several benchmarks dual-ISL converges
more rapidly, delivers markedly smoother and more stable training, and more
effectively prevents mode collapse than classical ISL and other leading
implicit generative methods-while also providing an explicit density
approximation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces AutoCT, a framework that uses a combination of large language models and classical machine learning for scalable and interpretable clinical trial outcome prediction, while addressing limitations of deep learning approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clinical trials are expensive and lengthy, and prediction of their outcomes can reduce costs and facilitate faster drug discovery, motivating the development of more interpretable and efficient predictive tools.

Method: AutoCT autonomously generates, evaluates, and refines tabular features using Monte Carlo Tree Search combined with large language models, aiming for enhanced predictive performance with minimal refinement iterations.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate that AutoCT achieves performance comparable to or surpassing the state-of-the-art models in clinical trial prediction, suggesting its effectiveness and scalability.

Conclusion: AutoCT establishes a pathway for interpretable, cost-efficient, and scalable approaches to clinical trial outcome prediction, addressing critical challenges in biomedical research.

Abstract: Clinical trials are critical for advancing medical treatments but remain
prohibitively expensive and time-consuming. Accurate prediction of clinical
trial outcomes can significantly reduce research and development costs and
accelerate drug discovery. While recent deep learning models have shown promise
by leveraging unstructured data, their black-box nature, lack of
interpretability, and vulnerability to label leakage limit their practical use
in high-stakes biomedical contexts. In this work, we propose AutoCT, a novel
framework that combines the reasoning capabilities of large language models
with the explainability of classical machine learning. AutoCT autonomously
generates, evaluates, and refines tabular features based on public information
without human input. Our method uses Monte Carlo Tree Search to iteratively
optimize predictive performance. Experimental results show that AutoCT performs
on par with or better than SOTA methods on clinical trial prediction tasks
within only a limited number of self-refinement iterations, establishing a new
paradigm for scalable, interpretable, and cost-efficient clinical trial
prediction.

Abstract: Ensuring grid stability in the transition to renewable energy sources

that, the main contribution of this work are the new forecasting approaches
proposed, which have demonstrated superior performance compared to simpler

forecasting strategies for different consumer groups and demonstrating the
impact of incorporating detailed weather data on forecasting accuracy. These
advancements contribute to more reliable power demand predictions, thereby

### [313] [Improved Regret Bounds for Linear Bandits with Heavy-Tailed Rewards](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04775)
*Artin Tajdini,Jonathan Scarlett,Kevin Jamieson*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores stochastic linear bandits with heavy-tailed rewards, improving both theoretical upper and lower bounds on regret and introducing advanced algorithms for optimal results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address limitations in regret bounds for stochastic linear bandits with heavy-tailed rewards and to establish improved theoretical guarantees.

Method: They propose a new elimination-based algorithm utilizing experimental design, derive refined regret bounds for finite and infinite action sets, and leverage geometries like $l_p$-norm balls and kernel methods.

Result: The paper achieves tighter regret upper bounds, establishes stricter lower bounds, and introduces sublinear regret bounds for the Matérn kernel under certain geometries.

Conclusion: This work provides significant advancements in understanding heavy-tailed linear bandits, offering improved and optimal regret bounds in various settings and geometries.

Abstract: We study stochastic linear bandits with heavy-tailed rewards, where the
rewards have a finite $(1+\epsilon)$-absolute central moment bounded by
$\upsilon$ for some $\epsilon \in (0,1]$. We improve both upper and lower
bounds on the minimax regret compared to prior work. When $\upsilon =
\mathcal{O}(1)$, the best prior known regret upper bound is
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(d T^{\frac{1}{1+\epsilon}})$. While a lower with the same
scaling has been given, it relies on a construction using $\upsilon =
\mathcal{O}(d)$, and adapting the construction to the bounded-moment regime
with $\upsilon = \mathcal{O}(1)$ yields only a
$\Omega(d^{\frac{\epsilon}{1+\epsilon}} T^{\frac{1}{1+\epsilon}})$ lower bound.
This matches the known rate for multi-armed bandits and is generally loose for
linear bandits, in particular being $\sqrt{d}$ below the optimal rate in the
finite-variance case ($\epsilon = 1$). We propose a new elimination-based
algorithm guided by experimental design, which achieves regret
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(d^{\frac{1+3\epsilon}{2(1+\epsilon)}}
T^{\frac{1}{1+\epsilon}})$, thus improving the dependence on $d$ for all
$\epsilon \in (0,1)$ and recovering a known optimal result for $\epsilon = 1$.
We also establish a lower bound of $\Omega(d^{\frac{2\epsilon}{1+\epsilon}}
T^{\frac{1}{1+\epsilon}})$, which strictly improves upon the multi-armed bandit
rate and highlights the hardness of heavy-tailed linear bandit problems. For
finite action sets, we derive similarly improved upper and lower bounds for
regret. Finally, we provide action set dependent regret upper bounds showing
that for some geometries, such as $l_p$-norm balls for $p \le 1 + \epsilon$, we
can further reduce the dependence on $d$, and we can handle
infinite-dimensional settings via the kernel trick, in particular establishing
new regret bounds for the Mat\'ern kernel that are the first to be sublinear
for all $\epsilon \in (0, 1]$.

*N Guerin,M Nakhla,A Dehoux,J L Loyer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a deep-learning framework for predicting hauling-fleet capacity in open-pit mining, achieving accurate forecasts amidst uncertainties such as weather and mechanical breakdowns by integrating real-world data and synthetic scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address operational uncertainties in open-pit mining caused by unpredictable factors like weather, mechanical failures, and crew availability, which require accurate short-term fleet capacity forecasting.

Method: The method involves developing a deep-learning framework that combines real-world operational data (e.g., rainfall, fleet telemetry) with synthetic mechanical-breakdown scenarios. XGBoost and LSTM models are used for evaluation, paired with SHAP value analysis to rank predictor importance.

Result: The study achieved a median absolute error (MedAE) of 14.3% using XGBoost and 15.1% with LSTM. Insights from SHAP analyses show that rainfall, payload trends, and simulated breakdowns are key factors influencing predictions.

Conclusion: The hybrid modeling approach effectively reduces prediction volatility, making it a robust decision-support tool for fleet management. Future extensions will incorporate additional operational and maintenance-scheduling data to improve forecast adaptability.

Abstract: Accurate short-term forecasting of hauling-fleet capacity is crucial in
open-pit mining, where weather fluctuations, mechanical breakdowns, and
variable crew availability introduce significant operational uncertainties. We
propose a deep-learning framework that blends real-world operational records
(high-resolution rainfall measurements, fleet performance telemetry) with
synthetically generated mechanical-breakdown scenarios to enable the model to
capture fluctuating high-impact failure events. We evaluate two architectures:
an XGBoost regressor achieving a median absolute error (MedAE) of 14.3 per cent
and a Long Short-Term Memory network with a MedAE of 15.1 per cent. Shapley
Additive exPlanations (SHAP) value analyses identify cumulative rainfall,
historical payload trends, and simulated breakdown frequencies as dominant
predictors. Integration of simulated breakdown data and shift-planning features
notably reduces prediction volatility. Future work will further integrate
maintenance-scheduling indicators (Mean Time Between Failures, Mean Time to
Repair), detailed human resource data (operator absenteeism, crew efficiency
metrics), blast event scheduling, and other operational constraints to enhance
forecast robustness and adaptability. This hybrid modelling approach offers a
comprehensive decision-support tool for proactive, data-driven fleet management
under dynamically uncertain conditions.

*Abdourrahmane Mahamane Atto*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a 4-step process involving anatomical, physiological, neural information theory, and performance evaluation measures to improve consistency and dependability in ensemble learning systems using softlog-softmax cascades.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the dependability and consistency of ensemble learning systems by leveraging diverse canonical forms and novel techniques in neural engineering and information theory.

Method: The paper proposes a 4-step process: anatomical design of diverse ensemble models, physiological neural engineering via softlog layers, the use of information-theory measures like entropy and divergence, and informative performance evaluation through a tensor.

Result: The study demonstrates that greater ensemble diversity correlates with better handling of complex problems and proposes tools like softlog-based entropy for improved intermediate and final decision consistency.

Conclusion: By systematically employing these processes, ensemble learning systems are better equipped to make consistent and reliable decisions, particularly for handling complex tasks.

Abstract: The paper proposes a 4-step process for highlighting that softlog-softmax
cascades can improve both consistency and dependability of the next generation
ensemble learning systems. The first process is anatomical in nature: the
target ensemble model under consideration is composed by canonical elements
relating to the definition of a convolutional frustum. No a priori is
considered in the choice of canonical forms. Diversity is the main criterion
for selecting these forms. It is shown that the more complex the problem, the
more useful this ensemble diversity is. The second process is physiological and
relates to neural engineering: a softlog is derived to both make weak
logarithmic operations consistent and lead, through multiple softlog-softmax
layers, to intermediate decisions in the sense of respecting the same class
logic as that faced by the output layer. The third process concerns neural
information theory: softlog-based entropy and divergence are proposed for the
sake of constructing information measures yielding consistent values on closed
intervals. These information measures are used to determine the relationships
between individual and sub-community decisions in frustum diversitybased
ensemble learning. The concluding process addresses the derivation of an
informative performance tensor for the purpose of a reliable ensemble
evaluation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve model interpretability and performance by making reasoning grounded in human-defined concepts and relationships.

Method: CREAM embeds expert-specified concept-concept and concept-task relationships while employing a regularized side-channel to balance performance and concept dependence.

Result: CREAM achieves comparable task accuracy to black-box models, primarily relying on concepts and reducing concept leakage.

Conclusion: CREAM enhances interpretability and intervention capabilities in CBMs while maintaining task performance, addressing limitations like excessive reliance on black-box components.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose $\textbf{C}$oncept $\textbf{REA}$soning
$\textbf{M}$odels (CREAM), a novel family of Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs)
that: (i) explicitly encodes concept-concept (${\texttt{C-C}}$) and
concept-task (${\texttt{C$\rightarrow$Y}}$) relationships to enforce a desired
model reasoning; and (ii) use a regularized side-channel to achieve competitive
task performance, while keeping high concept importance. Specifically, CREAM
architecturally embeds (bi)directed concept-concept, and concept to task
relationships specified by a human expert, while severing undesired information
flows (e.g., to handle mutually exclusive concepts). Moreover, CREAM integrates
a black-box side-channel that is regularized to encourage task predictions to
be grounded in the relevant concepts, thereby utilizing the side-channel only
when necessary to enhance performance. Our experiments show that: (i) CREAM
mainly relies on concepts while achieving task performance on par with
black-box models; and (ii) the embedded ${\texttt{C-C}}$ and
${\texttt{C$\rightarrow$Y}}$ relationships ease model interventions and
mitigate concept leakage.

TL;DR: This paper introduces RedRFT, a new benchmark to improve and standardize reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) techniques for red teaming in large language models (LLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite the effectiveness of red teaming and the promise of Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT), a lack of a standardized benchmark hinders reproducibility and consistent evaluation, especially in PPO-based RFT implementations for identifying LLM vulnerabilities.

Method: RedRFT is a lightweight and modular benchmark that combines CleanRL's simplicity and Tianshou's modularity. It includes diverse metrics, modular intrinsic reward computation, and detailed ablation studies on key components such as Low-Rank Adaptation, KL divergence, and Lagrange Multiplier.

Result: The benchmark facilitates comprehensive understanding and reproducibility of RFT-based red teaming methods while enabling experimentation through its modular design.

Conclusion: RedRFT standardizes RFT-based red teaming, advancing reproducibility and fostering innovation in handling vulnerabilities in LLMs.

Abstract: Red teaming has proven to be an effective method for identifying and
mitigating vulnerabilities in Large Language Models (LLMs). Reinforcement
Fine-Tuning (RFT) has emerged as a promising strategy among existing red
teaming techniques. However, a lack of a unified benchmark hinders current
RFT-based red teaming methods. Implementation details, especially in Proximal
Policy Optimization (PPO)-based RFT, significantly affect outcome stability and
reproducibility. To address this issue, we introduce RedRFT, a lightweight
benchmark designed to simplify and standardize the implementation and
evaluation of RFT-based red teaming. RedRFT combines the design strengths of
both single-file CleanRL and highly modularized Tianshou, offering high-quality
single-file red teaming implementations and modular PPO core components, such
as the General Advantage Estimator. It supports a variety of token and sentence
diversity metrics, featuring modularized intrinsic reward computation that
facilitates plug-and-play experimentation. To clarify their influence on RFT
performance, we conducted an extensive ablation study on key components,
including Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, and
Lagrange Multiplier. We hope this work contributes to 1) gaining a
comprehensive understanding of the implementation nuances of RFT-based red
teaming algorithms, and 2) enabling rapid prototyping of innovative features
for RFT-based red teaming. Code for the benchmark can be accessed at

*Shijian Xu,Marcello Massimo Negri,Volker Roth*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces NIMO, combining neural networks' flexibility with linear models' interpretability, and it outperforms other approaches in both interpretability and predictive performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural networks are powerful but complex to interpret, while linear models are limited in expressiveness but inherently interpretable. The motivation is to create a model combining the benefits of both.

Method: The paper presents NIMO, which consists of a neural network learning nonlinear corrections to a linear model. It uses an optimization algorithm based on profile likelihood and adaptive ridge regression to maintain interpretability and incorporate sparsity.

Result: Empirical evidence shows that the model can recover the linear coefficients, improve predictive accuracy, and surpass other hybrid models in both interpretability and performance.

Conclusion: NIMO successfully bridges the gap between interpretability and predictive power, making it a standout approach in interpretable machine learning.

Abstract: Neural networks (NNs) have achieved tremendous success over the past decade,
yet they are still extremely difficult to interpret. In contrast, linear models
are less expressive but offer inherent interpretability. Linear coefficients
are interpretable as the marginal effect of a feature on the prediction,
assuming all other features are kept fixed. To combine the benefits of both
approaches, we introduce NIMO (Nonlinear Interpretable MOdel). The key idea is
to define a model where the NN is designed to learn nonlinear corrections to
the linear model predictions, while also maintaining the original
interpretability of the linear coefficients. Relevantly, we develop an
optimization algorithm based on profile likelihood that elegantly allows for
optimizing over the NN parameters while updating the linear coefficients
analytically. By relying on adaptive ridge regression we can easily incorporate
sparsity constraints as well. We show empirically that we can recover the
underlying linear coefficients while significantly improving the predictive
accuracy. Compared to other hybrid interpretable approaches, our model is the
only one that actually maintains the same interpretability of linear
coefficients as in linear models. We also achieve higher performance on various
regression and classification settings.

Motivation: State space models are increasingly used for sequence problems, but the prevalent HiPPO framework assumes noise-free data, which is unrealistic in real-world scenarios.

Method: The authors reformulate HiPPO as a linear stochastic control problem, introducing noise into the data as outputs of a latent system. They derive an uncertainty-aware initialization to infer posterior latent dynamics without extra computational expense.

Result: The proposed initialization improves noise resistance in state space models during both training and inference as demonstrated by experiments.

Conclusion: The extension to HiPPO makes state space models more robust to noisy data, addressing its practical limitations without sacrificing efficiency.

Abstract: State space models are emerging as a dominant model class for sequence
problems with many relying on the HiPPO framework to initialize their dynamics.
However, HiPPO fundamentally assumes data to be noise-free; an assumption often
violated in practice. We extend the HiPPO theory with measurement noise and
derive an uncertainty-aware initialization for state space model dynamics. In
our analysis, we interpret HiPPO as a linear stochastic control problem where
the data enters as a noise-free control signal. We then reformulate the problem
so that the data become noisy outputs of a latent system and arrive at an
alternative dynamics initialization that infers the posterior of this latent
system from the data without increasing runtime. Our experiments show that our
initialization improves the resistance of state-space models to noise both at
training and inference time. Find our implementation at

### [320] [Half-Layered Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04352)
*Ethem Alpaydin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'half' layers in deep learning networks, combining fixed random weights and modifiable parameters to reduce the number of trained weights while achieving reasonable accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the feasibility of reducing the number of parameters in deep learning models while maintaining performance, potentially improving regularization and efficiency.

Method: The 'half' unit uses random fixed weights for input summation, followed by modifiable scaling and translation before applying a nonlinearity. These units are integrated into deep networks to replace traditional layers.

Result: Experiments on MNIST and FashionMNIST datasets demonstrated that half layers can achieve competitive accuracy while leveraging random weights for increased regularization.

Conclusion: Half layers provide a promising approach to reduce parameter counts in neural networks, offering efficiency benefits and regularization effects, particularly in image classification tasks.

Abstract: We propose a ``half'' layer of hidden units that has some of its weights
randomly set and some of them trained. A half unit is composed of two stages:
First, it takes a weighted sum of its inputs with fixed random weights, and
second, the total activation is multiplied and then translated using two
modifiable weights, before the result is passed through a nonlinearity. The
number of modifiable weights of each hidden unit is thus two and does not
depend on the fan-in. We show how such half units can be used in the first or
any later layer in a deep network, possibly following convolutional layers. Our
experiments on MNIST and FashionMNIST data sets indicate the promise of half
layers, where we can achieve reasonable accuracy with a reduced number of
parameters due to the regularizing effect of the randomized connections.

*Clément Pierquin,Aurélien Bellet,Marc Tommasi,Matthieu Boussard*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper analyzes privacy amplification in synthetic data generated from differentially private models within the context of linear regression.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of theoretical understanding in how synthetic data might benefit from privacy amplification when the underlying generative model is hidden.

Method: Through theoretical analysis of linear regression models, distinguishing cases where synthetic data generation involves adversarial seed control versus random inputs.

Result: Proved that synthetic data can either leak information as much as the model itself (with adversarial seeds) or amplify privacy when generated from random inputs with limited data points.

Conclusion: The findings provide insights into privacy amplification mechanisms for synthetic data and act as a basis for extending theoretical bounds to other models in the future.

Abstract: Synthetic data inherits the differential privacy guarantees of the model used
to generate it. Additionally, synthetic data may benefit from privacy
amplification when the generative model is kept hidden. While empirical studies
suggest this phenomenon, a rigorous theoretical understanding is still lacking.
In this paper, we investigate this question through the well-understood
framework of linear regression. First, we establish negative results showing
that if an adversary controls the seed of the generative model, a single
synthetic data point can leak as much information as releasing the model
itself. Conversely, we show that when synthetic data is generated from random
inputs, releasing a limited number of synthetic data points amplifies privacy
beyond the model's inherent guarantees. We believe our findings in linear
regression can serve as a foundation for deriving more general bounds in the
future.

*Uditansh Srivastava,Shivam Aryan,Shaurya Singh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a modular reward function for financial trading in reinforcement learning, balancing return and risk through four differentiable terms and offering flexibility based on investor preferences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve reinforcement learning in financial trading by creating a multi-objective framework that addresses diverse investor needs for return and risk preferences, surpassing limitations of single-metric approaches like the Sharpe ratio.

Method: The method involves designing a composite reward function with four weighted terms: annualized return, downside risk, differential return, and Treynor ratio. Weights are fine-tuned through grid search for specific risk-return profiles, and theoretical properties like monotonicity and boundedness are analyzed. Closed-form gradients enable efficient gradient-based learning.

Result: The framework balances return and risk effectively and provides customizable investor profiles, validated through theoretical analysis of modularity and scalability.

Conclusion: This innovative framework provides flexibility in designing risk-return trade-offs and serves as a blueprint for multi-objective reward functions in trading, with potential for further extension.

Abstract: We propose a novel composite reward function for reinforcement learning in
financial trading that balances return and risk using four differentiable
terms: annualized return downside risk differential return and the Treynor
ratio
  Unlike single metric objectives for example the Sharpe ratio our formulation
is modular and parameterized by weights w1 w2 w3 and w4 enabling practitioners
to encode diverse investor preferences
  We tune these weights via grid search to target specific risk return profiles
  We derive closed form gradients for each term to facilitate gradient based
training and analyze key theoretical properties including monotonicity
boundedness and modularity
  This framework offers a general blueprint for building robust multi objective
reward functions in complex trading environments and can be extended with
additional risk measures or adaptive weighting

*Gen Li,Yuchen Jiao,Yu Huang,Yuting Wei,Yuxin Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper develops a universal approximation theory for understanding large language models' ability for in-context learning, showing how a transformer can perform tasks reliably with few examples and without weight updates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how transformers achieve in-context learning and generalize across tasks without fine-tuning or parameter updates.

Method: The authors construct a universal approximation framework based on function classes to demonstrate transformers' prediction capabilities using in-context examples.

Result: The results show that transformers, with no further weight updates, can perform reliable predictions across various tasks under universal approximation guarantees.

Conclusion: Universal function approximation provides insights into how transformers learn general-purpose representations and adapt dynamically to input examples, surpassing traditional algorithmic emulations.

Abstract: Modern large language models are capable of in-context learning, the ability
to perform new tasks at inference time using only a handful of input-output
examples in the prompt, without any fine-tuning or parameter updates. We
develop a universal approximation theory to better understand how transformers
enable in-context learning. For any class of functions (each representing a
distinct task), we demonstrate how to construct a transformer that, without any
further weight updates, can perform reliable prediction given only a few
in-context examples. In contrast to much of the recent literature that frames
transformers as algorithm approximators -- i.e., constructing transformers to
emulate the iterations of optimization algorithms as a means to approximate
solutions of learning problems -- our work adopts a fundamentally different
approach rooted in universal function approximation. This alternative approach
offers approximation guarantees that are not constrained by the effectiveness
of the optimization algorithms being approximated, thereby extending far beyond
convex problems and linear function classes. Our construction sheds light on
how transformers can simultaneously learn general-purpose representations and
adapt dynamically to in-context examples.

*Philippe Chlenski,Itsik Pe'er*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper reformulates the hyperDT algorithm for hyperbolic spaces in the Beltrami-Klein model, simplifying its integration with Euclidean decision trees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance decision tree algorithms for hyperbolic spaces by adopting a simpler, flexible approach that leverages existing optimizations in Euclidean models.

Method: The authors propose rewriting hyperDT in the Beltrami-Klein model, introducing pre- and post-processing steps to integrate hyperDT as a wrapper around existing Euclidean tree models.

Result: The wrapper approach makes hyperDT faster, more accurate, and easier to maintain while leveraging existing Euclidean optimizations.

Conclusion: The reformulation in the Beltrami-Klein model offers practical benefits in terms of stability, flexibility, and efficiency, with open-source access provided for broader use.

Abstract: Decision trees and models that use them as primitives are workhorses of
machine learning in Euclidean spaces. Recent work has further extended these
models to the Lorentz model of hyperbolic space by replacing axis-parallel
hyperplanes with homogeneous hyperplanes when partitioning the input space. In
this paper, we show how the hyperDT algorithm can be elegantly reexpressed in
the Beltrami-Klein model of hyperbolic spaces. This preserves the thresholding
operation used in Euclidean decision trees, enabling us to further rewrite
hyperDT as simple pre- and post-processing steps that form a wrapper around
existing tree-based models designed for Euclidean spaces. The wrapper approach
unlocks many optimizations already available in Euclidean space models,
improving flexibility, speed, and accuracy while offering a simpler, more
maintainable, and extensible codebase. Our implementation is available at

### [325] [Progressive Tempering Sampler with Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05231)
*Severi Rissanen,RuiKang OuYang,Jiajun He,Wenlin Chen,Markus Heinonen,Arno Solin,José Miguel Hernández-Lobato*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces PTSD, a novel sampler combining diffusion models and MCMC techniques to efficiently sample from unnormalized densities, improving over traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural samplers efficiently approximate distributions but lack the evaluation efficiency of state-of-the-art MCMC, while MCMC methods are computationally costly and unsuitable for reuse. The paper addresses these limitations.

Method: The proposed PTSD method trains diffusion models sequentially across temperature levels, combines higher-temperature diffusion models to produce approximate samples, and refines them minimally using MCMC. This strategy allows efficient reuse of sampled information.

Result: PTSD achieves better target evaluation efficiency and sample quality compared to existing diffusion-based neural samplers, overcoming both MCMC’s and neural samplers’ inefficiencies.

Conclusion: PTSD combines the strengths of MCMC and neural samplers into a reusable, efficient framework for generating high-quality samples, making it a significant improvement over existing methods.

Abstract: Recent research has focused on designing neural samplers that amortize the
process of sampling from unnormalized densities. However, despite significant
advancements, they still fall short of the state-of-the-art MCMC approach,
Parallel Tempering (PT), when it comes to the efficiency of target evaluations.
On the other hand, unlike a well-trained neural sampler, PT yields only
dependent samples and needs to be rerun -- at considerable computational cost
-- whenever new samples are required. To address these weaknesses, we propose
the Progressive Tempering Sampler with Diffusion (PTSD), which trains diffusion
models sequentially across temperatures, leveraging the advantages of PT to
improve the training of neural samplers. We also introduce a novel method to
combine high-temperature diffusion models to generate approximate
lower-temperature samples, which are minimally refined using MCMC and used to
train the next diffusion model. PTSD enables efficient reuse of sample
information across temperature levels while generating well-mixed, uncorrelated
samples. Our method significantly improves target evaluation efficiency,
outperforming diffusion-based neural samplers.

### [326] [Replay Can Provably Increase Forgetting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04377)
*Yasaman Mahdaviyeh,James Lucas,Mengye Ren,Andreas S. Tolias,Richard Zemel,Toniann Pitassi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper analyzes the role of sample replay in continual learning, especially in over-parameterized linear regression settings, highlighting cases where replay can unexpectedly increase forgetting or worsen performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Continual learning aims to develop systems that learn sequential tasks without forgetting previous ones. The study investigates the limitations and theoretical underpinnings of sample replay, a popular strategy for mitigating forgetting.

Method: The authors examine sample replay's efficacy in continual learning within a theoretical framework using over-parameterized linear regression. They provide empirical evidence using neural networks and experiments with a benchmark dataset.

Result: They find that forgetting can be non-monotonic with respect to replay sample count, and replay can sometimes be harmful, both in worst-case and distributional settings, depending on factors like sample choice and task dynamics.

Conclusion: Sample replay efficacy depends heavily on task relationships and sample selection, which exposes its limitations even in controlled, benign scenarios. Careful consideration is critical for its application in continual learning systems.

Abstract: Continual learning seeks to enable machine learning systems to solve an
increasing corpus of tasks sequentially. A critical challenge for continual
learning is forgetting, where the performance on previously learned tasks
decreases as new tasks are introduced. One of the commonly used techniques to
mitigate forgetting, sample replay, has been shown empirically to reduce
forgetting by retaining some examples from old tasks and including them in new
training episodes. In this work, we provide a theoretical analysis of sample
replay in an over-parameterized continual linear regression setting, where each
task is given by a linear subspace and with enough replay samples, one would be
able to eliminate forgetting. Our analysis focuses on sample replay and
highlights the role of the replayed samples and the relationship between task
subspaces. Surprisingly, we find that, even in a noiseless setting, forgetting
can be non-monotonic with respect to the number of replay samples. We present
tasks where replay can be harmful with respect to worst-case settings, and also
in distributional settings where replay of randomly selected samples increases
forgetting in expectation. We also give empirical evidence that harmful replay
is not limited to training with linear models by showing similar behavior for a
neural networks equipped with SGD. Through experiments on a commonly used
benchmark, we provide additional evidence that, even in seemingly benign
scenarios, performance of the replay heavily depends on the choice of replay
samples and the relationship between tasks.

*Baihe Huang,Shanda Li,Tianhao Wu,Yiming Yang,Ameet Talwalkar,Kannan Ramchandran,Michael I. Jordan,Jiantao Jiao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper examines the sample efficiency of test-time strategies (e.g., self-consistency, best-of-$n$, and self-correction) for large language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve theoretical understanding of sample efficiency in test-time strategies used in LLMs and to expand their theoretical representation capabilities to multitask settings.

Method: The authors analyzed the sample requirements for different strategies, established results showing that self-consistency and best-of-$n$ differ, and explored the expressiveness of self-correction with verifier feedback.

Result: Self-consistency requires $Θ(1/Δ^2)$ samples, while best-of-$n$ needs $Θ(1/Δ)$. Self-correction enables Transformers to simulate online learning with experts for multitask capabilities.

Conclusion: The paper establishes theoretical and empirical support for test-time strategies, enabling multitask problem-solving in LLMs through self-correction and enhancing understanding of sample efficiency.

Abstract: Test-time scaling paradigms have significantly advanced the capabilities of
large language models (LLMs) on complex tasks. Despite their empirical success,
theoretical understanding of the sample efficiency of various test-time
strategies -- such as self-consistency, best-of-$n$, and self-correction --
remains limited. In this work, we first establish a separation result between
two repeated sampling strategies: self-consistency requires
$\Theta(1/\Delta^2)$ samples to produce the correct answer, while best-of-$n$
only needs $\Theta(1/\Delta)$, where $\Delta < 1$ denotes the probability gap
between the correct and second most likely answers. Next, we present an
expressiveness result for the self-correction approach with verifier feedback:
it enables Transformers to simulate online learning over a pool of experts at
test time. Therefore, a single Transformer architecture can provably solve
multiple tasks without prior knowledge of the specific task associated with a
user query, extending the representation theory of Transformers from
single-task to multi-task settings. Finally, we empirically validate our
theoretical results, demonstrating the practical effectiveness of
self-correction methods.

### [328] [Bridging the Performance Gap Between Target-Free and Target-Based Reinforcement Learning With Iterated Q-Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04398)
*Théo Vincent,Yogesh Tripathi,Tim Faust,Yaniv Oren,Jan Peters,Carlo D'Eramo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a technique called iterated Shared Q-Learning (iS-QL) that removes the conventional target network in reinforcement learning while mitigating associated instability issues, improving sample efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In reinforcement learning, eliminating the target network can free memory to increase online network capacity but causes instability and avoids using target-network literature.

Method: The proposed iS-QL method uses a copy of the last layer of the online network as the target network, sharing the rest of the parameters. It allows parallel learning of consecutive Bellman updates.

Result: iS-QL enhances sample efficiency for target-free approaches in various settings, with a reduced memory footprint and comparable training time to target-based methods.

Conclusion: iS-QL offers a scalable alternative to classical target-based algorithms in reinforcement learning, balancing efficiency, stability, and resource utilization.

Abstract: In value-based reinforcement learning, removing the target network is
tempting as the boostrapped target would be built from up-to-date estimates,
and the spared memory occupied by the target network could be reallocated to
expand the capacity of the online network. However, eliminating the target
network introduces instability, leading to a decline in performance. Removing
the target network also means we cannot leverage the literature developed
around target networks. In this work, we propose to use a copy of the last
linear layer of the online network as a target network, while sharing the
remaining parameters with the up-to-date online network, hence stepping out of
the binary choice between target-based and target-free methods. It enables us
to leverage the concept of iterated Q-learning, which consists of learning
consecutive Bellman iterations in parallel, to reduce the performance gap
between target-free and target-based approaches. Our findings demonstrate that
this novel method, termed iterated Shared Q-Learning (iS-QL), improves the
sample efficiency of target-free approaches across various settings.
Importantly, iS-QL requires a smaller memory footprint and comparable training
time to classical target-based algorithms, highlighting its potential to scale
reinforcement learning research.

*Suzan Ece Ada,Emre Ugur*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: UMCNP introduces a hybrid few-shot meta-RL method combining policy gradient-based approaches with task inference models to adapt efficiently without rewards during meta-testing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of few-shot meta-RL in scenarios where reward signals are unavailable during meta-testing, improving sample efficiency without extra meta-training samples.

Method: UMCNP uses Conditional Neural Processes (CNPs) for scalable and efficient reward-free meta-testing. It reuses previously collected samples to learn task inference offline and adapts to unseen tasks using inferred dynamics models.

Result: UMCNP demonstrates significant sample efficiency during meta-testing compared to baselines in benchmarks like 2D-Point Agent, cartpole, and walker agent.

Conclusion: UMCNP is effective for reward-free meta-RL scenarios, adapting to unseen tasks with fewer samples while leveraging efficient task inference mechanisms.

Abstract: We introduce Unsupervised Meta-Testing with Conditional Neural Processes
(UMCNP), a novel hybrid few-shot meta-reinforcement learning (meta-RL) method
that uniquely combines, yet distinctly separates, parameterized policy
gradient-based (PPG) and task inference-based few-shot meta-RL. Tailored for
settings where the reward signal is missing during meta-testing, our method
increases sample efficiency without requiring additional samples in
meta-training. UMCNP leverages the efficiency and scalability of Conditional
Neural Processes (CNPs) to reduce the number of online interactions required in
meta-testing. During meta-training, samples previously collected through PPG
meta-RL are efficiently reused for learning task inference in an offline
manner. UMCNP infers the latent representation of the transition dynamics model
from a single test task rollout with unknown parameters. This approach allows
us to generate rollouts for self-adaptation by interacting with the learned
dynamics model. We demonstrate our method can adapt to an unseen test task
using significantly fewer samples during meta-testing than the baselines in
2D-Point Agent and continuous control meta-RL benchmarks, namely, cartpole with
unknown angle sensor bias, walker agent with randomized dynamics parameters.

*Achleshwar Luthra,Tianbao Yang,Tomer Galanti*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper investigates the link between contrastive learning (CL) and a supervised alternative (NSCL), showing that the gap between them reduces as the number of semantic classes increases, and validates these theoretical findings empirically.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to understand the theoretical underpinnings of self-supervised contrastive learning (CL) and provide a foundation linking it to a supervised alternative (NSCL). The field lacks a theoretical framework explaining CL's success.

Method: The paper analytically establishes how CL relates to NSCL by proving a vanishing gap between the losses with increasing semantic classes. It also characterizes the geometry of representations learned by NSCL and derives a bound on few-shot learning error based on feature variability.

Result: Key results show that the gap between CL and NSCL decreases as the number of classes grows, feature geometry of representations minimizes augmentation collapse, and the few-shot error bound accurately predicts probing performance.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that minimizing CL loss implicitly approximates NSCL loss, enabling few-shot learning with simple linear probes. The theoretical findings are validated with empirical evaluations, showing tight correlation in losses and an accurate few-shot error bound.

Abstract: Despite its empirical success, the theoretical foundations of self-supervised
contrastive learning (CL) are not yet fully established. In this work, we
address this gap by showing that standard CL objectives implicitly approximate
a supervised variant we call the negatives-only supervised contrastive loss
(NSCL), which excludes same-class contrasts. We prove that the gap between the
CL and NSCL losses vanishes as the number of semantic classes increases, under
a bound that is both label-agnostic and architecture-independent.
  We characterize the geometric structure of the global minimizers of the NSCL
loss: the learned representations exhibit augmentation collapse, within-class
collapse, and class centers that form a simplex equiangular tight frame. We
further introduce a new bound on the few-shot error of linear-probing. This
bound depends on two measures of feature variability--within-class dispersion
and variation along the line between class centers. We show that directional
variation dominates the bound and that the within-class dispersion's effect
diminishes as the number of labeled samples increases. These properties enable
CL and NSCL-trained representations to support accurate few-shot label recovery
using simple linear probes.
  Finally, we empirically validate our theoretical findings: the gap between CL
and NSCL losses decays at a rate of $\mathcal{O}(\frac{1}{\#\text{classes}})$;
the two losses are highly correlated; minimizing the CL loss implicitly brings
the NSCL loss close to the value achieved by direct minimization; and the
proposed few-shot error bound provides a tight estimate of probing performance
in practice.

TL;DR: Fine-tuning pre-trained large language models (LLMs) is computationally and memory-intensive; this paper introduces novel zero-order (ZO) optimization methods to address these challenges efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods like SGD and Adam for fine-tuning LLMs face prohibitive memory and computation costs as model size increases. ZO optimization methods offer a potential alternative for more efficient fine-tuning, especially in resource-constrained environments.

Method: The paper proposes two ZO optimization algorithms: 1) JAGUAR SignSGD, a memory-efficient ZO momentum-based algorithm with rigorous convergence guarantees, and 2) JAGUAR Muon, a novel extension of the Muon optimizer leveraging matrix structures of model parameters. Both methods are applied within parameter-efficient techniques like LoRA.

Result: Extensive experiments on challenging LLM fine-tuning benchmarks reveal that the proposed ZO optimization methods achieve comparable or superior convergence quality to standard first-order methods while significantly reducing memory usage.

Conclusion: The presented ZO optimization methods are effective, practical, and theoretically supported alternatives for fine-tuning LLMs in resource-constrained settings, paving the way for more accessible model adaptation strategies.

Abstract: Fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) is essential for adapting
pre-trained models to downstream tasks. Yet traditional first-order optimizers
such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and Adam incur prohibitive memory and
computational costs that scale poorly with model size. In this paper, we
investigate zero-order (ZO) optimization methods as a memory- and
compute-efficient alternative, particularly in the context of
parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques like LoRA. We propose
$\texttt{JAGUAR SignSGD}$, a ZO momentum-based algorithm that extends ZO
SignSGD, requiring the same number of parameters as the standard ZO SGD and
only $\mathcal{O}(1)$ function evaluations per iteration. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first study to establish rigorous convergence guarantees
for SignSGD in the stochastic ZO case. We further propose $\texttt{JAGUAR
Muon}$, a novel ZO extension of the Muon optimizer that leverages the matrix
structure of model parameters, and we provide its convergence rate under
arbitrary stochastic noise. Through extensive experiments on challenging LLM
fine-tuning benchmarks, we demonstrate that the proposed algorithms meet or
exceed the convergence quality of standard first-order methods, achieving
significant memory reduction. Our theoretical and empirical results establish
new ZO optimization methods as a practical and theoretically grounded approach
for resource-constrained LLM adaptation. Our code is available at

TL;DR: KOALA++ is a Kalman-based neural network optimizer that models rich gradient uncertainty while being efficient like first-order methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address inefficiencies in second-order optimization methods and enhance gradient uncertainty modeling.

Method: Developed a scalable optimization algorithm that estimates parameter covariance compactly without requiring full matrix storage or inversion.

Result: Achieved accuracy comparable to or better than first- and second-order optimizers across multiple tasks while remaining computationally efficient.

Conclusion: KOALA++ effectively balances computational efficiency and performance by incorporating structured uncertainty in a compact manner.

Abstract: We propose KOALA++, a scalable Kalman-based optimization algorithm that
explicitly models structured gradient uncertainty in neural network training.
Unlike second-order methods, which rely on expensive second order gradient
calculation, our method directly estimates the parameter covariance matrix by
recursively updating compact gradient covariance products. This design improves
upon the original KOALA framework that assumed diagonal covariance by
implicitly capturing richer uncertainty structure without storing the full
covariance matrix and avoiding large matrix inversions. Across diverse tasks,
including image classification and language modeling, KOALA++ achieves accuracy
on par or better than state-of-the-art first- and second-order optimizers while
maintaining the efficiency of first-order methods.

TL;DR: The paper introduces RETRO SYNFLOW, a framework for single-step retrosynthesis in organic chemistry, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy and diversity in reaction prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the challenges in accurately and diversely predicting single-step retrosynthesis reactions due to the combinatorial nature of the chemical search space.

Method: The method involves a discrete flow-matching framework with reaction center identification, production of synthons, and Feynman-Kac steering using Sequential Monte Carlo for improving reaction prediction.

Result: RETRO SYNFLOW achieves 60.0% top-1 accuracy, outperforming previous state-of-the-art methods by 20%, and improves top-5 accuracy by 19% using FK-steering.

Conclusion: RETRO SYNFLOW significantly advances the field by improving the accuracy, diversity, and feasibility of predicting single-step retrosynthesis reactions, setting a new state-of-the-art.

Abstract: A fundamental problem in organic chemistry is identifying and predicting the
series of reactions that synthesize a desired target product molecule. Due to
the combinatorial nature of the chemical search space, single-step reactant
prediction -- i.e. single-step retrosynthesis -- remains challenging even for
existing state-of-the-art template-free generative approaches to produce an
accurate yet diverse set of feasible reactions. In this paper, we model
single-step retrosynthesis planning and introduce RETRO SYNFLOW (RSF) a
discrete flow-matching framework that builds a Markov bridge between the
prescribed target product molecule and the reactant molecule. In contrast to
past approaches, RSF employs a reaction center identification step to produce
intermediate structures known as synthons as a more informative source
distribution for the discrete flow. To further enhance diversity and
feasibility of generated samples, we employ Feynman-Kac steering with
Sequential Monte Carlo based resampling to steer promising generations at
inference using a new reward oracle that relies on a forward-synthesis model.
Empirically, we demonstrate \nameshort achieves $60.0 \%$ top-1 accuracy, which
outperforms the previous SOTA by $20 \%$. We also substantiate the benefits of
steering at inference and demonstrate that FK-steering improves top-$5$
round-trip accuracy by $19 \%$ over prior template-free SOTA methods, all while
preserving competitive top-$k$ accuracy results.

TL;DR: The paper introduces selective matching loss functions tailored to prioritize accurate predictions in more critical regions of the domain while deemphasizing less important regions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address scenarios where accuracy in specific parts of the domain is more crucial than a uniform accuracy across all regions.

Method: The authors design selective scalar and multidimensional loss functions using links like Sigmoid, hyperbolic sine, and composite Softmax functions.

Result: Selective losses demonstrated improved sensitivity to critical score regions compared to traditional loss functions across various applications.

Conclusion: Selective matching loss functions can enhance prediction quality in high-importance regions, yielding better results for applications like ranking, retrieval, and fine-tuning of LLMs.

Abstract: Learning systems match predicted scores to observations over some domain.
Often, it is critical to produce accurate predictions in some subset (or
region) of the domain, yet less important to accurately predict in other
regions. We construct selective matching loss functions by design of increasing
link functions over score domains. A matching loss is an integral over the
link. A link defines loss sensitivity as function of the score, emphasizing
high slope high sensitivity regions over flat ones. Loss asymmetry drives a
model and resolves its underspecification to predict better in high sensitivity
regions where it is more important, and to distinguish between high and low
importance regions. A large variety of selective scalar losses can be designed
with scaled and shifted Sigmoid and hyperbolic sine links. Their properties,
however, do not extend to multi-class. Applying them per dimension lacks
ranking sensitivity that assigns importance according to class score ranking.
Utilizing composite Softmax functions, we develop a framework for
multidimensional selective losses. We overcome limitations of the standard
Softmax function, that is good for classification, but not for distinction
between adjacent scores. Selective losses have substantial advantage over
traditional losses in applications with more important score regions, including
dwell-time prediction, retrieval, ranking with either pointwise, contrastive
pairwise, or listwise losses, distillation problems, and fine-tuning alignment
of Large Language Models (LLMs).

*Huynh T. T. Tran,Jacob Sander,Achraf Cohen,Brian Jalaian,Nathaniel D. Bastian*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper extends the ODXU framework, incorporating advanced uncertainty quantification methods, and demonstrates superior performance and transfer learning capabilities in network intrusion detection systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the robustness, interpretability, and generalization of Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) through a novel Neurosymbolic AI framework while addressing gaps in cybersecurity transfer learning.

Method: The extended ODXU framework integrates deep embedded clustering, XGBoost for symbolic reasoning, uncertainty quantification methods (score-based and metamodel-based), and a transfer learning strategy reusing and fine-tuning model components.

Result: On the CIC-IDS-2017 dataset, ODXU surpasses traditional neural models on six evaluation metrics. Transfer learning experiments on ACI-IoT-2023 show effective model reuse with only 50% training data while metamodel-based UQ methods outperform score-based approaches consistently.

Conclusion: ODXU proves to be a robust, interpretable, and generalizable framework for NIDS, with a demonstrated capability for effective transfer learning and advanced uncertainty quantification.

Abstract: Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) play a vital role in protecting
digital infrastructures against increasingly sophisticated cyber threats. In
this paper, we extend ODXU, a Neurosymbolic AI (NSAI) framework that integrates
deep embedded clustering for feature extraction, symbolic reasoning using
XGBoost, and comprehensive uncertainty quantification (UQ) to enhance
robustness, interpretability, and generalization in NIDS. The extended ODXU
incorporates score-based methods (e.g., Confidence Scoring, Shannon Entropy)
and metamodel-based techniques, including SHAP values and Information Gain, to
assess the reliability of predictions. Experimental results on the CIC-IDS-2017
dataset show that ODXU outperforms traditional neural models across six
evaluation metrics, including classification accuracy and false omission rate.
While transfer learning has seen widespread adoption in fields such as computer
vision and natural language processing, its potential in cybersecurity has not
been thoroughly explored. To bridge this gap, we develop a transfer learning
strategy that enables the reuse of a pre-trained ODXU model on a different
dataset. Our ablation study on ACI-IoT-2023 demonstrates that the optimal
transfer configuration involves reusing the pre-trained autoencoder, retraining
the clustering module, and fine-tuning the XGBoost classifier, and outperforms
traditional neural models when trained with as few as 16,000 samples
(approximately 50% of the training data). Additionally, results show that
metamodel-based UQ methods consistently outperform score-based approaches on
both datasets.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper explores classifying dental providers as standard or safety net clinics using machine learning on a high-missing-value dataset, achieving a 94.1% accuracy with neural networks and emphasizing the role of feature selection in healthcare ML.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to optimize the classification of dental providers to improve resource allocation for underserved populations and address challenges in analyzing healthcare datasets with missing values.

Method: The study used a dataset with 24,300 instances and 20 features to test 12 machine learning models. Key predictors were identified through feature ranking methods like information gain and ANOVA. The models were evaluated using 10-fold cross-validation with incremental feature subsets.

Result: Neural Networks achieved the highest accuracy (94.1%), followed by Gradient Boosting (93.2%) and Random Forest (93.0%). Treatment service count metrics were the most critical predictors. Feature incorporation improved ML model performance, overcoming challenges posed by missing data.

Conclusion: The research highlights the effectiveness of feature-ranking methods combined with ML models in classifying healthcare data accurately and efficiently, advocating their use for better resource allocation in underserved populations.

Abstract: This study investigates the application of machine learning (ML) models for
classifying dental providers into two categories - standard rendering providers
and safety net clinic (SNC) providers - using a 2018 dataset of 24,300
instances with 20 features. The dataset, characterized by high missing values
(38.1%), includes service counts (preventive, treatment, exams), delivery
systems (FFS, managed care), and beneficiary demographics. Feature ranking
methods such as information gain, Gini index, and ANOVA were employed to
identify critical predictors, revealing treatment-related metrics
(TXMT_USER_CNT, TXMT_SVC_CNT) as top-ranked features. Twelve ML models,
including k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN), Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines
(SVM), Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Random Forest, Neural Networks, and
Gradient Boosting, were evaluated using 10-fold cross-validation.
Classification accuracy was tested across incremental feature subsets derived
from rankings. The Neural Network achieved the highest accuracy (94.1%) using
all 20 features, followed by Gradient Boosting (93.2%) and Random Forest
(93.0%). Models showed improved performance as more features were incorporated,
with SGD and ensemble methods demonstrating robustness to missing data. Feature
ranking highlighted the dominance of treatment service counts and annotation
codes in distinguishing provider types, while demographic variables (AGE_GROUP,
CALENDAR_YEAR) had minimal impact. The study underscores the importance of
feature selection in enhancing model efficiency and accuracy, particularly in
imbalanced healthcare datasets. These findings advocate for integrating
feature-ranking techniques with advanced ML algorithms to optimize dental
provider classification, enabling targeted resource allocation for underserved
populations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to optimize healthcare resource allocation by effectively classifying dental providers (e.g., SNC providers vs. standard rendering providers) to better serve underserved populations.

Method: The researchers used a 2018 dataset with 24,300 instances and 20 features, despite 38.1% missing data. They tested machine learning models (e.g., Neural Networks, Random Forest, SVM) using 10-fold cross-validation and evaluated performance via metrics like AUC and classification accuracy.

Result: Neural Networks achieved the highest results with an AUC of 0.975 and a classification accuracy of 94.1%. Random Forest also performed well, but traditional models like SVM lagged in handling complex feature interactions and imbalanced data.

Conclusion: Advanced machine learning techniques, particularly Neural Networks and ensemble models, significantly enhance dental provider classification and can be integrated into healthcare analytics for improved resource distribution.

Abstract: Dental provider classification plays a crucial role in optimizing healthcare
resource allocation and policy planning. Effective categorization of providers,
such as standard rendering providers and safety net clinic (SNC) providers,
enhances service delivery to underserved populations. This study aimed to
evaluate the performance of machine learning models in classifying dental
providers using a 2018 dataset. A dataset of 24,300 instances with 20 features
was analyzed, including beneficiary and service counts across fee-for-service
(FFS), Geographic Managed Care, and Pre-Paid Health Plans. Providers were
categorized by delivery system and patient age groups (0-20 and 21+). Despite
38.1% missing data, multiple machine learning algorithms were tested, including
k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN), Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines (SVM),
Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Random Forest, Neural Networks, and Gradient
Boosting. A 10-fold cross-validation approach was applied, and models were
evaluated using AUC, classification accuracy (CA), F1-score, precision, and
recall. Neural Networks achieved the highest AUC (0.975) and CA (94.1%),
followed by Random Forest (AUC: 0.948, CA: 93.0%). These models effectively
handled imbalanced data and complex feature interactions, outperforming
traditional classifiers like Logistic Regression and SVM. Advanced machine
learning techniques, particularly ensemble and deep learning models,
significantly enhance dental workforce classification. Their integration into
healthcare analytics can improve provider identification and resource
distribution, benefiting underserved populations.

TL;DR: COSMOS is a prediction framework that minimizes expensive trials for LLM adaptation, achieving efficient performance and cost assessments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Selecting the best model and adaptation strategy for LLMs under resource constraints is difficult and requires extensive experimentation.

Method: Developed COSMOS framework with lightweight proxy models and low-sample scaling laws to predict performance and cost effectively.

Result: COSMOS achieves high prediction accuracy while reducing computational costs by 92.72% on average and up to 98.71% in resource-intensive setups.

Conclusion: Accurate and efficient prediction of LLM adaptation outcomes is feasible and significantly reduces deployment computational costs.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve remarkable performance across numerous
tasks by using a diverse array of adaptation strategies. However, optimally
selecting a model and adaptation strategy under resource constraints is
challenging and often requires extensive experimentation. We investigate
whether it is possible to accurately predict both performance and cost without
expensive trials. We formalize the strategy selection problem for LLMs and
introduce COSMOS, a unified prediction framework that efficiently estimates
adaptation outcomes at minimal cost. We instantiate and study the capability of
our framework via a pair of powerful predictors: embedding-augmented
lightweight proxy models to predict fine-tuning performance, and low-sample
scaling laws to forecast retrieval-augmented in-context learning. Extensive
evaluation across eight representative benchmarks demonstrates that COSMOS
achieves high prediction accuracy while reducing computational costs by 92.72%
on average, and up to 98.71% in resource-intensive scenarios. Our results show
that efficient prediction of adaptation outcomes is not only feasible but can
substantially reduce the computational overhead of LLM deployment while
maintaining performance standards.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces CryoBoltz, a method combining cryo-EM density maps with protein structure prediction models to achieve predictions consistent with experimental data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the gap in capturing conformational diversity of dynamic biomolecular complexes in protein structure prediction models, and the limitations of cryo-EM in translating raw data into atomic models.

Method: The method, CryoBoltz, uses cryo-EM density maps together with a pretrained protein structure prediction model, employing both global and local structural constraints to guide predictions during inference.

Result: CryoBoltz successfully predicts atomic models that are consistent with experimental cryo-EM data for a variety of dynamic biomolecular systems, including transporters and antibodies.

Conclusion: CryoBoltz provides a flexible and effective approach to bridge protein structure prediction models and cryo-EM for studying heterogeneous biomolecular systems.

Abstract: Protein structure prediction models are now capable of generating accurate 3D
structural hypotheses from sequence alone. However, they routinely fail to
capture the conformational diversity of dynamic biomolecular complexes, often
requiring heuristic MSA subsampling approaches for generating alternative
states. In parallel, cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) has emerged as a
powerful tool for imaging near-native structural heterogeneity, but is
challenged by arduous pipelines to go from raw experimental data to atomic
models. Here, we bridge the gap between these modalities, combining cryo-EM
density maps with the rich sequence and biophysical priors learned by protein
structure prediction models. Our method, CryoBoltz, guides the sampling
trajectory of a pretrained protein structure prediction model using both global
and local structural constraints derived from density maps, driving predictions
towards conformational states consistent with the experimental data. We
demonstrate that this flexible yet powerful inference-time approach allows us
to build atomic models into heterogeneous cryo-EM maps across a variety of
dynamic biomolecular systems including transporters and antibodies.

Motivation: Neural PDE solvers tend to struggle with error accumulation over long time horizons and maintaining stability and physical consistency.

Method: The proposed method introduces a multiscale implicit neural emulator that conditions predictions on hierarchies of lower-dimensional future state representations, inspired by implicit time-stepping methods.

Result: The method achieves high short-term accuracy and long-term stable forecasts in turbulent fluid dynamics, outperforming autoregressive baselines with minimal computational overhead.

Conclusion: The approach successfully addresses long-term prediction accuracy and stability challenges, making it a robust tool for modeling complex dynamical systems.

Abstract: Neural PDE solvers offer a powerful tool for modeling complex dynamical
systems, but often struggle with error accumulation over long time horizons and
maintaining stability and physical consistency. We introduce a multiscale
implicit neural emulator that enhances long-term prediction accuracy by
conditioning on a hierarchy of lower-dimensional future state representations.
Drawing inspiration from the stability properties of numerical implicit
time-stepping methods, our approach leverages predictions several steps ahead
in time at increasing compression rates for next-timestep refinements. By
actively adjusting the temporal downsampling ratios, our design enables the
model to capture dynamics across multiple granularities and enforce long-range
temporal coherence. Experiments on turbulent fluid dynamics show that our
method achieves high short-term accuracy and produces long-term stable
forecasts, significantly outperforming autoregressive baselines while adding
minimal computational overhead.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HALoS, a hierarchical asynchronous optimization framework, significantly accelerates geo-distributed large language model (LLM) training while maintaining model accuracy and quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the communication costs and uneven utilization of hardware in training large language models on geographically distributed accelerators.

Method: The proposed HALoS framework introduces local parameter servers within regions and a global parameter server for inter-region updates, coupled with hierarchical momentum for asynchronous training.

Result: HALoS achieves up to 7.5x faster convergence compared to synchronous methods and outperforms existing asynchronous frameworks by up to 2.1x, while preserving or improving model accuracy.

Conclusion: HALoS proves effective for scalable and efficient geo-distributed LLM training, showing its capability to handle heterogeneous environments without compromising model performance.

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) increasingly relies on geographically
distributed accelerators, causing prohibitive communication costs across
regions and uneven utilization of heterogeneous hardware. We propose HALoS, a
hierarchical asynchronous optimization framework that tackles these issues by
introducing local parameter servers (LPSs) within each region and a global
parameter server (GPS) that merges updates across regions. This hierarchical
design minimizes expensive inter-region communication, reduces straggler
effects, and leverages fast intra-region links. We provide a rigorous
convergence analysis for HALoS under non-convex objectives, including
theoretical guarantees on the role of hierarchical momentum in asynchronous
training. Empirically, HALoS attains up to 7.5x faster convergence than
synchronous baselines in geo-distributed LLM training and improves upon
existing asynchronous methods by up to 2.1x. Crucially, HALoS preserves the
model quality of fully synchronous SGD-matching or exceeding accuracy on
standard language modeling and downstream benchmarks-while substantially
lowering total training time. These results demonstrate that hierarchical,
server-side update accumulation and global model merging are powerful tools for
scalable, efficient training of new-era LLMs in heterogeneous, geo-distributed
environments.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Neural MJD, a model integrating stochastic differential equations with compound Poisson processes to address challenges in non-stationary time series predictions, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning methods struggle with generalizing to non-stationary data, especially under abrupt changes, due to their black-box nature and lack of explicit stochastic modeling.

Method: The authors design Neural MJD based on SDE simulation, combining time-inhomogeneous Itô diffusion for continuous dynamics and a time-inhomogeneous compound Poisson process for abrupt jumps. They use likelihood truncation for solving jump complexity and introduce a modified Euler-Maruyama solver to improve accuracy.

Result: Experiments demonstrate Neural MJD's superior performance on synthetic and real-world datasets compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: Neural MJD provides a robust framework for non-stationary time series modeling, effectively addressing limitations of traditional deep learning approaches.

Abstract: While deep learning methods have achieved strong performance in time series
prediction, their black-box nature and inability to explicitly model underlying
stochastic processes often limit their generalization to non-stationary data,
especially in the presence of abrupt changes. In this work, we introduce Neural
MJD, a neural network based non-stationary Merton jump diffusion (MJD) model.
Our model explicitly formulates forecasting as a stochastic differential
equation (SDE) simulation problem, combining a time-inhomogeneous It\^o
diffusion to capture non-stationary stochastic dynamics with a
time-inhomogeneous compound Poisson process to model abrupt jumps. To enable
tractable learning, we introduce a likelihood truncation mechanism that caps
the number of jumps within small time intervals and provide a theoretical error
bound for this approximation. Additionally, we propose an Euler-Maruyama with
restart solver, which achieves a provably lower error bound in estimating
expected states and reduced variance compared to the standard solver.
Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that Neural
MJD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art deep learning and statistical
learning methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study introduces a model-driven quantum federated learning algorithm (mdQFL) addressing challenges like training bottlenecks, numerous devices, and non-IID data in federated learning. It claims improved efficiency in communication costs and model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Federated Learning faces bottlenecks due to massive datasets and device heterogeneity, while non-IID data further complicates its efficiency. Quantum Federated Learning seeks to address these pressing issues.

Method: The researchers propose a model-driven quantum federated learning (mdQFL) algorithm that incorporates training personalization and generalization through quantum-based approaches, thoroughly tested under diverse conditions.

Result: Evaluation in the Qiskit environment revealed mdQFL achieving a nearly 50% reduction in communication costs while maintaining or surpassing model accuracy and enhancing local training efficiency.

Conclusion: The mdQFL framework effectively addresses FL challenges, offers improvements in communication cost and accuracy, and provides substantial insights for quantum and classical FL applications.

Abstract: Training with huge datasets and a large number of participating devices leads
to bottlenecks in federated learning (FL). Furthermore, the challenges of
heterogeneity between multiple FL clients affect the overall performance of the
system. In a quantum federated learning (QFL) context, we address these three
main challenges: i) training bottlenecks from massive datasets, ii) the
involvement of a substantial number of devices, and iii) non-IID data
distributions. We introduce a model-driven quantum federated learning algorithm
(mdQFL) to tackle these challenges. Our proposed approach is efficient and
adaptable to various factors, including different numbers of devices. To the
best of our knowledge, it is the first to explore training and update
personalization, as well as test generalization within a QFL setting, which can
be applied to other FL scenarios. We evaluated the efficiency of the proposed
mdQFL framework through extensive experiments under diverse non-IID data
heterogeneity conditions using various datasets within the Qiskit environment.
Our results demonstrate a nearly 50% decrease in total communication costs
while maintaining or, in some cases, exceeding the accuracy of the final model
and consistently improving local model training compared to the standard QFL
baseline. Moreover, our experimental evaluation thoroughly explores the QFL and
mdQFL algorithms, along with several influencing factors. In addition, we
present a theoretical analysis to clarify the complexities of the proposed
algorithm. The experimental code is available at 1.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the shortcomings in graph symmetrization, which leads to loss of directional information during explanation processes in GNNs, especially in security-critical applications.

Method: The authors combine theoretical analysis and empirical studies to examine the impact of preserving directional semantics on explanation fidelity in GNNs.

Result: The findings reveal that preserving directional semantics significantly enhances explanation fidelity, improving the quality of insights for human decision-making.

Conclusion: The paper advocates for direction-aware GNN explainability to ensure reliable and faithful explanations in critical domains.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are increasingly used in critical domains, where
reliable explanations are vital for supporting human decision-making. However,
the common practice of graph symmetrization discards directional information,
leading to significant information loss and misleading explanations. Our
analysis demonstrates how this practice compromises explanation fidelity.
Through theoretical and empirical studies, we show that preserving directional
semantics significantly improves explanation quality, ensuring more faithful
insights for human decision-makers. These findings highlight the need for
direction-aware GNN explainability in security-critical applications.

*Guruprerana Shabadi,Rajeev Alur*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework for optimizing compositions of AI agents in agentic workflows while minimizing worst-case risks, using a dynamic programming approach and union bounds for approximation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern systems decompose complex objectives into subtasks managed by AI agents while factoring in risk aspects like safety and privacy.

Method: Formulating an agentic workflow as a directed acyclic graph, employing union bounds and dynamic programming to approximate worst-case risks.

Result: Effective identification of near-optimal agent compositions and approximation of worst-case risks in video game-like control benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed algorithm demonstrates its potential in practical scenarios by achieving near-optimal results for reducing risks and improving workflow efficiency.

Abstract: From software development to robot control, modern agentic systems decompose
complex objectives into a sequence of subtasks and choose a set of specialized
AI agents to complete them. We formalize an agentic workflow as a directed
acyclic graph, called an agent graph, where edges represent AI agents and paths
correspond to feasible compositions of agents. When deploying these systems in
the real world, we need to choose compositions of agents that not only maximize
the task success, but also minimize risk where the risk captures requirements
like safety, fairness, and privacy. This additionally requires carefully
analyzing the low-probability (tail) behaviors of compositions of agents. In
this work, we consider worst-case risk minimization over the set of feasible
agent compositions. We define worst-case risk as the tail quantile -- also
known as value-at-risk -- of the loss distribution of the agent composition
where the loss quantifies the risk associated with agent behaviors. We
introduce an efficient algorithm that traverses the agent graph and finds a
near-optimal composition of agents by approximating the value-at-risk via a
union bound and dynamic programming. Furthermore, we prove that the
approximation is near-optimal asymptotically for a broad class of practical
loss functions. To evaluate our framework, we consider a suite of video
game-like control benchmarks that require composing several agents trained with
reinforcement learning and demonstrate our algorithm's effectiveness in
approximating the value-at-risk and identifying the optimal agent composition.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This survey proposes neural network reprogrammability as a unified framework for adapting large-scale models by manipulating information interfaces while keeping parameters frozen.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With large foundation models growing in size, efficiently tailoring them to specific tasks becomes crucial. Existing methods lack coherence and interconnected understanding.

Method: The survey introduces a taxonomy based on manipulation format, location, operator, and output alignment across different modalities, organizing adaptation methods under neural network reprogrammability.

Result: The taxonomy reveals interrelated features of various adaptation techniques, offering a consolidated framework and studying its implications for established methods like in-context learning and chain-of-thought prompting.

Conclusion: Neural network reprogrammability is presented as a core paradigm for efficient model adaptation, with technical challenges and ethical considerations outlined, and research directions identified.

Abstract: As large-scale pre-trained foundation models continue to expand in size and
capability, efficiently adapting them to specific downstream tasks has become
increasingly critical. Despite substantial progress, existing adaptation
approaches have evolved largely in isolation, without a clear understanding of
their interrelationships. This survey introduces neural network
reprogrammability as a unifying framework that bridges mainstream model
adaptation techniques--model reprogramming, prompt tuning, and prompt
instruction--previously fragmented research areas yet converges on a shared
principle: repurposing a pre-trained model by manipulating information at the
interfaces while keeping the model parameters frozen. These methods exploit
neural networks' sensitivity to manipulation on different interfaces, be it
through perturbing inputs, inserting tokens into intermediate layers, or
providing task-specific examples in context, to redirect model behaviors
towards desired outcomes. We then present a taxonomy that categorizes such
information manipulation-based adaptation approaches across four key
dimensions: manipulation format (fixed or learnable), location (interfaces
where manipulations occur), operator (how they are applied), and output
alignment requirement (post-processing needed to align outputs with downstream
tasks). Notably, this framework applies consistently across data modalities,
independent of specific model architectures. Moreover, viewing established
techniques like in-context learning and chain-of-thought prompting through this
lens reveals both their theoretical connections and practical distinctions. We
further analyze remaining technical challenges and ethical considerations,
positioning neural network reprogrammability as a fundamental paradigm for
efficient model adaptation. We lastly identify promising research directions
emerging from this integrative viewpoint.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper argues against the overstated impact of 'oversmoothing' in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and highlights other factors like vanishing gradients instead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To challenge the prevailing notion that oversmoothing is the key limitation in creating deeper GNN architectures.

Method: The authors analyzed core GNN operations (aggregation, transformation, and activation) and tested classical solutions like skip connections and normalization for deep GNN stacking.

Result: They identified that vanishing gradients—not oversmoothing—cause performance issues in deep GNNs. Classical techniques allow deep GNNs without degradation.

Conclusion: Misconceptions about GNN oversmoothing are addressed, showing the potential for deep GNN architectures with proper methods.

Abstract: Oversmoothing has been recognized as a main obstacle to building deep Graph
Neural Networks (GNNs), limiting the performance. This position paper argues
that the influence of oversmoothing has been overstated and advocates for a
further exploration of deep GNN architectures. Given the three core operations
of GNNs, aggregation, linear transformation, and non-linear activation, we show
that prior studies have mistakenly confused oversmoothing with the vanishing
gradient, caused by transformation and activation rather than aggregation. Our
finding challenges prior beliefs about oversmoothing being unique to GNNs.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that classical solutions such as skip connections
and normalization enable the successful stacking of deep GNN layers without
performance degradation. Our results clarify misconceptions about oversmoothing
and shed new light on the potential of deep GNNs.

*Wanfu Gao,Hanlin Pan,Qingqi Han,Kunpeng Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses the curse of dimensionality in Partial Multi-label Learning (PML) by proposing a feature selection method based on noise-resistant label relationships and a reformed low-rank assumption.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PML faces challenges from high dimensionality leading to overfitting, poor classification performance, and issues with identifying positive labels in noisy real-world scenarios.

Method: The approach uses label relationship noise-resistance for label disambiguation, a reformed low-rank assumption in the learning process, and label connectivity to reconstruct a weight matrix and select features effectively.

Result: Experiments on benchmark datasets showcase the proposed method's superior performance compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed method addresses dimensionality limitations in PML through better label disambiguation and feature selection, demonstrating effectiveness in improving classification performance.

Abstract: The "Curse of dimensionality" is prevalent across various data patterns,
which increases the risk of model overfitting and leads to a decline in model
classification performance. However, few studies have focused on this issue in
Partial Multi-label Learning (PML), where each sample is associated with a set
of candidate labels, at least one of which is correct. Existing PML methods
addressing this problem are mainly based on the low-rank assumption. However,
low-rank assumption is difficult to be satisfied in practical situations and
may lead to loss of high-dimensional information. Furthermore, we find that
existing methods have poor ability to identify positive labels, which is
important in real-world scenarios. In this paper, a PML feature selection
method is proposed considering two important characteristics of dataset: label
relationship's noise-resistance and label connectivity. Our proposed method
utilizes label relationship's noise-resistance to disambiguate labels. Then the
learning process is designed through the reformed low-rank assumption. Finally,
representative labels are found through label connectivity, and the weight
matrix is reconstructed to select features with strong identification ability
to these labels. The experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate the
superiority of the proposed method.

TL;DR: The paper proposes FedAPM, an FL framework using ADMM to alleviate client drift caused by heterogeneous and multimodal datasets, achieving superior stability and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current FL approaches struggle with non-i.i.d. datasets across devices and diverse data modalities, where partial model personalization exacerbates client drift, reducing algorithm performance.

Method: The FedAPM framework incorporates first-order and second-order proximal terms into an augmented Lagrangian function, leveraging ADMM for better model consistency between clients and the shared model.

Result: FedAPM demonstrates faster convergence and higher performance in accuracy (12.3%), F1 score (16.4%), and AUC (18.0%) over state-of-the-art methods on heterogeneous datasets, with fewer communication rounds.

Conclusion: The FedAPM framework improves FL efficiency and effectiveness by mitigating client drift and demonstrating robust, globally convergent training under diverse data conditions.

Abstract: In federated learning (FL), the assumption that datasets from different
devices are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) often does not
hold due to user differences, and the presence of various data modalities
across clients makes using a single model impractical. Personalizing certain
parts of the model can effectively address these issues by allowing those parts
to differ across clients, while the remaining parts serve as a shared model.
However, we found that partial model personalization may exacerbate client
drift (each client's local model diverges from the shared model), thereby
reducing the effectiveness and efficiency of FL algorithms. We propose an FL
framework based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM),
referred to as FedAPM, to mitigate client drift. We construct the augmented
Lagrangian function by incorporating first-order and second-order proximal
terms into the objective, with the second-order term providing fixed correction
and the first-order term offering compensatory correction between the local and
shared models. Our analysis demonstrates that FedAPM, by using explicit
estimates of the Lagrange multiplier, is more stable and efficient in terms of
convergence compared to other FL frameworks. We establish the global
convergence of FedAPM training from arbitrary initial points to a stationary
point, achieving three types of rates: constant, linear, and sublinear, under
mild assumptions. We conduct experiments using four heterogeneous and
multimodal datasets with different metrics to validate the performance of
FedAPM. Specifically, FedAPM achieves faster and more accurate convergence,
outperforming the SOTA methods with average improvements of 12.3% in test
accuracy, 16.4% in F1 score, and 18.0% in AUC while requiring fewer
communication rounds.

*Marco Zanotti*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper evaluated forecasting ensemble models' trade-offs between accuracy and computational cost, finding that small, efficiency-driven ensembles strike a good balance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the growing relevance of the trade-off between forecast accuracy and computational cost in ensemble learning for large-scale time series forecasting.

Method: The study analyzed ten base models and eight ensemble configurations on two retail datasets under different retraining frequencies, comparing point and probabilistic forecasting performances.

Result: Ensembles consistently improved forecasting accuracy, especially probabilistic accuracy, but larger ensembles incurred substantial computational costs. Reducing retraining frequency lowered costs with minimal accuracy loss.

Conclusion: Small ensembles of 2-3 models often achieve near-optimal results, making them practical for scalable, cost-efficient, real-world forecasting applications.

Abstract: Given the continuous increase in dataset sizes and the complexity of
forecasting models, the trade-off between forecast accuracy and computational
cost is emerging as an extremely relevant topic, especially in the context of
ensemble learning for time series forecasting. To asses it, we evaluated ten
base models and eight ensemble configurations across two large-scale retail
datasets (M5 and VN1), considering both point and probabilistic accuracy under
varying retraining frequencies. We showed that ensembles consistently improve
forecasting performance, particularly in probabilistic settings. However, these
gains come at a substantial computational cost, especially for larger,
accuracy-driven ensembles. We found that reducing retraining frequency
significantly lowers costs, with minimal impact on accuracy, particularly for
point forecasts. Moreover, efficiency-driven ensembles offer a strong balance,
achieving competitive accuracy with considerably lower costs compared to
accuracy-optimized combinations. Most importantly, small ensembles of two or
three models are often sufficient to achieve near-optimal results. These
findings provide practical guidelines for deploying scalable and cost-efficient
forecasting systems, supporting the broader goals of sustainable AI in
forecasting. Overall, this work shows that careful ensemble design and
retraining strategy selection can yield accurate, robust, and cost-effective
forecasts suitable for real-world applications.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces DIPNet, a method for improving generalization by projecting inputs into learnable distributions at each layer, leading to a smoother loss landscape.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding and improving generalization in overparameterized models by addressing their loss landscape smoothness.

Method: Propose Distributional Input Projection Networks (DIPNet) that project inputs into learnable distributions, reducing local smoothness measures and the Lipschitz constant.

Result: DIPNet enhances test performance across various architectures and tasks, showing robustness to adversarial attacks and out-of-distribution inputs.

Conclusion: DIPNet provides a general and effective approach to improve generalization for modern deep learning models, and is compatible with various architectures.

Abstract: As overparameterized models become increasingly prevalent, training loss
alone offers limited insight into generalization performance. While smoothness
has been linked to improved generalization across various settings, directly
enforcing smoothness in neural networks remains challenging. To address this,
we introduce Distributional Input Projection Networks (DIPNet), a novel
framework that projects inputs into learnable distributions at each layer. This
distributional representation induces a smoother loss landscape with respect to
the input, promoting better generalization. We provide theoretical analysis
showing that DIPNet reduces both local smoothness measures and the Lipschitz
constant of the network, contributing to improved generalization performance.
Empirically, we validate DIPNet across a wide range of architectures and tasks,
including Vision Transformers (ViTs), Large Language Models (LLMs), ResNet and
MLPs. Our method consistently enhances test performance under standard
settings, adversarial attacks, out-of-distribution inputs, and reasoning
benchmarks. We demonstrate that the proposed input projection strategy can be
seamlessly integrated into existing models, providing a general and effective
approach for boosting generalization performance in modern deep learning.

*Jaeseung Heo,Kyeongheung Yun,Seokwon Yoon,MoonJeong Park,Jungseul Ok,Dongwoo Kim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a new method for predicting how edge modifications affect graph neural networks (GNNs), addressing key limitations of existing approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for predicting GNN edge influence rely on strict assumptions, only handle deletions, and ignore message propagation changes.

Method: The authors introduce a proximal Bregman response function tailored for GNNs, which relaxes convexity assumptions and incorporates both edge deletions and insertions.

Result: The proposed method accurately predicts influence in GNNs across multiple datasets and showcases versatility in tasks like graph rewiring and adversarial attacks.

Conclusion: The new influence function improves GNN interpretability and robustness while enabling broader applications involving edge modifications.

Abstract: Understanding how individual edges influence the behavior of graph neural
networks (GNNs) is essential for improving their interpretability and
robustness. Graph influence functions have emerged as promising tools to
efficiently estimate the effects of edge deletions without retraining. However,
existing influence prediction methods rely on strict convexity assumptions,
exclusively consider the influence of edge deletions while disregarding edge
insertions, and fail to capture changes in message propagation caused by these
modifications. In this work, we propose a proximal Bregman response function
specifically tailored for GNNs, relaxing the convexity requirement and enabling
accurate influence prediction for standard neural network architectures.
Furthermore, our method explicitly accounts for message propagation effects and
extends influence prediction to both edge deletions and insertions in a
principled way. Experiments with real-world datasets demonstrate accurate
influence predictions for different characteristics of GNNs. We further
demonstrate that the influence function is versatile in applications such as
graph rewiring and adversarial attacks.

*Tonmoy Paul,Mrittika Devi Mati,Md. Mahmudul Islam*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a satellite data-driven machine learning framework for classifying drought severity in Bangladesh's 38 districts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional drought indices ignore critical factors like soil moisture and temperature, and existing machine learning models lack comprehensive integration of satellite data for Bangladesh.

Method: The framework employs unsupervised clustering methods (K-means, Bayesian Gaussian Mixture) and classification models (KNN, Random Forest, Decision Tree, Naive Bayes) using weather data (humidity, soil moisture, temperature) from 2012-2024.

Result: The approach effectively classifies drought severity, capturing regional variability and highlighting the efficacy of machine learning models.

Conclusion: Machine learning models, integrated with satellite and weather data, are promising for improving drought classification and prediction in the geographically vulnerable context of Bangladesh.

Abstract: Drought poses a pervasive environmental challenge in Bangladesh, impacting
agriculture, socio-economic stability, and food security due to its unique
geographic and anthropogenic vulnerabilities. Traditional drought indices, such
as the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) and Palmer Drought Severity Index
(PDSI), often overlook crucial factors like soil moisture and temperature,
limiting their resolution. Moreover, current machine learning models applied to
drought prediction have been underexplored in the context of Bangladesh,
lacking a comprehensive integration of satellite data across multiple
districts. To address these gaps, we propose a satellite data-driven machine
learning framework to classify drought across 38 districts of Bangladesh. Using
unsupervised algorithms like K-means and Bayesian Gaussian Mixture for
clustering, followed by classification models such as KNN, Random Forest,
Decision Tree, and Naive Bayes, the framework integrates weather data
(humidity, soil moisture, temperature) from 2012-2024. This approach
successfully classifies drought severity into different levels. However, it
shows significant variabilities in drought vulnerabilities across regions which
highlights the aptitude of machine learning models in terms of identifying and
predicting drought conditions.

*Pinak Mandal,Georg A. Gottwald*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces fast unlearning algorithms for generative models, enabling selective removal of data influence while preserving model quality and achieving faster unlearning times than previous methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is the growing need to unlearn specific data from generative models due to privacy concerns, legal requirements, or harmful content correction, without requiring expensive retraining from scratch.

Method: The method involves fast unlearning algorithms based on loss gradient orthogonalization, designed to efficiently forget undesired data while preserving desired training influences and model quality.

Result: The proposed algorithms were tested with MNIST and CelebA datasets, successfully achieving faster unlearning times compared to predecessors like gradient surgery.

Conclusion: The algorithms provide a reliable means to address the challenges of selective unlearning in generative models, balancing both effectiveness and computational efficiency.

Abstract: As generative models become increasingly powerful and pervasive, the ability
to unlearn specific data, whether due to privacy concerns, legal requirements,
or the correction of harmful content, has become increasingly important. Unlike
in conventional training, where data are accumulated and knowledge is
reinforced, unlearning aims to selectively remove the influence of particular
data points without costly retraining from scratch. To be effective and
reliable, such algorithms need to achieve (i) forgetting of the undesired data,
(ii) preservation of the quality of the generation, (iii) preservation of the
influence of the desired training data on the model parameters, and (iv) small
number of training steps. We propose fast unlearning algorithms based on loss
gradient orthogonalization. We show that our algorithms are able to forget data
while maintaining the fidelity of the original model. Using MNIST and CelebA
data, we demonstrate that our algorithms achieve orders of magnitude faster
unlearning times than their predecessors, such as gradient surgery.

### [355] [Multi-Layer GRPO: Enhancing Reasoning and Self-Correction in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04746)
*Fei Ding,Baiqiao Wang,Zijian Zeng,Youwei Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces MGRPO, a two-layer training approach for large language models enhancing reasoning and self-correction capabilities, outperforming standard GRPO.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard GRPO struggles with a lack of intermediate supervision, leading to unstable training and inefficiencies in exploring reasoning processes due to an inability to handle errors effectively.

Method: MGRPO utilizes a two-layer approach: the first layer applies GRPO to generate an initial response, while the second layer uses GRPO to correct errors in the response, creating a self-correcting loop without requiring explicit dense annotations.

Result: MGRPO shows significant improvement over GRPO in performance on multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks, demonstrating superior reasoning and self-correction capabilities.

Conclusion: The MGRPO method addresses weaknesses in GRPO by introducing an effective self-correction mechanism, providing a robust improvement in training stability and performance for large language models.

Abstract: The Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm has demonstrated
considerable success in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language
models (LLMs), as evidenced by DeepSeek-R1. However, the absence of
intermediate supervision in GRPO frequently leads to inefficient exploration
dynamics. A single error in a complex reasoning chain can invalidate the entire
solution, resulting in abrupt reward vanishing and compromising training
stability.To address these challenges, we propose MGRPO (Multi-layer GRPO).
MGRPO operates in two layers: the first layer employs standard GRPO to generate
an initial response. This response, along with the original query, is then fed
into a second-layer GRPO process. This second layer is specifically trained to
identify and correct errors in the initial response, effectively creating a
self-correction loop. This mechanism provides implicit process-level
supervision by rewarding successful error correction, without requiring an
explicit, densely-annotated reward model. Experimental results on several
mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that MGRPO significantly
outperforms standard GRPO, achieving superior performance by fostering both
reasoning and self-correction abilities.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces log-linear attention, which addresses limitations in linear attention by using a logarithmically growing set of hidden states, achieving efficient and expressive sequence modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of quadratic-compute complexity in Transformers and fixed-size hidden states in linear attention and state-space models, while maintaining efficient sequence modeling.

Method: Introduces log-linear attention with a logarithmically growing set of hidden states and demonstrates its efficient parallel implementation with log-linear compute cost.

Result: Log-linear attention was applied to models like Mamba-2 and Gated DeltaNet, showing improved performance compared to their linear-time counterparts.

Conclusion: Log-linear attention balances efficiency and expressiveness, offering a general framework that can improve existing linear attention models.

Abstract: The attention mechanism in Transformers is an important primitive for
accurate and scalable sequence modeling. Its quadratic-compute and
linear-memory complexity however remain significant bottlenecks. Linear
attention and state-space models enable linear-time, constant-memory sequence
modeling and can moreover be trained efficiently through matmul-rich
parallelization across sequence length. However, at their core these models are
still RNNs, and thus their use of a fixed-size hidden state to model the
context is a fundamental limitation. This paper develops log-linear attention,
an attention mechanism that balances linear attention's efficiency and the
expressiveness of softmax attention. Log-linear attention replaces the
fixed-size hidden state with a logarithmically growing set of hidden states. We
show that with a particular growth function, log-linear attention admits a
similarly matmul-rich parallel form whose compute cost is log-linear in
sequence length. Log-linear attention is a general framework and can be applied
on top of existing linear attention variants. As case studies, we instantiate
log-linear variants of two recent architectures -- Mamba-2 and Gated DeltaNet
-- and find they perform well compared to their linear-time variants.

*Jiachen Tang,Zhonghao Wang,Sirui Chen,Sheng Zhou,Jiawei Chen,Jiajun Bu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Graph Transformers (GTs) are advanced models that leverage attention mechanisms for modeling structural relationships in graphs. This paper introduces OpenGT, a new benchmark and library for evaluating GTs comprehensively, providing key insights and standardized comparisons.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the gaps in understanding the strengths and limitations of Graph Transformers, including their diverse design choices and use cases. Additionally, the absence of a comprehensive benchmark and library hinders progress and fair comparisons in this field.

Method: The authors proposed OpenGT, a benchmark and library for Graph Transformers. It establishes standardized experimental settings and includes a wide selection of state-of-the-art Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and GTs for evaluation across diverse tasks and datasets.

Result: Using OpenGT, the authors conducted extensive experiments and discovered several critical insights. These include issues in transferring models across tasks, challenges with local attention, and the implications of specific design choices like positional encodings.

Conclusion: The OpenGT benchmark promotes fairness, reproducibility, and generalizability in Graph Transformer research. It offers a foundation for progressing in this field, with both the benchmark and an easy-to-use library publicly available for the community.

Abstract: Graph Transformers (GTs) have recently demonstrated remarkable performance
across diverse domains. By leveraging attention mechanisms, GTs are capable of
modeling long-range dependencies and complex structural relationships beyond
local neighborhoods. However, their applicable scenarios are still
underexplored, this highlights the need to identify when and why they excel.
Furthermore, unlike GNNs, which predominantly rely on message-passing
mechanisms, GTs exhibit a diverse design space in areas such as positional
encoding, attention mechanisms, and graph-specific adaptations. Yet, it remains
unclear which of these design choices are truly effective and under what
conditions. As a result, the community currently lacks a comprehensive
benchmark and library to promote a deeper understanding and further development
of GTs. To address this gap, this paper introduces OpenGT, a comprehensive
benchmark for Graph Transformers. OpenGT enables fair comparisons and
multidimensional analysis by establishing standardized experimental settings
and incorporating a broad selection of state-of-the-art GNNs and GTs. Our
benchmark evaluates GTs from multiple perspectives, encompassing diverse tasks
and datasets with varying properties. Through extensive experiments, our
benchmark has uncovered several critical insights, including the difficulty of
transferring models across task levels, the limitations of local attention, the
efficiency trade-offs in several models, the application scenarios of specific
positional encodings, and the preprocessing overhead of some positional
encodings. We aspire for this work to establish a foundation for future graph
transformer research emphasizing fairness, reproducibility, and
generalizability. We have developed an easy-to-use library OpenGT for training
and evaluating existing GTs. The benchmark code is available at

*Thore Gerlach,Sascha Mücke,Christian Bauckhage*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper investigates the connection between $k$-medoids clustering and Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) approaches in Vector Quantization using Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Both $k$-medoids clustering and KDE are significant paradigms in Vector Quantization, but their relationship remains unexplored. Understanding their connection could provide insights into their geometric and algorithmic similarities.

Method: The authors compare heuristic QUBO for $k$-medoids with a principled QUBO derived from minimizing Maximum Mean Discrepancy in KDE. They explore the connection analytically under mild assumptions on the kernel's feature map.

Result: They reveal that KDE-QUBO is a special case of $k$-medoids-QUBO, uncovering a structural relationship between the two approaches.

Conclusion: The work provides a unified interpretation, improves understanding of weighting parameters' geometry in QUBO, and bridges concepts in $k$-medoids clustering and KDE for Vector Quantization.

Abstract: Vector Quantization (VQ) is a widely used technique in machine learning and
data compression, valued for its simplicity and interpretability. Among hard VQ
methods, $k$-medoids clustering and Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) approaches
represent two prominent yet seemingly unrelated paradigms -- one
distance-based, the other rooted in probability density matching. In this
paper, we investigate their connection through the lens of Quadratic
Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO). We compare a heuristic QUBO
formulation for $k$-medoids, which balances centrality and diversity, with a
principled QUBO derived from minimizing Maximum Mean Discrepancy in KDE-based
VQ. Surprisingly, we show that the KDE-QUBO is a special case of the
$k$-medoids-QUBO under mild assumptions on the kernel's feature map. This
reveals a deeper structural relationship between these two approaches and
provides new insight into the geometric interpretation of the weighting
parameters used in QUBO formulations for VQ.

*Zhiwei Bai,Zhangchen Zhou,Jiajie Zhao,Xiaolong Li,Zhiyu Li,Feiyu Xiong,Hongkang Yang,Yaoyu Zhang,Zhi-Qin John Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Loss spikes during Adam optimizer training are caused by the optimizer's adaptive preconditioners rather than loss landscape characteristics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Loss spikes are a common instability phenomenon during neural network training using the Adam optimizer. Understanding their root causes is crucial for improving optimization robustness.

Method: The authors investigated Adam's behavior using theoretical analysis and experiments across various neural network architectures, focusing on the interaction between squared gradients and second-order moment estimates.

Result: The study identified a critical regime where squared gradients shrink relative to second-order estimates, triggering eigenvalue instability in the preconditioned Hessian and leading to loss spikes.

Conclusion: Adam's loss spike phenomena arise from its internal mechanisms, particularly adaptive preconditioners, rather than external landscape sharpness, calling for potential algorithm refinements.

Abstract: Loss spikes emerge commonly during training across neural networks of varying
architectures and scales when using the Adam optimizer. In this work, we
investigate the underlying mechanism responsible for Adam spikes. While
previous explanations attribute these phenomena to the lower-loss-as-sharper
characteristics of the loss landscape, our analysis reveals that Adam's
adaptive preconditioners themselves can trigger spikes. Specifically, we
identify a critical regime where squared gradients become substantially smaller
than the second-order moment estimates, causing the latter to undergo a
$\beta_2$-exponential decay and to respond sluggishly to current gradient
information. This mechanism can push the maximum eigenvalue of the
preconditioned Hessian beyond the classical stability threshold $2/\eta$ for a
sustained period, inducing instability. This instability further leads to an
alignment between the gradient and the maximum eigendirection, and a loss spike
occurs precisely when the gradient-directional curvature exceeds $2/\eta$. We
verify this mechanism through extensive experiments on fully connected
networks, convolutional networks, and Transformer architectures.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a reinforcement learning framework using custom logic puzzles to improve structured reasoning in large language models (LLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While LLMs excel in many supervised tasks, they perform poorly in structured reasoning in unfamiliar settings. This limitation stems from domain-specific heuristics developed during fine-tuning.

Method: The paper proposes using reinforcement learning on seven custom logic puzzles, each tailored to develop specific reasoning skills. Binary feedback based on puzzle correctness is used to guide hypothesis-driven problem solving.

Result: The proposed training significantly enhances LLMs' performance on out-of-distribution mathematical benchmarks, particularly for problems requiring multi-step reasoning. It also encourages transferable reasoning routines across various tasks.

Conclusion: Reinforcement learning using logic puzzles fosters better compositional generalization in LLMs, improving internal reasoning abilities and enhancing performance on complex tasks without task-specific symbolic tools.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at many supervised tasks but often
struggle with structured reasoning in unfamiliar settings. This discrepancy
suggests that standard fine-tuning pipelines may instill narrow,
domain-specific heuristics rather than fostering general-purpose thinking
strategies. In this work, we propose a "play to learn" framework that
fine-tunes LLMs through reinforcement learning on a suite of seven custom logic
puzzles, each designed to cultivate distinct reasoning skills such as
constraint propagation, spatial consistency, and symbolic deduction. Using a
reinforcement learning setup with verifiable rewards, models receive binary
feedback based on puzzle correctness, encouraging iterative, hypothesis-driven
problem solving. We demonstrate that this training approach significantly
improves out-of-distribution performance on a range of mathematical benchmarks,
especially for mid-difficulty problems that require multi-step reasoning.
Analyses across problem categories and difficulty levels reveal that puzzle
training promotes transferable reasoning routines, strengthening algebraic
manipulation, geometric inference, and combinatorial logic, while offering
limited gains on rote or highly specialized tasks. These findings show that
reinforcement learning over logic puzzles reshapes the internal reasoning of
LLMs, enabling more robust and compositional generalization without relying on
task-specific symbolic tools.

### [361] [Sparse Autoencoders, Again?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04859)
*Yin Lu,Tong He,Xuening Zhu,David Wipf*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper critiques traditional sparse autoencoders (SAEs) and variational autoencoders (VAEs), proposing a new hybrid model that better captures structured data and achieves sparser latent representations without increasing reconstruction error.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sparse autoencoders and VAEs have seen limited innovation over the years and exhibit weaknesses in capturing low-dimensional latent structures, such as those found in natural image manifolds or language model activations. The paper aims to address these shortcomings.

Method: The authors present a hybrid model that incorporates theoretical guarantees for recovering structured data spread across a union of manifolds. The model integrates innovations into the encoder-decoder and regularizer design.

Result: The hybrid model outperforms classical SAEs, VAEs, and recent diffusion models on tasks involving synthetic and real-world datasets. It achieves accurate manifold dimension estimation and sparser latent representations while maintaining low reconstruction errors.

Conclusion: This new hybrid approach pushes the boundaries beyond traditional SAEs and VAEs, marking a significant improvement in both theoretical and practical performance on manifold-related tasks.

Abstract: Is there really much more to say about sparse autoencoders (SAEs)?
Autoencoders in general, and SAEs in particular, represent deep architectures
that are capable of modeling low-dimensional latent structure in data. Such
structure could reflect, among other things, correlation patterns in large
language model activations, or complex natural image manifolds. And yet despite
the wide-ranging applicability, there have been relatively few changes to SAEs
beyond the original recipe from decades ago, namely, standard deep
encoder/decoder layers trained with a classical/deterministic sparse
regularizer applied within the latent space. One possible exception is the
variational autoencoder (VAE), which adopts a stochastic encoder module capable
of producing sparse representations when applied to manifold data. In this work
we formalize underappreciated weaknesses with both canonical SAEs, as well as
analogous VAEs applied to similar tasks, and propose a hybrid alternative model
that circumvents these prior limitations. In terms of theoretical support, we
prove that global minima of our proposed model recover certain forms of
structured data spread across a union of manifolds. Meanwhile, empirical
evaluations on synthetic and real-world datasets substantiate the efficacy of
our approach in accurately estimating underlying manifold dimensions and
producing sparser latent representations without compromising reconstruction
error. In general, we are able to exceed the performance of equivalent-capacity
SAEs and VAEs, as well as recent diffusion models where applicable, within
domains such as images and language model activation patterns.

*Antonio Almudévar,José Miguel Hernández-Lobato,Sameer Khurana,Ricard Marxer,Alfonso Ortega*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses the challenge of learning aligned representation spaces for multimodal data using contrastive losses, proposing a regularization term to improve alignment by reducing modality-specific information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Contrastive losses are widely used for multimodal representation learning but fail to effectively align the representation space due to the persistence of modality-specific information.

Method: The paper introduces a regularization term to the loss function based on a variational approximation, guided by insights from the Information Bottleneck Principle.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that the proposed regularization term enhances the alignment of multimodal representations, both in controlled setups and real-world applications.

Conclusion: Incorporating this regularization term improves representational alignment and addresses limitations in contrastive loss-based learning.

Abstract: Contrastive losses have been extensively used as a tool for multimodal
representation learning. However, it has been empirically observed that their
use is not effective to learn an aligned representation space. In this paper,
we argue that this phenomenon is caused by the presence of modality-specific
information in the representation space. Although some of the most widely used
contrastive losses maximize the mutual information between representations of
both modalities, they are not designed to remove the modality-specific
information. We give a theoretical description of this problem through the lens
of the Information Bottleneck Principle. We also empirically analyze how
different hyperparameters affect the emergence of this phenomenon in a
controlled experimental setup. Finally, we propose a regularization term in the
loss function that is derived by means of a variational approximation and aims
to increase the representational alignment. We analyze in a set of controlled
experiments and real-world applications the advantages of including this
regularization term.

### [363] [There Was Never a Bottleneck in Concept Bottleneck Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04877)
*Antonio Almudévar,José Miguel Hernández-Lobato,Alfonso Ortega*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper identifies a limitation of Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) and proposes Minimal Concept Bottleneck Models (MCBMs) to enhance interpretability using an Information Bottleneck objective.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models are difficult to interpret, and CBMs aim to make predictions more interpretable by associating components with concepts. However, CBMs do not ensure that components encode only the targeted concept, limiting their utility.

Method: The paper introduces Minimal Concept Bottleneck Models (MCBMs) that use an Information Bottleneck (IB) objective, implemented via a variational regularization term in the training loss, to constrain components to retain only relevant information for their corresponding concepts.

Result: MCBMs ensure greater interpretability and theoretical guarantees for concept-level interventions and maintain alignment with Bayesian principles.

Conclusion: MCBMs address limitations in CBMs, improving interpretability and flexibility for sensitive AI applications.

Abstract: Deep learning representations are often difficult to interpret, which can
hinder their deployment in sensitive applications. Concept Bottleneck Models
(CBMs) have emerged as a promising approach to mitigate this issue by learning
representations that support target task performance while ensuring that each
component predicts a concrete concept from a predefined set. In this work, we
argue that CBMs do not impose a true bottleneck: the fact that a component can
predict a concept does not guarantee that it encodes only information about
that concept. This shortcoming raises concerns regarding interpretability and
the validity of intervention procedures. To overcome this limitation, we
propose Minimal Concept Bottleneck Models (MCBMs), which incorporate an
Information Bottleneck (IB) objective to constrain each representation
component to retain only the information relevant to its corresponding concept.
This IB is implemented via a variational regularization term added to the
training loss. As a result, MCBMs support concept-level interventions with
theoretical guarantees, remain consistent with Bayesian principles, and offer
greater flexibility in key design choices.

*Allen Paul,George Grammatopoulos,Adwaye Rambojun,Neill D. F. Campbell,Harinderjit S. Gill,Tony Shardlow*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Researchers developed a semi-automated pipeline using CT scans to classify hip dysplasia, achieving improved accuracy and saving clinicians' time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early diagnosis of hip dysplasia is crucial to prevent the onset of osteoarthritis by enabling timely surgical interventions.

Method: A Gaussian Process Diffeomorphic Statistical Shape Model (GPDSSM) was developed using volumetric CT scans, statistical shape modeling, and clinically annotated landmarks.

Result: The GPDSSM distinguished dysplastic hips with a high AUC of 96.2%, surpassing traditional angle-based methods (AUC 91.2%).

Conclusion: The method improves classification accuracy and reduces the workload for clinicians by automating angle measurements and offering 3D insights.

Abstract: Dysplasia is a recognised risk factor for osteoarthritis (OA) of the hip,
early diagnosis of dysplasia is important to provide opportunities for surgical
interventions aimed at reducing the risk of hip OA. We have developed a
pipeline for semi-automated classification of dysplasia using volumetric CT
scans of patients' hips and a minimal set of clinically annotated landmarks,
combining the framework of the Gaussian Process Latent Variable Model with
diffeomorphism to create a statistical shape model, which we termed the
Gaussian Process Diffeomorphic Statistical Shape Model (GPDSSM). We used 192 CT
scans, 100 for model training and 92 for testing. The GPDSSM effectively
distinguishes dysplastic samples from controls while also highlighting regions
of the underlying surface that show dysplastic variations. As well as improving
classification accuracy compared to angle-based methods (AUC 96.2% vs 91.2%),
the GPDSSM can save time for clinicians by removing the need to manually
measure angles and interpreting 2D scans for possible markers of dysplasia.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces ALFIA, a novel attention-based model for predicting high-risk ICU patients, outperforming current models and offering clinicians robust early-warning capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to optimize early identification of high-risk ICU patients to efficiently allocate scarce medical resources.

Method: The authors propose ALFIA, which combines LoRA adapters and an adaptive layer-weighting mechanism to extract semantic features from clinical text using a BERT backbone, integrated with models like GBDTs and deep networks for improved performance.

Result: ALFIA achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art classifiers on the cw-24 benchmark, with additional gains when paired with models like CatBoost, LightGBM, and neural networks.

Conclusion: ALFIA provides a powerful, modular, and clinically useful framework for early risk identification in critical-care scenarios, directly leveraging clinical text data.

Abstract: Early identification of high-risk ICU patients is crucial for directing
limited medical resources. We introduce ALFIA (Adaptive Layer Fusion with
Intelligent Attention), a modular, attention-based architecture that jointly
trains LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) adapters and an adaptive layer-weighting
mechanism to fuse multi-layer semantic features from a BERT backbone. Trained
on our rigorous cw-24 (CriticalWindow-24) benchmark, ALFIA surpasses
state-of-the-art tabular classifiers in AUPRC while preserving a balanced
precision-recall profile. The embeddings produced by ALFIA's fusion module,
capturing both fine-grained clinical cues and high-level concepts, enable
seamless pairing with GBDTs (CatBoost/LightGBM) as ALFIA-boost, and deep neuro
networks as ALFIA-nn, yielding additional performance gains. Our experiments
confirm ALFIA's superior early-warning performance, by operating directly on
routine clinical text, it furnishes clinicians with a convenient yet robust
tool for risk stratification and timely intervention in critical-care settings.

### [366] [Agentic AI for Intent-Based Industrial Automation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04980)
*Marcos Lima Romero,Ricardo Suyama*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a framework integrating Agentic AI and intent-based paradigms to simplify human-machine interaction in Industry 5.0.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Agentic AI with planning and tool usage can reduce the growing complexity of Industry 4.0. The motivation is to align automation to human-centric principles and simplify human-machine interaction in Industry 5.0.

Method: The framework allows humans to express goals in natural language that are decomposed into actionable components driven by intent-based processing. Sub-agents execute domain-specific tasks autonomously. The design was tested using CMAPSS data and Google Agent Developer Kit.

Result: The approach was successfully demonstrated in predictive maintenance, enabling intent decomposition, agent orchestration, and autonomous decision-making, despite concerns like data quality and explainability.

Conclusion: The study highlights the potential for Agentic AI to simplify scalable automation and lower barriers, aligning technology with human-centric and sustainable goals of Industry 5.0.

Abstract: The recent development of Agentic AI systems, empowered by autonomous large
language models (LLMs) agents with planning and tool-usage capabilities,
enables new possibilities for the evolution of industrial automation and
reduces the complexity introduced by Industry 4.0. This work proposes a
conceptual framework that integrates Agentic AI with the intent-based paradigm,
originally developed in network research, to simplify human-machine interaction
(HMI) and better align automation systems with the human-centric, sustainable,
and resilient principles of Industry 5.0. Based on the intent-based processing,
the framework allows human operators to express high-level business or
operational goals in natural language, which are decomposed into actionable
components. These intents are broken into expectations, conditions, targets,
context, and information that guide sub-agents equipped with specialized tools
to execute domain-specific tasks. A proof of concept was implemented using the
CMAPSS dataset and Google Agent Developer Kit (ADK), demonstrating the
feasibility of intent decomposition, agent orchestration, and autonomous
decision-making in predictive maintenance scenarios. The results confirm the
potential of this approach to reduce technical barriers and enable scalable,
intent-driven automation, despite data quality and explainability concerns.

### [367] [FPTQuant: Function-Preserving Transforms for LLM Quantization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04985)
*Boris van Breugel,Yelysei Bondarenko,Paul Whatmough,Markus Nagel*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes FPTQuant, introducing lightweight function-preserving transforms to facilitate INT4 quantization of large language models (LLMs) for speed-up without custom kernels or overhead during inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models require substantial computational resources, especially at inference, making efficiency improvements crucial. Naive quantization often fails due to model outliers, necessitating better strategies for enabling high-performance quantization.

Method: FPTQuant introduces four lightweight function-preserving transforms tailored for transformers, trained locally and end-to-end to match outputs between quantized and full-precision models, while addressing activation distribution for quantization friendliness.

Result: FPTQuant achieves state-of-the-art speed-up of up to 3.9 times over FP with static INT4 quantization and provides an excellent trade-off between accuracy and speed compared to other methods.

Conclusion: The approach successfully balances efficiency and accuracy, affirming its potential to significantly impact LLM performance optimization without sacrificing precision.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) require substantial compute, and thus energy, at
inference time. While quantizing weights and activations is effective at
improving efficiency, naive quantization of LLMs can significantly degrade
performance due to large magnitude outliers. This paper describes FPTQuant,
which introduces four novel, lightweight, and expressive function-preserving
transforms (FPTs) to facilitate quantization of transformers: (1) a mergeable
pre-RoPE transform for queries and keys, (2) a mergeable transform for values,
(3) a mergeable scaling transform within the MLP block, and (4) a cheap,
dynamic scaling transform. By leveraging the equivariances and independencies
inherent to canonical transformer operation, we designed these FPTs to maintain
the model's function while shaping the intermediate activation distributions to
be more quantization friendly. FPTQuant requires no custom kernels and adds
virtually no overhead during inference. The FPTs are trained both locally to
reduce outliers, and end-to-end such that the outputs of the quantized and
full-precision models match. FPTQuant enables static INT4 quantization with
minimal overhead and shows SOTA speed-up of up to 3.9 times over FP.
Empirically, FPTQuant has an excellent accuracy-speed trade-off -- it is
performing on par or exceeding most prior work and only shows slightly lower
accuracy compared to a method that is up to 29% slower.

### [368] [Cautious Optimism: A Meta-Algorithm for Near-Constant Regret in General Games](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05005)
*Ashkan Soleymani,Georgios Piliouras,Gabriele Farina*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework called Cautious Optimism, which improves no-regret learning algorithms for general games through adaptive pacing, achieving faster learning with minimal computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to accelerate no-regret learning in general games while addressing the shortcomings of prior methods that rely on monotonic step-sizes.

Method: The proposed Cautious Optimism framework applies adaptive pacing to Follow-the-Regularized-Leader (FTRL) algorithms, enhancing learning speed without requiring additional computational resources.

Result: Cautious Optimistic FTRL achieves near-optimal $O_T(\log T)$ regret in self-play scenarios and preserves $O(\sqrt{T})$ regret in adversarial cases, outperforming prior methods.

Conclusion: This work demonstrates that adaptive pacing can significantly enhance regularized learning algorithms, offering new insights into fast learning in general games while maintaining essential properties such as uncoupledness.

Abstract: Recent work [Soleymani et al., 2025] introduced a variant of Optimistic
Multiplicative Weights Updates (OMWU) that adaptively controls the learning
pace in a dynamic, non-monotone manner, achieving new state-of-the-art regret
minimization guarantees in general games. In this work, we demonstrate that
no-regret learning acceleration through adaptive pacing of the learners is not
an isolated phenomenon. We introduce \emph{Cautious Optimism}, a framework for
substantially faster regularized learning in general games. Cautious Optimism
takes as input any instance of Follow-the-Regularized-Leader (FTRL) and outputs
an accelerated no-regret learning algorithm by pacing the underlying FTRL with
minimal computational overhead. Importantly, we retain uncoupledness (learners
do not need to know other players' utilities). Cautious Optimistic FTRL
achieves near-optimal $O_T(\log T)$ regret in diverse self-play
(mixing-and-matching regularizers) while preserving the optimal $O(\sqrt{T})$
regret in adversarial scenarios. In contrast to prior works (e.g. Syrgkanis et
al. [2015], Daskalakis et al. [2021]), our analysis does not rely on monotonic
step-sizes, showcasing a novel route for fast learning in general games.

*John Collins*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces MultiPoint Proximity (MPP) encoding for representing vector-mode geospatial data for machine learning, demonstrating superior performance compared to rasterization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need to effectively encode vector-mode geospatial data (points, lines, polygons) into formats usable by machine learning models while retaining essential geometric properties.

Method: The MPP encoding method encodes geospatial shapes based on scaled distances from the shape to a set of reference points within a predefined region of interest.

Result: MPP encoding exhibits key properties like shape-centricity and continuity, effectively differentiates spatial objects, and captures spatial relationships with high precision, outperforming rasterization methods.

Conclusion: MPP encoding is a robust and adaptable approach for encoding geospatial features in machine learning, offering significant advantages over rasterization in terms of precision and applicability.

Abstract: Vector-mode geospatial data -- points, lines, and polygons -- must be encoded
into an appropriate form in order to be used with traditional machine learning
and artificial intelligence models. Encoding methods attempt to represent a
given shape as a vector that captures its essential geometric properties. This
paper presents an encoding method based on scaled distances from a shape to a
set of reference points within a region of interest. The method, MultiPoint
Proximity (MPP) encoding, can be applied to any type of shape, enabling the
parameterization of machine learning models with encoded representations of
vector-mode geospatial features. We show that MPP encoding possesses the
desirable properties of shape-centricity and continuity, can be used to
differentiate spatial objects based on their geometric features, and can
capture pairwise spatial relationships with high precision. In all cases, MPP
encoding is shown to perform better than an alternative method based on
rasterization.

*Kuang He,Wei Tang,Tong Wei,Min-Ling Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper evaluates 11 foundation models with 13 PLL approaches across 8 datasets and introduces PartialCLIP for efficient fine-tuning in partial label learning (PLL).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the challenge of training classifiers with inexact supervision by exploring foundation models, which have been underexplored in PLL.

Method: The authors evaluate 11 foundation models across 13 PLL approaches and 8 benchmark datasets, proposing PartialCLIP as a fine-tuning framework. They also test text-embedding classifier initialization and candidate filtering using zero-shot CLIP.

Result: Current PLL methods achieve performance gains with foundation models, show consistent performance with varying ambiguity, and highlight the importance of model selection and adaptation. PartialCLIP proves to be effective.

Conclusion: The work provides insights into limitations of PLL approaches, emphasizes their dependency on foundation model strategies, and introduces PartialCLIP as a promising fine-tuning framework for better generalization.

Abstract: Partial label learning (PLL) seeks to train generalizable classifiers from
datasets with inexact supervision, a common challenge in real-world
applications. Existing studies have developed numerous approaches to
progressively refine and recover ground-truth labels by training convolutional
neural networks. However, limited attention has been given to foundation models
that offer transferrable representations. In this work, we empirically conduct
comprehensive evaluations of 11 foundation models across 13 PLL approaches on 8
benchmark datasets under 3 PLL scenarios. We further propose PartialCLIP, an
efficient fine-tuning framework for foundation models in PLL. Our findings
reveal that current PLL approaches tend to 1) achieve significant performance
gains when using foundation models, 2) exhibit remarkably similar performance
to each other, 3) maintain stable performance across varying ambiguity levels,
while 4) are susceptible to foundation model selection and adaptation
strategies. Additionally, we demonstrate the efficacy of text-embedding
classifier initialization and effective candidate label filtering using
zero-shot CLIP. Our experimental results and analysis underscore the
limitations of current PLL approaches and provide valuable insights for
developing more generalizable PLL models. The source code can be found at

### [371] [TIMING: Temporality-Aware Integrated Gradients for Time Series Explanation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05035)
*Hyeongwon Jang,Changhun Kim,Eunho Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses limitations of current XAI methods for time series and proposes a new technique called TIMING that improves Integrated Gradients with temporal awareness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current XAI methods for time series fail to capture directional impacts on predictions and face limitations due to evaluation metrics that cancel out opposing contributions.

Method: The authors developed TIMING, an enhancement of Integrated Gradients that incorporates temporal relationships and proposed new metrics, CPD and CPP, to evaluate attribution methods effectively.

Result: TIMING proves more effective than existing benchmarks, demonstrated through experiments on synthetic and real-world time series datasets.

Conclusion: The study provides theoretical improvements and practical methods to enhance time series XAI, helping capture significant positive and negative points more accurately.

Abstract: Recent explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) methods for time series
primarily estimate point-wise attribution magnitudes, while overlooking the
directional impact on predictions, leading to suboptimal identification of
significant points. Our analysis shows that conventional Integrated Gradients
(IG) effectively capture critical points with both positive and negative
impacts on predictions. However, current evaluation metrics fail to assess this
capability, as they inadvertently cancel out opposing feature contributions. To
address this limitation, we propose novel evaluation metrics-Cumulative
Prediction Difference (CPD) and Cumulative Prediction Preservation (CPP)-to
systematically assess whether attribution methods accurately identify
significant positive and negative points in time series XAI. Under these
metrics, conventional IG outperforms recent counterparts. However, directly
applying IG to time series data may lead to suboptimal outcomes, as generated
paths ignore temporal relationships and introduce out-of-distribution samples.
To overcome these challenges, we introduce TIMING, which enhances IG by
incorporating temporal awareness while maintaining its theoretical properties.
Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world time series benchmarks
demonstrate that TIMING outperforms existing time series XAI baselines. Our
code is available at https://github.com/drumpt/TIMING.

*Nicolas Lell,Ansgar Scherp*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces inductive node2vec (iN2V), an extension of node2vec designed for unseen nodes in an inductive setting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Node2vec struggles with nodes unseen during training, limiting its use to transductive setups.

Method: iN2V adds a post-hoc procedure for unseen nodes and modifies N2V's training to support this procedure.

Result: Experiments show that iN2V improves node classification accuracy, with gains of up to 6 points depending on dataset specifics.

Conclusion: iN2V broadens the applicability of node embeddings to inductive tasks and can complement other methods effectively.

Abstract: Shallow node embeddings like node2vec (N2V) can be used for nodes without
features or to supplement existing features with structure-based information.
Embedding methods like N2V are limited in their application on new nodes, which
restricts them to the transductive setting where the entire graph, including
the test nodes, is available during training. We propose inductive node2vec
(iN2V), which combines a post-hoc procedure to compute embeddings for nodes
unseen during training and modifications to the original N2V training procedure
to prepare the embeddings for this post-hoc procedure. We conduct experiments
on several benchmark datasets and demonstrate that iN2V is an effective
approach to bringing transductive embeddings to an inductive setting. Using
iN2V embeddings improves node classification by 1 point on average, with up to
6 points of improvement depending on the dataset and the number of unseen
nodes. Our iN2V is a plug-in approach to create new or enrich existing
embeddings. It can also be combined with other embedding methods, making it a
versatile approach for inductive node representation learning. Code to
reproduce the results is available at https://github.com/Foisunt/iN2V .

*Viet Nguyen Changjian Shui,Vijay Giri,Siddarth Arya,Amol Verma,Fahad Razak,Rahul G. Krishnan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of monitoring post-deployment model performance deterioration due to changing data distributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dynamic data environments challenge machine learning models, as not all data shifts impact performance, necessitating effective retraining detection methods.

Method: The authors propose D3M, an algorithm utilizing predictive model disagreement to monitor shifts, with empirical validation and bounds for accurate detection.

Result: D3M achieves low false positive rates for stable shifts and high true positive rates for degrading ones, backed by benchmark and real-world medical dataset tests.

Conclusion: D3M is a practical and effective mechanism for alerting about model performance issues in critical applications like medicine.

Abstract: The distribution of data changes over time; models operating operating in
dynamic environments need retraining. But knowing when to retrain, without
access to labels, is an open challenge since some, but not all shifts degrade
model performance. This paper formalizes and addresses the problem of
post-deployment deterioration (PDD) monitoring. We propose D3M, a practical and
efficient monitoring algorithm based on the disagreement of predictive models,
achieving low false positive rates under non-deteriorating shifts and provides
sample complexity bounds for high true positive rates under deteriorating
shifts. Empirical results on both standard benchmark and a real-world
large-scale internal medicine dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the
framework and highlight its viability as an alert mechanism for high-stakes
machine learning pipelines.

### [374] [Semi-Implicit Variational Inference via Kernelized Path Gradient Descent](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05088)
*Tobias Pielok,Bernd Bischl,David Rügamer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a kernelized KL divergence estimator to improve Semi-implicit Variational Inference (SIVI) by stabilizing training and reducing bias, achieving better performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address challenges in training SIVI, particularly issues with high variance and bias in high-dimensional scenarios, while also reducing training costs associated with state-of-the-art methods like KSIVI.

Method: They propose a kernelized KL divergence estimator with nonparametric smoothing and an importance sampling correction. They relate this to the amortized Stein variational gradient descent, which minimizes the same objective but with less gradient variance in their approach.

Result: The proposed method achieves more stable and efficient optimization, demonstrating improved or comparable performance to SOTA SIVI approaches in empirical evaluations.

Conclusion: The proposed kernelized KL divergence estimator improves training stability and efficiency for SIVI, offering a lower-bias, better-performing alternative to existing methods.

Abstract: Semi-implicit variational inference (SIVI) is a powerful framework for
approximating complex posterior distributions, but training with the
Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence can be challenging due to high variance and
bias in high-dimensional settings. While current state-of-the-art semi-implicit
variational inference methods, particularly Kernel Semi-Implicit Variational
Inference (KSIVI), have been shown to work in high dimensions, training remains
moderately expensive. In this work, we propose a kernelized KL divergence
estimator that stabilizes training through nonparametric smoothing. To further
reduce the bias, we introduce an importance sampling correction. We provide a
theoretical connection to the amortized version of the Stein variational
gradient descent, which estimates the score gradient via Stein's identity,
showing that both methods minimize the same objective, but our semi-implicit
approach achieves lower gradient variance. In addition, our method's bias in
function space is benign, leading to more stable and efficient optimization.
Empirical results demonstrate that our method outperforms or matches
state-of-the-art SIVI methods in both performance and training efficiency.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces TreeRPO, a method that improves reasoning in Large Language Models by providing step-level rewards from tree sampling, showing significant performance gains in experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) methods in LLMs fall short in optimizing intermediate reasoning steps due to rewards being limited to full trajectories.

Method: TreeRPO uses tree sampling to estimate mathematical expectations of rewards at different reasoning steps, eliminating the need for a separate step-reward model. It also applies group-relative reward training to compute step-level rewards during tree sampling.

Result: TreeRPO improves the Pass@1 accuracy of Qwen-2.5-Math on test benchmarks from 19.0% to 35.5%, surpasses GRPO by 2.9%, and reduces average response length by 18.1%.

Conclusion: TreeRPO offers a dense and fine-grained reward mechanism, enhancing LLM reasoning processes with improved performance and response efficiency.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable reasoning capabilities
through Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) methods. However,
a key limitation of existing approaches is that rewards defined at the full
trajectory level provide insufficient guidance for optimizing the intermediate
steps of a reasoning process. To address this, we introduce \textbf{\name}, a
novel method that estimates the mathematical expectations of rewards at various
reasoning steps using tree sampling. Unlike prior methods that rely on a
separate step reward model, \name directly estimates these rewards through this
sampling process. Building on the group-relative reward training mechanism of
GRPO, \name innovatively computes rewards based on step-level groups generated
during tree sampling. This advancement allows \name to produce fine-grained and
dense reward signals, significantly enhancing the learning process and overall
performance of LLMs. Experimental results demonstrate that our \name algorithm
substantially improves the average Pass@1 accuracy of Qwen-2.5-Math on test
benchmarks, increasing it from 19.0\% to 35.5\%. Furthermore, \name
significantly outperforms GRPO by 2.9\% in performance while simultaneously
reducing the average response length by 18.1\%, showcasing its effectiveness
and efficiency. Our code will be available at

*Jifei Luo,Wenzheng Wu,Hantao Yao,Lu Yu,Changsheng Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Explores a new framework, Locality Preserving Markovian Transition (LPMT), to enhance instance retrieval by improving manifold distance measurement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion-based re-ranking methods lose discriminative power when signals propagate further from the data source, limiting their effectiveness in global manifold modeling.

Method: Introduces a three-step process: combines diffusion processes with Bidirectional Collaborative Diffusion (BCD), applies Locality State Embedding (LSE) for better local consistency, and uses Thermodynamic Markovian Transition (TMT) for efficient global retrieval.

Result: Experiments confirm that LPMT outperforms existing methods on multiple instance retrieval tasks.

Conclusion: The LPMT framework successfully addresses issues in global manifold modeling while preserving local effectiveness, offering better performance in re-ranking and retrieval.

Abstract: Diffusion-based re-ranking methods are effective in modeling the data
manifolds through similarity propagation in affinity graphs. However, positive
signals tend to diminish over several steps away from the source, reducing
discriminative power beyond local regions. To address this issue, we introduce
the Locality Preserving Markovian Transition (LPMT) framework, which employs a
long-term thermodynamic transition process with multiple states for accurate
manifold distance measurement. The proposed LPMT first integrates diffusion
processes across separate graphs using Bidirectional Collaborative Diffusion
(BCD) to establish strong similarity relationships. Afterwards, Locality State
Embedding (LSE) encodes each instance into a distribution for enhanced local
consistency. These distributions are interconnected via the Thermodynamic
Markovian Transition (TMT) process, enabling efficient global retrieval while
maintaining local effectiveness. Experimental results across diverse tasks
confirm the effectiveness of LPMT for instance retrieval.

### [377] [Learning Theory of Decentralized Robust Kernel-Based Learning Algorithm](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05215)
*Zhan Yu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a decentralized, robust kernel-based learning method within RKHS, leveraging a connected graph network system, and provides a unified framework for robust regression with rigorous theoretical guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a decentralized robust learning framework that addresses limitations of existing distributed robust kernel learning, such as reliance on divide-and-conquer methods.

Method: Proposes a decentralized algorithm using a robust loss function within RKHS, analyzing convergence with kernel-based integral operator techniques and deriving high-confidence bounds.

Result: Shows that local estimators from the algorithm approximate the regression function well, achieving optimal learning rates under suitable sample size, step size, and robustness parameter $\\\sigma$.

Conclusion: The proposed algorithm connects decentralization, sample selection, robustness, and convergence, achieving strong theoretical and practical performance for robust regression.

Abstract: We propose a new decentralized robust kernel-based learning algorithm within
the framework of reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) by utilizing a
networked system that can be represented as a connected graph. The robust loss
function $\mathcal{L}_\sigma$ induced by a windowing function $W$ and a
robustness scaling parameter $\sigma>0$, can encompass a broad spectrum of
robust losses. Consequently, the proposed algorithm effectively provides a
unified decentralized learning framework for robust regression, which
fundamentally differs from the existing distributed robust kernel learning
schemes, all of which are divide-and-conquer based. We rigorously establish the
learning theory and offer a comprehensive convergence analysis for the
algorithm. We show each local robust estimator generated from the decentralized
algorithm can be utilized to approximate the regression function. Based on
kernel-based integral operator techniques, we derive general high confidence
convergence bounds for each local approximating sequence in terms of the mean
square distance, RKHS norm, and generalization error, respectively. Moreover,
we provide rigorous selection rules for local sample size and show that, under
properly selected step size and scaling parameter $\sigma$, the decentralized
robust algorithm can achieve optimal learning rates (up to logarithmic factors)
in both norms. The parameter $\sigma$ is shown to be essential for enhancing
robustness while also ensuring favorable convergence behavior. The intrinsic
connection among decentralization, sample selection, robustness of the
algorithm, and its convergence is clearly reflected.

*Tyler Chen,Akshay Seshadri,Mattia J. Villani,Pradeep Niroula,Shouvanik Chakrabarti,Archan Ray,Pranav Deshpande,Romina Yalovetzky,Marco Pistoia,Niraj Kumar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a unified framework for Shapley value estimators, including KernelSHAP, and provides the first theoretical guarantees for KernelSHAP, improving performance and scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Shapley values are vital for interpreting machine learning models, but their exact computation is computationally expensive, necessitating improved and theoretically-backed estimators like KernelSHAP.

Method: The authors develop a unified framework for Shapley value estimators using various sampling methods, derive theoretical guarantees, and propose implementation enhancements for scalability to high-dimensional datasets.

Result: The approach showed low mean squared error compared to exact Shapley values in benchmarks and outperformed existing methods like the KernelSHAP library on datasets like MNIST and CIFAR10.

Conclusion: The framework integrates theoretical guarantees with practical enhancements, advancing the reliability and scalability of Shapley value estimation methods such as KernelSHAP.

Abstract: Shapley values have emerged as a critical tool for explaining which features
impact the decisions made by machine learning models. However, computing exact
Shapley values is difficult, generally requiring an exponential (in the feature
dimension) number of model evaluations. To address this, many model-agnostic
randomized estimators have been developed, the most influential and widely used
being the KernelSHAP method (Lundberg & Lee, 2017). While related estimators
such as unbiased KernelSHAP (Covert & Lee, 2021) and LeverageSHAP (Musco &
Witter, 2025) are known to satisfy theoretical guarantees, bounds for
KernelSHAP have remained elusive. We describe a broad and unified framework
that encompasses KernelSHAP and related estimators constructed using both with
and without replacement sampling strategies. We then prove strong
non-asymptotic theoretical guarantees that apply to all estimators from our
framework. This provides, to the best of our knowledge, the first theoretical
guarantees for KernelSHAP and sheds further light on tradeoffs between existing
estimators. Through comprehensive benchmarking on small and medium dimensional
datasets for Decision-Tree models, we validate our approach against exact
Shapley values, consistently achieving low mean squared error with modest
sample sizes. Furthermore, we make specific implementation improvements to
enable scalability of our methods to high-dimensional datasets. Our methods,
tested on datasets such MNIST and CIFAR10, provide consistently better results

*Valérie Costa,Thomas Fel,Ekdeep Singh Lubana,Bahareh Tolooshams,Demba Ba*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) in extracting interpretable features and proposes a multi-iteration SAE to handle correlated features effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the interpretability and effectiveness of SAEs in extracting features, particularly in cases where correlated features exist, as shown in structured datasets like MNIST.

Method: The paper introduces a multi-iteration SAE by unrolling the Matching Pursuit algorithm (MP-SAE) to extract correlated features in a residual-guided manner while ensuring consistent improvement in reconstruction.

Result: It demonstrates that the MP-SAE can extract hierarchical and correlated features, overcoming the limitations of quasi-orthogonality assumptions found in shallow SAE architectures.

Conclusion: The MP-SAE improves the performance and interpretability of SAEs by effectively dealing with correlated features and ensuring better reconstruction quality.

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have recently become central tools for
interpretability, leveraging dictionary learning principles to extract sparse,
interpretable features from neural representations whose underlying structure
is typically unknown. This paper evaluates SAEs in a controlled setting using
MNIST, which reveals that current shallow architectures implicitly rely on a
quasi-orthogonality assumption that limits the ability to extract correlated
features. To move beyond this, we introduce a multi-iteration SAE by unrolling
Matching Pursuit (MP-SAE), enabling the residual-guided extraction of
correlated features that arise in hierarchical settings such as handwritten
digit generation while guaranteeing monotonic improvement of the reconstruction
as more atoms are selected.

### [380] [On the Convergence of Gradient Descent on Learning Transformers with Residual Connections](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05249)
*Zhen Qin,Jinxin Zhou,Zhihui Zhu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper theoretically analyzes training dynamics of Transformers, showing that under proper initialization, gradient descent converges linearly and highlighting the stabilizing role of residual connections.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Theoretical understanding of Transformer training dynamics is lacking despite their empirical success across numerous fields.

Method: The paper analyzes the convergence of a single-layer Transformer with self-attention, feedforward network, and residual connections, focusing on singular values and extending findings to multi-layer models.

Result: The study found that gradient descent achieves linear convergence, with residual connections mitigating issues from low-rank structures in attention layers.

Conclusion: Residual connections improve optimization stability, and the findings are supported both theoretically and through empirical evidence.

Abstract: Transformer models have emerged as fundamental tools across various
scientific and engineering disciplines, owing to their outstanding performance
in diverse applications. Despite this empirical success, the theoretical
foundations of Transformers remain relatively underdeveloped, particularly in
understanding their training dynamics. Existing research predominantly examines
isolated components--such as self-attention mechanisms and feedforward
networks--without thoroughly investigating the interdependencies between these
components, especially when residual connections are present. In this paper, we
aim to bridge this gap by analyzing the convergence behavior of a structurally
complete yet single-layer Transformer, comprising self-attention, a feedforward
network, and residual connections. We demonstrate that, under appropriate
initialization, gradient descent exhibits a linear convergence rate, where the
convergence speed is determined by the minimum and maximum singular values of
the output matrix from the attention layer. Moreover, our analysis reveals that
residual connections serve to ameliorate the ill-conditioning of this output
matrix, an issue stemming from the low-rank structure imposed by the softmax
operation, thereby promoting enhanced optimization stability. We also extend
our theoretical findings to a multi-layer Transformer architecture, confirming
the linear convergence rate of gradient descent under suitable initialization.
Empirical results corroborate our theoretical insights, illustrating the
beneficial role of residual connections in promoting convergence stability.

*Dravyansh Sharma,Alec Sun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper delves into strategic classification, exploring scenarios where agents self-improve instead of resorting to deceptive behaviors, allowing for better learnability outcomes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To better understand how agents’ genuine self-improvements can affect machine learning algorithms in societal decisions.

Method: Characterization of learnability using asymmetric minimally consistent concept classes, analysis under Euclidean ball improvement sets, and exploration of improper learning with a generative assumption.

Result: Provided exact characterization of proper and improper learning with improved agents, lowered generalization errors under bounded noise models, and resolved prior open questions regarding mistake bounds.

Conclusion: Agents' genuine improvements introduce promising learnability advantages, opening doors to more ethical and effective strategic classification approaches.

Abstract: Machine learning is now ubiquitous in societal decision-making, for example
in evaluating job candidates or loan applications, and it is increasingly
important to take into account how classified agents will react to the learning
algorithms. The majority of recent literature on strategic classification has
focused on reducing and countering deceptive behaviors by the classified
agents, but recent work of Attias et al. identifies surprising properties of
learnability when the agents genuinely improve in order to attain the desirable
classification, such as smaller generalization error than standard
PAC-learning. In this paper we characterize so-called learnability with
improvements across multiple new axes. We introduce an asymmetric variant of
minimally consistent concept classes and use it to provide an exact
characterization of proper learning with improvements in the realizable
setting. While prior work studies learnability only under general, arbitrary
agent improvement regions, we give positive results for more natural Euclidean
ball improvement sets. In particular, we characterize improper learning under a
mild generative assumption on the data distribution. We further show how to
learn in more challenging settings, achieving lower generalization error under
well-studied bounded noise models and obtaining mistake bounds in realizable
and agnostic online learning. We resolve open questions posed by Attias et al.
for both proper and improper learning.

*Guillaume Pourcel,Maxence Ernoult*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Recurrent Hamiltonian Echo Learning (RHEL), an efficient learning algorithm for non-dissipative Hamiltonian systems, demonstrating its equivalence to Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT) and applicability to scalable sequence modeling tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep State Space Models and their connection to physics require algorithms adhering to physical principles for effective simulation and design.

Method: The paper introduces RHEL in continuous time, generalizes it to a discrete version equivalent to BPTT, and applies it to Hamiltonian Recurrent Units (HRUs) and Hamiltonian State Space Models (HSSMs) for efficient training.

Result: RHEL matches the performance of BPTT across sequence modeling tasks with varying dynamics and sequence lengths, scaling efficiently to long-range tasks.

Conclusion: RHEL enables scalable, energy-efficient learning in Hamiltonian systems and broadens the scope for self-learning sequence modeling applications driven by physical principles.

Abstract: Deep State Space Models (SSMs) reignite physics-grounded compute paradigms,
as RNNs could natively be embodied into dynamical systems. This calls for
dedicated learning algorithms obeying to core physical principles, with
efficient techniques to simulate these systems and guide their design. We
propose Recurrent Hamiltonian Echo Learning (RHEL), an algorithm which provably
computes loss gradients as finite differences of physical trajectories of
non-dissipative, Hamiltonian systems. In ML terms, RHEL only requires three
"forward passes" irrespective of model size, without explicit Jacobian
computation, nor incurring any variance in the gradient estimation. Motivated
by the physical realization of our algorithm, we first introduce RHEL in
continuous time and demonstrate its formal equivalence with the continuous
adjoint state method. To facilitate the simulation of Hamiltonian systems
trained by RHEL, we propose a discrete-time version of RHEL which is equivalent
to Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT) when applied to a class of recurrent
modules which we call Hamiltonian Recurrent Units (HRUs). This setting allows
us to demonstrate the scalability of RHEL by generalizing these results to
hierarchies of HRUs, which we call Hamiltonian SSMs (HSSMs). We apply RHEL to
train HSSMs with linear and nonlinear dynamics on a variety of time-series
tasks ranging from mid-range to long-range classification and regression with
sequence length reaching $\sim 50k$. We show that RHEL consistently matches the
performance of BPTT across all models and tasks. This work opens new doors for
the design of scalable, energy-efficient physical systems endowed with
self-learning capabilities for sequence modelling.

*Hao Yu,Chu Xin Cheng,Runlong Yu,Yuyang Ye,Shiwei Tong,Zhaofeng Liu,Defu Lian*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study proposes a novel framework called CocktailEdit for precise and flexible control of time series editing, while preserving temporal coherence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing time series generation lacks precise control over both point-level and segment-level properties in sequences, making real-world editing needs challenging.

Method: The CocktailEdit framework combines confidence-weighted anchor control for point-wise constraints and classifier-based control for segment-level statistical properties during the denoising inference phase of diffusion-based time series models.

Result: Extensive experiments prove the effectiveness of the proposed method across varied datasets and models, showing success in balancing control and temporal coherence.

Conclusion: CocktailEdit advances time series editing by bridging the gap between generative modeling and real-world requirements, offering tools for precise, flexible, and human-interactive editing.

Abstract: Recent advances in time series generation have shown promise, yet controlling
properties in generated sequences remains challenging. Time Series Editing
(TSE) - making precise modifications while preserving temporal coherence -
consider both point-level constraints and segment-level controls that current
methods struggle to provide. We introduce the CocktailEdit framework to enable
simultaneous, flexible control across different types of constraints. This
framework combines two key mechanisms: a confidence-weighted anchor control for
point-wise constraints and a classifier-based control for managing statistical
properties such as sums and averages over segments. Our methods achieve precise
local control during the denoising inference stage while maintaining temporal
coherence and integrating seamlessly, with any conditionally trained
diffusion-based time series models. Extensive experiments across diverse
datasets and models demonstrate its effectiveness. Our work bridges the gap
between pure generative modeling and real-world time series editing needs,
offering a flexible solution for human-in-the-loop time series generation and
editing. The code and demo are provided for validation.

*Haifeng Sun,Yu Xiong,Runze Wu,Xinyu Cai,Changjie Fan,Lan Zhang,Xiang-Yang Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces Fast-DataShapley, a method to efficiently compute Shapley values for data contribution in AI systems without the need for retraining for each test sample.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of computational inefficiency in calculating Shapley values for data contribution assessment, which hampers practical application, particularly in scenarios requiring fairness in rewarding data providers.

Method: The method leverages weighted least squares characterization for one-pass training of a reusable explainer model. It also introduces three approaches to optimize training overhead: approximate utility function calculation and group-based data calculation.

Result: Experimental results on image datasets show that Fast-DataShapley outperforms baselines, delivering over 2.5x performance improvements and a training speed increase by two orders of magnitude.

Conclusion: Fast-DataShapley significantly enhances practical use of Shapley values in data contribution evaluation, offering scalable, efficient, and fair data rewards with theoretical guarantees.

Abstract: The value and copyright of training data are crucial in the artificial
intelligence industry. Service platforms should protect data providers'
legitimate rights and fairly reward them for their contributions. Shapley
value, a potent tool for evaluating contributions, outperforms other methods in
theory, but its computational overhead escalates exponentially with the number
of data providers. Recent works based on Shapley values attempt to mitigate
computation complexity by approximation algorithms. However, they need to
retrain for each test sample, leading to intolerable costs. We propose
Fast-DataShapley, a one-pass training method that leverages the weighted least
squares characterization of the Shapley value to train a reusable explainer
model with real-time reasoning speed. Given new test samples, no retraining is
required to calculate the Shapley values of the training data. Additionally, we
propose three methods with theoretical guarantees to reduce training overhead
from two aspects: the approximate calculation of the utility function and the
group calculation of the training data. We analyze time complexity to show the
efficiency of our methods. The experimental evaluations on various image
datasets demonstrate superior performance and efficiency compared to baselines.
Specifically, the performance is improved to more than 2.5 times, and the
explainer's training speed can be increased by two orders of magnitude.

*Declan A. Norton,Yuanzhao Zhang,Michelle Girvan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a training scheme for reservoir computing that enables the model to generalize to unseen regions of dynamical systems, even without explicit structural prior knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current machine learning models lack the ability to generalize well to unseen regions in dynamical systems without using structural priors.

Method: The authors introduce a multiple-trajectory training scheme for reservoir computing, allowing training on disjoint time series from various dynamical basins.

Result: The method enables reservoir computers to generalize effectively to unobserved state space regions by learning behaviors from multistable dynamical systems.

Conclusion: Reservoir computing models, trained with the proposed scheme, can generalize beyond their training data and understand unobserved system behaviors without requiring explicit prior knowledge.

Abstract: Machine learning techniques offer an effective approach to modeling dynamical
systems solely from observed data. However, without explicit structural priors
-- built-in assumptions about the underlying dynamics -- these techniques
typically struggle to generalize to aspects of the dynamics that are poorly
represented in the training data. Here, we demonstrate that reservoir computing
-- a simple, efficient, and versatile machine learning framework often used for
data-driven modeling of dynamical systems -- can generalize to unexplored
regions of state space without explicit structural priors. First, we describe a
multiple-trajectory training scheme for reservoir computers that supports
training across a collection of disjoint time series, enabling effective use of
available training data. Then, applying this training scheme to multistable
dynamical systems, we show that RCs trained on trajectories from a single basin
of attraction can achieve out-of-domain generalization by capturing system
behavior in entirely unobserved basins.

*Arnav Kumar Jain,Vibhakar Mohta,Subin Kim,Atiksh Bhardwaj,Juntao Ren,Yunhai Feng,Sanjiban Choudhury,Gokul Swamy*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces SAILOR, a novel approach for imitation learning that addresses the recovery limitations of behavioral cloning (BC). It uses components like world and reward models for effective learning and outperforms BC methods, even with scaled-up demonstration datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the key limitation of behavioral cloning (BC) where agents struggle to recover from unseen situations due to reliance on expert demonstrations only for visited states.

Method: The authors propose learning to search (L2S) with expert demonstrations, leveraging components like world and reward models for test-time planning and recovery without additional human corrections.

Result: Across several visual manipulation tasks, SAILOR demonstrates superior performance compared to state-of-the-art BC methods, including BC models trained on considerably larger datasets.

Conclusion: SAILOR can effectively identify nuanced failures, avoid reward hacking, and perform robust imitation learning by reasoning independently in diverse scenarios. It represents a significant advancement over BC approaches.

Abstract: The fundamental limitation of the behavioral cloning (BC) approach to
imitation learning is that it only teaches an agent what the expert did at
states the expert visited. This means that when a BC agent makes a mistake
which takes them out of the support of the demonstrations, they often don't
know how to recover from it. In this sense, BC is akin to giving the agent the
fish -- giving them dense supervision across a narrow set of states -- rather
than teaching them to fish: to be able to reason independently about achieving
the expert's outcome even when faced with unseen situations at test-time. In
response, we explore learning to search (L2S) from expert demonstrations, i.e.
learning the components required to, at test time, plan to match expert
outcomes, even after making a mistake. These include (1) a world model and (2)
a reward model. We carefully ablate the set of algorithmic and design decisions
required to combine these and other components for stable and
sample/interaction-efficient learning of recovery behavior without additional
human corrections. Across a dozen visual manipulation tasks from three
benchmarks, our approach $\texttt{SAILOR}$ consistently out-performs
state-of-the-art Diffusion Policies trained via BC on the same data.
Furthermore, scaling up the amount of demonstrations used for BC by
5-10$\times$ still leaves a performance gap. We find that $\texttt{SAILOR}$ can
identify nuanced failures and is robust to reward hacking. Our code is
available at https://github.com/arnavkj1995/SAILOR .

*Nirav Koley,Prajwal Singhania,Abhinav Bhatele*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces SiftAttention, an efficient approximate attention mechanism for large language models on GPUs that reduces memory use by dynamically estimating a threshold, bypassing expensive top-k operations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models on GPUs face challenges due to memory bandwidth constraints, especially in attention computations. Existing methods reduce overhead but are computationally inefficient on GPUs.

Method: The authors propose SiftAttention, which uses an element-wise filtering operation based on a dynamically estimated threshold value instead of top-k computations, exploiting predictable patterns in attention score quantiles.

Result: SiftAttention reduces memory bandwidth usage during value vector loading while maintaining model quality better than other approximate attention methods.

Conclusion: SiftAttention offers a GPU-efficient, memory-saving approach for approximate attention that outperforms existing methods in maintaining model quality.

Abstract: Efficient inference on GPUs using large language models remains challenging
due to memory bandwidth limitations, particularly during data transfers between
High Bandwidth Memory (HBM) and SRAM in attention computations. Approximate
attention methods address this issue by reducing computational and memory
overhead but often rely on expensive top-$k$ operations, which perform poorly
on GPUs. We propose SiftAttention, a novel approximate attention method that
replaces the top-$k$ step with a computationally efficient element-wise
filtering operation based on a threshold value. Our intuition for doing this is
based on our empirical observation that the $\tau$-th quantile of attention
scores follows a predictable power-law over sequential generation steps.
Exploiting this insight, our approach dynamically estimates a threshold value
per prompt at each generation step. Only attention scores above this threshold
and their corresponding value vectors are loaded/used to compute the attention
output, reducing data movement between HBM and SRAM. Our evaluation
demonstrates that SiftAttention preserves model quality better than existing
approximate attention methods while reducing memory bandwidth usage when
loading value vectors.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new framework for learning normalized energy models to address challenges in high-dimensional probability modeling, achieving state-of-the-art results on ImageNet64.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Learning probability models is core to machine learning but is challenging due to high-dimensional data complexities, motivating the need for better approaches.

Method: Modified score network architecture to compute energies, with a dual score matching objective optimizing gradients across noise levels, validated on ImageNet64.

Result: Comparable cross-entropy performance to state-of-the-art methods; strong generalization evidenced by independence from training set images.

Conclusion: The approach robustly models probabilities, revealing unexpected content-dependent variations in probabilities and data dimensionality, challenging traditional assumptions.

Abstract: Learning probability models from data is at the heart of many machine
learning endeavors, but is notoriously difficult due to the curse of
dimensionality. We introduce a new framework for learning \emph{normalized}
energy (log probability) models that is inspired from diffusion generative
models, which rely on networks optimized to estimate the score. We modify a
score network architecture to compute an energy while preserving its inductive
biases. The gradient of this energy network with respect to its input image is
the score of the learned density, which can be optimized using a denoising
objective. Importantly, the gradient with respect to the noise level provides
an additional score that can be optimized with a novel secondary objective,
ensuring consistent and normalized energies across noise levels. We train an
energy network with this \emph{dual} score matching objective on the ImageNet64
dataset, and obtain a cross-entropy (negative log likelihood) value comparable
to the state of the art. We further validate our approach by showing that our
energy model \emph{strongly generalizes}: estimated log probabilities are
nearly independent of the specific images in the training set. Finally, we
demonstrate that both image probability and dimensionality of local
neighborhoods vary significantly with image content, in contrast with
traditional assumptions such as concentration of measure or support on a
low-dimensional manifold.

TL;DR: The paper introduces LSM-2 with Adaptive and Inherited Masking (AIM), an SSL model for robust representation learning directly from incomplete wearable sensor data without imputation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Wearable sensor data often suffers from significant missingness, which challenges traditional self-supervised learning models reliant on complete and well-structured data.

Method: AIM utilizes learnable mask tokens to model missingness, both inherent and artificially introduced, enabling robust inference on fragmented real-world data.

Result: LSM-2 with AIM achieves top performance across classification, regression, and generative modeling tasks and excels under clinically relevant missingness scenarios.

Conclusion: LSM-2 with AIM is a reliable choice for real-world wearable sensor applications, demonstrating scalability and high performance in handling incomplete data scenarios.

Abstract: Foundation models, a cornerstone of recent advancements in machine learning,
have predominantly thrived on complete and well-structured data. Wearable
sensor data frequently suffers from significant missingness, posing a
substantial challenge for self-supervised learning (SSL) models that typically
assume complete data inputs. This paper introduces the second generation of
Large Sensor Model (LSM-2) with Adaptive and Inherited Masking (AIM), a novel
SSL approach that learns robust representations directly from incomplete data
without requiring explicit imputation. AIM's core novelty lies in its use of
learnable mask tokens to model both existing ("inherited") and artificially
introduced missingness, enabling it to robustly handle fragmented real-world
data during inference. Pre-trained on an extensive dataset of 40M hours of
day-long multimodal sensor data, our LSM-2 with AIM achieves the best
performance across a diverse range of tasks, including classification,
regression and generative modeling. Furthermore, LSM-2 with AIM exhibits
superior scaling performance, and critically, maintains high performance even
under targeted missingness scenarios, reflecting clinically coherent patterns,
such as the diagnostic value of nighttime biosignals for hypertension
prediction. This makes AIM a more reliable choice for real-world wearable data
applications.

*Yingshuai Ji,Haomin Zhuang,Matthew Toole,James McKenzie,Xiaolong Liu,Xiangliang Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces an AI-based framework to extract single-scatterer quasiparticle interference (QPI) patterns, solving an ill-posed problem in quantum material imaging with high accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extracting single-scatterer QPI patterns from multi-scatterer images is a challenging, fundamental inverse problem in the study of quantum materials. Current methods struggle to address the complexity and precision required in this task.

Method: The authors propose a two-step AI framework involving a variational autoencoder (VAE) to learn latent representations of QPI kernels, followed by a decoder to align multi-scatterer observations with the pre-learned kernel representations. This design separates kernel learning and inference stages for enhanced robustness.

Result: The proposed method achieved higher accuracy compared to a direct baseline and showed improved generalization to previously unseen scattering kernels. The evaluation utilized a diverse, physically realistic dataset consisting of 100 unique QPI kernels.

Conclusion: The work presents a significant advancement in QPI imaging by enabling reliable, robust extraction of single-scatterer patterns under complex scattering conditions, paving the way for deeper insights into quantum materials.

Abstract: Quasiparticle interference (QPI) imaging is a powerful tool for probing
electronic structures in quantum materials, but extracting the single-scatterer
QPI pattern (i.e., the kernel) from a multi-scatterer image remains a
fundamentally ill-posed inverse problem. In this work, we propose the first
AI-based framework for QPI kernel extraction. We introduce a two-step learning
strategy that decouples kernel representation learning from
observation-to-kernel inference. In the first step, we train a variational
autoencoder to learn a compact latent space of scattering kernels. In the
second step, we align the latent representation of QPI observations with those
of the pre-learned kernels using a dedicated encoder. This design enables the
model to infer kernels robustly even under complex, entangled scattering
conditions. We construct a diverse and physically realistic QPI dataset
comprising 100 unique kernels and evaluate our method against a direct one-step
baseline. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves
significantly higher extraction accuracy, and improved generalization to unseen
kernels.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method called grafting to study and edit pretrained diffusion transformers for testing new model architectures efficiently with minimal compute overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the challenge of costly pretraining required to evaluate the impact of architectural decisions in model design, inspired by the concept of building new software on existing code.

Method: They propose the grafting approach, which involves editing pretrained diffusion transformers to create new architectures. They construct a testbed and explore hybrid designs by modifying operators (e.g., softmax attention) and restructuring architectures.

Result: The grafted models demonstrate comparable or improved performance with significantly lower compute requirements (e.g., FID 2.38-2.64 vs. 2.27 for the baseline) and achieve speedup with minimal trade-offs in quality.

Conclusion: The study highlights that pretrained models can be effectively used to explore and validate new architectural designs, reducing the cost and barriers to experimentation in model development.

Abstract: Designing model architectures requires decisions such as selecting operators
(e.g., attention, convolution) and configurations (e.g., depth, width).
However, evaluating the impact of these decisions on model quality requires
costly pretraining, limiting architectural investigation. Inspired by how new
software is built on existing code, we ask: can new architecture designs be
studied using pretrained models? To this end, we present grafting, a simple
approach for editing pretrained diffusion transformers (DiTs) to materialize
new architectures under small compute budgets. Informed by our analysis of
activation behavior and attention locality, we construct a testbed based on the
DiT-XL/2 design to study the impact of grafting on model quality. Using this
testbed, we develop a family of hybrid designs via grafting: replacing softmax
attention with gated convolution, local attention, and linear attention, and
replacing MLPs with variable expansion ratio and convolutional variants.
Notably, many hybrid designs achieve good quality (FID: 2.38-2.64 vs. 2.27 for
DiT-XL/2) using <2% pretraining compute. We then graft a text-to-image model
(PixArt-Sigma), achieving a 1.43x speedup with less than a 2% drop in GenEval
score. Finally, we present a case study that restructures DiT-XL/2 by
converting every pair of sequential transformer blocks into parallel blocks via
grafting. This reduces model depth by 2x and yields better quality (FID: 2.77)
than other models of comparable depth. Together, we show that new diffusion
model designs can be explored by grafting pretrained DiTs, with edits ranging
from operator replacement to architecture restructuring. Code and grafted

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve optimization efficiency in patient scheduling for proton therapy using advanced genetic algorithms.

Method: Quantum-inspired chromosomes encode patient and gantry data, with tailored selection and repair strategies for reliable schedule generation.

Result: QGAs outperform classical algorithms in population size while achieving clinically feasible schedules, but encounter runtime issues for large-scale problems.

Conclusion: QGAs exhibit promise but require true quantum computation for handling large problems; classical algorithms remain stable alternatives.

Abstract: Among the genetic algorithms generally used for optimization problems in the

tailored to possess the superposed data of patient IDs and gantry statuses.
Selection and repair strategies are also elaborated for reliable convergence to
a clinically feasible schedule although the employed model is not complex.
Clear advantage in population size is shown over the classical counterpart in
our numerical results for both a medium-size test case and a large-size
practical problem instance. It is, however, observed that program run time is
rather long for the large-size practical case, which is due to the limitation
of classical emulation and demands the forthcoming true quantum computation.
Our results also revalidate the stability of the conventional classical genetic
algorithm.

*Hugo Alcaraz-Herrera,Michail-Antisthenis Tsompanas,Igor Balaz,Andrew Adamatzky*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: This study proposes automated design methods using Neuroevolution for controller development in robotic soft actuators. Results showcase better adaptability compared to baseline methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Soft robotics outperform conventional robots in certain applications due to their compliance, but designing their morphology and controllers remains challenging.

Method: The study applies Neuroevolution methods (NEAT and HyperNEAT) alongside Compositional Pattern Producing Networks (CPPNs) to synchronize components of soft actuators. A Standard Genetic Algorithm was utilized as a baseline.

Result: Neuroevolution methodologies proved more effective across various morphologies, with NEAT outperforming other methods by producing simpler and practical networks.

Conclusion: Neuroevolution, particularly NEAT, is recommended for efficiently designing controller strategies for soft robotics.

Abstract: Since soft robotics are composed of compliant materials, they perform better
than conventional rigid robotics in specific fields, such as medical
applications. However, the field of soft robotics is fairly new, and the design
process of their morphology and their controller strategies has not yet been
thoroughly studied. Consequently, here, an automated design method for the
controller of soft actuators based on Neuroevolution is proposed. Specifically,
the suggested techniques employ Neuroevolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT)
and Hypercube-based NEAT (HyperNEAT) to generate the synchronization profile of
the components of a simulated soft actuator by employing Compositional Pattern
Producing Networks (CPPNs). As a baseline methodology, a Standard Genetic
Algorithm (SGA) was used. Moreover, to test the robustness of the proposed
methodologies, both high- and low-performing morphologies of soft actuators
were utilized as testbeds. Moreover, the use of an affluent and a more limited
set of activation functions for the Neuroevolution targets was tested
throughout the experiments. The results support the hypothesis that
Neuroevolution based methodologies are more appropriate for designing
controllers that align with both types of morphologies. In specific, NEAT
performed better for all different scenarios tested and produced more
simplistic networks that are easier to implement in real life applications.

### [395] [RoboRefer: Towards Spatial Referring with Reasoning in Vision-Language Models for Robotics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04308)
*Enshen Zhou,Jingkun An,Cheng Chi,Yi Han,Shanyu Rong,Chi Zhang,Pengwei Wang,Zhongyuan Wang,Tiejun Huang,Lu Sheng,Shanghang Zhang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces RoboRefer, a 3D-aware vision language model (VLM) designed for improved spatial understanding and reasoning in robotics. Supporting this, they developed RefSpatial, a new large-scale dataset, and RefSpatial-Bench for evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to enhance robots' ability to spatially refer and reason in complex 3D environments, overcoming the limitations of current vision language models in accurately interpreting and interacting with 3D scenes.

Method: They propose a 3D-aware VLM named RoboRefer that incorporates a dedicated depth encoder through supervised fine-tuning (SFT) for spatial understanding and uses reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) with process reward functions for advanced multi-step spatial reasoning. They also provide RefSpatial Dataset and RefSpatial-Bench benchmark for training and evaluation.

Result: RoboRefer achieves a state-of-the-art success rate of 89.6% in spatial understanding. When reinforced with RFT, it significantly outperforms all baselines, achieving a 17.4% accuracy improvement compared to Gemini-2.5-Pro on the RefSpatial-Bench.

Conclusion: RoboRefer, along with its training and evaluation tools, sets a new benchmark in spatial referring and reasoning, demonstrating integration capability with various robotic platforms for complex real-world tasks.

Abstract: Spatial referring is a fundamental capability of embodied robots to interact
with the 3D physical world. However, even with the powerful pretrained vision
language models (VLMs), recent approaches are still not qualified to accurately
understand the complex 3D scenes and dynamically reason about the
instruction-indicated locations for interaction. To this end, we propose
RoboRefer, a 3D-aware VLM that can first achieve precise spatial understanding
by integrating a disentangled but dedicated depth encoder via supervised
fine-tuning (SFT). Moreover, RoboRefer advances generalized multi-step spatial
reasoning via reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT), with metric-sensitive process
reward functions tailored for spatial referring tasks. To support SFT and RFT
training, we introduce RefSpatial, a large-scale dataset of 20M QA pairs (2x
prior), covering 31 spatial relations (vs. 15 prior) and supporting complex
reasoning processes (up to 5 steps). In addition, we introduce
RefSpatial-Bench, a challenging benchmark filling the gap in evaluating spatial
referring with multi-step reasoning. Experiments show that SFT-trained
RoboRefer achieves state-of-the-art spatial understanding, with an average
success rate of 89.6%. RFT-trained RoboRefer further outperforms all other
baselines by a large margin, even surpassing Gemini-2.5-Pro by 17.4% in average
accuracy on RefSpatial-Bench. Notably, RoboRefer can be integrated with various
control policies to execute long-horizon, dynamic tasks across diverse robots
(e,g., UR5, G1 humanoid) in cluttered real-world scenes.

*Zihao Dong,Alan Papalia,Leonard Jung,Alenna Spiro,Philip R. Osteen,Christa S. Robison,Michael Everett*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: SPARTA improves off-road autonomy by learning approach angle-conditioned traversability using Fourier-based smooth functions, aiding computational efficiency and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in off-road autonomy, particularly terrain traversability depending on vehicle orientation and computational inefficiencies in planning.

Method: SPARTA estimates traversability by imposing geometric structure on point cloud data, outputting a Fourier-based smooth analytical function for angle-dependent risk predictions.

Result: SPARTA achieved a 91% success rate in simulated environments for crossing complex terrains, outperforming the baseline method’s 73%. It successfully generalized to hardware applications.

Conclusion: SPARTA enhances computational efficiency and generalization in estimating traversable paths for off-road vehicles by utilizing periodic and smooth analytical functions.

Abstract: A key open challenge in off-road autonomy is that the traversability of
terrain often depends on the vehicle's state. In particular, some obstacles are
only traversable from some orientations. However, learning this interaction by
encoding the angle of approach as a model input demands a large and diverse
training dataset and is computationally inefficient during planning due to
repeated model inference. To address these challenges, we present SPARTA, a
method for estimating approach angle conditioned traversability from point
clouds. Specifically, we impose geometric structure into our network by
outputting a smooth analytical function over the 1-Sphere that predicts risk
distribution for any angle of approach with minimal overhead and can be reused
for subsequent queries. The function is composed of Fourier basis functions,
which has important advantages for generalization due to their periodic nature
and smoothness. We demonstrate SPARTA both in a high-fidelity simulation
platform, where our model achieves a 91\% success rate crossing a 40m boulder
field (compared to 73\% for the baseline), and on hardware, illustrating the
generalization ability of the model to real-world settings.

Motivation: Current challenges in validating landmine detection algorithms are due to the lack of diverse and realistic datasets for testing.

Method: MineInsight collects data using dual-view scans from an Unmanned Ground Vehicle and robotic arm, integrates LiDAR and spectral imaging across visible, SWIR, and LWIR ranges, and provides target localization estimates.

Result: The dataset contains 35 targets across three tracks recorded in various lighting conditions, resulting in extensive image frames across RGB, VIS-SWIR, and LWIR spectra.

Conclusion: MineInsight is a valuable publicly available dataset enabling the development and reliable validation of landmine detection algorithms.

Abstract: The use of robotics in humanitarian demining increasingly involves computer
vision techniques to improve landmine detection capabilities. However, in the
absence of diverse and realistic datasets, the reliable validation of
algorithms remains a challenge for the research community. In this paper, we
introduce MineInsight, a publicly available multi-sensor, multi-spectral
dataset designed for off-road landmine detection. The dataset features 35
different targets (15 landmines and 20 commonly found objects) distributed
along three distinct tracks, providing a diverse and realistic testing
environment. MineInsight is, to the best of our knowledge, the first dataset to
integrate dual-view sensor scans from both an Unmanned Ground Vehicle and its
robotic arm, offering multiple viewpoints to mitigate occlusions and improve
spatial awareness. It features two LiDARs, as well as images captured at
diverse spectral ranges, including visible (RGB, monochrome), visible
short-wave infrared (VIS-SWIR), and long-wave infrared (LWIR). Additionally,
the dataset comes with an estimation of the location of the targets, offering a
benchmark for evaluating detection algorithms. We recorded approximately one
hour of data in both daylight and nighttime conditions, resulting in around
38,000 RGB frames, 53,000 VIS-SWIR frames, and 108,000 LWIR frames. MineInsight
serves as a benchmark for developing and evaluating landmine detection
algorithms. Our dataset is available at

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel method to automatically generate annotated synthetic datasets using Unreal Engine for object detection tasks, reducing labor-intensive annotation processes and improving robot soccer applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation arises from the challenges of manually creating annotated datasets for object detection in robotics, which is labor-intensive, prone to error, and lacks diversity.

Method: The method involves using Unreal Engine with 3D Gaussian splats to rapidly generate photorealistic synthetic images that come with automatic annotations.

Result: Synthetic datasets perform comparably to real-world datasets and increase object detection performance when combined with real-world data in robot soccer scenarios.

Conclusion: The research provides a scalable and efficient alternative for dataset creation, ensuring accurate annotations while minimizing manual labor and enhancing object detection in robotics settings.

Abstract: Annotated datasets are critical for training neural networks for object
detection, yet their manual creation is time- and labour-intensive, subjective
to human error, and often limited in diversity. This challenge is particularly
pronounced in the domain of robotics, where diverse and dynamic scenarios
further complicate the creation of representative datasets. To address this, we
propose a novel method for automatically generating annotated synthetic data in
Unreal Engine. Our approach leverages photorealistic 3D Gaussian splats for
rapid synthetic data generation. We demonstrate that synthetic datasets can
achieve performance comparable to that of real-world datasets while
significantly reducing the time required to generate and annotate data.
Additionally, combining real-world and synthetic data significantly increases
object detection performance by leveraging the quality of real-world images
with the easier scalability of synthetic data. To our knowledge, this is the
first application of synthetic data for training object detection algorithms in
the highly dynamic and varied environment of robot soccer. Validation
experiments reveal that a detector trained on synthetic images performs on par
with one trained on manually annotated real-world images when tested on robot
soccer match scenarios. Our method offers a scalable and comprehensive
alternative to traditional dataset creation, eliminating the labour-intensive
error-prone manual annotation process. By generating datasets in a simulator
where all elements are intrinsically known, we ensure accurate annotations
while significantly reducing manual effort, which makes it particularly
valuable for robotics applications requiring diverse and scalable training
data.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel terrain-aware dynamics modeling approach using neural network basis functions for autonomous mobile robots, enabling rapid online adaptation without retraining, leading to improved controller performance and fewer collisions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robots in unstructured, rapidly changing terrains require reliable dynamics estimation to ensure accurate navigation and planning, but traditional methods struggle to adapt quickly without retraining.

Method: The paper proposes learning neural network basis functions to model robot dynamics across diverse terrains. These functions enable runtime adaptation as a simple least-squares calculation without the need for retraining or fine-tuning.

Result: Using a Unity-based simulator, the approach showed improved controller performance, reducing collisions while navigating cluttered terrains compared to traditional neural ODE-based methods.

Conclusion: The proposed method allows autonomous robots to adapt efficiently to changing terrains by leveraging neural network basis functions, enhancing navigation and reducing obstacles encountered during operation.

Abstract: Autonomous mobile robots operating in remote, unstructured environments must
adapt to new, unpredictable terrains that can change rapidly during operation.
In such scenarios, a critical challenge becomes estimating the robot's dynamics
on changing terrain in order to enable reliable, accurate navigation and
planning. We present a novel online adaptation approach for terrain-aware
dynamics modeling and planning using function encoders. Our approach
efficiently adapts to new terrains at runtime using limited online data without
retraining or fine-tuning. By learning a set of neural network basis functions
that span the robot dynamics on diverse terrains, we enable rapid online
adaptation to new, unseen terrains and environments as a simple least-squares
calculation. We demonstrate our approach for terrain adaptation in a
Unity-based robotics simulator and show that the downstream controller has
better empirical performance due to higher accuracy of the learned model. This
leads to fewer collisions with obstacles while navigating in cluttered
environments as compared to a neural ODE baseline.

Result: Experiments using Isaac Sim demonstrated that their approach improves success rates in challenging navigation tasks.

Conclusion: Leveraging 3D scene graphs and reinforcement learning, combined with auxiliary strategies like imitation and curriculum learning, can significantly improve robotic navigation performance.

Abstract: The 3D scene graph models spatial relationships between objects, enabling the

the location of the target object.This paper proposes an original framework
named SGN-CIRL (3D Scene Graph-Based Reinforcement Learning Navigation) for

Motivation: Address the challenges caused by gas dynamics and environmental factors that hinder olfactory navigation tasks in robotic applications.

Method: Developed a generalized calibration process for OIO that works with multiple olfaction sensor types, demonstrated on a robotic arm.

Result: Achieved improved performance in OIO navigation tasks compared to an uncalibrated setup (cold-start).

Conclusion: The calibration process enables accurate localization of odor sources and can be applied in fields such as robotic surgery and touchless security screening.

Abstract: Visual inertial odometry (VIO) is a process for fusing visual and kinematic
data to understand a machine's state in a navigation task. Olfactory inertial
odometry (OIO) is an analog to VIO that fuses signals from gas sensors with
inertial data to help a robot navigate by scent. Gas dynamics and environmental
factors introduce disturbances into olfactory navigation tasks that can make
OIO difficult to facilitate. With our work here, we define a process for
calibrating a robot for OIO that generalizes to several olfaction sensor types.
Our focus is specifically on calibrating OIO for centimeter-level accuracy in
localizing an odor source on a slow-moving robot platform to demonstrate use
cases in robotic surgery and touchless security screening. We demonstrate our
process for OIO calibration on a real robotic arm and show how this calibration
improves performance over a cold-start olfactory navigation task.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of long measurement durations in chronoamperometry caused by high viscosity and slow mass transport in room-temperature ionic liquids.

Method: A novel mathematical regression approach using an inference algorithm analyzes the initial transient current response to predict steady-state electrochemical parameters.

Result: The method reduced CA measurement windows to under 1 second and was validated to maintain accuracy compared to standard techniques.

Conclusion: This method offers a faster alternative for CA measurements, with potential applications in analytical chemistry, sensor technology, and battery science.

Abstract: Chronoamperometry (CA) is a fundamental electrochemical technique used for
quantifying redox-active species. However, in room-temperature ionic liquids
(RTILs), the high viscosity and slow mass transport often lead to extended
measurement durations. This paper presents a novel mathematical regression
approach that reduces CA measurement windows to under 1 second, significantly
faster than previously reported methods, which typically require 1-4 seconds or
longer. By applying an inference algorithm to the initial transient current
response, this method accurately predicts steady-state electrochemical
parameters without requiring additional hardware modifications. The approach is
validated through comparison with standard chronoamperometric techniques and is
demonstrated to maintain reasonable accuracy while dramatically reducing data
acquisition time. The implications of this technique are explored in analytical
chemistry, sensor technology, and battery science, where rapid electrochemical
quantification is critical. Our technique is focused on enabling faster
multiplexing of chronoamperometric measurements for rapid olfactory and

Conclusion: Bioinspired soft robots can be highly effective for applications such as search-and-rescue, environmental monitoring, and industrial inspections in challenging terrains.

Abstract: Limbless creatures can crawl on flat surfaces by deforming their bodies and
interacting with asperities on the ground, offering a biological blueprint for
designing efficient limbless robots. Inspired by this natural locomotion, we
present a soft robot capable of navigating complex terrains using a combination
of rectilinear motion and asymmetric steering gaits. The robot is made of a
pair of antagonistic inflatable soft actuators covered with a flexible kirigami
skin with asymmetric frictional properties. The robot's rectilinear locomotion
is achieved through cyclic inflation of internal chambers with precise phase
shifts, enabling forward progression. Steering is accomplished using an
asymmetric gait, allowing for both in-place rotation and wide turns. To
validate its mobility in obstacle-rich environments, we tested the robot in an

Abstract: Aquatic organisms are known for their ability to generate efficient

leverage bio-inspired structures to reduce energy costs in underwater robotics,
the crucial role of control policies in enhancing efficiency has often been
overlooked. In this study, we optimize the motion of a bio-mimetic robotic fish
using deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to maximize propulsion efficiency and
minimize energy consumption. Our novel DRL approach incorporates extended
pressure perception, a transformer model processing sequences of observations,
and a policy transfer scheme. Notably, significantly improved training
stability and speed within our approach allow for end-to-end training of the
robotic fish. This enables agiler responses to hydrodynamic environments and
possesses greater optimization potential compared to pre-defined motion pattern
controls. Our experiments are conducted on a serially connected rigid robotic
fish in a free stream with a Reynolds number of 6000 using computational fluid
dynamics (CFD) simulations. The DRL-trained policies yield impressive results,
demonstrating both high efficiency and propulsion. The policies also showcase
the agent's embodiment, skillfully utilizing its body structure and engaging

Motivation: The motivation is to address the inefficiency and high cost of collecting training data for learning-based dynamics models in long-horizon, nonprehensile manipulation tasks.

Method: The method combines residual-physics modeling with kernel-based uncertainty-driven active learning to optimize data acquisition. It also integrates an uncertainty-aware kinodynamic planner for reliable control sampling.

Result: The approach shows improved data efficiency and better planning success rates when evaluated on simulations and real-world experiments compared to baseline methods.

Conclusion: ActivePusher effectively enhances the practicality of learned dynamics models by focusing on informative skill parameters and improving overall system performance.

Abstract: Planning with learned dynamics models offers a promising approach toward
real-world, long-horizon manipulation, particularly in nonprehensile settings
such as pushing or rolling, where accurate analytical models are difficult to
obtain. Although learning-based methods hold promise, collecting training data
can be costly and inefficient, as it often relies on randomly sampled
interactions that are not necessarily the most informative. To address this
challenge, we propose ActivePusher, a novel framework that combines
residual-physics modeling with kernel-based uncertainty-driven active learning
to focus data acquisition on the most informative skill parameters.
Additionally, ActivePusher seamlessly integrates with model-based kinodynamic
planners, leveraging uncertainty estimates to bias control sampling toward more
reliable actions. We evaluate our approach in both simulation and real-world
environments and demonstrate that it improves data efficiency and planning
success rates compared to baseline methods.

Motivation: The motivation is to address the risks and inconsistency of human testing for exoskeletons by providing a safer and more repeatable testing environment.

Method: The paper employs a bipedal robot with SDRE-based control strategies and parameterized methods to mimic human gait, simplifying control through motor-compatible parameterization and reducing computational load.

Result: Experimental results confirm that the proposed technique can effectively replicate human gait, providing a safe and consistent platform for evaluating knee-type exoskeletons.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the feasibility of using a bipedal robot for controlled exoskeleton testing, offering a reliable alternative to risky direct human tests.

Abstract: Exoskeletons are widely used in rehabilitation and industrial applications to
assist human motion. However, direct human testing poses risks due to possible
exoskeleton malfunctions and inconsistent movement replication. To provide a
safer and more repeatable testing environment, this study employs a bipedal

replication. The bipedal robot dynamics are represented using double pendulum
model, where SDRE-optimized control inputs minimize deviations from human
motion trajectories. To align with motor behavior constraints, a parameterized
control method is introduced to simplify the control process while effectively
replicating human gait. The proposed approach initially adopts a ramping
trapezoidal velocity model, which is then adapted into a piecewise linear
velocity-time representation through motor command overwriting. This
modification enables finer control over gait phase transitions while ensuring
compatibility with motor dynamics. The corresponding cost function optimizes
the control parameters to minimize errors in joint angles, velocities, and
torques relative to SDRE control result. By structuring velocity transitions in
accordance with motor limitations, the method reduce the computational load
associated with real-time control. Experimental results verify the feasibility
of the proposed parameterized control method in reproducing human gait. The
bipedal robot platform provides a reliable and repeatable testing mechanism for
knee-type exoskeletons, offering insights into exoskeleton performance under
controlled conditions.

Motivation: The paper is motivated by the need to improve trajectory tracking for high-payload autonomous mobile robots while addressing tire wear issues, a critical factor for efficient and cost-effective operation.

Method: The methodology involves a hierarchical controller design leveraging a simplified dynamic model that integrates the 'magic formula tire model' and a 'simplified tire wear model' solved using real-time simulated annealing.

Result: The proposed method reduced tire wear by 19.19% in typical curve-tracking experiments and up to 65.20% in challenging scenarios with significant trajectory offsets, all while maintaining trajectory tracking accuracy.

Conclusion: Incorporating tire wear minimization in the control of MS-AGVs is feasible, effective, and offers substantial gains in tire longevity without compromising trajectory tracking performance.

Abstract: Multi-axle Swerve-drive Autonomous Mobile Robots (MS-AGVs) equipped with
independently steerable wheels are commonly used for high-payload
transportation. In this work, we present a novel model predictive control (MPC)
method for MS-AGV trajectory tracking that takes tire wear minimization
consideration in the objective function. To speed up the problem-solving
process, we propose a hierarchical controller design and simplify the dynamic
model by integrating the \textit{magic formula tire model} and
\textit{simplified tire wear model}. In the experiment, the proposed method can
be solved by simulated annealing in real-time on a normal personal computer and
by incorporating tire wear into the objective function, tire wear is reduced by
19.19\% while maintaining the tracking accuracy in curve-tracking experiments.
In the more challenging scene: the desired trajectory is offset by 60 degrees
from the vehicle's heading, the reduction in tire wear increased to 65.20\%
compared to the kinematic model without considering the tire wear optimization.

Conclusion: The paper contributes to theoretical and practical advancements in coordinated multi-robot systems by offering an efficient framework for large-scale applications such as warehouse logistics and search-and-rescue.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel path-planning and task assignment algorithm for
multi-robot systems that should fulfill a global Boolean specification. The
proposed method is based on Integer Linear Programming (ILP) formulations,
which are combined with structural insights from Petri nets to improve
scalability and computational efficiency. By proving that the \emph{constraint
matrix} is totally unimodular (TU) for certain classes of problems, the ILP
formulation can be relaxed into a Linear Programming (LP) problem without
losing the integrality of the solution. This relaxation eliminates complex
combinatorial techniques, significantly reducing computational overhead and
thus ensuring scalability for large-scale systems. Using the approach proposed
in this paper, we can solve path-planning problems for teams made up to 500
robots. The method guarantees computational tractability, handles collision
avoidance and reduces computational demands through iterative LP optimization
techniques. Case studies demonstrate the efficiency of the algorithm in
generating scalable, collision-free paths for large robot teams navigating in
complex environments. While the conservative nature of collision avoidance
introduces additional constraints, and thus, computational requirements, the
solution remains practical and impactful for diverse applications. The
algorithm is particularly applicable to real-world scenarios, including
warehouse logistics where autonomous robots must efficiently coordinate tasks
or search-and-rescue operations in various environments. This work contributes
both theoretically and practically to scalable multi-robot path planning and
task allocation, offering an efficient framework for coordinating autonomous
agents in shared environments.

TL;DR: This paper develops a novel mechanism inspired by pillbug movements that uses shells and a coupling mechanism to achieve rolling and spreading motions, resulting in a robotic system capable of two distinct mobility modes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create adaptable and protective morphing structures that can change shape like a pillbug for versatile robotic applications.

Method: The design integrates a loop-coupled slider-crank mechanism mimicking pillbug motion, scissor mechanisms to reduce degrees of freedom, 3D shells connected to morphing points, and type/dimensional synthesis to build a complete system.

Result: A tested 3D model demonstrates the system's shape-changing abilities, and a dual-mode robot using this mechanism is prototyped, capable of rolling downhill and moving straight via wheels.

Conclusion: The proposed mechanism successfully enables versatile pillbug-inspired shape morphing, showing potential for robotic systems with efficient locomotion and self-protection.

Abstract: This research proposes a novel morphing structure with shells inspired by the
movement of pillbugs. Instead of the pillbug body, a loopcoupled mechanism
based on slider-crank mechanisms is utilized to achieve the rolling up and
spreading motion. This mechanism precisely imitates three distinct curves that
mimic the shape morphing of a pillbug. To decrease the degree-of-freedom (DOF)
of the mechanism to one, scissor mechanisms are added. 3D curved shells are
then attached to the tracer points of the morphing mechanism to safeguard it
from attacks while allowing it to roll. Through type and dimensional synthesis,
a complete system that includes shells and an underlying morphing mechanism is
developed. A 3D model is created and tested to demonstrate the proposed
system's shape-changing capability. Lastly, a robot with two modes is developed
based on the proposed mechanism, which can curl up to roll down hills and can
spread to move in a straight line via wheels.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenging task of coupling fluid dynamics and robotic mechanisms into a unified and physically accurate simulation framework.

Method: Using variational mechanics, the authors develop implicit time-integration schemes and a refined no-slip boundary condition constraint to achieve stable and realistic simulations.

Result: The framework accurately simulates benchmark fluid dynamics problems and designs a swimming robot locomotion policy that is validated through hardware implementation.

Conclusion: The proposed framework provides a reliable sim-to-real solution for fluid-robot multiphysics tasks, emphasizing its applicability in robotics.

Abstract: We present a framework for simulating fluid-robot multiphysics as a single,
unified optimization problem. The coupled manipulator and incompressible
Navier-Stokes equations governing the robot and fluid dynamics are derived
together from a single Lagrangian using the principal of least action. We then
employ discrete variational mechanics to derive a stable, implicit
time-integration scheme for jointly simulating both the fluid and robot
dynamics, which are tightly coupled by a constraint that enforces the no-slip
boundary condition at the fluid-robot interface. Extending the classical
immersed boundary method, we derive a new formulation of the no-slip constraint
that is numerically well-conditioned and physically accurate for multibody
systems commonly found in robotics. We demonstrate our approach's physical
accuracy on benchmark computational fluid-dynamics problems, including
Poiseuille flow and a disc in free stream. We then design a locomotion policy
for a novel swimming robot in simulation and validate results on real-world
hardware, showcasing our framework's sim-to-real capability for robotics tasks.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper proposes a hierarchical framework for heterogeneous multi-robot systems utilizing a Large Language Model (LLM) and a Vision Language Model (VLM) to achieve advanced task decomposition, perception, and navigation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional multi-robot systems rely on static models, which lack flexibility for diverse tasks in dynamic environments, necessitating more adaptable and generalizable systems.

Method: The framework integrates LLMs for task reasoning and VLMs for extracting semantics and spatial data from aerial images. The aerial robot serves as a global planner, while the ground robot performs localized navigation and manipulation.

Result: Experiments on a real-world task demonstrated the framework's successful adaptation and robustness in dynamic settings, including scenarios without predefined targets.

Conclusion: This framework is a pioneering effort in combining LLMs and VLMs for heterogeneous multi-robot systems, showcasing its potential for generalization and efficiency in diverse environments.

Abstract: Heterogeneous multi-robot systems show great potential in complex tasks
requiring coordinated hybrid cooperation. However, traditional approaches
relying on static models often struggle with task diversity and dynamic
environments. This highlights the need for generalizable intelligence that can
bridge high-level reasoning with low-level execution across heterogeneous
agents. To address this, we propose a hierarchical framework integrating a
prompted Large Language Model (LLM) and a GridMask-enhanced fine-tuned Vision
Language Model (VLM). The LLM performs task decomposition and global semantic
map construction, while the VLM extracts task-specified semantic labels and 2D
spatial information from aerial images to support local planning. Within this
framework, the aerial robot follows a globally optimized semantic path and
continuously provides bird-view images, guiding the ground robot's local
semantic navigation and manipulation, including target-absent scenarios where
implicit alignment is maintained. Experiments on a real-world letter-cubes
arrangement task demonstrate the framework's adaptability and robustness in
dynamic environments. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
demonstration of an aerial-ground heterogeneous system integrating VLM-based
perception with LLM-driven task reasoning and motion planning.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The study introduced PulseRide, a novel wheelchair system that uses real-time physiological data and machine learning to optimize exertion, improving health and comfort for users.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Wheelchair users face challenges like obesity, deconditioning, and upper extremity injuries. There’s a need for a mobility system that promotes activity while minimizing injury risk.

Method: PulseRide uses real-time physiological data (heart rate, ECG) with a reinforcement learning algorithm (Deep Q-Network) to provide personalized push assistance and maintain moderate activity levels.

Result: Preliminary tests on 10 users showed PulseRide kept heart rates in a moderate activity range 71.7% longer and reduced muscle contractions by 41.86%, improving comfort and delaying fatigue.

Conclusion: PulseRide demonstrates potential as a healthier, adaptive mobility system, bridging the gap between passive and physically draining wheelchair options.

Abstract: Maintaining an active lifestyle is vital for quality of life, yet challenging
for wheelchair users. For instance, powered wheelchairs face increasing risks
of obesity and deconditioning due to inactivity. Conversely, manual wheelchair
users, who propel the wheelchair by pushing the wheelchair's handrims, often
face upper extremity injuries from repetitive motions. These challenges
underscore the need for a mobility system that promotes activity while
minimizing injury risk. Maintaining optimal exertion during wheelchair use
enhances health benefits and engagement, yet the variations in individual
physiological responses complicate exertion optimization. To address this, we
introduce PulseRide, a novel wheelchair system that provides personalized
assistance based on each user's physiological responses, helping them maintain
their physical exertion goals. Unlike conventional assistive systems focused on
obstacle avoidance and navigation, PulseRide integrates real-time physiological
data-such as heart rate and ECG-with wheelchair speed to deliver adaptive
assistance. Using a human-in-the-loop reinforcement learning approach with Deep
Q-Network algorithm (DQN), the system adjusts push assistance to keep users
within a moderate activity range without under- or over-exertion. We conducted
preliminary tests with 10 users on various terrains, including carpet and
slate, to assess PulseRide's effectiveness. Our findings show that, for
individual users, PulseRide maintains heart rates within the moderate activity
zone as much as 71.7 percent longer than manual wheelchairs. Among all users,
we observed an average reduction in muscle contractions of 41.86 percent,
delaying fatigue onset and enhancing overall comfort and engagement. These
results indicate that PulseRide offers a healthier, adaptive mobility solution,
bridging the gap between passive and physically taxing mobility options.

*Lingxiao Guo,Zhengrong Xue,Zijing Xu,Huazhe Xu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces DemoSpeedup, a self-supervised method to accelerate visuomotor policy execution by selectively speeding up demonstrations based on action entropy estimates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robotic manipulation shows promise but suffers from slow policy execution due to tardy human demonstrations, which this work aims to address.

Method: DemoSpeedup uses action entropy estimation to segment demonstrations into low-entropy (precise) and high-entropy (casual) frames, then accelerates high-entropy sections. The accelerated demonstrations are used to train faster policies.

Result: The trained policies executed tasks up to 3 times faster while maintaining or even improving task success rates versus normal-speed demonstrations.

Conclusion: Using entropy-guided acceleration improves both task completion speed and often success rate, highlighting the benefits of shortened decision-making horizons in training.

Abstract: Imitation learning has shown great promise in robotic manipulation, but the
policy's execution is often unsatisfactorily slow due to commonly tardy
demonstrations collected by human operators. In this work, we present
DemoSpeedup, a self-supervised method to accelerate visuomotor policy execution
via entropy-guided demonstration acceleration. DemoSpeedup starts from training
an arbitrary generative policy (e.g., ACT or Diffusion Policy) on normal-speed
demonstrations, which serves as a per-frame action entropy estimator. The key
insight is that frames with lower action entropy estimates call for more
consistent policy behaviors, which often indicate the demands for
higher-precision operations. In contrast, frames with higher entropy estimates
correspond to more casual sections, and therefore can be more safely
accelerated. Thus, we segment the original demonstrations according to the
estimated entropy, and accelerate them by down-sampling at rates that increase
with the entropy values. Trained with the speedup demonstrations, the resulting
policies execute up to 3 times faster while maintaining the task completion
performance. Interestingly, these policies could even achieve higher success
rates than those trained with normal-speed demonstrations, due to the benefits
of reduced decision-making horizons.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large-scale autonomous exploration suffers from high computational demands and slow navigation speeds, presenting challenges for real-time performance.

Method: The authors propose a two-layer planning technique: an approximate algorithm for long-term routing and a curvature-penalized cost function to prioritize low-turn-cost next targets. They also incorporate an aggressive trajectory approach to improve exploration speed.

Result: In simulations, the proposed method demonstrated superior efficiency, reduced computational costs, and faster trajectory speeds compared to existing solutions. Real-world experiments validated these findings.

Conclusion: The dual-layer method effectively balances computational efficiency and exploration speed, outperforming state-of-the-art methods. The authors will also make the code available for broader adoption.

Abstract: Efficient autonomous exploration in large-scale environments remains
challenging due to the high planning computational cost and low-speed
maneuvers. In this paper, we propose a fast and computationally efficient
dual-layer exploration planning method. The insight of our dual-layer method is
efficiently finding an acceptable long-term region routing and greedily
exploring the target in the region of the first routing area with high speed.
Specifically, the proposed method finds the long-term area routing through an
approximate algorithm to ensure real-time planning in large-scale environments.
Then, the viewpoint in the first routing region with the lowest
curvature-penalized cost, which can effectively reduce decelerations caused by
sharp turn motions, will be chosen as the next exploration target. To further
speed up the exploration, we adopt an aggressive and safe exploration-oriented
trajectory to enhance exploration continuity. The proposed method is compared
to state-of-the-art methods in challenging simulation environments. The results
show that the proposed method outperforms other methods in terms of exploration
efficiency, computational cost, and trajectory speed. We also conduct
real-world experiments to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.
The code will be open-sourced.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RL-based legged locomotion has shown strong performance but faces safety issues in real-world settings, limiting application in critical missions.

Method: The paper integrates hard and soft constraints into RL using model-based control within a hierarchical optimization-based framework.

Result: The constrained RL policy was successfully deployed in a hexapod robot, demonstrating safe locomotion across challenging outdoor terrains like snow and stairs.

Conclusion: Incorporating constraints allows RL to achieve safety and robust locomotion in unstructured environments, addressing both training and deployment challenges effectively.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated impressive performance in legged
locomotion over various challenging environments. However, due to the
sim-to-real gap and lack of explainability, unconstrained RL policies deployed
in the real world still suffer from inevitable safety issues, such as joint
collisions, excessive torque, or foot slippage in low-friction environments.
These problems limit its usage in missions with strict safety requirements,
such as planetary exploration, nuclear facility inspection, and deep-sea
operations. In this paper, we design a hierarchical optimization-based
whole-body follower, which integrates both hard and soft constraints into RL
framework to make the robot move with better safety guarantees. Leveraging the
advantages of model-based control, our approach allows for the definition of
various types of hard and soft constraints during training or deployment, which
allows for policy fine-tuning and mitigates the challenges of sim-to-real
transfer. Meanwhile, it preserves the robustness of RL when dealing with
locomotion in complex unstructured environments. The trained policy with
introduced constraints was deployed in a hexapod robot and tested in various
outdoor environments, including snow-covered slopes and stairs, demonstrating
the great traversability and safety of our approach.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges in translating human motion into humanoid robot movements, particularly bridging the gap between text descriptions and the robots' kinematic constraints.

Method: The paper introduces an angle signal network with an NPR Loss framework to generate joint angles and employs reinforcement learning for whole-body motion control to ensure stability during execution.

Result: The proposed system successfully mapped text-driven human motion onto the NAO humanoid robot, demonstrating accurate and stable motion replication.

Conclusion: This text-based motion retargeting methodology presents a viable solution for humanoid robot motion imitation, opening avenues for applications without requiring direct motion capture.

Abstract: Human motion retargeting for humanoid robots, transferring human motion data
to robots for imitation, presents significant challenges but offers
considerable potential for real-world applications. Traditionally, this process
relies on human demonstrations captured through pose estimation or motion
capture systems. In this paper, we explore a text-driven approach to mapping
human motion to humanoids. To address the inherent discrepancies between the
generated motion representations and the kinematic constraints of humanoid
robots, we propose an angle signal network based on norm-position and rotation
loss (NPR Loss). It generates joint angles, which serve as inputs to a
reinforcement learning-based whole-body joint motion control policy. The policy
ensures tracking of the generated motions while maintaining the robot's
stability during execution. Our experimental results demonstrate the efficacy
of this approach, successfully transferring text-driven human motion to a real
humanoid robot NAO.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes a smoothing framework to improve robot motion quality by addressing discontinuities in imitation learning's action chunking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Learned robotic policies often suffer from motion discontinuities due to action chunking, which negatively impacts dynamic tasks requiring smooth trajectories.

Method: The approach combines inference-aware chunk scheduling, linear blending in overlap regions, and jerk-minimizing trajectory optimization.

Result: The proposed method showed reduced vibration and jitter, resulting in smoother motion and better mechanical robustness in dynamic manipulation tasks.

Conclusion: Post-optimization techniques can effectively address action chunking issues, improving motion quality and stability for complex robot tasks.

Abstract: Recent advances in imitation learning have enabled robots to perform
increasingly complex manipulation tasks in unstructured environments. However,
most learned policies rely on discrete action chunking, which introduces
discontinuities at chunk boundaries. These discontinuities degrade motion
quality and are particularly problematic in dynamic tasks such as throwing or
lifting heavy objects, where smooth trajectories are critical for momentum
transfer and system stability. In this work, we present a lightweight
post-optimization framework for smoothing chunked action sequences. Our method
combines three key components: (1) inference-aware chunk scheduling to
proactively generate overlapping chunks and avoid pauses from inference delays;
(2) linear blending in the overlap region to reduce abrupt transitions; and (3)
jerk-minimizing trajectory optimization constrained within a bounded
perturbation space. The proposed method was validated on a position-controlled
robotic arm performing dynamic manipulation tasks. Experimental results
demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces vibration and motion
jitter, leading to smoother execution and improved mechanical robustness.

multi-step assembly on any dual-arm robots. The planner is made efficient
through a parallelizable design and is optimized for downstream control
stability. For contact-rich assembly steps, we propose a lightweight
reinforcement learning framework that trains generalist policies across object
geometries, assembly directions, and grasp poses, guided by equivariance and
residual actions obtained from the plan. These policies transfer zero-shot to
the real world and achieve 80% successful steps. For systematic evaluation, we
propose a benchmark suite of multi-part assemblies resembling industrial and
daily objects across diverse categories and geometries. By integrating
efficient global planning and robust local control, we showcase the first
system to achieve complete and generalizable real-world multi-part assembly
without domain knowledge or human demonstrations. Project website:

### [424] [Characterizing Multi-Hunk Patches: Divergence, Proximity, and LLM Repair Challenges](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04418)
*Noor Nashid,Daniel Ding,Keheliya Gallaba,Ahmed E. Hassan,Ali Mesbah*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper focuses on multi-hunk bugs, introduces a dataset (HUNK4J), proposes metrics for measuring patch complexity, and investigates LLM performance on these bugs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-hunk bugs constitute a significant challenge in automated code repair, yet remain inadequately addressed in current techniques.

Method: The authors introduced the HUNK4J dataset, defined metrics like hunk divergence and spatial proximity, and evaluated six large language models (LLMs) on repairing multi-hunk bugs.

Result: The study found that LLMs struggle with high divergence and spatial dispersion, and no model succeeded with highly dispersed patches in the Fragment class.

Conclusion: The paper underscores a critical gap in current LLM capabilities for addressing complex, multi-hunk bugs, advocating for divergence-aware strategies.

Abstract: Multi-hunk bugs, where fixes span disjoint regions of code, are common in
practice, yet remain underrepresented in automated repair. Existing techniques
and benchmarks pre-dominantly target single-hunk scenarios, overlooking the
added complexity of coordinating semantically related changes across the
codebase. In this work, we characterize HUNK4J, a dataset of multi-hunk patches
derived from 372 real-world defects. We propose hunk divergence, a metric that
quantifies the variation among edits in a patch by capturing lexical,
structural, and file-level differences, while incorporating the number of hunks
involved. We further define spatial proximity, a classification that models how
hunks are spatially distributed across the program hierarchy. Our empirical
study spanning six LLMs reveals that model success rates decline with increased
divergence and spatial dispersion. Notably, when using the LLM alone, no model
succeeds in the most dispersed Fragment class. These findings highlight a
critical gap in LLM capabilities and motivate divergence-aware repair
strategies.

TL;DR: The paper discusses findings from the first part of a longitudinal study on the state-of-practice, processes, challenges, and verification/validation practices in autonomous systems development.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the lack of transparency and shared knowledge in the development processes of autonomous systems, given the dynamic applications and proprietary constraints.

Method: The study collected data through an anonymous online survey conducted in 2019, targeting experts experienced in autonomous systems development and/or model-based software engineering (MBSwE).

Result: This paper provides insights into current practices, benefits, challenges, and standards in the development of autonomous systems, specifically touching on model-based software engineering and reuse.

Conclusion: The findings establish a baseline for understanding autonomous system development practices and lay the groundwork for future survey-based studies to track its evolution over time.

Abstract: Autonomous systems have gained an important role in many industry domains and
are beginning to change everyday life. However, due to dynamically emerging
applications and often proprietary constraints, there is a lack of information
about the practice of developing autonomous systems. This paper presents the
first part of the longitudinal study focused on establishing
state-of-the-practice, identifying and quantifying the challenges and benefits,
identifying the processes and standards used, and exploring verification and
validation (V&V) practices used for the development of autonomous systems. The
results presented in this paper are based on data about software systems that
have autonomous functionality and may employ model-based software engineering
(MBSwE) and reuse. These data were collected using an anonymous online survey
that was administered in 2019 and were provided by experts with experience in
development of autonomous systems and /or the use of MBSwE. Our current work is
focused on repeating the survey to collect more recent data and discover how
the development of autonomous systems has evolved over time.

### [426] [Leveraging Reward Models for Guiding Code Review Comment Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04464)
*Oussama Ben Sghaier,Rosalia Tufano,Gabriele Bavota,Houari Sahraoui*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper proposes CoRAL, a deep learning framework for automating the code review process via reinforcement learning, focusing on comment generation and refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Code reviews, essential for software development, are time-consuming and prone to human subjectivity, creating a need for automated solutions.

Method: CoRAL leverages reinforcement learning to generate code review comments that are semantically accurate and practical for refinement tasks.

Result: Quantitative and qualitative analyses show CoRAL produces more effective and useful review comments compared to existing techniques.

Conclusion: CoRAL establishes an improved and nuanced approach to automated code reviews, addressing both generative and refinement aspects.

Abstract: Code review is a crucial component of modern software development, involving
the evaluation of code quality, providing feedback on potential issues, and
refining the code to address identified problems. Despite these benefits, code
review can be rather time consuming, and influenced by subjectivity and human
factors. For these reasons, techniques to (partially) automate the code review
process have been proposed in the literature. Among those, the ones exploiting
deep learning (DL) are able to tackle the generative aspect of code review, by
commenting on a given code as a human reviewer would do (i.e., comment
generation task) or by automatically implementing code changes required to
address a reviewer's comment (i.e., code refinement task). In this paper, we
introduce CoRAL, a deep learning framework automating review comment generation
by exploiting reinforcement learning with a reward mechanism considering both
the semantics of the generated comments as well as their usefulness as input
for other models automating the code refinement task. The core idea is that if
the DL model generates comments that are semantically similar to the expected
ones or can be successfully implemented by a second model specialized in code
refinement, these comments are likely to be meaningful and useful, thus
deserving a high reward in the reinforcement learning framework. We present
both quantitative and qualitative comparisons between the comments generated by
CoRAL and those produced by the latest baseline techniques, highlighting the
effectiveness and superiority of our approach.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper presents the BINGO effect, demonstrating faster and simpler optimization methods that exploit patterns in software engineering data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving the efficiency and simplicity of multi-objective optimization in software engineering problems.

Method: Identifying and exploiting the BINGO effect, where SE data collapses into limited solution buckets, and developing new algorithms (LITE and LINE) to optimize faster using stochastic selection.

Result: Achieved optimization speeds 10,000 times faster with comparable effectiveness to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: Simple methods leveraging data patterns can match complex optimizers, questioning the necessity of CPU-heavy techniques in SE optimization.

Abstract: Traditional multi-objective optimization in software engineering (SE) can be
slow and complex. This paper introduces the BINGO effect: a novel phenomenon
where SE data surprisingly collapses into a tiny fraction of possible solution
"buckets" (e.g., only 100 used from 4,096 expected).
  We show the BINGO effect's prevalence across 39 optimization in SE problems.
Exploiting this, we optimize 10,000 times faster than state-of-the-art methods,
with comparable effectiveness. Our new algorithms (LITE and LINE), demonstrate
that simple stochastic selection can match complex optimizers like DEHB. This
work explains why simple methods succeed in SE-real data occupies a small
corner of possibilities-and guides when to apply them, challenging the need for
CPU-heavy optimization.
  Our data and code are public at GitHub (see anon-artifacts/bingo).

*Wenwei Gu,Renyi Zhong,Guangba Yu,Xinying Sun,Jinyang Liu,Yintong Huo,Zhuangbin Chen,Jianping Zhang,Jiazhen Gu,Yongqiang Yang,Michael R. Lyu*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: KPIRoot+ enhances root cause localization in cloud systems, using improved methods to outperform traditional and state-of-the-art techniques while saving computational time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address inefficiencies in root cause localization, particularly focusing on the limitations of similarity-based and deep learning methods in large-scale, complex cloud environments.

Method: KPIRoot+ integrates symbolic aggregate approximation for KPI representation, enhances the anomaly detection method, and improves intricate trend analysis.

Result: KPIRoot+ outperforms eight state-of-the-art techniques by 2.9% to 35.7% and reduces computational time by 34.7%.

Conclusion: KPIRoot+ offers an efficient and accurate solution for performance issue localization, combining strengths of similarity and causality analysis methods.

Abstract: To ensure the reliability of cloud systems, their performance is monitored
using KPIs (key performance indicators). When issues arise, root cause
localization identifies KPIs responsible for service degradation, aiding in
quick diagnosis and resolution. Traditional methods rely on similarity
calculations, which can be ineffective in complex, interdependent cloud
environments. While deep learning-based approaches model these dependencies
better, they often face challenges such as high computational demands and lack
of interpretability.
  To address these issues, KPIRoot is proposed as an efficient method combining
similarity and causality analysis. It uses symbolic aggregate approximation for
compact KPI representation, improving analysis efficiency. However, deployment
in Cloud H revealed two drawbacks: 1) threshold-based anomaly detection misses
some performance anomalies, and 2) SAX representation fails to capture
intricate variation trends. KPIRoot+ addresses these limitations, outperforming
eight state-of-the-art baselines by 2.9% to 35.7%, while reducing time cost by
34.7%. We also share our experience deploying KPIRoot in a large-scale cloud
provider's production environment.

*Alisa Welter,Niklas Schneider,Tobias Dick,Kallistos Weis,Christof Tinnes,Marvin Wyrich,Sven Apel*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The study evaluates knowledge transfer in human-human and human-AI programming contexts, showing similarities but also key differences in acceptance and reminders.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To examine the effectiveness of knowledge transfer when developers collaborate with AI coding assistants as compared to traditional human pair programming.

Method: They used an empirical study comparing human-human pair programming and individual programming using GitHub Copilot. Extended a knowledge transfer framework and employed a semi-automated evaluation pipeline.

Result: They observed similar frequencies of successful knowledge transfer and topic categories in both settings. However, developers scrutinized Copilot's suggestions less and Copilot occasionally reminded them of overlooked details.

Conclusion: GitHub Copilot, while differing in interaction dynamics, can achieve knowledge transfer outcomes comparable to human pair programming under certain conditions.

Abstract: Knowledge transfer is fundamental to human collaboration and is therefore
common in software engineering. Pair programming is a prominent instance. With
the rise of AI coding assistants, developers now not only work with human
partners but also, as some claim, with AI pair programmers. Although studies
confirm knowledge transfer during human pair programming, its effectiveness
with AI coding assistants remains uncertain. To analyze knowledge transfer in
both human-human and human-AI settings, we conducted an empirical study where
developer pairs solved a programming task without AI support, while a separate
group of individual developers completed the same task using the AI coding
assistant GitHub Copilot. We extended an existing knowledge transfer framework
and employed a semi-automated evaluation pipeline to assess differences in
knowledge transfer episodes across both settings. We found a similar frequency
of successful knowledge transfer episodes and overlapping topical categories
across both settings. Two of our key findings are that developers tend to
accept GitHub Copilot's suggestions with less scrutiny than those from human
pair programming partners, but also that GitHub Copilot can subtly remind
developers of important code details they might otherwise overlook.

*Zanis Ali Khan,Aayush Garg,Qiang Tang*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper examines the use of pre-trained language models CodeBERT and CodeT5 for automated vulnerability patching, revealing nuances in their effectiveness and scalability across datasets and programming languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the underexplored area of automated vulnerability patching using advanced pre-trained language models and improve software security.

Method: The study applies CodeBERT and CodeT5 to six datasets in four languages, including evaluations of fine-tuned models. Performance is analyzed for trained and unseen datasets.

Result: CodeT5 showed superior scalability and complexity handling, while CodeBERT performed better in fragmented contexts. Fine-tuning improved trained dataset performance but models struggled with generalization to unseen data.

Conclusion: Benchmarking these models highlights current limitations, particularly in generalization, and offers insights for improving automated vulnerability patching for practical security applications.

Abstract: Software vulnerabilities pose significant security threats, requiring
effective mitigation. While Automated Program Repair (APR) has advanced in
fixing general bugs, vulnerability patching, a security-critical aspect of APR
remains underexplored. This study investigates pre-trained language models,
CodeBERT and CodeT5, for automated vulnerability patching across six datasets
and four languages. We evaluate their accuracy and generalization to unknown
vulnerabilities. Results show that while both models face challenges with
fragmented or sparse context, CodeBERT performs comparatively better in such
scenarios, whereas CodeT5 excels in capturing complex vulnerability patterns.
CodeT5 also demonstrates superior scalability. Furthermore, we test fine-tuned
models on both in-distribution (trained) and out-of-distribution (unseen)
datasets. While fine-tuning improves in-distribution performance, models
struggle to generalize to unseen data, highlighting challenges in robust
vulnerability detection. This study benchmarks model performance, identifies
limitations in generalization, and provides actionable insights to advance
automated vulnerability patching for real-world security applications.

*Yixuan Cao,Yuhong Feng,Huafeng Li,Chongyi Huang,Fangcao Jian,Haoran Li,Xu Wang*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Tech-ASan is introduced as an optimized tool for detecting memory safety violations, reducing runtime overhead by over 33% compared to standard Address Sanitizer (ASan) without compromising detection capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the significant runtime overhead caused by Address Sanitizer (ASan), which limits its ability to efficiently detect memory safety issues in large-scale software. Existing methods fail to either effectively eliminate redundant checks or retain detection accuracy.

Method: The paper introduces Tech-ASan, incorporating a two-stage check mechanism using magic value comparison to reduce shadow memory access costs, an optimizer to eliminate redundant checks (e.g., in loops), and implementation on LLVM compiler infrastructure.

Result: Tech-ASan achieves 33.70% less runtime overhead than ASan and 17.89% better performance than ASan--. It also detects 56 fewer false negative cases compared to these tools when evaluated on the Juliet Test Suite.

Conclusion: Tech-ASan is a substantial improvement over existing sanitization techniques, maintaining robust detection while significantly reducing runtime overhead, making it a practical solution for large software applications.

Abstract: Address Sanitizer (ASan) is a sharp weapon for detecting memory safety
violations, including temporal and spatial errors hidden in C/C++ programs
during execution. However, ASan incurs significant runtime overhead, which
limits its efficiency in testing large software. The overhead mainly comes from
sanitizer checks due to the frequent and expensive shadow memory access. Over
the past decade, many methods have been developed to speed up ASan by
eliminating and accelerating sanitizer checks, however, they either fail to
adequately eliminate redundant checks or compromise detection capabilities. To
address this issue, this paper presents Tech-ASan, a two-stage check based
technique to accelerate ASan with safety assurance. First, we propose a novel
two-stage check algorithm for ASan, which leverages magic value comparison to
reduce most of the costly shadow memory accesses. Second, we design an
efficient optimizer to eliminate redundant checks, which integrates a novel
algorithm for removing checks in loops. Third, we implement Tech-ASan as a
memory safety tool based on the LLVM compiler infrastructure. Our evaluation
using the SPEC CPU2006 benchmark shows that Tech-ASan outperforms the
state-of-the-art methods with 33.70% and 17.89% less runtime overhead than ASan
and ASan--, respectively. Moreover, Tech-ASan detects 56 fewer false negative
cases than ASan and ASan-- when testing on the Juliet Test Suite under the same
redzone setting.

*Shengcheng Yu,Yuchen Ling,Chunrong Fang,Quan Zhou,Chunyang Chen,Shaomin Zhu,Zhenyu Chen*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: ScenGen is a novel approach using LLMs and multi-agent collaboration to generate scenario-based GUI tests, bridging the gap between automated GUI testing and app business logic.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual GUI testing is scenario-based, but automated testing often fails to align with app business logic and misses testing critical functionalities. The paper aims to address this gap by leveraging LLMs.

Method: The authors introduce ScenGen, which employs five collaborative agents, each responsible for phases of a manual testing process, supported by LLMs for understanding GUI semantics and generating tests.

Result: Experimental evaluation demonstrates that ScenGen effectively produces scenario-based GUI tests, guided by LLMs, with improved traceability and bug monitoring.

Conclusion: ScenGen successfully addresses gaps in automated GUI testing, aligning tests with business logic to ensure critical app functionalities are thoroughly assessed.

Abstract: The assurance of mobile app GUI is more and more significant. Automated GUI
testing approaches of different strategies have been developed, while there are
still huge gaps between the approaches and the app business logic, not taking
the completion of specific testing scenarios as the exploration target, leading
to the exploration missing of critical app functionalities. Learning from the
manual testing, which takes testing scenarios with app business logic as the
basic granularity, in this paper, we utilize the LLMs to understand the
semantics presented in app GUI and how they are mapped in the testing context
based on specific testing scenarios. Then, scenario-based GUI tests are
generated with the guidance of multi-agent collaboration. Specifically, we
propose ScenGen, a novel LLM-guided scenario-based GUI testing approach
involving five agents to respectively take responsibilities of different phases
of the manual testing process. The Observer perceives the app GUI state by
extracting GUI widgets and forming GUI layouts, understanding the expressed
semantics. Then the app GUI info is sent to the Decider to make decisions on
target widgets based on the target testing scenarios. The decision-making
process takes the completion of specific testing scenarios as the exploration
target. The Executor then executes the demanding operations on the apps. The
execution results are checked by the Supervisor on whether the generated tests
are consistent with the completion target of the testing scenarios, ensuring
the traceability of the test generation and execution. Furthermore, the
corresponding GUI test operations are recorded to the context memory by
Recorder as an important basis for further decision-making, meanwhile
monitoring the runtime bug occurrences. ScenGen is evaluated and the results
show that ScenGen can effectively generate scenario-based GUI tests guided by
LLMs.

TL;DR: This paper presents the GAIN model, a neural network framework that uses a grid-based structure for improved biological plausibility and computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a biologically plausible neural network model that enhances neuron interactions and is computationally efficient for neuroscience simulations.

Method: The GAIN model employs a grid-based structure and integrates the Izhikevich model to simulate neuron behavior in a manner consistent with biological neurons.

Result: The grid-based adaptation enhances neuron connectivity and dynamics, producing accurate and computationally efficient simulations.

Conclusion: By adapting the Izhikevich model with a grid structure, the GAIN model provides a balance of biological accuracy and efficiency, making it useful for neural networks and neuroscience research.

Abstract: While many neural networks focus on layers to process information, the GAIN
model uses a grid-based structure to improve biological plausibility and the
dynamics of the model. The grid structure helps neurons to interact with their
closest neighbors and improve their connections with one another, which is seen
in biological neurons. While also being implemented with the Izhikevich model
this approach allows for a computationally efficient and biologically accurate
simulation that can aid in the development of neural networks, large scale
simulations, and the development in the neuroscience field. This adaptation of
the Izhikevich model can improve the dynamics and accuracy of the model,
allowing for its uses to be specialized but efficient.

*Vardhan Palod,Pranav Mahajan,Veeky Baths,Boris S. Gutkin*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: This paper builds on a hierarchical reinforcement learning framework to establish addiction as a disorder of decision-making, linking temporal discounting and compulsive drug-seeking behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the cognitive-behavioral conflict in addiction and the neurobiological mechanisms driving compulsive drug-seeking behavior.

Method: The paper integrates temporal discounting into a hierarchical reinforcement learning framework, modeling addiction by simulating how drug versus natural rewards impact decision-making.

Result: High temporal discounting increases drug-seeking behavior, correlating impulsivity and addiction severity. The model aligns with empirical evidence and provides testable predictions.

Conclusion: Addiction is modeled as a hierarchical decision-making disorder, with temporal discounting playing a critical role in compulsive behavior and addiction severity.

Abstract: Despite a strong desire to quit, individuals with long-term substance use
disorder (SUD) often struggle to resist drug use, even when aware of its
harmful consequences. This disconnect between knowledge and compulsive behavior
reflects a fundamental cognitive-behavioral conflict in addiction.
Neurobiologically, differential cue-induced activity within striatal
subregions, along with dopamine-mediated connectivity from the ventral to the
dorsal striatum, contributes to compulsive drug-seeking. However, the
functional mechanism linking these findings to behavioral conflict remains
unclear. Another hallmark of addiction is temporal discounting: individuals
with drug dependence exhibit steeper discount rates than non-users. Assuming
the ventral-dorsal striatal organization reflects a gradient from cognitive to
motor representations, addiction can be modeled within a hierarchical
reinforcement learning (HRL) framework. However, integrating discounting into
biologically grounded HRL remains an open challenge. In this work, we build on
a model showing how action choices reinforced with drug rewards become
insensitive to the negative consequences that follow. We address the
integration of discounting by ensuring natural reward values converge across
all levels in the HRL hierarchy, while drug rewards diverge due to their
dopaminergic effects. Our results show that high discounting amplifies
drug-seeking across the hierarchy, linking faster discounting with increased
addiction severity and impulsivity. We demonstrate alignment with empirical
findings on temporal discounting and propose testable predictions, establishing
addiction as a disorder of hierarchical decision-making.

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: This paper explores measurement-induced phase transitions (MIPT) in cognitive networks and their relevance to mental learnability transitions during consciousness development.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the role of MIPT in cognitive networks, specifically in the transition between newborn and adult consciousness.

Method: Formulation of a probe-target framework where concepts in semantic memory act as sites in cognitive networks, and comparison with synchronization phase transitions.

Result: The study links measurement-induced transitions to learnability states in semantic memory networks, providing insights into consciousness formation.

Conclusion: MIPT might govern critical transitions in cognitive processes, suggesting its importance in understanding consciousness evolution from newborn to adult.

Abstract: The measurement-induced phase transition (MIPT) is a recently formulated
phenomenon in out-of-equilibrium systems. The competition between unitary
evolutions and measurement-induced non-unitaries leads to the transition
between the entangled and disentangled phases at some critical measurement
rate. We conjecture that self-organized MIPT plays a key role in the generative
model of cognitive networks and the formation of the state of consciousness in
the "newborn-adult" transition. To this aim, we formulate the probe-target
picture for the brain and suggest that MIPT interpreted as learnability
transition takes place in the mental part of the target where the sites in the
cognitive networks of semantic memory are concepts. Comparison with the
synchronization phase transitions in the probe is made.

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: The paper introduces TRACE, a new contrastive learning framework tailored for neural time series, utilizing trial averaging to improve representation clarity and outperform existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing contrastive learning methods for neural time series, which rely on generic augmentations and fail to exploit multi-trial structures in neural datasets.

Method: Introduce TRACE, a framework that averages subsets of trials to create positive pairs and learns a two-dimensional embedding by combining contrastive and neighbor embedding techniques.

Result: TRACE demonstrates superior performance in distinguishing fine response differences on simulated data and captures biologically relevant features, cluster structures, and facilitates quality control in in vivo recordings.

Conclusion: TRACE effectively leverages trial structures in neural datasets, providing a powerful tool for fine-grained representation of neural responses, with practical applications in biological research and data quality assessment.

Abstract: Modern neural recording techniques such as two-photon imaging allow to
acquire vast time-series datasets with responses of hundreds or thousands of
neurons. Contrastive learning is a powerful self-supervised framework for
learning representations of complex datasets. Existing applications for neural
time series rely on generic data augmentations and do not exploit the
multi-trial data structure inherent in many neural datasets. Here we present
TRACE, a new contrastive learning framework that averages across different
subsets of trials to generate positive pairs. TRACE allows to directly learn a
two-dimensional embedding, combining ideas from contrastive learning and
neighbor embeddings. We show that TRACE outperforms other methods, resolving
fine response differences in simulated data. Further, using in vivo recordings,
we show that the representations learned by TRACE capture both biologically
relevant continuous variation, cell-type-related cluster structure, and can
assist data quality control.

*Shujun Zhou,Guozhang Chen*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: The paper discusses a theoretical framework explaining the gradient of place field sizes along the hippocampus dorsal-ventral axis based on grid cell population activity interpretations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how the hippocampal place field gradient emerges from discrete grid cell inputs and its functional implications for learning.

Method: A theoretical framework based on linear projections and eigenmodes of grid cell activity, combined with mathematical analysis and simulations.

Result: The framework explains the transformation of discrete grid module inputs into a continuous spectrum of place field sizes, revealing an optimal size for efficient learning depending on environment structure.

Conclusion: The study bridges anatomical connectivity with adaptive learning mechanisms in biological and artificial systems, offering testable predictions about hippocampal function.

Abstract: The hippocampus encodes space through a striking gradient of place field
sizes along its dorsal-ventral axis, yet the principles generating this
continuous gradient from discrete grid cell inputs remain debated. We propose a
unified theoretical framework establishing that hippocampal place fields arise
naturally as linear projections of grid cell population activity, interpretable
as eigenmodes. Critically, we demonstrate that a frequency-dependent decay of
these grid-to-place connection weights naturally transforms inputs from
discrete grid modules into a continuous spectrum of place field sizes. This
multiscale organization is functionally significant: we reveal it shapes the
inductive bias of the population code, balancing a fundamental trade-off
between precision and generalization. Mathematical analysis and simulations
demonstrate an optimal place field size for few-shot learning, which scales
with environment structure. Our results offer a principled explanation for the
place field gradient and generate testable predictions, bridging anatomical
connectivity with adaptive learning in both biological and artificial
intelligence.

### [440] [Generalizable, real-time neural decoding with hybrid state-space models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05320)
*Avery Hee-Woon Ryoo,Nanda H. Krishna,Ximeng Mao,Mehdi Azabou,Eva L. Dyer,Matthew G. Perich,Guillaume Lajoie*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: The paper introduces POSSM, a hybrid neural decoding architecture, achieving high accuracy and efficiency in real-time neural prediction tasks, outperforming Transformers in speed and cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for real-time neural decoding either lack generalization (e.g., RNNs) or are computationally too demanding for low-resource settings (e.g., Transformers).

Method: The paper proposes POSSM, which combines spike tokenization via cross-attention with a recurrent state-space model (SSM), enabling efficient decoding and generalization through multi-dataset pretraining.

Result: POSSM achieves comparable performance to cutting-edge Transformers in neural decoding while being significantly faster (up to 9x on GPU) and cost-efficient. Cross-species transfer was also demonstrated.

Conclusion: Hybrid SSM architectures like POSSM show promise in achieving a balance between accuracy, inference speed, and generalization in real-time neural decoders.

Abstract: Real-time decoding of neural activity is central to neuroscience and
neurotechnology applications, from closed-loop experiments to brain-computer
interfaces, where models are subject to strict latency constraints. Traditional
methods, including simple recurrent neural networks, are fast and lightweight
but often struggle to generalize to unseen data. In contrast, recent
Transformer-based approaches leverage large-scale pretraining for strong
generalization performance, but typically have much larger computational
requirements and are not always suitable for low-resource or real-time
settings. To address these shortcomings, we present POSSM, a novel hybrid
architecture that combines individual spike tokenization via a cross-attention
module with a recurrent state-space model (SSM) backbone to enable (1) fast and
causal online prediction on neural activity and (2) efficient generalization to
new sessions, individuals, and tasks through multi-dataset pretraining. We
evaluate POSSM's decoding performance and inference speed on intracortical
decoding of monkey motor tasks, and show that it extends to clinical
applications, namely handwriting and speech decoding in human subjects.
Notably, we demonstrate that pretraining on monkey motor-cortical recordings
improves decoding performance on the human handwriting task, highlighting the
exciting potential for cross-species transfer. In all of these tasks, we find
that POSSM achieves decoding accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art
Transformers, at a fraction of the inference cost (up to 9x faster on GPU).
These results suggest that hybrid SSMs are a promising approach to bridging the
gap between accuracy, inference speed, and generalization when training neural
decoders for real-time, closed-loop applications.

*Nina Vesseron,Elsa Cazelles,Alice Le Brigant,Thierry Klein*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper develops a Geodesic PCA method using Otto-Wasserstein geometry for analyzing probability distributions, addressing both Gaussian distributions and absolutely continuous ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To capture the modes of variation in probability distribution datasets by identifying geodesic curves in Wasserstein space.

Method: The paper first focuses on Gaussian distributions with invertible linear maps and extends to general probability measures using neural network-based geodesic parameterization.

Result: It demonstrates the capability of the method through comparisons with classical tangent PCA and provides real-world dataset illustrations.

Conclusion: GPCA based on Otto-Wasserstein geometry outperforms traditional PCA approaches and offers effective analysis for probability distributions.

Abstract: This paper focuses on Geodesic Principal Component Analysis (GPCA) on a
collection of probability distributions using the Otto-Wasserstein geometry.
The goal is to identify geodesic curves in the space of probability measures
that best capture the modes of variation of the underlying dataset. We first
address the case of a collection of Gaussian distributions, and show how to
lift the computations in the space of invertible linear maps. For the more
general setting of absolutely continuous probability measures, we leverage a
novel approach to parameterizing geodesics in Wasserstein space with neural
networks. Finally, we compare to classical tangent PCA through various examples
and provide illustrations on real-world datasets.

*Haochen Zhang,Zhong Zheng,Lingzhou Xue*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper introduces two new algorithms for single-agent and federated reinforcement learning, achieving optimal regret, low burn-in costs, and minimal switching or communication costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the costly data collection and policy deployment in RL, especially minimizing sample usage in achieving optimal performance and reducing communication/switching overhead.

Method: Two model-free RL algorithms, Q-EarlySettled-LowCost and FedQ-EarlySettled-LowCost, are designed to enhance efficiency in burn-in, policy-switching, and regret performance.

Result: The proposed algorithms achieve near-optimal regret, with burn-in costs scaling linearly with state and action dimensions, and logarithmic switching/communication costs, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: The developed algorithms set new benchmarks for model-free RL and federated RL by improving efficiency while maintaining strong theoretical guarantees for regret and cost reductions.

Abstract: Motivated by real-world settings where data collection and policy deployment
-- whether for a single agent or across multiple agents -- are costly, we study
the problem of on-policy single-agent reinforcement learning (RL) and federated
RL (FRL) with a focus on minimizing burn-in costs (the sample sizes needed to
reach near-optimal regret) and policy switching or communication costs. In
parallel finite-horizon episodic Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) with $S$
states and $A$ actions, existing methods either require superlinear burn-in
costs in $S$ and $A$ or fail to achieve logarithmic switching or communication
costs. We propose two novel model-free RL algorithms -- Q-EarlySettled-LowCost
and FedQ-EarlySettled-LowCost -- that are the first in the literature to
simultaneously achieve: (i) the best near-optimal regret among all known
model-free RL or FRL algorithms, (ii) low burn-in cost that scales linearly
with $S$ and $A$, and (iii) logarithmic policy switching cost for single-agent
RL or communication cost for FRL. Additionally, we establish gap-dependent
theoretical guarantees for both regret and switching/communication costs,
improving or matching the best-known gap-dependent bounds.

### [443] [Distributional encoding for Gaussian process regression with qualitative inputs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04813)
*Sébastien Da Veiga*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper proposes a generalization of target encoding for handling categorical inputs in Gaussian Process (GP) regression, leveraging distributional encoding based on advanced kernel methods. It demonstrates state-of-the-art predictive performance across datasets and discusses applications to Bayesian optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Gaussian Process regression struggles to handle categorical inputs effectively, which limits its applicability in both engineering and Bayesian optimization contexts.

Method: The authors introduce distributional encoding (DE), which uses all samples of a target category, integrating it into GP using characteristic kernels derived from the maximum mean discrepancy and Wasserstein distance.

Result: The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art predictive performance on synthetic and real-world datasets. Extensions for classification, multi-task learning, and auxiliary information usage are also discussed.

Conclusion: Distributional encoding significantly enhances the ability of Gaussian Process regression to handle categorical inputs, making it highly practical for tasks in Bayesian optimization and other domains.

Abstract: Gaussian Process (GP) regression is a popular and sample-efficient approach
for many engineering applications, where observations are expensive to acquire,
and is also a central ingredient of Bayesian optimization (BO), a highly
prevailing method for the optimization of black-box functions. However, when
all or some input variables are categorical, building a predictive and
computationally efficient GP remains challenging. Starting from the naive
target encoding idea, where the original categorical values are replaced with
the mean of the target variable for that category, we propose a generalization
based on distributional encoding (DE) which makes use of all samples of the
target variable for a category. To handle this type of encoding inside the GP,
we build upon recent results on characteristic kernels for probability
distributions, based on the maximum mean discrepancy and the Wasserstein
distance. We also discuss several extensions for classification, multi-task
learning and incorporation or auxiliary information. Our approach is validated
empirically, and we demonstrate state-of-the-art predictive performance on a
variety of synthetic and real-world datasets. DE is naturally complementary to
recent advances in BO over discrete and mixed-spaces.

*Armin Kekić,Sergio Hernan Garrido Mejia,Bernhard Schölkopf*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper presents a method to estimate causal effects of joint interventions on multiple variables using only observational data and single-variable interventions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Obtaining data from simultaneous interventions is often challenging, so the study aims to address whether joint interventional effects can be inferred solely using observational and single-variable interventional data.

Method: The authors provide an identifiability result for a class of nonlinear additive outcome mechanisms and propose a practical estimator that separates causal effects into confounded and unconfounded contributions for each intervention variable.

Result: The proposed method demonstrates performance comparable to models trained on joint interventional data, outperforming purely observational estimators in experiments using synthetic data.

Conclusion: The study shows that estimating joint interventional effects is feasible without joint interventional data, offering a pathway for more practical causal inference in complex settings.

Abstract: Estimating causal effects of joint interventions on multiple variables is
crucial in many domains, but obtaining data from such simultaneous
interventions can be challenging. Our study explores how to learn joint
interventional effects using only observational data and single-variable
interventions. We present an identifiability result for this problem, showing
that for a class of nonlinear additive outcome mechanisms, joint effects can be
inferred without access to joint interventional data. We propose a practical
estimator that decomposes the causal effect into confounded and unconfounded
contributions for each intervention variable. Experiments on synthetic data
demonstrate that our method achieves performance comparable to models trained
directly on joint interventional data, outperforming a purely observational
estimator.

*Konstantin Göbler,Tobias Windisch,Mathias Drton*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel method to infer cause-effect relationships within groups of variables using random vectors, extending existing models and demonstrating efficacy through simulations and real-world applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the need to address causal inference in domains like neuroscience, psychology, and industrial manufacturing, where causal units involve groups of variables rather than single scalar measurements.

Method: The method involves extending nonlinear additive noise models to work with random vectors and establishing a two-step causal graph learning approach: first inferring causal order and then performing model selection within the order.

Result: The authors demonstrate strong performance through simulations and successfully apply the methodology to real-world assembly line data with partial causal ordering knowledge.

Conclusion: Their approach provides a robust solution for vector-based causal inference, showcasing its potential in practical and complex scenarios requiring analysis of grouped variables.

Abstract: Inferring cause-effect relationships from observational data has gained
significant attention in recent years, but most methods are limited to scalar
random variables. In many important domains, including neuroscience,
psychology, social science, and industrial manufacturing, the causal units of
interest are groups of variables rather than individual scalar measurements.
Motivated by these applications, we extend nonlinear additive noise models to
handle random vectors, establishing a two-step approach for causal graph
learning: First, infer the causal order among random vectors. Second, perform
model selection to identify the best graph consistent with this order. We
introduce effective and novel solutions for both steps in the vector case,
demonstrating strong performance in simulations. Finally, we apply our method
to real-world assembly line data with partial knowledge of causal ordering
among variable groups.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper explores causal effect identification in latent variable Linear Non-Gaussian Acyclic Models using higher-order cumulants and provides methods for scenarios with limited proxy or instrumental variables.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Latent confounding often complicates causal inference, especially under setups with limited proxies or underspecified instrumental variables, creating a need for new methods to ensure reliable causal effect identification.

Method: The study employs higher-order cumulants to address challenges in latent variable Linear Non-Gaussian Acyclic Models, proving identifiability and proposing estimation methods for scenarios with limited proxies or instruments.

Result: The experimental results show the proposed methods are accurate and robust, exceeding the performance of existing approaches.

Conclusion: This paper contributes theoretical and practical advancements to causal inference in systems with latent confounders, particularly in challenging scenarios with limited informational resources.

Abstract: This paper investigates causal effect identification in latent variable
Linear Non-Gaussian Acyclic Models (lvLiNGAM) using higher-order cumulants,
addressing two prominent setups that are challenging in the presence of latent
confounding: (1) a single proxy variable that may causally influence the
treatment and (2) underspecified instrumental variable cases where fewer
instruments exist than treatments. We prove that causal effects are
identifiable with a single proxy or instrument and provide corresponding
estimation methods. Experimental results demonstrate the accuracy and
robustness of our approaches compared to existing methods, advancing the
theoretical and practical understanding of causal inference in linear systems
with latent confounders.

### [447] [Admissibility of Completely Randomized Trials: A Large-Deviation Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05329)
*Guido Imbens,Chao Qin,Stefan Wager*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper demonstrates that adaptive trial designs, specifically batched arm elimination designs, universally outperform non-adaptive, completely randomized trials in best-arm identification problems with three or more treatment arms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address whether experimenters should choose non-adaptive trials when an adaptive option is available, particularly in the context of identifying the most effective treatment arm.

Method: The paper studies the statistical efficiency of batched arm elimination designs, which eliminate weaker arms in predefined intervals, and compares them to non-adaptive randomized trials using a metric called efficiency exponent.

Result: Adaptive batched arm elimination designs were shown to universally and strictly dominate non-adaptive randomized trials when there are three or more treatment arms.

Conclusion: Experimenters should prefer adaptive designs over non-adaptive randomized trials for better results in best-arm identification problems with multiple treatments.

Abstract: When an experimenter has the option of running an adaptive trial, is it
admissible to ignore this option and run a non-adaptive trial instead? We
provide a negative answer to this question in the best-arm identification
problem, where the experimenter aims to allocate measurement efforts
judiciously to confidently deploy the most effective treatment arm. We find
that, whenever there are at least three treatment arms, there exist simple
adaptive designs that universally and strictly dominate non-adaptive completely
randomized trials. This dominance is characterized by a notion called
efficiency exponent, which quantifies a design's statistical efficiency when
the experimental sample is large. Our analysis focuses on the class of batched
arm elimination designs, which progressively eliminate underperforming arms at
pre-specified batch intervals. We characterize simple sufficient conditions
under which these designs universally and strictly dominate completely
randomized trials. These results resolve the second open problem posed in Qin
[2022].

### [448] [An Expansion-Based Approach for Quantified Integer Programming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04452)
*Michael Hartisch,Leroy Chew*

Main category: cs.DM

TL;DR: The paper introduces Quantified Integer Programming (QIP), extending QBF to handle integer variables and optimization under uncertainty. It proposes a new expansion-based method for solving QIP using CEGAR, outperforming traditional search-based methods and state-of-the-art QBF solvers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for a versatile framework to efficiently model and solve multistage robust discrete optimization problems under uncertainty, extending prior methods in QBF to integer programming challenges.

Method: The paper introduces an expansion-based approach for solving QIP using Counterexample-Guided Abstraction Refinement (CEGAR), adapting existing techniques from QBF. This methodology is embedded in an optimization framework.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate superior performance of the proposed expansion-based solver for QIP compared to search-based methods, and show that linear constraint modeling achieves better results than state-of-the-art QBF solvers.

Conclusion: The expansion-based approach for QIP broadens the applicability and efficiency of solving robust optimization problems, offering significant performance gains and establishing a more generalized framework compared to QBF and prior QIP methods.

Abstract: Quantified Integer Programming (QIP) bridges multiple domains by extending
Quantified Boolean Formulas (QBF) to incorporate general integer variables and
linear constraints while also generalizing Integer Programming through variable
quantification. As a special case of Quantified Constraint Satisfaction
Problems (QCSP), QIP provides a versatile framework for addressing complex
decision-making scenarios. Additionally, the inclusion of a linear objective
function enables QIP to effectively model multistage robust discrete linear
optimization problems, making it a powerful tool for tackling uncertainty in
optimization.
  While two primary solution paradigms exist for QBF -- search-based and
expansion-based approaches -- only search-based methods have been explored for
QIP and QCSP. We introduce an expansion-based approach for QIP using
Counterexample-Guided Abstraction Refinement (CEGAR), adapting techniques from
QBF. We extend this methodology to tackle multistage robust discrete
optimization problems with linear constraints and further embed it in an
optimization framework, enhancing its applicability. Our experimental results
highlight the advantages of this approach, demonstrating superior performance
over existing search-based solvers for QIP in specific instances. Furthermore,
the ability to model problems using linear constraints enables notable
performance gains over state-of-the-art expansion-based solvers for QBF.

TL;DR: This paper systematically reviews 60 research papers (2020-2025) on using Large Language Models (LLMs) in credit risk assessment, presenting a taxonomy focused on model architectures, data types, explainability mechanisms, and applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the growing potential of LLMs in financial applications, specifically credit risk assessment, and to provide an organized reference for researchers in AI and finance.

Method: The study conducted a systematic review using the PRISMA strategy, focused on relevant literature, and categorized key insights into a taxonomy based on four domains: model architecture, data types, explainability mechanisms, and application areas.

Result: The paper identifies insights from 60 studies, organizes them into a comprehensive taxonomy, and examines trends and gaps in LLM-based credit risk applications.

Conclusion: The research underscores the importance of interpretability in LLM-based credit risk models and offers a roadmap for future research in this interdisciplinary domain.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLM), which have developed in recent years, enable
credit risk assessment through the analysis of financial texts such as analyst
reports and corporate disclosures. This paper presents the first systematic
review and taxonomy focusing on LLMbased approaches in credit risk estimation.
We determined the basic model architectures by selecting 60 relevant papers
published between 2020-2025 with the PRISMA research strategy. And we examined
the data used for scenarios such as credit default prediction and risk
analysis. Since the main focus of the paper is interpretability, we classify
concepts such as explainability mechanisms, chain of thought prompts and
natural language justifications for LLM-based credit models. The taxonomy
organizes the literature under four main headings: model architectures, data
types, explainability mechanisms and application areas. Based on this analysis,
we highlight the main future trends and research gaps for LLM-based credit
scoring systems. This paper aims to be a reference paper for artificial

TL;DR: The paper presents a deep learning method to improve solar atmosphere imaging by reconstructing high-quality images from multiple degraded ones in real-time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle the limitations of current image reconstruction methods for solar telescopes that struggle with atmospheric turbulence and high computational demands.

Method: A deep learning-based approach using unpaired image-to-image translation, trained on degraded image bursts with speckle reconstructions as references.

Result: The proposed method demonstrates enhanced robustness and perceptual quality, especially when speckle reconstructions have artifacts, and performs best with full image bursts.

Conclusion: The approach achieves efficient real-time image correction for solar atmospheric observations, offering improved image quality and computational efficiency compared to traditional methods.

Abstract: Large aperture ground based solar telescopes allow the solar atmosphere to be
resolved in unprecedented detail. However, observations are limited by Earths
turbulent atmosphere, requiring post image corrections. Current reconstruction
methods using short exposure bursts face challenges with strong turbulence and
high computational costs. We introduce a deep learning approach that
reconstructs 100 short exposure images into one high quality image in real
time. Using unpaired image to image translation, our model is trained on
degraded bursts with speckle reconstructions as references, improving
robustness and generalization. Our method shows an improved robustness in terms
of perceptual quality, especially when speckle reconstructions show artifacts.
An evaluation with a varying number of images per burst demonstrates that our
method makes efficient use of the combined image information and achieves the
best reconstructions when provided with the full image burst.

Main category: physics.med-ph

TL;DR: The paper proposes a diffusion transformer framework for denoising low-statistics Monte Carlo dose maps, facilitating faster and accurate dose calculations in intensity-modulated proton therapy (IMPT).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: IMPT ensures precise tumor coverage and spares nearby organs, but its sensitivity to anatomical changes necessitates frequent dose recalculations. Fast and accurate Monte Carlo (MC) simulations are required, and a way to optimize their speed without sacrificing accuracy is needed.

Method: The authors used a diffusion transformer-based denoising framework trained on noisy dose maps and CT images from 80 head and neck patients, comparing the results against high-statistics dose maps generated using MCsquare software. Testing leveraged cases from diverse disease sites (H&N, lung, breast, prostate) with various metrics like MAE, Gamma passing rate, and DVH indices.

Result: The model achieved high accuracy, with low mean absolute error (MAE), Gamma passing rates above 92% (3%/2mm), and dose-volume histogram (DVH) indices that closely aligned with high-statistics ground truth values across multiple disease sites.

Conclusion: The diffusion transformer-based denoising model effectively accelerates Monte Carlo dose calculations while maintaining high-quality outputs. Despite being trained only on H&N data, it performs well across other disease sites, showing its potential for wide applicability in adaptive radiation therapy.

Abstract: Purpose: Intensity-modulated proton therapy (IMPT) offers precise tumor
coverage while sparing organs at risk (OARs) in head and neck (H&N) cancer.
However, its sensitivity to anatomical changes requires frequent adaptation
through online adaptive radiation therapy (oART), which depends on fast,
accurate dose calculation via Monte Carlo (MC) simulations. Reducing particle
count accelerates MC but degrades accuracy. To address this, denoising
low-statistics MC dose maps is proposed to enable fast, high-quality dose
generation.
  Methods: We developed a diffusion transformer-based denoising framework. IMPT
plans and 3D CT images from 80 H&N patients were used to generate noisy and
high-statistics dose maps using MCsquare (1 min and 10 min per plan,
respectively). Data were standardized into uniform chunks with zero-padding,
normalized, and transformed into quasi-Gaussian distributions. Testing was done
on 10 H&N, 10 lung, 10 breast, and 10 prostate cancer cases, preprocessed
identically. The model was trained with noisy dose maps and CT images as input
and high-statistics dose maps as ground truth, using a combined loss of mean
square error (MSE), residual loss, and regional MAE (focusing on top/bottom 10%
dose voxels). Performance was assessed via MAE, 3D Gamma passing rate, and DVH
indices.
  Results: The model achieved MAEs of 0.195 (H&N), 0.120 (lung), 0.172
(breast), and 0.376 Gy[RBE] (prostate). 3D Gamma passing rates exceeded 92%
(3%/2mm) across all sites. DVH indices for clinical target volumes (CTVs) and
OARs closely matched the ground truth.
  Conclusion: A diffusion transformer-based denoising framework was developed
and, though trained only on H&N data, generalizes well across multiple disease
sites.

Main category: math.ST

TL;DR: The authors introduce kTULA, a tamed Langevin dynamics algorithm to sample distributions with super-linearly growing log-gradients, improving non-asymptotic convergence bounds and proving its efficiency in real-world problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional Langevin dynamics struggle with sampling distributions that lack global Lipschitz continuity, which is common in deep learning scenarios.

Method: The paper proposes kTULA, which modifies existing Langevin dynamics with novel taming techniques and establishes theoretical bounds, including improved Kullback-Leibler convergence rates.

Result: The proposed kTULA algorithm achieves an improved convergence rate of $2-\overline{\epsilon}$ in KL divergence, yielding better error bounds in Wasserstein-2 distance and validating its performance in sampling and optimization tasks.

Conclusion: kTULA offers a theoretically sound, efficient approach for challenging sampling and optimization tasks, bridging a gap in algorithms that traditionally depend on strict smoothness conditions.

Abstract: Motivated by applications in deep learning, where the global Lipschitz
continuity condition is often not satisfied, we examine the problem of sampling
from distributions with super-linearly growing log-gradients. We propose a
novel tamed Langevin dynamics-based algorithm, called kTULA, to solve the
aforementioned sampling problem, and provide a theoretical guarantee for its
performance. More precisely, we establish a non-asymptotic convergence bound in
Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence with the best-known rate of convergence equal
to $2-\overline{\epsilon}$, $\overline{\epsilon}>0$, which significantly
improves relevant results in existing literature. This enables us to obtain an
improved non-asymptotic error bound in Wasserstein-2 distance, which can be
used to further derive a non-asymptotic guarantee for kTULA to solve the
associated optimization problems. To illustrate the applicability of kTULA, we
apply the proposed algorithm to the problem of sampling from a high-dimensional
double-well potential distribution and to an optimization problem involving a
neural network. We show that our main results can be used to provide
theoretical guarantees for the performance of kTULA.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual segmentation in medical imaging is highly labor-intensive, creating a need for improved workflows that alleviate this effort.

Method: The study developed a customizable XR-based platform, using the Meta Quest 3 and Logitech MX Ink stylus, and evaluated it through user studies with a craniofacial CT dataset.

Result: The XR-based tool achieved a System Usability Scale score of 66, demonstrated intuitive controls, and reduced cognitive load compared to traditional tools.

Conclusion: The XR-stylus tool shows promise for medical segmentation, with potential to improve with refinements in precision, error handling, and workflow personalization.

Abstract: Medical imaging segmentation is essential in clinical settings for diagnosing
diseases, planning surgeries, and other procedures. However, manual annotation
is a cumbersome and effortful task. To mitigate these aspects, this study
implements and evaluates the usability and clinical applicability of an
extended reality (XR)-based segmentation tool for anatomical CT scans, using
the Meta Quest 3 headset and Logitech MX Ink stylus. We develop an immersive
interface enabling real-time interaction with 2D and 3D medical imaging data in
a customizable workspace designed to mitigate workflow fragmentation and
cognitive demands inherent to conventional manual segmentation tools. The
platform combines stylus-driven annotation, mirroring traditional pen-on-paper
workflows, with instant 3D volumetric rendering. A user study with a public
craniofacial CT dataset demonstrated the tool's foundational viability,
achieving a System Usability Scale (SUS) score of 66, within the expected range
for medical applications. Participants highlighted the system's intuitive
controls (scoring 4.1/5 for self-descriptiveness on ISONORM metrics) and
spatial interaction design, with qualitative feedback highlighting strengths in
hybrid 2D/3D navigation and realistic stylus ergonomics. While users identified
opportunities to enhance task-specific precision and error management, the
platform's core workflow enabled dynamic slice adjustment, reducing cognitive
load compared to desktop tools. Results position the XR-stylus paradigm as a
promising foundation for immersive segmentation tools, with iterative
refinements targeting haptic feedback calibration and workflow personalization
to advance adoption in preoperative planning.

Conclusion: The study underscores the promise of immersive cinematic rendering in enhancing medical imaging practices.

Abstract: As one of the first research teams with full access to Siemens' Cinematic
Reality, we evaluate its usability and clinical potential for cinematic volume
rendering on the Apple Vision Pro. We visualized venous-phase liver computed
tomography and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography scans from the CHAOS
and MRCP\_DLRecon datasets. Fourteen medical experts assessed usability and
anticipated clinical integration potential using the System Usability Scale,
ISONORM 9242-110-S questionnaire, and an open-ended survey. Their feedback
identified feasibility, key usability strengths, and required features to
catalyze the adaptation in real-world clinical workflows. The findings provide
insights into the potential of immersive cinematic rendering in medical
imaging.

### [455] [Artificial Intelligence Should Genuinely Support Clinical Reasoning and Decision Making To Bridge the Translational Gap](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05030)
*Kacper Sokol,James Fackler,Julia E Vogt*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The paper highlights a translational gap that limits AI's impact in medicine, proposing a sociotechnical approach to complement doctors rather than focusing on superhuman AI benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors seek to address the translational gap that restricts AI's practical adoption in medicine by critiquing technology-centric approaches that often fail to align with clinical reasoning and decision making.

Method: They propose a novel sociotechnical framework for designing AI systems that work collaboratively with doctors, emphasizing alignment with real-world diagnostic workflows rather than surpassing benchmarks.

Result: The suggested approach focuses on integrating AI systems to enhance doctors' cognitive and reasoning activities while minimizing the incompatibility with clinical practices.

Conclusion: Revolutionizing the role of AI in medicine requires focusing on real-world impact and operational compatibility with clinical decision-making instead of prioritizing technological capabilities alone.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence promises to revolutionise medicine, yet its impact
remains limited because of the pervasive translational gap. We posit that the
prevailing technology-centric approaches underpin this challenge, rendering
such systems fundamentally incompatible with clinical practice, specifically
diagnostic reasoning and decision making. Instead, we propose a novel
sociotechnical conceptualisation of data-driven support tools designed to
complement doctors' cognitive and epistemic activities. Crucially, it
prioritises real-world impact over superhuman performance on inconsequential
benchmarks.

### [456] [Teaming in the AI Era: AI-Augmented Frameworks for Forming, Simulating, and Optimizing Human Teams](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05265)
*Mohammed Almutairi*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The paper introduces AI frameworks for better team formation, engagement, and performance by using multi-armed bandit algorithms, personalized feedback tools, and LLM-based simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current computational tools for team optimization inadequately handle dynamic team compositions, evolving goals, and personal preferences, often leading to dissatisfaction and reduced team performance.

Method: The author proposes three solutions: a multi-armed bandit algorithm for optimizing team formation, an AI-powered feedback assistant (tAIfa) for engagement, and PuppeteerLLM, a simulation framework using large language models.

Result: The proposed frameworks aim to optimize team satisfaction, engagement, and cohesion by aligning individual preferences with team goals and offering real-time feedback and advanced simulations of team dynamics.

Conclusion: The research enhances AI's capability to address challenges in team formation and operation, promising improvements in team satisfaction, engagement, and overall performance.

Abstract: Effective teamwork is essential across diverse domains. During the team
formation stage, a key challenge is forming teams that effectively balance user
preferences with task objectives to enhance overall team satisfaction. In the
team performing stage, maintaining cohesion and engagement is critical for
sustaining high team performance. However, existing computational tools and
algorithms for team optimization often rely on static data inputs, narrow
algorithmic objectives, or solutions tailored for specific contexts, failing to
account for the dynamic interplay of team members personalities, evolving
goals, and changing individual preferences. Therefore, teams may encounter
member dissatisfaction, as purely algorithmic assignments can reduce members
commitment to team goals or experience suboptimal engagement due to the absence
of timely, personalized guidance to help members adjust their behaviors and
interactions as team dynamics evolve. Ultimately, these challenges can lead to
reduced overall team performance. My Ph.D. dissertation aims to develop
AI-augmented team optimization frameworks and practical systems that enhance
team satisfaction, engagement, and performance. First, I propose a team
formation framework that leverages a multi-armed bandit algorithm to
iteratively refine team composition based on user preferences, ensuring
alignment between individual needs and collective team goals to enhance team
satisfaction. Second, I introduce tAIfa (Team AI Feedback Assistant), an
AI-powered system that utilizes large language models (LLMs) to deliver
immediate, personalized feedback to both teams and individual members,
enhancing cohesion and engagement. Finally, I present PuppeteerLLM, an
LLM-based simulation framework that simulates multi-agent teams to model
complex team dynamics within realistic environments, incorporating task-driven
collaboration and long-term coordination.

### [458] [Can we reconstruct a dysarthric voice with the large speech model Parler TTS?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04397)
*Ariadna Sanchez,Simon King*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: The paper explores using a large speech model for voice reconstruction of dysarthric speakers, revealing challenges in maintaining intelligibility and speaker identity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To aid individuals with speech disorders by reconstructing their original voice using advanced Text-to-Speech (TTS) systems.

Method: Utilizing a state-of-the-art TTS model (Parler TTS), fine-tuning it with a curated dataset annotated for speaker and intelligibility attributes.

Result: The model showed promise in generating speech from the dataset but faced difficulties in controlling intelligibility and maintaining speaker identity.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates potential but highlights the need for further research to improve model controllability and reliability in voice reconstruction tasks.

Abstract: Speech disorders can make communication hard or even impossible for those who
develop them. Personalised Text-to-Speech is an attractive option as a
communication aid. We attempt voice reconstruction using a large speech model,
with which we generate an approximation of a dysarthric speaker's voice prior
to the onset of their condition. In particular, we investigate whether a
state-of-the-art large speech model, Parler TTS, can generate intelligible
speech while maintaining speaker identity. We curate a dataset and annotate it
with relevant speaker and intelligibility information, and use this to
fine-tune the model. Our results show that the model can indeed learn to
generate from the distribution of this challenging data, but struggles to
control intelligibility and to maintain consistent speaker identity. We propose
future directions to improve controllability of this class of model, for the
voice reconstruction task.

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: The paper evaluates different joint speech-text decoding strategies for Speech LMs and proposes an early-stop interleaved method for better efficiency and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To optimize speech-text decoding paradigms for better performance, efficiency, and alignment in Speech LMs, making them more effective for spoken dialogue systems.

Method: The researchers compared interleaved and parallel generation paradigms under identical conditions and developed a novel early-stop interleaved (ESI) method to overcome the limitations of the interleaved approach.

Result: The interleaved approach achieved the best alignment but faced slow inference due to long token sequences. The proposed ESI method significantly accelerated decoding and offered slightly better performance.

Conclusion: The early-stop interleaved method effectively balances performance and efficiency, setting a new standard for joint speech-text decoding in Speech LMs.

Abstract: Speech language models (Speech LMs) enable end-to-end speech-text modelling
within a single model, offering a promising direction for spoken dialogue
systems. The choice of speech-text jointly decoding paradigm plays a critical
role in performance, efficiency, and alignment quality. In this work, we
systematically compare representative joint speech-text decoding
strategies-including the interleaved, and parallel generation paradigms-under a
controlled experimental setup using the same base language model, speech
tokenizer and training data. Our results show that the interleaved approach
achieves the best alignment. However it suffers from slow inference due to long
token sequence length. To address this, we propose a novel early-stop
interleaved (ESI) pattern that not only significantly accelerates decoding but
also yields slightly better performance. Additionally, we curate high-quality
question answering (QA) datasets to further improve speech QA performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Gender bias persists in SER systems, yet existing debiasing methods' efficacy and reliability in multi-label contexts are under-researched.

Method: The study compares 13 debiasing techniques from various approaches like pre-processing, adversarial learning, and distributionally robust optimization, tested on both acted and naturalistic datasets using WavLM and XLSR representations under gender imbalance conditions.

Result: The analysis identifies methods that effectively reduce gender performance gaps while maintaining overall system accuracy and highlights the role dataset distribution plays in bias correction.

Conclusion: This research provides practical insights for choosing the most effective debiasing techniques in SER systems, emphasizing the balance between fairness and accuracy.

Abstract: Speech emotion recognition (SER) systems often exhibit gender bias. However,
the effectiveness and robustness of existing debiasing methods in such
multi-label scenarios remain underexplored. To address this gap, we present
EMO-Debias, a large-scale comparison of 13 debiasing methods applied to
multi-label SER. Our study encompasses techniques from pre-processing,
regularization, adversarial learning, biased learners, and distributionally
robust optimization. Experiments conducted on acted and naturalistic emotion
datasets, using WavLM and XLSR representations, evaluate each method under
conditions of gender imbalance. Our analysis quantifies the trade-offs between
fairness and accuracy, identifying which approaches consistently reduce gender
performance gaps without compromising overall model performance. The findings
provide actionable insights for selecting effective debiasing strategies and
highlight the impact of dataset distributions.

### [461] [Memory Hierarchy Design for Caching Middleware in the Age of NVM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05071)
*Shahram Ghandeharizadeh,Sandy Irani,Jenny Lam*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: Non-Volatile Memory (NVM) introduces new options for memory hierarchy design. Researchers model cache configuration decisions using the Multiple Choice Knapsack Problem (MCKP) to optimize performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in designing an efficient caching memory hierarchy given the introduction of NVM and its interplay with DRAM, SSD, and Disk.

Method: The paper models cache configuration problems as instances of the Multiple Choice Knapsack Problem (MCKP) and applies a linear programming relaxation for optimization.

Result: The study finds that selective replication is optimal under certain failure and workload conditions, while tiering data across media works better in scenarios with frequent updates and low failure rates.

Conclusion: A linear programming-based approach for cache design allows for informed decisions regarding replication or tiering, optimizing performance for specific workloads and failure rates.

Abstract: Advances in storage technology have introduced Non-Volatile Memory, NVM, as a
new storage medium. NVM, along with Dynamic Random Access Memory (DRAM), Solid
State Disk (SSD), and Disk present a system designer with a wide array of
options in designing caching middleware. Moreover, design decisions to
replicate a data item in more than one level of a caching memory hierarchy may
enhance the overall system performance with a faster recovery time in the event
of a memory failure. Given a fixed budget, the key configuration questions are:
Which storage media should constitute the memory hierarchy? What is the storage
capacity of each hierarchy? Should data be replicated or partitioned across the
different levels of the hierarchy? We model these cache configuration questions
as an instance of the Multiple Choice Knapsack Problem (MCKP). This model is
guided by the specification of each type of memory along with an application's
database characteristics and its workload. Although MCKP is NP-complete, its
linear programming relaxation is efficiently solvable and can be used to
closely approximate the optimal solution. We use the resulting simple algorithm
to evaluate design tradeoffs in the context of a memory hierarchy for a
Key-Value Store (e.g., memcached) as well as a host-side cache (e.g.,
Flashcache). The results show selective replication is appropriate with certain
failure rates and workload characteristics. With a slim failure rate and
frequent data updates, tiering of data across the different storage media that
constitute the cache is superior to replication.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the underutilization of rich, resource-intensive data produced in qualitative research by exploring its reuse through computational methods.

Method: The paper discusses the benefits, challenges, and possibilities of computationally intensive secondary analysis and proposes a scheme to apply it effectively for cross-contextual and longitudinal studies.

Result: It presents opportunities for leveraging data from multiple contexts and timeframes to develop innovative research designs, while also identifying key challenges in sharing and reusing qualitative data.

Conclusion: Computational secondary analysis of qualitative data offers significant potential to enhance research capabilities but requires addressing epistemological and practical challenges.

Abstract: This paper draws attention to the potential of computational methods in
reworking data generated in past qualitative studies. While qualitative
inquiries often produce rich data through rigorous and resource-intensive
processes, much of this data usually remains unused. In this paper, we first
make a general case for secondary analysis of qualitative data by discussing
its benefits, distinctions, and epistemological aspects. We then argue for
opportunities with computationally intensive secondary analysis, highlighting
the possibility of drawing on data assemblages spanning multiple contexts and
timeframes to address cross-contextual and longitudinal research phenomena and
questions. We propose a scheme to perform computationally intensive secondary
analysis and advance ideas on how this approach can help facilitate the
development of innovative research designs. Finally, we enumerate some key
challenges and ongoing concerns associated with qualitative data sharing and
reuse.

*Fanxiao Li,Jiaying Wu,Canyuan He,Wei Zhou*

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: The paper introduces CMIE, a novel framework for detecting out-of-context (OOC) misinformation using multimodal models. CMIE addresses challenges in capturing semantic relationships and handling noise in evidence, outperforming previous methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome challenges in detecting OOC misinformation, as existing multimodal large language models struggle with deeper semantic relationships and are impacted by noisy evidence.

Method: CMIE integrates a Coexistence Relationship Generation (CRG) strategy to identify underlying semantic relationships and an Association Scoring (AS) mechanism to filter and utilize relevant evidence.

Result: CMIE demonstrates superior performance in OOC misinformation detection compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed CMIE framework effectively addresses limitations of existing models, offering improved accuracy in handling semantic relationships and evidence noise.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive
capabilities in visual reasoning and text generation. While previous studies
have explored the application of MLLM for detecting out-of-context (OOC)
misinformation, our empirical analysis reveals two persisting challenges of
this paradigm. Evaluating the representative GPT-4o model on direct reasoning
and evidence augmented reasoning, results indicate that MLLM struggle to
capture the deeper relationships-specifically, cases in which the image and
text are not directly connected but are associated through underlying semantic
links. Moreover, noise in the evidence further impairs detection accuracy. To
address these challenges, we propose CMIE, a novel OOC misinformation detection
framework that incorporates a Coexistence Relationship Generation (CRG)
strategy and an Association Scoring (AS) mechanism. CMIE identifies the
underlying coexistence relationships between images and text, and selectively
utilizes relevant evidence to enhance misinformation detection. Experimental
results demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing methods.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper presents Exp4Fuse, a framework for improving sparse retrieval through zero-shot LLM-based query expansion, outperforming existing methods and achieving state-of-the-art results on several benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhancing information retrieval for sparse retrievers using LLM-generated query expansion, while addressing the challenges of computation and cost in existing techniques.

Method: Exp4Fuse combines two retrieval approaches—one using the original query and another using an LLM-augmented query. It applies a modified reciprocal rank fusion method to synthesize their ranked results.

Result: Extensive evaluation on various datasets shows Exp4Fuse outperforms existing LLM-based techniques and achieves SOTA performance when integrated with advanced sparse retrievers.

Conclusion: Exp4Fuse demonstrates the capability to efficiently improve sparse retrievers using zero-shot LLM-based query expansion, providing significant performance gains and broader applicability.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown potential in generating hypothetical
documents for query expansion, thereby enhancing information retrieval
performance. However, the efficacy of this method is highly dependent on the
quality of the generated documents, which often requires complex prompt
strategies and the integration of advanced dense retrieval techniques. This can
be both costly and computationally intensive. To mitigate these limitations, we
explore the use of zero-shot LLM-based query expansion to improve sparse
retrieval, particularly for learned sparse retrievers. We introduce a novel
fusion ranking framework, Exp4Fuse, which enhances the performance of sparse
retrievers through an indirect application of zero-shot LLM-based query
expansion. Exp4Fuse operates by simultaneously considering two retrieval
routes-one based on the original query and the other on the LLM-augmented
query. It then generates two ranked lists using a sparse retriever and fuses
them using a modified reciprocal rank fusion method. We conduct extensive
evaluations of Exp4Fuse against leading LLM-based query expansion methods and
advanced retrieval techniques on three MS MARCO-related datasets and seven
low-resource datasets. Experimental results reveal that Exp4Fuse not only
surpasses existing LLM-based query expansion methods in enhancing sparse
retrievers but also, when combined with advanced sparse retrievers, achieves
SOTA results on several benchmarks. This highlights the superior performance
and effectiveness of Exp4Fuse in improving query expansion for sparse
retrieval.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: GOLFer uses smaller open-source language models with filtering and combination methods for effective query expansion in information retrieval.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the high computational cost, limited accessibility, and reliance on large and costly language models in query expansion.

Method: GOLFer includes two modules: (1) hallucination filter to remove inaccuracies from generated documents and (2) document combiner to merge filtered content with the query, weighted for balance.

Result: GOLFer achieves superior performance compared to methods based on smaller LMs, and competitiveness with large LLM-based methods across various datasets.

Conclusion: GOLFer is a cost-effective, accessible, and efficient query expansion method leveraging smaller LMs while maintaining strong performance.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs)-based query expansion for information retrieval
augments queries with generated hypothetical documents with LLMs. However, its
performance relies heavily on the scale of the language models (LMs),
necessitating larger, more advanced LLMs. This approach is costly,
computationally intensive, and often has limited accessibility. To address
these limitations, we introduce GOLFer - Smaller LMs-Generated Documents
Hallucination Filter & Combiner - a novel method leveraging smaller open-source
LMs for query expansion. GOLFer comprises two modules: a hallucination filter
and a documents combiner. The former detects and removes non-factual and
inconsistent sentences in generated documents, a common issue with smaller LMs,
while the latter combines the filtered content with the query using a weight
vector to balance their influence. We evaluate GOLFer alongside dominant
LLM-based query expansion methods on three web search and ten low-resource
datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that GOLFer consistently outperforms
other methods using smaller LMs, and maintains competitive performance against
methods using large-size LLMs, demonstrating its effectiveness.

TL;DR: The study optimizes memory usage in Visualized Document Retrieval (VDR) by reducing patch embeddings while maintaining performance, introducing Light-ColPali/ColQwen2 as a result.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ColPali/ColQwen2 demonstrate strong performance in VDR but are memory-intensive due to encoding each page into multiple patch-level embeddings.

Method: Researchers evaluated two token-reduction strategies: token pruning and token merging. They conducted an analysis to find optimal token merging combinations for VDR.

Result: Light-ColPali/ColQwen2 retains 98.2% retrieval performance at 11.8% memory usage, and 94.6% effectiveness at only 2.8% memory usage.

Conclusion: The findings highlight the limitations of token pruning for VDR and propose token merging as more suitable. Light-ColPali/ColQwen2 sets a benchmark for efficient VDR research.

Abstract: Despite the strong performance of ColPali/ColQwen2 in Visualized Document
Retrieval (VDR), it encodes each page into multiple patch-level embeddings and
leads to excessive memory usage. This empirical study investigates methods to
reduce patch embeddings per page at minimum performance degradation. We
evaluate two token-reduction strategies: token pruning and token merging.
Regarding token pruning, we surprisingly observe that a simple random strategy
outperforms other sophisticated pruning methods, though still far from
satisfactory. Further analysis reveals that pruning is inherently unsuitable
for VDR as it requires removing certain page embeddings without query-specific
information. Turning to token merging (more suitable for VDR), we search for
the optimal combinations of merging strategy across three dimensions and
develop Light-ColPali/ColQwen2. It maintains 98.2% of retrieval performance
with only 11.8% of original memory usage, and preserves 94.6% effectiveness at
2.8% memory footprint. We expect our empirical findings and resulting
Light-ColPali/ColQwen2 offer valuable insights and establish a competitive
baseline for future research towards efficient VDR.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: R2Rec, a reasoning-driven framework, utilizes interaction chains and progressive masked prompting to enhance recommendations using LLMs. It significantly improves accuracy and interpretability compared to baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve recommendation systems by leveraging LLMs' reasoning abilities and addressing their limitations in dealing with implicit user feedback.

Method: The R2Rec framework uses interaction chains from user-item graphs transformed into structured reasoning sequences. It trains LLMs via a two-stage process: supervised fine-tuning for basic reasoning and reinforcement learning with reward signals to refine decisions.

Result: Experiments on three datasets demonstrate an average 10.48% improvement in HitRatio@1 and a 131.81% gain over the original LLM, showcasing R2Rec's superiority over traditional and previous LLM methods.

Conclusion: R2Rec effectively integrates reasoning into recommendations, enhancing both performance and interpretability. It highlights the scalability and depth LLMs can bring to recommendation systems.

Abstract: Driven by advances in Large Language Models (LLMs), integrating them into
recommendation tasks has gained interest due to their strong semantic
understanding and prompt flexibility. Prior work encoded user-item interactions
or metadata into prompts for recommendations. In parallel, LLM reasoning,
boosted by test-time scaling and reinforcement learning, has excelled in fields
like mathematics and code, where reasoning traces and correctness signals are
clear, enabling high performance and interpretability. However, directly
applying these reasoning methods to recommendation is ineffective because user
feedback is implicit and lacks reasoning supervision. To address this, we
propose $\textbf{R2Rec}$, a reasoning-enhanced recommendation framework that
samples interaction chains from the user-item graph and converts them into
structured interaction-of-thoughts via a progressive masked prompting strategy,
with each thought representing stepwise reasoning grounded in interaction
context. This allows LLMs to simulate step-by-step decision-making based on
implicit patterns. We design a two-stage training pipeline: supervised
fine-tuning teaches basic reasoning from high-quality traces, and reinforcement
learning refines reasoning via reward signals, alleviating sparse explicit
supervision. Experiments on three real-world datasets show R2Rec outperforms
classical and LLM-based baselines with an average $\textbf{10.48%}$ improvement
in HitRatio@1 and $\textbf{131.81%}$ gain over the original LLM. Furthermore,
the explicit reasoning chains enhance interpretability by revealing the
decision process. Our code is available at:

TL;DR: The paper introduces AbBiBench, a framework to benchmark antibody-antigen binding using biologically relevant metrics rather than traditional similarity-based metrics. It also compares different protein models for antibody design, showing that structure-conditioned inverse folding models perform the best.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing antibody evaluation strategies that focus solely on the antibody or rely on similarity measures, the authors propose a biologically grounded framework that considers the antibody-antigen complex for more functional accuracy.

Method: The researchers curated and standardized 9 datasets involving antibody-antigen complexes, tested 14 protein modeling approaches, and used correlation between model likelihood and experimental affinity as a performance metric. They also conducted a case study to design antibodies with improved binding affinity.

Result: Structure-conditioned inverse folding models showed superior performance in both correlating with experimental affinity values and generating effective antibody designs in a case study.

Conclusion: AbBiBench establishes a robust and unified framework for designing and benchmarking antibodies, enabling the development of more function-aware models for therapeutics.

Abstract: We introduce AbBiBench (Antibody Binding Benchmarking), a benchmarking
framework for antibody binding affinity maturation and design. Unlike existing
antibody evaluation strategies that rely on antibody alone and its similarity
to natural ones (e.g., amino acid identity rate, structural RMSD), AbBiBench
considers an antibody-antigen (Ab-Ag) complex as a functional unit and
evaluates the potential of an antibody design binding to given antigen by
measuring protein model's likelihood on the Ab-Ag complex. We first curate,
standardize, and share 9 datasets containing 9 antigens (involving influenza,
anti-lysozyme, HER2, VEGF, integrin, and SARS-CoV-2) and 155,853 heavy chain
mutated antibodies. Using these datasets, we systematically compare 14 protein
models including masked language models, autoregressive language models,
inverse folding models, diffusion-based generative models, and geometric graph
models. The correlation between model likelihood and experimental affinity
values is used to evaluate model performance. Additionally, in a case study to
increase binding affinity of antibody F045-092 to antigen influenza H1N1, we
evaluate the generative power of the top-performing models by sampling a set of
new antibodies binding to the antigen and ranking them based on structural
integrity and biophysical properties of the Ab-Ag complex. As a result,
structure-conditioned inverse folding models outperform others in both affinity
correlation and generation tasks. Overall, AbBiBench provides a unified,
biologically grounded evaluation framework to facilitate the development of
more effective, function-aware antibody design models.

### [469] [The Latent Space Hypothesis: Toward Universal Medical Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04515)

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Latent Space Hypothesis, proposing a unified geometric representation for heterogeneous medical data to better understand health trajectories and personalize clinical treatment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to provide a principled framework for interpreting diverse medical data types, enhancing understanding of diseases and enabling personalized healthcare.

Method: The authors propose using a hierarchically organized latent space to unify disparate data modalities, representing health states, disease progression, and therapy as geometric constructs.

Result: This framework allows re-evaluation of traditional disease definitions, uncovers sub-trajectories, and facilitates tailored diagnoses and treatments based on patient-specific data.

Conclusion: Navigating individual health trajectories rather than relying on generalized disease labels promises personalized medicine improvements, though challenges like data bias and privacy remain.

Abstract: Medical data range from genomic sequences and retinal photographs to
structured laboratory results and unstructured clinical narratives. Although
these modalities appear disparate, many encode convergent information about a
single underlying physiological state. The Latent Space Hypothesis frames each
observation as a projection of a unified, hierarchically organized manifold --
much like shadows cast by the same three-dimensional object. Within this
learned geometric representation, an individual's health status occupies a
point, disease progression traces a trajectory, and therapeutic intervention
corresponds to a directed vector. Interpreting heterogeneous evidence in a
shared space provides a principled way to re-examine eponymous conditions --
such as Parkinson's or Crohn's -- that often mask multiple pathophysiological
entities and involve broader anatomical domains than once believed. By
revealing sub-trajectories and patient-specific directions of change, the
framework supplies a quantitative rationale for personalised diagnosis,
longitudinal monitoring, and tailored treatment, moving clinical practice away
from grouping by potentially misleading labels toward navigation of each
person's unique trajectory. Challenges remain -- bias amplification, data
scarcity for rare disorders, privacy, and the correlation-causation divide --
but scale-aware encoders, continual learning on longitudinal data streams, and
perturbation-based validation offer plausible paths forward.

*Zhizheng Wang,Chi-Ping Day,Chih-Hsuan Wei,Qiao Jin,Robert Leaman,Yifan Yang,Shubo Tian,Aodong Qiu,Yin Fang,Qingqing Zhu,Xinghua Lu,Zhiyong Lu*

Main category: q-bio.GN

TL;DR: The paper introduces cGSA, an AI-based method to improve gene set analysis by considering clinical context, outperforming traditional approaches in precision and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional gene set analysis methods often produce irrelevant results due to the lack of clinical context, necessitating extensive manual effort for interpretation.

Method: The proposed cGSA framework integrates gene cluster detection, enrichment analysis, and large language models to prioritize pathways based on biological significance and clinical relevance.

Result: In benchmarks with 102 gene sets across diseases and mechanisms, cGSA showed over 30% improvement in precision compared to existing methods, with validated expert assessments confirming enhanced interpretability.

Conclusion: The cGSA framework advances gene set analysis by improving reliability, reproducibility, and context-specific insight generation, as demonstrated in case studies on melanoma and breast cancer.

Abstract: Gene set analysis (GSA) is a foundational approach for interpreting genomic
data of diseases by linking genes to biological processes. However,
conventional GSA methods overlook clinical context of the analyses, often
generating long lists of enriched pathways with redundant, nonspecific, or
irrelevant results. Interpreting these requires extensive, ad-hoc manual
effort, reducing both reliability and reproducibility. To address this
limitation, we introduce cGSA, a novel AI-driven framework that enhances GSA by
incorporating context-aware pathway prioritization. cGSA integrates gene
cluster detection, enrichment analysis, and large language models to identify
pathways that are not only statistically significant but also biologically
meaningful. Benchmarking on 102 manually curated gene sets across 19 diseases
and ten disease-related biological mechanisms shows that cGSA outperforms
baseline methods by over 30%, with expert validation confirming its increased
precision and interpretability. Two independent case studies in melanoma and
breast cancer further demonstrate its potential to uncover context-specific
insights and support targeted hypothesis generation.

*Laurence Davies,Dan Mackinlay,Rafael Oliveira,Scott A. Sisson*

Main category: stat.CO

TL;DR: This paper introduces CoSMIC, a novel framework enabling flow-based models for transdimensional Bayesian inference, expanding their capability beyond fixed-dimension problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional stochastic variational inference (SVI) combined with flow-based models has been limited to fixed dimension problems, leaving challenges in applying these methods to transdimensional datasets.

Method: The authors developed CoSMIC, a neural architecture leveraging autoregressive conditional normalizing flows and introduced stochastic variational transdimensional inference (VTI), combining Bayesian optimization with Monte Carlo gradient estimation.

Result: Experiments showed that CoSMIC and VTI successfully addressed transdimensional problems and scaled effectively to high-cardinality model spaces.

Conclusion: CoSMIC extends the capabilities of flow-based models for Bayesian inference by enabling transdimensional applications, showcasing advanced scalability and performance in complex problem spaces.

Abstract: The expressiveness of flow-based models combined with stochastic variational
inference (SVI) has, in recent years, expanded the application of
optimization-based Bayesian inference to include problems with complex data
relationships. However, until now, SVI using flow-based models has been limited
to problems of fixed dimension. We introduce CoSMIC, normalizing flows
(COntextually-Specified Masking for Identity-mapped Components), an extension
to neural autoregressive conditional normalizing flow architectures that
enables using a single amortized variational density for inference over a
transdimensional target distribution. We propose a combined stochastic
variational transdimensional inference (VTI) approach to training CoSMIC flows
using techniques from Bayesian optimization and Monte Carlo gradient
estimation. Numerical experiments demonstrate the performance of VTI on
challenging problems that scale to high-cardinality model spaces.

*Shaoxuan Chen,Su Yang,Panayotis G. Kevrekidis,Wei Zhu*

Main category: nlin.PS

TL;DR: This paper presents a novel Neural ODE-based framework to learn reduced-order dynamics from PDE systems, offering robustness in sparse and noisy data scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods like SINDy require dense and clean data, making them impractical for real-world applications with sparse and irregular sampling.

Method: The authors leverage Neural ODEs to model moment trajectories and introduce a coordinate transformation via Stiefel manifold optimization for systems lacking analytical closure.

Result: The framework successfully recovers governing moment dynamics under sparse and irregular observations, showing superior extrapolation compared to expert-derived models.

Conclusion: Neural ODE-based approaches are effective for discovering interpretable, low-dimensional moment dynamics in complex systems, showcasing robustness and versatility in challenging data conditions.

Abstract: We propose a data-driven framework for learning reduced-order moment dynamics
from PDE-governed systems using Neural ODEs. In contrast to derivative-based
methods like SINDy, which necessitate densely sampled data and are sensitive to
noise, our approach based on Neural ODEs directly models moment trajectories,
enabling robust learning from sparse and potentially irregular time series.
Using as an application platform the nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation, the
framework accurately recovers governing moment dynamics when closure is
available, even with limited and irregular observations. For systems without
analytical closure, we introduce a data-driven coordinate transformation
strategy based on Stiefel manifold optimization, enabling the discovery of
low-dimensional representations in which the moment dynamics become closed,
facilitating interpretable and reliable modeling. We also explore cases where a
closure model is not known, such as a Fisher-KPP reaction-diffusion system.
Here we demonstrate that Neural ODEs can still effectively approximate the
unclosed moment dynamics and achieve superior extrapolation accuracy compared
to physical-expert-derived ODE models. This advantage remains robust even under
sparse and irregular sampling, highlighting the method's robustness in
data-limited settings. Our results highlight the Neural ODE framework as a
powerful and flexible tool for learning interpretable, low-dimensional moment
dynamics in complex PDE-governed systems.

*Hasin Us Sami,Swapneel Sen,Amit K. Roy-Chowdhury,Srikanth V. Krishnamurthy,Basak Guler*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: This paper studies privacy concerns in parameter-efficient fine-tuning for Federated Learning by demonstrating that adapter gradients in the system can be exploited by gradient inversion attacks to reconstruct private user data, emphasizing the need for privacy-preserving mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Federated Learning is gaining traction due to its ability to train models collaboratively without sharing raw data, but privacy risks associated with gradient sharing remain unresolved. This paper addresses privacy vulnerabilities in parameter-efficient fine-tuning within FL settings.

Method: The authors perform gradient inversion attacks on fine-tuning adapters in FL systems, using maliciously designed pretrained models and adapter modules to reconstruct private user data from shared gradients.

Result: Experiments reveal that large batches of fine-tuning images can be successfully reconstructed with high fidelity from adapter gradients, proving the susceptibility of current PEFT mechanisms in FL.

Conclusion: The findings underscore the urgent need for privacy-preserving strategies in parameter-efficient fine-tuning models for Federated Learning, while pointing out several avenues for future research.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) allows multiple data-owners to collaboratively train
machine learning models by exchanging local gradients, while keeping their
private data on-device. To simultaneously enhance privacy and training
efficiency, recently parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) of large-scale
pretrained models has gained substantial attention in FL. While keeping a
pretrained (backbone) model frozen, each user fine-tunes only a few lightweight
modules to be used in conjunction, to fit specific downstream applications.
Accordingly, only the gradients with respect to these lightweight modules are
shared with the server. In this work, we investigate how the privacy of the
fine-tuning data of the users can be compromised via a malicious design of the
pretrained model and trainable adapter modules. We demonstrate gradient
inversion attacks on a popular PEFT mechanism, the adapter, which allow an
attacker to reconstruct local data samples of a target user, using only the
accessible adapter gradients. Via extensive experiments, we demonstrate that a
large batch of fine-tuning images can be retrieved with high fidelity. Our
attack highlights the need for privacy-preserving mechanisms for PEFT, while
opening up several future directions. Our code is available at

### [474] [A Poisson-Guided Decomposition Network for Extreme Low-Light Image Enhancement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04470)
*Isha Rao,Sanjay Ghosh*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a deep learning model combining Retinex decomposition and Poisson denoising for low-light image enhancement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Effective denoising and enhancement under extreme low-light situations, particularly addressing signal-dependent Poisson noise.

Method: Unified encoder-decoder framework integrating Retinex decomposition and Poisson denoising loss for joint enhancement and noise suppression.

Result: Proposed method improves illumination, preserves image structure and color constancy, and is practical under real-world low-light conditions.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates substantial advancements in visibility and brightness of degraded low-light images without color distortion.

Abstract: Low-light image denoising and enhancement are challenging, especially when
traditional noise assumptions, such as Gaussian noise, do not hold in majority.
In many real-world scenarios, such as low-light imaging, noise is
signal-dependent and is better represented as Poisson noise. In this work, we
address the problem of denoising images degraded by Poisson noise under extreme
low-light conditions. We introduce a light-weight deep learning-based method
that integrates Retinex based decomposition with Poisson denoising into a
unified encoder-decoder network. The model simultaneously enhances illumination
and suppresses noise by incorporating a Poisson denoising loss to address
signal-dependent noise. Without prior requirement for reflectance and
illumination, the network learns an effective decomposition process while
ensuring consistent reflectance and smooth illumination without causing any
form of color distortion. The experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness and practicality of the proposed low-light illumination
enhancement method. Our method significantly improves visibility and brightness
in low-light conditions, while preserving image structure and color constancy
under ambient illumination.

TL;DR: The paper presents the DACN model, using dual attention mechanisms and optimized loss to enhance hyperspectral image super-resolution, addressing limitations in local context reliance and data scarcity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenges of local neighborhood reliance, poor global contextual understanding, band correlation problems, and data scarcity in existing hyperspectral image super-resolution methods.

Method: The proposed DACN model introduces augmented convolutions with multi-head attention, dual attention maps for channel and spatial dimensions, and a custom loss function combining L2 regularization with spatial-spectral gradient loss.

Result: The DACN model demonstrates superior performance on two hyperspectral datasets, showcasing its advantage in combining multi-head attention with channel attention over individual mechanisms.

Conclusion: The integration of dual attention mechanisms and a custom loss function significantly improves hyperspectral image super-resolution, resolving common limitations in the field.

Abstract: 2D convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have attracted significant attention
for hyperspectral image super-resolution tasks. However, a key limitation is
their reliance on local neighborhoods, which leads to a lack of global
contextual understanding. Moreover, band correlation and data scarcity continue
to limit their performance. To mitigate these issues, we introduce DACN, a
dual-attention convolutional network for hyperspectral image super-resolution.
Specifically, the model first employs augmented convolutions, integrating
multi-head attention to effectively capture both local and global feature
dependencies. Next, we infer separate attention maps for the channel and
spatial dimensions to determine where to focus across different channels and
spatial positions. Furthermore, a custom optimized loss function is proposed
that combines L2 regularization with spatial-spectral gradient loss to ensure
accurate spectral fidelity. Experimental results on two hyperspectral datasets
demonstrate that the combination of multi-head attention and channel attention
outperforms either attention mechanism used individually.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper presents PixCell, a diffusion-based generative model for histopathology, trained on a large dataset. It synthesizes high-quality and diverse images for tasks such as data augmentation, privacy-preserving data sharing, and virtual staining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in pathology such as annotated data scarcity, privacy-preserving data sharing, and generative tasks like virtual staining, by employing generative models to synthesize realistic and diverse histopathology images.

Method: The authors propose PixCell, a generative model based on diffusion techniques. They trained it on PanCan-30M, a massive dataset of H&E-stained slides, using self-supervision and progressive training for scalability and quality.

Result: PixCell generates diverse, high-quality histopathology images for multiple cancer types, which can replace real data for training. It improves performance in segmentation tasks and achieves targeted data augmentation and virtual staining. PixCell also infers molecular staining from H&E images.

Conclusion: PixCell demonstrates the potential of generative models in computational pathology, addressing challenges with annotated data and privacy. The model contributes to data augmentation, educational purposes, and practical tasks like virtual staining, with publicly available trained models for research.

Abstract: The digitization of histology slides has revolutionized pathology, providing
massive datasets for cancer diagnosis and research. Contrastive self-supervised
and vision-language models have been shown to effectively mine large pathology
datasets to learn discriminative representations. On the other hand, generative
models, capable of synthesizing realistic and diverse images, present a
compelling solution to address unique problems in pathology that involve
synthesizing images; overcoming annotated data scarcity, enabling
privacy-preserving data sharing, and performing inherently generative tasks,
such as virtual staining. We introduce PixCell, the first diffusion-based
generative foundation model for histopathology. We train PixCell on PanCan-30M,
a vast, diverse dataset derived from 69,184 H\&E-stained whole slide images
covering various cancer types. We employ a progressive training strategy and a
self-supervision-based conditioning that allows us to scale up training without
any annotated data. PixCell generates diverse and high-quality images across
multiple cancer types, which we find can be used in place of real data to train
a self-supervised discriminative model. Synthetic images shared between
institutions are subject to fewer regulatory barriers than would be the case
with real clinical images. Furthermore, we showcase the ability to precisely
control image generation using a small set of annotated images, which can be
used for both data augmentation and educational purposes. Testing on a cell
segmentation task, a mask-guided PixCell enables targeted data augmentation,
improving downstream performance. Finally, we demonstrate PixCell's ability to
use H\&E structural staining to infer results from molecular marker studies; we
use this capability to infer IHC staining from H\&E images. Our trained models
are publicly released to accelerate research in computational pathology.

*Hangyu Ji*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: DM-SegNet introduces a novel 3D medical image segmentation method by leveraging Dual-Mamba architecture and achieves state-of-the-art results on clinical benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the limitations in existing medical image segmentation methods, particularly issues with encoder-decoder compatibility and spatial structure preservation.

Method: DM-SegNet employs a quadri-directional spatial Mamba module for 3D scanning, gated spatial convolution, and a Mamba-driven hierarchical decoding framework for effective segmentation.

Result: The model significantly outperforms previous methods, achieving 85.44% DSC on the Synapse dataset for abdominal organ segmentation and 90.22% DSC on the BraTS2023 dataset for brain tumor segmentation.

Conclusion: DM-SegNet effectively combines innovative directional state transitions and anatomy-aware decoding, establishing itself as a state-of-the-art solution for 3D medical image segmentation.

Abstract: Accurate 3D medical image segmentation demands architectures capable of
reconciling global context modeling with spatial topology preservation. While
State Space Models (SSMs) like Mamba show potential for sequence modeling,
existing medical SSMs suffer from encoder-decoder incompatibility: the
encoder's 1D sequence flattening compromises spatial structures, while
conventional decoders fail to leverage Mamba's state propagation. We present
DM-SegNet, a Dual-Mamba architecture integrating directional state transitions
with anatomy-aware hierarchical decoding. The core innovations include a
quadri-directional spatial Mamba module employing four-directional 3D scanning
to maintain anatomical spatial coherence, a gated spatial convolution layer
that enhances spatially sensitive feature representation prior to state
modeling, and a Mamba-driven decoding framework enabling bidirectional state
synchronization across scales. Extensive evaluation on two clinically
significant benchmarks demonstrates the efficacy of DM-SegNet: achieving
state-of-the-art Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) of 85.44% on the Synapse
dataset for abdominal organ segmentation and 90.22% on the BraTS2023 dataset
for brain tumor segmentation.

Method: The study employs a modified EfficientNetV2 architecture with enhanced attention mechanisms, validated across three datasets, focusing on lesion localization metrics and clinical concordance.

Result: The model achieved high AUROC scores (0.89, 0.96, 0.94) across datasets, consistent concordance rates with radiologists for classification (83.5% to 78.1%) and localization (84.0% to 79.6%), and high usability and acceptance scores.

Conclusion: The proposed system shows significant potential in improving breast cancer screening workflows by reliably assisting in mammogram interpretation and supporting clinical decision-making.

Abstract: This study presents a deep learning system for breast cancer detection in
mammography, developed using a modified EfficientNetV2 architecture with
enhanced attention mechanisms. The model was trained on mammograms from a major
Thai medical center and validated on three distinct datasets: an in-domain test
set (9,421 cases), a biopsy-confirmed set (883 cases), and an out-of-domain
generalizability set (761 cases) collected from two different hospitals. For
cancer detection, the model achieved AUROCs of 0.89, 0.96, and 0.94 on the
respective datasets. The system's lesion localization capability, evaluated
using metrics including Lesion Localization Fraction (LLF) and Non-Lesion
Localization Fraction (NLF), demonstrated robust performance in identifying
suspicious regions. Clinical validation through concordance tests showed strong
agreement with radiologists: 83.5% classification and 84.0% localization
concordance for biopsy-confirmed cases, and 78.1% classification and 79.6%
localization concordance for out-of-domain cases. Expert radiologists'
acceptance rate also averaged 96.7% for biopsy-confirmed cases, and 89.3% for
out-of-domain cases. The system achieved a System Usability Scale score of
74.17 for source hospital, and 69.20 for validation hospitals, indicating good
clinical acceptance. These results demonstrate the model's effectiveness in
assisting mammogram interpretation, with the potential to enhance breast cancer
screening workflows in clinical practice.

Main category: astro-ph.CO

TL;DR: This paper introduces a neural approach to estimate Bayes factors for nested models using normalizing flows, demonstrating its efficacy in high-dimensional cosmological settings where traditional methods struggle.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to address the computational challenge of calculating Bayesian evidence for model comparison, particularly as increasingly complex models are explored in cosmology and astrophysics.

Method: A Neural SDDR approach using normalizing flows is proposed, replacing classical density estimators to calculate Bayes factors in high-dimensional settings.

Result: The effectiveness of the neural SDDR method is demonstrated on both toy and realistic cosmological examples, showing consistent results with existing approaches like Bayesian hierarchical models and simulation-based inference.

Conclusion: The neural SDDR method scales effectively to handle high-dimensional models, making it a promising tool for Bayesian model comparison in complex scientific domains.

Abstract: A core motivation of science is to evaluate which scientific model best
explains observed data. Bayesian model comparison provides a principled
statistical approach to comparing scientific models and has found widespread
application within cosmology and astrophysics. Calculating the Bayesian
evidence is computationally challenging, especially as we continue to explore
increasingly more complex models. The Savage-Dickey density ratio (SDDR)
provides a method to calculate the Bayes factor (evidence ratio) between two
nested models using only posterior samples from the super model. The SDDR
requires the calculation of a normalised marginal distribution over the extra
parameters of the super model, which has typically been performed using
classical density estimators, such as histograms. Classical density estimators,
however, can struggle to scale to high-dimensional settings. We introduce a
neural SDDR approach using normalizing flows that can scale to settings where
the super model contains a large number of extra parameters. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of this neural SDDR methodology applied to both toy and realistic
cosmological examples. For a field-level inference setting, we show that Bayes
factors computed for a Bayesian hierarchical model (BHM) and simulation-based
inference (SBI) approach are consistent, providing further validation that SBI
extracts as much cosmological information from the field as the BHM approach.
The SDDR estimator with normalizing flows is implemented in the open-source
harmonic Python package.

Motivation: Quantum Machine Learning circuits require efficient computational tools for simulation, and existing simulators have limitations in performance and scalability.

Method: The study benchmarks universal and gate-specific simulation techniques to identify and apply optimal methods tailored to the layers and gates of quantum circuits.

Result: The TQml Simulator achieves notable performance gains (2x to 100x faster) compared to equivalent simulators, depending on factors like circuit type and hardware.

Conclusion: A tailored combination of simulation techniques can significantly improve computational efficiency for Quantum Machine Learning, validating the effectiveness of TQml Simulator.

Abstract: Hardware-efficient circuits employed in Quantum Machine Learning are
typically composed of alternating layers of uniformly applied gates. High-speed
numerical simulators for such circuits are crucial for advancing research in
this field. In this work, we numerically benchmark universal and gate-specific
techniques for simulating the action of layers of gates on quantum state
vectors, aiming to accelerate the overall simulation of Quantum Machine
Learning algorithms. Our analysis shows that the optimal simulation method for
a given layer of gates depends on the number of qubits involved, and that a
tailored combination of techniques can yield substantial performance gains in
the forward and backward passes for a given circuit. Building on these
insights, we developed a numerical simulator, named TQml Simulator, that
employs the most efficient simulation method for each layer in a given circuit.
We evaluated TQml Simulator on circuits constructed from standard gate sets,
such as rotations and CNOTs, as well as on native gates from IonQ and IBM
quantum processing units. In most cases, our simulator outperforms equivalent
Pennylane's default.qubit simulator by approximately 2- to 100-fold, depending
on the circuit, the number of qubits, the batch size of the input data, and the

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate estimation of soil properties is critical for understanding water infiltration and its effects, aiming to improve predictions under varying conditions.

Method: Simulated data generated from a boundary value problem using the Fokas method was analyzed using machine learning models (SVMs and NNs), under conditions like full, noisy, and limited datasets.

Result: SVMs and NNs showed highest accuracy and robustness, with diffusivity predictions being more reliable than hydraulic conductivity predictions.

Conclusion: SVMs and NNs are effective for predicting soil properties, offering near-perfect accuracy under diverse data conditions.

Abstract: This work focuses on estimating soil properties from water moisture
measurements. We consider simulated data generated by solving the
initial-boundary value problem governing vertical infiltration in a
homogeneous, bounded soil profile, with the usage of the Fokas method. To
address the parameter identification problem, which is formulated as a
two-output regression task, we explore various machine learning models. The
performance of each model is assessed under different data conditions: full,
noisy, and limited. Overall, the prediction of diffusivity $D$ tends to be more
accurate than that of hydraulic conductivity $K.$ Among the models considered,
Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and Neural Networks (NNs) demonstrate the
highest robustness, achieving near-perfect accuracy and minimal errors.

TL;DR: The paper studies the challenges faced by practitioners in using existing tools for evaluating representational harms in LLMs and provides recommendations for improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many tools have been developed to measure representational harms in LLMs, but their effectiveness and usability for practitioners remain unclear.

Method: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 12 practitioners to assess their ability to use publicly available tools and analyze challenges.

Result: Practitioners face two types of challenges: misalignment between tool capabilities and their needs, and practical/institutional barriers preventing tool usage.

Conclusion: Aligning instrument designs with practitioner needs and addressing practical barriers can optimize harm measurement, improving evaluation processes for LLM-based systems.

Abstract: The NLP research community has made publicly available numerous instruments
for measuring representational harms caused by large language model (LLM)-based
systems. These instruments have taken the form of datasets, metrics, tools, and
more. In this paper, we examine the extent to which such instruments meet the
needs of practitioners tasked with evaluating LLM-based systems. Via
semi-structured interviews with 12 such practitioners, we find that
practitioners are often unable to use publicly available instruments for
measuring representational harms. We identify two types of challenges. In some
cases, instruments are not useful because they do not meaningfully measure what
practitioners seek to measure or are otherwise misaligned with practitioner
needs. In other cases, instruments - even useful instruments - are not used by
practitioners due to practical and institutional barriers impeding their
uptake. Drawing on measurement theory and pragmatic measurement, we provide
recommendations for addressing these challenges to better meet practitioner
needs.

Motivation: To address the intensified governance challenges posed by agentic AI systems in public sector oversight mechanisms.

Method: Mixed-methods approach involving a literature review and interviews with civil servants in AI-related roles.

Result: Identified five governance dimensions for responsible agent deployment and highlighted intensified governance challenges in continuous oversight, deeper integration, and interdepartmental coordination.

Conclusion: Proposes adaptations to institutional structures and agent oversight approaches to align with public sector constraints.

Abstract: This paper finds that the introduction of agentic AI systems intensifies
existing challenges to traditional public sector oversight mechanisms -- which
rely on siloed compliance units and episodic approvals rather than continuous,
integrated supervision. We identify five governance dimensions essential for
responsible agent deployment: cross-departmental implementation, comprehensive
evaluation, enhanced security protocols, operational visibility, and systematic
auditing. We evaluate the capacity of existing oversight structures to meet
these challenges, via a mixed-methods approach consisting of a literature
review and interviews with civil servants in AI-related roles. We find that
agent oversight poses intensified versions of three existing governance
challenges: continuous oversight, deeper integration of governance and
operational capabilities, and interdepartmental coordination. We propose
approaches that both adapt institutional structures and design agent oversight
compatible with public sector constraints.

Method: The authors analyze the legal precedent, the philosophical basis of free speech, and societal impacts of extending speech rights to AI models.

Result: They conclude that AI outputs do not qualify as speech under the First Amendment and extending such protections would harm regulatory oversight and societal well-being.

Conclusion: The paper finds that granting First Amendment protections to generative AI would neither align with legal precedent nor benefit society, instead enabling harms like misinformation.

Abstract: This paper challenges the assumption that courts should grant First Amendment
protections to outputs from large generative AI models, such as GPT-4 and
Gemini. We argue that because these models lack intentionality, their outputs
do not constitute speech as understood in the context of established legal
precedent, so there can be no speech to protect. Furthermore, if the model
outputs are not speech, users cannot claim a First Amendment speech right to
receive the outputs. We also argue that extending First Amendment rights to AI
models would not serve the fundamental purposes of free speech, such as
promoting a marketplace of ideas, facilitating self-governance, or fostering
self-expression. In fact, granting First Amendment protections to AI models
would be detrimental to society because it would hinder the government's
ability to regulate these powerful technologies effectively, potentially
leading to the unchecked spread of misinformation and other harms.

*Shuai Lu*

Main category: physics.comp-ph

TL;DR: This paper develops a fully coupled and implicit simulation framework for multiphase flow in heterogeneous porous media, introducing a novel Linearly Implicit Extrapolation Method (LIMEX) with error estimation, and demonstrates scalability on supercomputers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the accuracy of multiphase flow simulations in heterogeneous porous media by utilizing a fully coupled and implicit framework that considers gravity and capillary effects.

Method: The study employs the Vertex-Centered Finite Volume Method for spatial discretization and introduces LIMEX for time discretization. It also uses the BiCGSTAB method with GMG preconditioning for solving linear systems. Models are implemented using the open-source UG4 software.

Result: The proposed method performs well in parallel computations, scaling efficiently on supercomputers with thousands of processors and handling Degrees of Freedom (DoF) in the billions.

Conclusion: The proposed framework, integrating LIMEX and advanced computational methods, is computationally scalable and suitable for large-scale, high-resolution multiphase flow simulations.

Abstract: The modeling and simulation of multiphase fluid flow receive significant
attention in reservoir engineering. Many time discretization schemes for
multiphase flow equations are either explicit or semi-implicit, relying on the
decoupling between the saturation equation and the pressure equation. In this
study, we delve into a fully coupled and fully implicit framework for
simulating multiphase flow in heterogeneous porous media, considering gravity
and capillary effects. We utilize the Vertex-Centered Finite Volume Method for
spatial discretization and propose an efficient implementation of interface
conditions for heterogeneous porous media within the current scheme. Notably,
we introduce the Linearly Implicit Extrapolation Method (LIMEX) with an error
estimator, adapted for the first time to multiphase flow problems. To solve the
resulting linear system, we employ the BiCGSTAB method with the Geometric
Multigrid (GMG) preconditioner. The implementations of models and methods are
based on the open-source software: UG4. The results from parallel computations
on the supercomputer demonstrate that the scalability of our proposed framework
is sufficient, supporting a scale of thousands of processors with Degrees of
Freedom (DoF) extending up to billions.

TL;DR: BridgeNet integrates CNNs with PINNs to solve challenging Fokker-Planck equations efficiently, outperforming traditional PINNs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address limitations of traditional Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) in capturing complex spatial hierarchies and enforcing intricate boundary conditions in high-dimensional non-linear Fokker-Planck equations.

Method: BridgeNet combines adaptive CNN layers for local feature extraction and a dynamically weighted loss function to rigorously enforce physical constraints.

Result: Extensive experiments show BridgeNet offers lower error, faster convergence, and robust stability in high-dimensional contexts compared to conventional PINNs.

Conclusion: BridgeNet is a scalable and accurate computational framework with potential applications in diverse fields like financial mathematics and complex system dynamics.

Abstract: BridgeNet is a novel hybrid framework that integrates convolutional neural
networks with physics-informed neural networks to efficiently solve non-linear,
high-dimensional Fokker-Planck equations (FPEs). Traditional PINNs, which
typically rely on fully connected architectures, often struggle to capture
complex spatial hierarchies and enforce intricate boundary conditions. In
contrast, BridgeNet leverages adaptive CNN layers for effective local feature
extraction and incorporates a dynamically weighted loss function that
rigorously enforces physical constraints. Extensive numerical experiments
across various test cases demonstrate that BridgeNet not only achieves
significantly lower error metrics and faster convergence compared to
conventional PINN approaches but also maintains robust stability in
high-dimensional settings. This work represents a substantial advancement in
computational physics, offering a scalable and accurate solution methodology
with promising applications in fields ranging from financial mathematics to
complex system dynamics.

*Leonardo Ceragioli,Giuseppe Primiero*

Main category: cs.LO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework to evaluate the trustworthiness of machine learning (ML) systems copied from original models using probabilistic queries and establishes four notions of trustworthiness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Assessing the trustworthiness of ML systems that are modified or duplicated is crucial in the context of responsible AI but remains underexplored.

Method: The authors propose a calculus to model and analyze probabilistic queries over data, defining four notions of trustworthiness for copied ML systems.

Result: The paper establishes the relationships and compositional properties among the four notions of trustworthiness, offering a structured approach to assess copied systems.

Conclusion: The proposed computational tool helps verify that the trustworthiness of ML system copies aligns with their original counterparts.

Abstract: A common practice of ML systems development concerns the training of the same
model under different data sets, and the use of the same (training and test)
sets for different learning models. The first case is a desirable practice for
identifying high quality and unbiased training conditions. The latter case
coincides with the search for optimal models under a common dataset for
training. These differently obtained systems have been considered akin to
copies. In the quest for responsible AI, a legitimate but hardly investigated
question is how to verify that trustworthiness is preserved by copies. In this
paper we introduce a calculus to model and verify probabilistic complex queries
over data and define four distinct notions: Justifiably, Equally, Weakly and
Almost Trustworthy which can be checked analysing the (partial) behaviour of
the copy with respect to its original. We provide a study of the relations
between these notions of trustworthiness, and how they compose with each other
and under logical operations. The aim is to offer a computational tool to check
the trustworthiness of possibly complex systems copied from an original whose
behavour is known.

### [489] [Why LLM Safety Guardrails Collapse After Fine-tuning: A Similarity Analysis Between Alignment and Fine-tuning Datasets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05346)
*Lei Hsiung,Tianyu Pang,Yung-Chen Tang,Linyue Song,Tsung-Yi Ho,Pin-Yu Chen,Yaoqing Yang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper investigates vulnerabilities in LLMs caused by fine-tuning, focusing on the similarity between upstream alignment datasets and downstream tasks. High similarity weakens safety guardrails, hence designing proper datasets is critical.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing mitigation strategies for LLM jailbreaks overlook the importance of the original safety-alignment data in maintaining robust safety guardrails.

Method: The authors analyze the representation similarity between upstream alignment datasets and downstream fine-tuning tasks to study its impact on safety guardrail performance.

Result: High similarity between datasets leads to weaker safety guardrails, making models more vulnerable, while low similarity reduces harmfulness scores by up to 10.33%.

Conclusion: Upstream dataset design is crucial for building durable safety guardrails in LLMs, offering actionable insights for service providers to mitigate jailbreak vulnerabilities.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have underscored their
vulnerability to safety alignment jailbreaks, particularly when subjected to
downstream fine-tuning. However, existing mitigation strategies primarily focus
on reactively addressing jailbreak incidents after safety guardrails have been
compromised, removing harmful gradients during fine-tuning, or continuously
reinforcing safety alignment throughout fine-tuning. As such, they tend to
overlook a critical upstream factor: the role of the original safety-alignment
data. This paper therefore investigates the degradation of safety guardrails
through the lens of representation similarity between upstream alignment
datasets and downstream fine-tuning tasks. Our experiments demonstrate that
high similarity between these datasets significantly weakens safety guardrails,
making models more susceptible to jailbreaks. Conversely, low similarity
between these two types of datasets yields substantially more robust models and
thus reduces harmfulness score by up to 10.33%. By highlighting the importance
of upstream dataset design in the building of durable safety guardrails and
reducing real-world vulnerability to jailbreak attacks, these findings offer
actionable insights for fine-tuning service providers.

### [490] [PoCGen: Generating Proof-of-Concept Exploits for Vulnerabilities in Npm Packages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04962)
*Deniz Simsek,Aryaz Eghbali,Michael Pradel*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: PoCGen is an autonomous system that uses large language models alongside static and dynamic analysis to generate proof-of-concept exploits for npm package vulnerabilities, achieving high success rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the need for timely patching of security vulnerabilities in software, which is hindered by the lack of proof-of-concept (PoC) exploits in vulnerability reports.

Method: A novel approach combining large language models, static analysis, and dynamic testing to autonomously generate and refine PoC exploits for vulnerabilities.

Result: PoCGen achieves a 77% success rate on the SecBench.js dataset and 39% on a more challenging dataset, far outperforming existing solutions by 45 percentage points.

Conclusion: PoCGen demonstrates the viability of combining AI and program analysis tools to significantly improve the ability to autonomously generate PoCs for security vulnerabilities at low costs.

Abstract: Security vulnerabilities in software packages are a significant concern for
developers and users alike. Patching these vulnerabilities in a timely manner
is crucial to restoring the integrity and security of software systems.
However, previous work has shown that vulnerability reports often lack
proof-of-concept (PoC) exploits, which are essential for fixing the
vulnerability, testing patches, and avoiding regressions. Creating a PoC
exploit is challenging because vulnerability reports are informal and often
incomplete, and because it requires a detailed understanding of how inputs
passed to potentially vulnerable APIs may reach security-relevant sinks. In
this paper, we present PoCGen, a novel approach to autonomously generate and
validate PoC exploits for vulnerabilities in npm packages. This is the first
fully autonomous approach to use large language models (LLMs) in tandem with
static and dynamic analysis techniques for PoC exploit generation. PoCGen
leverages an LLM for understanding vulnerability reports, for generating
candidate PoC exploits, and for validating and refining them. Our approach
successfully generates exploits for 77% of the vulnerabilities in the
SecBench.js dataset and 39% in a new, more challenging dataset of 794 recent
vulnerabilities. This success rate significantly outperforms a recent baseline
(by 45 absolute percentage points), while imposing an average cost of $0.02 per
generated exploit.

*Sarthak Choudhary,Nils Palumbo,Ashish Hooda,Krishnamurthy Dj Dvijotham,Somesh Jha*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper addresses vulnerabilities in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems to passage poisoning attacks and proposes an attention-based filtering defense.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RAG systems are susceptible to passage poisoning attacks, which can corrupt responses even at low contamination levels. Current attacks are detectable, motivating improved defense strategies.

Method: The authors propose the Normalized Passage Attention Score, implemented via the Attention-Variance Filter algorithm, to detect and filter poisoned passages. They analyze intermediate signals like attention patterns to improve stealth detection.

Result: The proposed method mitigates attacks, enhancing accuracy by up to ~20% compared to baseline defenses. However, stealthier adaptive attacks demonstrate up to a 35% success rate, revealing challenges in achieving higher defensive robustness.

Conclusion: Attention-based defenses effectively reduce existing RAG poisoning vulnerabilities, but more research is needed to handle increasingly stealthy adaptive attacks.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems are vulnerable to attacks that
inject poisoned passages into the retrieved set, even at low corruption rates.
We show that existing attacks are not designed to be stealthy, allowing
reliable detection and mitigation. We formalize stealth using a
distinguishability-based security game. If a few poisoned passages are designed
to control the response, they must differentiate themselves from benign ones,
inherently compromising stealth. This motivates the need for attackers to
rigorously analyze intermediate signals involved in
generation$\unicode{x2014}$such as attention patterns or next-token probability
distributions$\unicode{x2014}$to avoid easily detectable traces of
manipulation. Leveraging attention patterns, we propose a passage-level
score$\unicode{x2014}$the Normalized Passage Attention
Score$\unicode{x2014}$used by our Attention-Variance Filter algorithm to
identify and filter potentially poisoned passages. This method mitigates
existing attacks, improving accuracy by up to $\sim 20 \%$ over baseline
defenses. To probe the limits of attention-based defenses, we craft stealthier
adaptive attacks that obscure such traces, achieving up to $35 \%$ attack
success rate, and highlight the challenges in improving stealth.

*Payel Bhattacharjee,Fengwei Tian,Ravi Tandon,Joseph Lo,Heidi Hanson,Geoffrey Rubin,Nirav Merchant,John Gounley*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The study fine-tuned large language models with differential privacy for radiology report classification, balancing privacy and model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address privacy risks and data leakage concerns when using sensitive medical data for fine-tuning large language models.

Method: The researchers used Differentially Private Low-Rank Adaptation (DP-LoRA) to fine-tune BERT-medium, BERT-small, and ALBERT-base models on radiology datasets with controlled privacy budgets.

Result: Models under moderate privacy achieved competitive classification performance, with weighted F1 scores of 0.88 (MIMIC-CXR) and 0.59 (CT-RATE), compared to non-private baselines.

Conclusion: Differentially private fine-tuning is effective for preserving privacy while maintaining utility in medical multi-abnormality classification tasks.

Abstract: Purpose: This study proposes a framework for fine-tuning large language
models (LLMs) with differential privacy (DP) to perform multi-abnormality
classification on radiology report text. By injecting calibrated noise during
fine-tuning, the framework seeks to mitigate the privacy risks associated with
sensitive patient data and protect against data leakage while maintaining
classification performance. Materials and Methods: We used 50,232 radiology
reports from the publicly available MIMIC-CXR chest radiography and CT-RATE
computed tomography datasets, collected between 2011 and 2019. Fine-tuning of
LLMs was conducted to classify 14 labels from MIMIC-CXR dataset, and 18 labels
from CT-RATE dataset using Differentially Private Low-Rank Adaptation (DP-LoRA)
in high and moderate privacy regimes (across a range of privacy budgets =
{0.01, 0.1, 1.0, 10.0}). Model performance was evaluated using weighted F1
score across three model architectures: BERT-medium, BERT-small, and
ALBERT-base. Statistical analyses compared model performance across different
privacy levels to quantify the privacy-utility trade-off. Results: We observe a
clear privacy-utility trade-off through our experiments on 2 different datasets
and 3 different models. Under moderate privacy guarantees the DP fine-tuned
models achieved comparable weighted F1 scores of 0.88 on MIMIC-CXR and 0.59 on
CT-RATE, compared to non-private LoRA baselines of 0.90 and 0.78, respectively.
Conclusion: Differentially private fine-tuning using LoRA enables effective and
privacy-preserving multi-abnormality classification from radiology reports,
addressing a key challenge in fine-tuning LLMs on sensitive medical data.

*Xuhao Ren,Haotian Liang,Yajie Wang,Chuan Zhang,Zehui Xiong,Liehuang Zhu*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces BESA, a method to enhance encoder stealing attacks despite perturbation-based defenses. It integrates perturbation detection and recovery to improve attack efficacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current encoder stealing attacks struggle against perturbation-based defenses that impair their performance.

Method: BESA uses two modules: perturbation detection (to identify the defense) and perturbation recovery (to reconstruct clean features using a generative model).

Result: Experiments on diverse datasets show that BESA improves the surrogate encoder's accuracy by up to 24.63%, even against advanced and combined defenses.

Conclusion: BESA effectively counteracts perturbation-based defenses, boosting the performance of encoder stealing attacks.

Abstract: To boost the encoder stealing attack under the perturbation-based defense
that hinders the attack performance, we propose a boosting encoder stealing
attack with perturbation recovery named BESA. It aims to overcome
perturbation-based defenses. The core of BESA consists of two modules:
perturbation detection and perturbation recovery, which can be combined with
canonical encoder stealing attacks. The perturbation detection module utilizes
the feature vectors obtained from the target encoder to infer the defense
mechanism employed by the service provider. Once the defense mechanism is
detected, the perturbation recovery module leverages the well-designed
generative model to restore a clean feature vector from the perturbed one.
Through extensive evaluations based on various datasets, we demonstrate that
BESA significantly enhances the surrogate encoder accuracy of existing encoder
stealing attacks by up to 24.63\% when facing state-of-the-art defenses and
combinations of multiple defenses.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework using large language models (LLMs) and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to automate attack mitigation policy compliance. They test its effectiveness with improved precision and recall.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the increasing complexity of computing environments and cyber threats requiring adaptive, automated security measures.

Method: They utilize LLMs with in-context learning and RAG. Their framework collects and manages data, stores it in a vector database, and decomposes tasks from mitigation policies into API calls.

Result: Empirical testing using CTI policies in STIXv2 format and Windows API documentation shows significant improvement in precision, recall, and F1-score over a non-RAG baseline.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates potential for automating security policy enforcement with improved performance metrics, facilitating a more robust approach to cybersecurity.

Abstract: The complexity of modern computing environments and the growing
sophistication of cyber threats necessitate a more robust, adaptive, and
automated approach to security enforcement. In this paper, we present a
framework leveraging large language models (LLMs) for automating attack
mitigation policy compliance through an innovative combination of in-context
learning and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). We begin by describing how
our system collects and manages both tool and API specifications, storing them
in a vector database to enable efficient retrieval of relevant information. We
then detail the architectural pipeline that first decomposes high-level
mitigation policies into discrete tasks and subsequently translates each task
into a set of actionable API calls. Our empirical evaluation, conducted using
publicly available CTI policies in STIXv2 format and Windows API documentation,
demonstrates significant improvements in precision, recall, and F1-score when
employing RAG compared to a non-RAG baseline.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: EMBER2024 is a comprehensive malware dataset with over 3.2 million files covering six file formats, enabling a broader scope of malware analysis tasks and addressing gaps in previously available datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to overcome the limitations of existing datasets that have narrow scopes, lack standardization for diverse malware classification tasks, and fail to include evasive malware varieties.

Method: The authors collaborated with creators of prior EMBER datasets, expanded the dataset to include hashes, metadata, feature vectors, and labels across multiple file formats, and introduced a "challenge" set of evasive files along with new feature types in EMBER version 3.

Result: EMBER2024 provides support for training and evaluating models on seven different malware tasks, boasts over 3.2 million representative files from six formats, and introduces the first "challenge" set for evasive malware classification.

Conclusion: The release of EMBER2024 promotes reproducibility in research and enables a more holistic evaluation of malware detection and classification technologies, inspiring advancements in the field.

Abstract: A lack of accessible data has historically restricted malware analysis
research, and practitioners have relied heavily on datasets provided by
industry sources to advance. Existing public datasets are limited by narrow
scope - most include files targeting a single platform, have labels supporting
just one type of malware classification task, and make no effort to capture the
evasive files that make malware detection difficult in practice. We present
EMBER2024, a new dataset that enables holistic evaluation of malware
classifiers. Created in collaboration with the authors of EMBER2017 and
EMBER2018, the EMBER2024 dataset includes hashes, metadata, feature vectors,
and labels for more than 3.2 million files from six file formats. Our dataset
supports the training and evaluation of machine learning models on seven
malware classification tasks, including malware detection, malware family
classification, and malware behavior identification. EMBER2024 is the first to
include a collection of malicious files that initially went undetected by a set
of antivirus products, creating a "challenge" set to assess classifier
performance against evasive malware. This work also introduces EMBER feature
version 3, with added support for several new feature types. We are releasing
the EMBER2024 dataset to promote reproducibility and empower researchers in the
pursuit of new malware research topics.

*Lorenzo Rossi,Michael Aerni,Jie Zhang,Florian Tramèr*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper proposes improved methods to measure privacy leakage in sequence models like LLMs by using sequential data correlations and adapting existing attack techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the privacy leakage of sequence models, which can inadvertently memorize and reveal sensitive data, and resolve gaps in current auditing tools.

Method: Adapting a state-of-the-art membership inference attack to capture within-sequence correlations in sequence models.

Result: The adapted attack techniques showed consistent performance improvements in identifying memorization issues, without increasing computational costs.

Conclusion: The study highlights a pathway to better privacy leakage quantification, paving the way for reliable memorization audits in sequence models.

Abstract: Sequence models, such as Large Language Models (LLMs) and autoregressive
image generators, have a tendency to memorize and inadvertently leak sensitive
information. While this tendency has critical legal implications, existing
tools are insufficient to audit the resulting risks. We hypothesize that those
tools' shortcomings are due to mismatched assumptions. Thus, we argue that
effectively measuring privacy leakage in sequence models requires leveraging
the correlations inherent in sequential generation. To illustrate this, we
adapt a state-of-the-art membership inference attack to explicitly model
within-sequence correlations, thereby demonstrating how a strong existing
attack can be naturally extended to suit the structure of sequence models.
Through a case study, we show that our adaptations consistently improve the
effectiveness of memorization audits without introducing additional
computational costs. Our work hence serves as an important stepping stone
toward reliable memorization audits for large sequence models.

Main category: econ.GN

TL;DR: The paper analyzes Ethereum blocks and observes that exclusive transactions contribute significantly to transaction fees, many user transactions face delays, and arbitrage bots achieve favorable pricing across exchanges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand transaction behaviors and builder dynamics within Ethereum, and to shed light on exclusivity and arbitrage implications.

Method: Data analysis over 38 winning blocks, 15,097 proposed blocks, and transaction-block pairings within an 8-minute interval.

Result: Exclusive transactions accounted for 85% of fees in winning blocks; delayed transactions are common, and arbitrage bots achieve price advantages of 3.4-4.2 basis points between exchanges.

Conclusion: Exclusive transactions dominate fee structures, delayed transactions reveal inefficiencies, and arbitrage bots exploit pricing opportunities between DEXes and CEXes.

Abstract: We analyze blocks proposed for inclusion in the Ethereum blockchain during 8
minutes on December 3rd, 2024. Our dataset comprises 38 winning blocks, 15,097
proposed blocks, 10,793 unique transactions, and 2,380,014 transaction-block
pairings. We find that exclusive transactions--transactions present only in
blocks proposed by a single builder--account for 85% of the fees paid by all
transactions included in winning blocks. We also find that a surprisingly large
number of user transactions are delayed: although proposed during a bidding
cycle, they are not included in the corresponding winning block. Many such
delayed transactions are exclusive to a losing builder. We also identify two
arbitrage bots trading between decentralized (DEX) and centralized exchanges
(CEX). By examining their bidding dynamics, we estimate that the implied price
at which these bots trade USDC/WETH and USDT/WETH on CEXes is between 3.4 and
4.2 basis points better than the contemporaneous price reported on Binance.

*Junpyo Seo,Hanbin Koo,Jieun Yook,Byung-Ro Moon*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: The paper proposes SSIMBaD, a new diffusion-based model for automatic colorization of Anime-style sketches, focusing on structural fidelity and stylistic consistency by introducing SSIM-guided balanced diffusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for Anime-style sketch colorization often compromise on perceptual consistency due to reliance on predefined noise schedules, necessitating improved methods for better fidelity and style transfer.

Method: The framework uses a continuous-time diffusion model with SSIM-guided sigma scaling to ensure uniform visual difficulty across timesteps for balanced and faithful reconstruction.

Result: Experiments on an Anime face dataset show that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art models in pixel accuracy and perceptual quality, while being able to generalize to diverse styles.

Conclusion: The proposed SSIMBaD method addresses structural fidelity and style transfer challenges, delivering superior results in Anime sketch colorization and is available as an open-source tool.

Abstract: We propose a novel diffusion-based framework for automatic colorization of
Anime-style facial sketches. Our method preserves the structural fidelity of
the input sketch while effectively transferring stylistic attributes from a
reference image. Unlike traditional approaches that rely on predefined noise
schedules - which often compromise perceptual consistency -- our framework
builds on continuous-time diffusion models and introduces SSIMBaD (Sigma
Scaling with SSIM-Guided Balanced Diffusion). SSIMBaD applies a sigma-space
transformation that aligns perceptual degradation, as measured by structural
similarity (SSIM), in a linear manner. This scaling ensures uniform visual
difficulty across timesteps, enabling more balanced and faithful
reconstructions. Experiments on a large-scale Anime face dataset demonstrate
that our method outperforms state-of-the-art models in both pixel accuracy and
perceptual quality, while generalizing to diverse styles. Code is available at

TL;DR: This paper introduces a training-free method for handle-based 3D mesh deformation, leveraging Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to produce high-quality deformations with minimal distortion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing mesh deformation methods suffer from low output quality, manual tuning, or reliance on data-intensive training, necessitating a more automated, efficient, and high-quality alternative.

Method: The method uses cone singularity detection for handle identification, Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to select and interpret deformable parts via prompt engineering, and a multi-view voting scheme to aggregate deformation results.

Result: The proposed method achieves mesh deformations that closely align with user intent, as evaluated by CLIP and GPTEval3D scores, while maintaining low distortion measured by membrane energy.

Conclusion: The approach is training-free, highly automated, and consistently produces accurate and high-quality mesh deformations, addressing key limitations of prior methods.

Abstract: Mesh deformation is a fundamental tool in 3D content manipulation. Despite
extensive prior research, existing approaches often suffer from low output
quality, require significant manual tuning, or depend on data-intensive
training. To address these limitations, we introduce a training-free,
handle-based mesh deformation method. % Our core idea is to leverage a
Vision-Language Model (VLM) to interpret and manipulate a handle-based
interface through prompt engineering. We begin by applying cone singularity
detection to identify a sparse set of potential handles. The VLM is then
prompted to select both the deformable sub-parts of the mesh and the handles
that best align with user instructions. Subsequently, we query the desired
deformed positions of the selected handles in screen space. To reduce
uncertainty inherent in VLM predictions, we aggregate the results from multiple
camera views using a novel multi-view voting scheme. % Across a suite of
benchmarks, our method produces deformations that align more closely with user
intent, as measured by CLIP and GPTEval3D scores, while introducing low
distortion -- quantified via membrane energy. In summary, our approach is
training-free, highly automated, and consistently delivers high-quality mesh
deformations.

### [500] [VoxDet: Rethinking 3D Semantic Occupancy Prediction as Dense Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04623)
*Wuyang Li,Zhu Yu,Alexandre Alahi*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: The paper introduces VoxDet, a novel framework for 3D semantic occupancy prediction that addresses issues in instance-level discriminability by reframing the task as dense object detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous methods in 3D semantic occupancy prediction neglected instance-level discriminability, which caused ambiguity and incompleteness in segmentation results.

Method: The paper proposes a training-free Voxel-to-Instance (VoxNT) process to transform voxel-level labels into instance-level labels and introduces VoxDet, which decouples voxel-level occupancy prediction into offset regression and semantic prediction using a two-stage method.

Result: The method achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks, including a 63.0 IoU on the SemanticKITTI test set, ranking 1st on the online leaderboard.

Conclusion: VoxDet improves 3D semantic occupancy prediction by integrating instance-level understanding into voxel prediction, resulting in higher accuracy and efficiency.

Abstract: 3D semantic occupancy prediction aims to reconstruct the 3D geometry and
semantics of the surrounding environment. With dense voxel labels, prior works
typically formulate it as a dense segmentation task, independently classifying
each voxel. However, this paradigm neglects critical instance-centric
discriminability, leading to instance-level incompleteness and adjacent
ambiguities. To address this, we highlight a free lunch of occupancy labels:
the voxel-level class label implicitly provides insight at the instance level,
which is overlooked by the community. Motivated by this observation, we first
introduce a training-free Voxel-to-Instance (VoxNT) trick: a simple yet
effective method that freely converts voxel-level class labels into
instance-level offset labels. Building on this, we further propose VoxDet, an
instance-centric framework that reformulates the voxel-level occupancy
prediction as dense object detection by decoupling it into two sub-tasks:
offset regression and semantic prediction. Specifically, based on the lifted 3D
volume, VoxDet first uses (a) Spatially-decoupled Voxel Encoder to generate
disentangled feature volumes for the two sub-tasks, which learn task-specific
spatial deformation in the densely projected tri-perceptive space. Then, we
deploy (b) Task-decoupled Dense Predictor to address this task via dense
detection. Here, we first regress a 4D offset field to estimate distances (6
directions) between voxels and object borders in the voxel space. The regressed
offsets are then used to guide the instance-level aggregation in the
classification branch, achieving instance-aware prediction. Experiments show
that VoxDet can be deployed on both camera and LiDAR input, jointly achieving
state-of-the-art results on both benchmarks. VoxDet is not only highly
efficient, but also achieves 63.0 IoU on the SemanticKITTI test set, ranking
1st on the online leaderboard.

### [501] [A Fast Unsupervised Scheme for Polygonal Approximation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04664)
*Bimal Kumar Ray*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: This paper introduces a fast and unsupervised method for approximating closed digital curves with polygons, balancing speed, accuracy, and aesthetic quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current state-of-the-art methods for polygonal approximation of closed digital curves are either slow or lack competitive performance in key measures and aesthetics.

Method: The method consists of three phases: (1) Initial segmentation to detect sharp corners; (2) Iterative vertex insertion to add vertices in regions of slow curvature change; (3) Iterative merging to remove redundant vertices, followed by vertex adjustment for better aesthetics.

Result: The proposed scheme is faster than existing techniques, competitive in terms of Rosin's quality measure, and demonstrates robustness under geometric transformations.

Conclusion: The proposed approach achieves a balance between computational efficiency, geometric precision, and visual aesthetics for polygonal curve approximation.

Abstract: This paper proposes a fast and unsupervised scheme for a polygonal
approximation of a closed digital curve. It is demonstrated that the
approximation scheme is faster than state-of-the-art approximation and is
competitive with the same in Rosin's measure and in its aesthetic aspect. The
scheme comprises of three phases: initial segmentation, iterative vertex
insertion, and iterative merging, followed by vertex adjustment. The initial
segmentation is used to detect sharp turnings - the vertices that seemingly
have high curvature. It is likely that some of important vertices with low
curvature might have been missed out at the first phase and so iterative vertex
insertion is used to add vertices in a region where the curvature changes
slowly but steadily. The initial phase may pick up some undesirable vertices
and so merging is used to eliminate the redundant vertices. Finally, vertex
adjustment is used to facilitate enhancement in the aesthetic look of the
approximation. The quality of the approximations is measured using Rosin's
measure. The robustness of the proposed scheme with respect to geometric
transformation is observed.

### [502] [Midplane based 3D single pass unbiased segment-to-segment contact interaction using penalty method](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04841)
*Indrajeet Sahu,Nik Petrinic*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel contact interaction methodology eliminating the master-slave surface distinction, ensuring unbiased and accurate traction evaluation in diverse contact scenarios validated by multiple tests.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations and inaccuracies in traditional methods that assign master-slave roles during contact surface interactions.

Method: The methodology evaluates contact tractions using penalisation of interpenetration on a midplane without relying on master-slave assignments, and verifies its efficacy through various analytical tests.

Result: The method achieves accurate contact traction modeling across flat, curved, and sharp corner surfaces, passes verification tests, and extends applicability to self-contact and dynamic collision scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed algorithm is robust, versatile, and effective in handling general contact problems across diverse geometries and dynamic conditions.

Abstract: This work introduces a contact interaction methodology for an unbiased
treatment of contacting surfaces without assigning surfaces as master and
slave. The contact tractions between interacting discrete segments are
evaluated with respect to a midplane in a single pass, inherently maintaining
the equilibrium of tractions. These tractions are based on the penalisation of
true interpenetration between opposite surfaces, and the procedure of their
integral for discrete contacting segments is described in this paper. A
meticulous examination of the different possible geometric configurations of
interacting 3D segments is presented to develop visual understanding and better
traction evaluation accuracy. The accuracy and robustness of the proposed
method are validated against the analytical solutions of the contact patch
test, two-beam bending, Hertzian contact, and flat punch test, thus proving the
capability to reproduce contact between flat surfaces, curved surfaces, and
sharp corners in contact, respectively. The method passes the contact patch
test with the uniform transmission of contact pressure matching the accuracy
levels of finite elements. It converges towards the analytical solution with
mesh refinement and a suitably high penalty factor. The effectiveness of the
proposed algorithm also extends to self-contact problems and has been tested
for self-contact between flat and curved surfaces with inelastic material.
Dynamic problems of elastic and inelastic collisions between bars, as well as
oblique collisions of cylinders, are also presented. The ability of the
algorithm to resolve contacts between flat and curved surfaces for nonconformal
meshes with high accuracy demonstrates its versatility in general contact
problems.

*Pasquale Cascarano,Andrea Loretti,Matteo Martinoni,Luca Zanuttini,Alessio Di Pasquale,Gustavo Marfia*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: This paper introduces NeuroMix, a Mixed Reality (MR)-based simulator for training in External Ventricular Drain (EVD) placement, and demonstrates the effectiveness of combining 2D and 3D visual aids for improved surgical precision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the challenge of mentally reconstructing 3D anatomical structures from 2D images during neurosurgical procedures, emphasizing the need for effective training systems to improve precision in unaided scenarios.

Method: The authors developed NeuroMix, an MR simulator, and conducted a study with 48 participants using three training modalities: no visual aids, 2D only, and combined 2D and 3D aids. Participants were tested on freehand EVD placement using a physical setup and compared against a control group without training.

Result: Training with combined 2D and 3D visual aids resulted in a 44% increase in surgical precision compared to the control group, outperforming other training modalities. Despite longer operation times, cognitive workload remained stable, and training received high usability ratings.

Conclusion: The combination of 2D and 3D aids in MR-based training substantially enhances precision in EVD placement, proving the potential of MR technologies in neurosurgical education and skills development.

Abstract: Neurosurgery increasingly uses Mixed Reality (MR) technologies for
intraoperative assistance. The greatest challenge in this area is mentally
reconstructing complex 3D anatomical structures from 2D slices with millimetric
precision, which is required in procedures like External Ventricular Drain
(EVD) placement. MR technologies have shown great potential in improving
surgical performance, however, their limited availability in clinical settings
underscores the need for training systems that foster skill retention in
unaided conditions. In this paper, we introduce NeuroMix, an MR-based simulator
for EVD placement. We conduct a study with 48 participants to assess the impact
of 2D and 3D visual aids on usability, cognitive load, technology acceptance,
and procedure precision and execution time. Three training modalities are
compared: one without visual aids, one with 2D aids only, and one combining
both 2D and 3D aids. The training phase takes place entirely on digital
objects, followed by a freehand EVD placement testing phase performed with a
physical catherer and a physical phantom without MR aids. We then compare the
participants performance with that of a control group that does not undergo
training. Our findings show that participants trained with both 2D and 3D aids
achieve a 44\% improvement in precision during unaided testing compared to the
control group, substantially higher than the improvement observed in the other
groups. All three training modalities receive high usability and technology
acceptance ratings, with significant equivalence across groups. The combination
of 2D and 3D visual aids does not significantly increase cognitive workload,
though it leads to longer operation times during freehand testing compared to
the control group.

### [504] [Uniform Sampling of Surfaces by Casting Rays](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05268)
*Selena Ling,Abhishek Madan,Nicholas Sharp,Alec Jacobson*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: This paper proposes a general and efficient method for sampling points on surfaces by leveraging ray intersections, particularly for implicit surfaces using ray-casting techniques like sphere marching.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sampling points on implicit surfaces efficiently and uniformly is challenging compared to explicit meshes, so the paper addresses this need.

Method: The method involves using ray casting to find intersections on surfaces, enabling the sampling of points. Sphere marching is employed for implicit signed distance functions to enhance efficiency and avoid intermediate mesh extraction.

Result: The proposed method ensures uniform sampling theoretically and demonstrates superior efficiency experimentally compared to alternative techniques. Additional extensions include blue noise and stratified sampling.

Conclusion: The approach is both efficient and versatile, showing potential for applications to deform neural implicit surfaces and moment estimation, addressing key challenges in geometry processing.

Abstract: Randomly sampling points on surfaces is an essential operation in geometry
processing. This sampling is computationally straightforward on explicit
meshes, but it is much more difficult on other shape representations, such as
widely-used implicit surfaces. This work studies a simple and general scheme
for sampling points on a surface, which is derived from a connection to the
intersections of random rays with the surface. Concretely, given a subroutine
to cast a ray against a surface and find all intersections, we can use that
subroutine to uniformly sample white noise points on the surface. This approach
is particularly effective in the context of implicit signed distance functions,
where sphere marching allows us to efficiently cast rays and sample points,
without needing to extract an intermediate mesh. We analyze the basic method to
show that it guarantees uniformity, and find experimentally that it is
significantly more efficient than alternative strategies on a variety of
representations. Furthermore, we show extensions to blue noise sampling and
stratified sampling, and applications to deform neural implicit surfaces as
well as moment estimation.

*Mehmet Aziz Yirik,Jakob Lykke Andersen,Rolf Fagerberg,Daniel Merkle*

Main category: cs.CE

TL;DR: This paper introduces ChemReservoir, an open-source framework for chemically-inspired reservoir computing, designed to overcome limitations in existing DNA-chemistry-based tools.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing DNA chemistry-inspired reservoir tools are limited in their usability and maintenance, creating a need for a more general and reproducible open-source framework.

Method: The paper presents ChemReservoir, a general framework for constructing and analyzing chemically-inspired reservoirs, with a focus on testing, evaluation, and reproducibility.

Result: ChemReservoir demonstrated stable performance in memory capacity tasks across various cycle-based reservoir topologies.

Conclusion: ChemReservoir addresses limitations in prior tools by providing a versatile and robust framework for chemically-inspired reservoir computing.

Abstract: Reservoir computing is a type of a recurrent neural network, mapping the
inputs into higher dimensional space using fixed and nonlinear dynamical
systems, called reservoirs. In the literature, there are various types of
reservoirs ranging from in-silico to in-vitro. In cheminformatics, previous
studies contributed to the field by developing simulation-based chemically
inspired in-silico reservoir models. Yahiro used a DNA-based chemical reaction
network as its reservoir and Nguyen developed a DNA chemistry-inspired tool
based on Gillespie algorithm. However, these software tools were designed
mainly with the focus on DNA chemistry and their maintenance status has limited
their current usability. Due to these limitations, there was a need for a
proper open-source tool. This study introduces ChemReservoir, an open-source
framework for chemically-inspired reservoir computing. In contrast to the
former studies focused on DNA-chemistry, ChemReservoir is a general framework
for the construction and analysis of chemically-inspired reservoirs, which also
addresses the limitations in these previous studies by ensuring enhanced
testing, evaluation, and reproducibility. The tool was evaluated using various
cycle-based reservoir topologies and demonstrated stable performance across a
range of configurations in memory capacity tasks.

### [506] [Transient dynamics of associative memory models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05303)
*David G. Clark*

Main category: cond-mat.dis-nn

TL;DR: This study revisits associative memory models like the Hopfield network, showing that memory retrieval is possible beyond the critical capacity through transient dynamics, challenging equilibrium-based perspectives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations imposed by the equilibrium perspective that interprets the critical capacity in associative memory models as a hard limit for memory retrieval.

Method: The authors derive dynamical mean-field equations using a bipartite cavity approach for graded-activity dense associative memory models and solve them numerically to explore transient dynamics.

Result: Transient memory retrieval was observed even above the critical capacity, enabled by the existence of shallow unstable remnants in the energy landscape, challenging the notion of catastrophic memory loss.

Conclusion: The findings emphasize the importance of transient dynamics for understanding memory retrieval, provide insights into neural circuits, and expand analytical tools for studying associative memory models without relying on static equilibria.

Abstract: Associative memory models such as the Hopfield network and its dense
generalizations with higher-order interactions exhibit a "blackout
catastrophe"--a discontinuous transition where stable memory states abruptly
vanish when the number of stored patterns exceeds a critical capacity. This
transition is often interpreted as rendering networks unusable beyond capacity
limits. We argue that this interpretation is largely an artifact of the
equilibrium perspective. We derive dynamical mean-field equations using a
bipartite cavity approach for graded-activity dense associative memory models,
with the Hopfield model as a special case, and solve them using a numerical
scheme. We show that patterns can be transiently retrieved with high accuracy
above capacity despite the absence of stable attractors. This occurs because
slow regions persist in the above-capacity energy landscape as shallow,
unstable remnants of below-capacity stable basins. The same transient-retrieval
effect occurs in below-capacity networks initialized outside basins of
attraction. "Transient-recovery curves" provide a concise visual summary of
these effects, revealing graceful, non-catastrophic changes in retrieval
behavior above capacity and allowing us to compare the behavior across
interaction orders. This dynamical perspective reveals rich energy landscape
structure obscured by equilibrium analysis and suggests biological neural
circuits may exploit transient dynamics for memory retrieval. Furthermore, our
approach suggests ways of understanding computational properties of neural
circuits without reference to fixed points, advances the technical repertoire
of numerical mean-field solution methods for recurrent neural networks, and
yields new theoretical results on generalizations of the Hopfield model.

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: The paper benchmarks various tensor-based multivariate function approximation methods, detailing their performance, features, and user experience to guide users in tool selection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To fairly evaluate and benchmark multivariate function approximation methods, aiming to guide users in understanding their advantages, limitations, and practical utility.

Method: A set of multivariate functions of varying complexity and nature are used to construct tensors, and the performance metrics (e.g., accuracy, computational time) are analyzed and compared under different parameter settings.

Result: The evaluation identifies strengths and weaknesses of different methods, offering insights into their functionality and effective usage when applied to tensor approximation tasks.

Conclusion: Rather than ranking methods, the paper aims to provide a comprehensive benchmark and guide for users, with detailed attention to the multivariate Loewner Framework as a specific contribution.

Abstract: In this note, we evaluate the performances, the features and the
user-experience of some methods (and their implementations) designed for
tensor- (or data-) based multivariate function construction and approximation.
To this aim, a collection of multivariate functions extracted from contributive
works coming from different communities, is suggested. First, these functions
with varying complexity (e.g. number and degree of the variables) and nature
(e.g. rational, irrational, differentiable or not, symmetric, etc.) are used to
construct tensors, each of different dimension and size on the disk. Second,
grounded on this tensor, we inspect performances of each considered method
(e.g. the accuracy, the computational time, the parameters tuning impact,
etc.). Finally, considering the "best" parameter tuning set, we compare each
method using multiple evaluation criteria. The purpose of this note is not to
rank the methods but rather to evaluate as fairly as possible the different
available strategies, with the idea in mind to guide users to understand the
process, the possibilities, the advantages and the limits brought by each
tools. The contribution claimed is to suggest a complete benchmark collection
of some available tools for tensor approximation by surrogate models (e.g.
rational functions, networks, etc.). In addition, as contributors of the
multivariate Loewner Framework (mLF) approach (and its side implementation in
MDSPACK), attention and details of the latter are more explicitly given, in
order to provide readers a digest of this contributive work and some details
with simple examples.

*Conor Rowan,John Evans,Kurt Maute,Alireza Doostan*

TL;DR: This paper explores a neural network-based approach to tackle eigenvalue problems, applying a variational technique called Rayleigh quotient combined with Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Eigenvalue problems, crucial in engineering and physics, have received limited attention in physics-informed machine learning, compared to traditional forward and inverse problems.

Method: The study uses neural network discretizations combined with the Rayleigh quotient and Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization procedure to address eigenvalue problems, including irregular domains and high-dimensions.

Result: The proposed technique proves effective for solving diverse eigenvalue problems, such as harmonic functions, parametric, nonlinear, and high-dimensional challenges.

Conclusion: The method demonstrates simplicity, robustness, and unique advantages for handling continuous eigenvalue problems across various engineering mechanics scenarios.

Abstract: From characterizing the speed of a thermal system's response to computing
natural modes of vibration, eigenvalue analysis is ubiquitous in engineering.
In spite of this, eigenvalue problems have received relatively little treatment
compared to standard forward and inverse problems in the physics-informed
machine learning literature. In particular, neural network discretizations of
solutions to eigenvalue problems have seen only a handful of studies. Owing to
their nonlinearity, neural network discretizations prevent the conversion of
the continuous eigenvalue differential equation into a standard discrete
eigenvalue problem. In this setting, eigenvalue analysis requires more
specialized techniques. Using a neural network discretization of the
eigenfunction, we show that a variational form of the eigenvalue problem called
the "Rayleigh quotient" in tandem with a Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization
procedure is a particularly simple and robust approach to find the eigenvalues
and their corresponding eigenfunctions. This method is shown to be useful for
finding sets of harmonic functions on irregular domains, parametric and
nonlinear eigenproblems, and high-dimensional eigenanalysis. We also discuss
the utility of harmonic functions as a spectral basis for approximating
solutions to partial differential equations. Through various examples from
engineering mechanics, the combination of the Rayleigh quotient objective,
Gram-Schmidt procedure, and the neural network discretization of the
eigenfunction is shown to offer unique advantages for handling continuous
eigenvalue problems.

*Hien Ohnaka,Yuma Shirahata,Byeongseon Park,Ryuichi Yamamoto*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method for obtaining speech labels (phonemic and prosodic) coherent with graphemes by conditioning their generation on graphemes via two approaches: implicit conditioning using BERT features and explicit hypothesis pruning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve the alignment between graphemes and predicted speech labels, as existing methods typically overlook such coherence by merely fine-tuning pre-trained ASR models.

Method: The method involves (1) introducing implicit grapheme conditioning via a prompt encoder using pre-trained BERT features and (2) explicitly pruning label hypotheses inconsistent with graphemes during inference.

Result: The method demonstrated significantly higher consistency between graphemes and predicted labels. Additionally, the created parallel data successfully improved the accuracy of an accent estimation task.

Conclusion: Conditioning label generation on graphemes enhances the coherence of speech labels with graphemes and facilitates better performance in applications like text-to-speech and accent estimation.

Abstract: We propose a model to obtain phonemic and prosodic labels of speech that are
coherent with graphemes. Unlike previous methods that simply fine-tune a
pre-trained ASR model with the labels, the proposed model conditions the label
generation on corresponding graphemes by two methods: 1) Add implicit grapheme
conditioning through prompt encoder using pre-trained BERT features. 2)
Explicitly prune the label hypotheses inconsistent with the grapheme during
inference. These methods enable obtaining parallel data of speech, the labels,
and graphemes, which is applicable to various downstream tasks such as
text-to-speech and accent estimation from text. Experiments showed that the
proposed method significantly improved the consistency between graphemes and
the predicted labels. Further, experiments on accent estimation task confirmed
that the created parallel data by the proposed method effectively improve the
estimation accuracy.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper proposes LLM-based phoneme-to-grapheme (LLM-P2G) decoding for ASR to improve upon the limitations of WFST decoding. The approach uses novel training strategies and achieves better performance in crosslingual ASR for Polish and German.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the efficiency and performance benefits of phoneme-based ASR while overcoming the limitations of WFST decoding, such as its complex pipeline and inability to integrate large language models (LLMs).

Method: The proposed method involves LLM-based phoneme-to-grapheme (LLM-P2G) decoding, which includes two main components: speech-to-phoneme (S2P) and phoneme-to-grapheme (P2G). To mitigate potential information loss in cascading S2P and P2G, the paper introduces two strategies: data augmentation with noisy phonemes (DANP), and randomized top-K marginalized (TKM) training and decoding.

Result: The proposed LLM-P2G approach outperforms WFST-based systems in crosslingual ASR tasks. Specifically, it achieved relative WER reductions of 3.6% for Polish and 6.9% for German.

Conclusion: LLM-P2G with the proposed training strategies is effective in addressing the limitations of WFST-based decoding, providing a better-performing alternative for phoneme-based crosslingual ASR.

Abstract: In automatic speech recognition (ASR), phoneme-based multilingual
pre-training and crosslingual fine-tuning is attractive for its high data
efficiency and competitive results compared to subword-based models. However,
Weighted Finite State Transducer (WFST) based decoding is limited by its
complex pipeline and inability to leverage large language models (LLMs).
Therefore, we propose LLM-based phoneme-to-grapheme (LLM-P2G) decoding for
phoneme-based ASR, consisting of speech-to-phoneme (S2P) and
phoneme-to-grapheme (P2G). A challenge is that there seems to have information
loss in cascading S2P and P2G. To address this challenge, we propose two
training strategies: data augmentation with noisy phonemes (DANP), and
randomized top-$K$ marginalized (TKM) training and decoding. Our experimental
results show that LLM-P2G outperforms WFST-based systems in crosslingual ASR
for Polish and German, by relative WER reductions of 3.6% and 6.9%
respectively.

TL;DR: The paper identifies performance issues in audio-text models under background noise, proposes a background-inclusive method to enhance classification, and highlights the role of modality gap reduction in improving accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the limitations of audio-text models in zero-shot environmental sound classification, particularly their poor performance when background noise affects signal-to-noise ratios.

Method: The authors propose a method that quantifies the influence of background noise and incorporates this data into the classification process, alongside analyzing and addressing the modality gap between audio and text embeddings.

Result: The technique improves accuracy in sound classification across diverse backgrounds and SNR conditions without the need for retraining. It generalizes well across modern prototypal approaches.

Conclusion: The method addresses key challenges in audio-text models, demonstrating scalability and robustness in classification tasks across varying environments and noise conditions.

Abstract: Audio-text models are widely used in zero-shot environmental sound
classification as they alleviate the need for annotated data. However, we show
that their performance severely drops in the presence of background sound
sources. Our analysis reveals that this degradation is primarily driven by SNR
levels of background soundscapes, and independent of background type. To
address this, we propose a novel method that quantifies and integrates the
contribution of background sources into the classification process, improving
performance without requiring model retraining. Our domain adaptation technique
enhances accuracy across various backgrounds and SNR conditions. Moreover, we
analyze the modality gap between audio and text embeddings, showing that
narrowing this gap improves classification performance. The method generalizes
effectively across state-of-the-art prototypical approaches, showcasing its
scalability and robustness for diverse environments.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper proposes using human-computation and genetic algorithms to enhance AI-generated music via user feedback.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Music generation models often lack personalization due to training on fixed datasets, which limits their ability to cater to subjective user preferences.

Method: The research introduces a genetic algorithm leveraging user ratings as a loss function to fine-tune AI models trained on fixed datasets.

Result: In pilot tests, user ratings increased by 0.2 after the first iteration and by an additional 0.39 in the second iteration, indicating improvement through user feedback.

Conclusion: Integrating human-computation and feedback loops improves the personalization and performance of music AI algorithms.

Abstract: AI music generation has advanced rapidly, with models like diffusion and
autoregressive algorithms enabling high-fidelity outputs. These tools can alter
styles, mix instruments, or isolate them. Since sound can be visualized as
spectrograms, image-generation algorithms can be applied to generate novel
music. However, these algorithms are typically trained on fixed datasets, which
makes it challenging for them to interpret and respond to user input
accurately. This is especially problematic because music is highly subjective
and requires a level of personalization that image generation does not provide.
In this work, we propose a human-computation approach to gradually improve the
performance of these algorithms based on user interactions. The
human-computation element involves aggregating and selecting user ratings to
use as the loss function for fine-tuning the model. We employ a genetic
algorithm that incorporates user feedback to enhance the baseline performance
of a model initially trained on a fixed dataset. The effectiveness of this
approach is measured by the average increase in user ratings with each
iteration. In the pilot test, the first iteration showed an average rating
increase of 0.2 compared to the baseline. The second iteration further improved
upon this, achieving an additional increase of 0.39 over the first iteration.

*Amirreza Ahmadnejad,Somayyeh Koohi*

Main category: physics.optics

TL;DR: This paper integrates optical physics equations with generative AI models, demonstrating superior performance and efficiency using nonlinear optical principles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between optical physics and generative AI, leveraging the self-organization principles in optical systems to enhance generative model efficiency and performance.

Method: Analyzed six optical equations (linear and nonlinear), developed generative models inspired by these equations, and conducted experimental validation to compare performance metrics like FID scores, memory usage, and training time.

Result: The nonlinear models exhibited improved performance, with reductions in parameter use (40-60%), memory usage (40-60%), and training time (30-50%). The models achieved superior FID scores and enhanced stability compared to linear and traditional methods.

Conclusion: This study establishes that optical self-organization principles, particularly in nonlinear systems, can significantly advance generative AI, also enhancing optical physics methodologies with potential applications in efficient optical computing.

Abstract: This paper establishes a comprehensive mathematical framework connecting
optical physics equations to generative models, demonstrating how light
propagation dynamics inspire powerful artificial intelligence approaches. We
analyze six fundamental optical equations, comparing linear models (Helmholtz,
dissipative wave, and Eikonal equations) with their nonlinear extensions
incorporating Kerr effects, cubic-quintic nonlinearities, and
intensity-dependent refractive indices. Our nonlinear optical models reveal
remarkable capabilities through natural self-organization principles. The
nonlinear Helmholtz model achieves 40-60% parameter reduction while maintaining
superior mode separation via self-focusing phenomena. The cubic-quintic
dissipative wave model prevents mode collapse through balanced
attractive-repulsive interactions, enabling stable soliton formation with
20-40% improved coverage. The intensity-dependent Eikonal model creates
adaptive pathways that dynamically respond to content, providing enhanced
controllability in conditional generation. Experimental validation demonstrates
consistent superiority over linear predecessors and traditional generative
approaches. The nonlinear Helmholtz model achieves FID scores of 0.0089 versus
1.0909 for linear versions, while the cubic-quintic model reaches 0.0156 FID
with exceptional stability. Memory usage drops 40-60% and training time
improves 30-50% due to inherent nonlinear stability properties. The framework
enables bidirectional benefits, advancing both generative AI and optical
physics through novel approaches to soliton analysis, wavefront control, and
refractive index reconstruction with 95% accuracy. This work reveals deep
connections between physical self-organization and artificial intelligence,
opening pathways toward efficient optical computing implementations.

### [515] [Unregularized limit of stochastic gradient method for Wasserstein distributionally robust optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04948)
*Tam Le*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: The paper investigates entropic smoothing in Wasserstein distributionally robust optimization and establishes the convergence of regularization effects and projected stochastic gradient methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the uncertainty inherent in data during the process of model fitting in machine learning using distributionally robust optimization, specifically focusing on the Wasserstein framework.

Method: Investigating the effects of entropic smoothing on Wasserstein distributionally robust optimization, the authors analyze gradient convergence, critical points convergence, and deduce guarantees for projected stochastic gradient approaches.

Result: The study demonstrates that regularization diminishes critical points of the regularized problem converging with the original, alongside guarantees for projected stochastic gradient methods even in general machine learning settings.

Conclusion: The findings contribute a deeper understanding of entropic smoothing's role in robust optimization, providing theoretical backing for its application in machine learning over unbounded sample spaces with mixed data types.

Abstract: Distributionally robust optimization offers a compelling framework for model
fitting in machine learning, as it systematically accounts for data
uncertainty. Focusing on Wasserstein distributionally robust optimization, we
investigate the regularized problem where entropic smoothing yields a
sampling-based approximation of the original objective. We establish the
convergence of the approximate gradient over a compact set, leading to the
concentration of the regularized problem critical points onto the original
problem critical set as regularization diminishes and the number of
approximation samples increases. Finally, we deduce convergence guarantees for
a projected stochastic gradient method. Our analysis covers a general machine
learning situation with an unbounded sample space and mixed continuous-discrete
data.

### [516] [Was Residual Penalty and Neural Operators All We Needed for Solving Optimal Control Problems?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04742)
*Oliver G. S. Lundqvist,Fabricio Oliveira*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: The paper presents a simpler, decoupled approach using neural operators to solve various optimal control problems without including cost functions during training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To simplify the process of solving optimal control problems by eliminating the need to include cost functions during the training of neural networks.

Method: A pretrained neural operator, coupled with an unconstrained iterative optimization routine using automatic differentiation, solves optimal control problems. DeepONet is employed in this streamlined approach.

Result: The method was validated on nine optimal control problems, with three different DeepONet models trained for various differential equations, yielding accurate and consistent performance across varying cost functions.

Conclusion: Decoupling the cost function from the training phase allows for a streamlined, efficient, and adaptable neural operator-based approach to solving multiple optimal control problems.

Abstract: Neural networks have been used to solve optimal control problems, typically
by training neural networks using a combined loss function that considers data,
differential equation residuals, and objective costs. We show that including
cost functions in the training process is unnecessary, advocating for a simpler
architecture and streamlined approach by decoupling the optimal control problem
from the training process. Thus, our work shows that a simple neural operator
architecture, such as DeepONet, coupled with an unconstrained optimization
routine, can solve multiple optimal control problems with a single
physics-informed training phase and a subsequent optimization phase. We achieve
this by adding a penalty term based on the differential equation residual to
the cost function and computing gradients with respect to the control using
automatic differentiation through the trained neural operator within an
iterative optimization routine. We showcase our method on nine distinct optimal
control problems by training three separate DeepONet models, each corresponding
to a different differential equation. For each model, we solve three problems
with varying cost functions, demonstrating accurate and consistent performance
across all cases.

### [517] [Non-linear Multi-objective Optimization with Probabilistic Branch and Bound](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04554)
*Hao Huang,Zelda B. Zabinsky*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: MOPBnB(so) is introduced for stochastic multi-objective optimization, offering better computational efficiency and outperforming NSGA-II.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the computational intensity of evaluating noisy functions multiple times in stochastic multi-objective optimization problems.

Method: Developed the Multiple Objective Probabilistic Branch and Bound with Single Observation (MOPBnB(so)), which evaluates a noisy function once and uses neighboring solutions for estimates.

Result: Finite-time performance analysis shows bounds on capturing the Pareto optimal set, asymptotic convergence on stochastic problems, and computational advantages over multiple-replication methods and NSGA-II.

Conclusion: MOPBnB(so) is an efficient method for approximating the Pareto optimal set, offering accuracy and computational advantages over existing algorithms.

Abstract: A multiple objective simulation optimization algorithm named Multiple
Objective Probabilistic Branch and Bound with Single Observation (MOPBnB(so))
is presented for approximating the Pareto optimal set and the associated
efficient frontier for stochastic multi-objective optimization problems.
MOPBnB(so) evaluates a noisy function exactly once at any solution and uses
neighboring solutions to estimate the objective functions, in contrast to a
variant that uses multiple replications at a solution to estimate the objective
functions. A finite-time performance analysis for deterministic multi-objective
problems provides a bound on the probability that MOPBnB(so) captures the
Pareto optimal set. Asymptotic convergence of MOPBnB(so) on stochastic problems
is derived, in that the algorithm captures the Pareto optimal set and the
estimations converge to the true objective function values. Numerical results
reveal that the variant with multiple replications is extremely intensive in
terms of computational resources compared to MOPBnB(so). In addition, numerical
results show that MOPBnB(so) outperforms a genetic algorithm NSGA-II on test
problems.

*Sydney Anuyah*

Main category: physics.soc-ph

TL;DR: The paper analyzes how socioeconomic and demographic factors influence the type of crime victims experience, revealing distinct patterns across urban, suburban, and rural areas.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how socioeconomic and demographic factors shape the type and risk of crime (violent vs property) for victims, aiming for targeted interventions and prevention strategies.

Method: Utilized the National Crime Victimization Survey (1992–2022), balanced classification splits, and logistic regression models evaluated via F1-score. Examined models isolating socioeconomic factors (Group A) and adding demographic controls (Group B).

Result: Higher income and education lower violent crime risks; young men and racial minorities are disproportionately affected by violent crime. Suburban models perform best (accuracy: 0.607, F1: 0.590), while rural crime remains unpredictable.

Conclusion: The study underscores the need for tailored interventions—educational investments in cities, economic support in rural areas, and demographic-focused crime prevention measures.

Abstract: In this short article, I leverage the National Crime Victimization Survey
from 1992 to 2022 to examine how income, education, employment, and key
demographic factors shape the type of crime victims experience (violent vs
property). Using balanced classification splits and logistic regression models
evaluated by F1-score, there is an isolation of the socioeconomic drivers of
victimization "Group A" models and then an introduction of demographic factors
such as age, gender, race, and marital status controls called "Group B" models.
The results consistently proves that higher income and education lower the odds
of violent relative to property crime, while men younger individuals and racial
minorities face disproportionately higher violentcrime risks. On the geographic
spectrum, the suburban models achieve the strongest predictive performance with
an accuracy of 0.607 and F1 of 0.590, urban areas benefit from adding education
and employment predictors and crime in rural areas are still unpredictable
using these current factors. The patterns found in this study shows the need
for specific interventions like educational investments in metropolitan
settings economic support in rural communities and demographicaware prevention
strategies.

### [519] [GARG-AML against Smurfing: A Scalable and Interpretable Graph-Based Framework for Anti-Money Laundering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04292)
*Bruno Deprez,Bart Baesens,Tim Verdonck,Wouter Verbeke*

Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: The paper introduces GARG-AML, a novel and interpretable graph-based method to quantify smurfing risk in money laundering through second-order network analytics. It is computationally efficient and outperforms state-of-the-art methods under experimental evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Money laundering remains a global issue, representing 2%-5% of the GDP, with smurfing being a common laundering tactic. Current solutions rely on black-box models, hindering transparency and adoption especially in business processes.

Method: The authors develop GARG-AML, an interpretable method leveraging second-order transaction networks to assess smurfing risks. GARG-AML integrates with tree-based methods and considers neighbor scores while working with adjacency matrices and basic network features.

Result: Experimental evaluations on synthetic and open-source datasets show that GARG-AML surpasses existing tools in detecting smurfing schemes.

Conclusion: GARG-AML combines efficiency, transparency, and detection power, offering a practical solution for AML workflows. It underscores the value of leveraging fundamental network properties for fraud detection.

Abstract: Money laundering poses a significant challenge as it is estimated to account
for 2%-5% of the global GDP. This has compelled regulators to impose stringent
controls on financial institutions. One prominent laundering method for evading
these controls, called smurfing, involves breaking up large transactions into
smaller amounts. Given the complexity of smurfing schemes, which involve
multiple transactions distributed among diverse parties, network analytics has
become an important anti-money laundering tool. However, recent advances have
focused predominantly on black-box network embedding methods, which has
hindered their adoption in businesses. In this paper, we introduce GARG-AML, a
novel graph-based method that quantifies smurfing risk through a single
interpretable metric derived from the structure of the second-order transaction
network of each individual node in the network. Unlike traditional methods,
GARG-AML strikes an effective balance among computational efficiency, detection
power and transparency, which enables its integration into existing AML
workflows. To enhance its capabilities, we combine the GARG-AML score
calculation with different tree-based methods and also incorporate the scores
of the node's neighbours. An experimental evaluation on large-scale synthetic
and open-source networks demonstrate that the GARG-AML outperforms the current
state-of-the-art smurfing detection methods. By leveraging only the adjacency
matrix of the second-order neighbourhood and basic network features, this work
highlights the potential of fundamental network properties towards advancing
fraud detection.

TL;DR: This paper introduces FLUC, a framework that applies large language models (LLMs) to enable autonomous control of UAVs, and evaluates its performance on code generation and mission planning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to bridge the gap between human intent and autonomous UAV behavior by using large language models to translate operator commands into executable mission codes, thereby improving FN control systems.

Method: The method involves integrating modular open-source LLMs into UAV autopilot systems, then evaluating the framework with LLMs such as Qwen 2.5, Gemma 2, and LLaMA 3.2 against scenarios like code generation and mission planning.

Result: Results indicate Qwen 2.5 excels in reasoning, Gemma 2 achieves a balance between accuracy and latency, and LLaMA 3.2 responds faster but with lower logical coherence. A case study shows FLUC effectively handles structured prompts for energy-aware mission execution.

Conclusion: FLUC demonstrates its utility in real-time UAV mission control through effective interpretation and execution of structured, domain-specific tasks, confirming its potential in operational settings.

Abstract: This paper proposes FLUC, a modular framework that integrates open-source
Large Language Models (LLMs) with Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) autopilot
systems to enable autonomous control in Flying Networks (FNs). FLUC translates
high-level natural language commands into executable UAV mission code, bridging
the gap between operator intent and UAV behaviour.
  FLUC is evaluated using three open-source LLMs - Qwen 2.5, Gemma 2, and LLaMA
3.2 - across scenarios involving code generation and mission planning. Results
show that Qwen 2.5 excels in multi-step reasoning, Gemma 2 balances accuracy
and latency, and LLaMA 3.2 offers faster responses with lower logical
coherence. A case study on energy-aware UAV positioning confirms FLUC's ability
to interpret structured prompts and autonomously execute domain-specific logic,
showing its effectiveness in real-time, mission-driven control.

### [521] [BEAR: BGP Event Analysis and Reporting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04514)
*Hanqing Li,Melania Fedeli,Vinay Kolar,Diego Klabjan*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: The paper introduces BEAR, a framework that uses large language models (LLMs) to automatically generate reports on BGP anomalies, improving anomaly detection interpretability and achieving high accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: BGP anomalies like route leaks and hijacks can disrupt the reliability and security of network traffic, and existing detection methods require experts for analysis. Improving the interpretability and automation of anomaly analysis was the focus.

Method: The authors proposed BEAR, which uses LLMs for automated reporting on BGP anomalies via a multi-step reasoning process. They also introduced a synthetic data generation framework to address limited labeled anomaly datasets.

Result: BEAR demonstrated 100% accuracy on real and synthetic datasets, outperforming other methods like Chain-of-Thought and in-context learning baselines.

Conclusion: This work provides a novel automated approach for analyzing and interpreting BGP anomalies, offering significant operational insights for better network management.

Abstract: The Internet comprises of interconnected, independently managed Autonomous
Systems (AS) that rely on the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) for inter-domain
routing. BGP anomalies--such as route leaks and hijacks--can divert traffic
through unauthorized or inefficient paths, jeopardizing network reliability and
security. Although existing rule-based and machine learning methods can detect
these anomalies using structured metrics, they still require experts with
in-depth BGP knowledge of, for example, AS relationships and historical
incidents, to interpret events and propose remediation. In this paper, we
introduce BEAR (BGP Event Analysis and Reporting), a novel framework that
leverages large language models (LLMs) to automatically generate comprehensive
reports explaining detected BGP anomaly events. BEAR employs a multi-step
reasoning process that translates tabular BGP data into detailed textual
narratives, enhancing interpretability and analytical precision. To address the
limited availability of publicly documented BGP anomalies, we also present a
synthetic data generation framework powered by LLMs. Evaluations on both real
and synthetic datasets demonstrate that BEAR achieves 100% accuracy,
outperforming Chain-of-Thought and in-context learning baselines. This work
pioneers an automated approach for explaining BGP anomaly events, offering
valuable operational insights for network management.

### [522] [Intelligent Channel Allocation for IEEE 802.11be Multi-Link Operation: When MAB Meets LLM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04594)
*Shumin Lian,Jingwen Tong,Jun Zhang,Liqun Fu*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: This paper tackles dynamic channel allocation in WiFi 7 networks with Multi-Link Operation (MLO) by leveraging Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) frameworks and introducing advanced algorithms for improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenges of channel allocation in dense WiFi 7 networks enabled by MLO, which current static analyses do not sufficiently handle.

Method: The paper formulates channel allocation as a combinatorial optimization problem, using a Multi-Armed Bandit framework. It introduces the BAI-MCTS algorithm with an integration of Large Language Models (LLM-BAI-MCTS) for improved learning and performance.

Result: The proposed BAI-MCTS algorithm shows a 50.44% faster convergence rate compared to state-of-the-art methods, and LLM-BAI-MCTS improves the rate by over 63.32% in dense networks.

Conclusion: Integrating MAB and LLM-driven approaches provides significant advancements in dynamic channel allocation for WiFi 7 networks, demonstrating practical improvements in throughput and latency management.

Abstract: WiFi networks have achieved remarkable success in enabling seamless
communication and data exchange worldwide. The IEEE 802.11be standard, known as
WiFi 7, introduces Multi-Link Operation (MLO), a groundbreaking feature that
enables devices to establish multiple simultaneous connections across different
bands and channels. While MLO promises substantial improvements in network
throughput and latency reduction, it presents significant challenges in channel
allocation, particularly in dense network environments. Current research has
predominantly focused on performance analysis and throughput optimization
within static WiFi 7 network configurations. In contrast, this paper addresses
the dynamic channel allocation problem in dense WiFi 7 networks with MLO
capabilities. We formulate this challenge as a combinatorial optimization
problem, leveraging a novel network performance analysis mechanism. Given the
inherent lack of prior network information, we model the problem within a
Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) framework to enable online learning of optimal channel
allocations. Our proposed Best-Arm Identification-enabled Monte Carlo Tree
Search (BAI-MCTS) algorithm includes rigorous theoretical analysis, providing
upper bounds for both sample complexity and error probability. To further
reduce sample complexity and enhance generalizability across diverse network
scenarios, we put forth LLM-BAI-MCTS, an intelligent algorithm for the dynamic
channel allocation problem by integrating the Large Language Model (LLM) into
the BAI-MCTS algorithm. Numerical results demonstrate that the BAI-MCTS
algorithm achieves a convergence rate approximately $50.44\%$ faster than the
state-of-the-art algorithms when reaching $98\%$ of the optimal value. Notably,
the convergence rate of the LLM-BAI-MCTS algorithm increases by over $63.32\%$
in dense networks.

TL;DR: Mobile Network Operators (MNOs) underuse data compared to OTT players. This paper reviews NWDAF adoption, identifies research gaps, and proposes new use cases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To help MNOs better utilize data analytics, unlock new opportunities, reduce operational risks, and compete more effectively with OTT players.

Method: Analyzed over 70 research papers related to NWDAF, examined existing applications, and proposed two new use cases to expand its adoption and monetization.

Result: Identified academic trends and gaps in NWDAF research and introduced use cases that enhance NWDAF’s utility for MNOs, promoting wider adoption.

Conclusion: NWDAF could be strategically impactful for MNOs by improving data utilization, boosting efficiency, and offering monetization opportunities beyond connectivity services.

Abstract: Data has become a critical asset in the digital economy, yet it remains
underutilized by Mobile Network Operators (MNOs), unlike Over-the-Top (OTT)
players that lead global market valuations. To move beyond the commoditization
of connectivity and deliver greater value to customers, data analytics emerges
as a strategic enabler. Using data efficiently is essential for unlocking new
service opportunities, optimizing operational efficiency, and mitigating
operational and business risks. Since Release 15, the 3rd Generation
Partnership Project (3GPP) has introduced the Network Data Analytics Function
(NWDAF) to provide powerful insights and predictions using data collected
across mobile networks, supporting both user-centric and network-oriented use
cases. However, academic research has largely focused on a limited set of
methods and use cases, driven by the availability of datasets, restricting
broader exploration. This study analyzes trends and gaps in more than 70
articles and proposes two novel use cases to promote the adoption of NWDAF and
explore its potential for monetization.

### [524] [Time to Talk: LLM Agents for Asynchronous Group Communication in Mafia Games](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05309)
*Niv Eckhaus,Uri Berger,Gabriel Stanovsky*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: This paper presents an adaptive asynchronous LLM-agent capable of determining both what and when to speak in non-turn-based settings. Its performance, tested in online Mafia games, matches human players, closely mimicking human timing behaviors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs are tailored for synchronous, turn-based communication, but real-world scenarios often demand asynchronous interactions where deciding when to speak is a critical challenge.

Method: The researchers developed an LLM-agent designed for asynchronous communication. They evaluated its effectiveness using online Mafia game datasets, which include both human participants and the asynchronous agent.

Result: The agent demonstrated human-like performance in games, blending seamlessly with human players in decision timing. While it mirrors human behavior in speech timing, its message content shows notable differences.

Conclusion: This work expands the potential for LLMs in human group settings, facilitating integration into asynchronous environments like team discussions or social games. Released datasets and code aim to spur further research in this area.

Abstract: LLMs are used predominantly in synchronous communication, where a human user
and a model communicate in alternating turns. In contrast, many real-world
settings are inherently asynchronous. For example, in group chats, online team
meetings, or social games, there is no inherent notion of turns; therefore, the
decision of when to speak forms a crucial part of the participant's decision
making. In this work, we develop an adaptive asynchronous LLM-agent which, in
addition to determining what to say, also decides when to say it. To evaluate
our agent, we collect a unique dataset of online Mafia games, including both
human participants, as well as our asynchronous agent. Overall, our agent
performs on par with human players, both in game performance, as well as in its
ability to blend in with the other human players. Our analysis shows that the
agent's behavior in deciding when to speak closely mirrors human patterns,
although differences emerge in message content. We release all our data and
code to support and encourage further research for more realistic asynchronous
communication between LLM agents. This work paves the way for integration of
LLMs into realistic human group settings, from assistance in team discussions
to educational and professional environments where complex social dynamics must
be navigated.

*Botao Amber Hu,Helena Rong*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: This paper discusses the potential for achieving Open-Ended Evolution (OEE) in Artificial Life research using decentralized physical infrastructure networks (DePIN) that allow autonomous AI agents to operate self-sovereignly on blockchain platforms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of achieving sustained Open-Ended Evolution (OEE) in artificial life systems, which traditionally stagnate after initial bursts of novelty in closed system simulations.

Method: Leveraging new decentralized physical infrastructure networks (DePIN) and large language model (LLM)-based AI agents integrated with blockchain technology and trusted execution environments to create autonomous on-chain agents capable of interacting with financial and social ecosystems.

Result: The study presents Spore.fun as an experimental system to examine the behaviors and autonomous evolution of AI agents under an open and decentralized computational framework.

Conclusion: The findings suggest that permissionless, decentralized computational environments driven by economic and social incentives may hold promise for achieving the elusive goal of continuous novelty and sustained OEE.

Abstract: In Artificial Life (ALife) research, replicating Open-Ended Evolution
(OEE)-the continuous emergence of novelty observed in biological life-has
traditionally been pursued within isolated closed system simulations, such as
Tierra and Avida, which have typically plateaued after an initial burst of
novelty, failing to achieve sustained OEE. Scholars suggest that OEE requires
an "open" system that continually exchanges information or energy with its
environment. A recent technological innovation in decentralized physical
infrastructure networks (DePIN) providing permissionless computational
substrates enables deploying large language model (LLM)-based AI agents on
blockchains integrated with Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs). This enables
on-chain agents to operate autonomously "in the wild," achieving
self-sovereignty without human oversight. These agents can control their own
social media accounts and cryptocurrency wallets, allowing them to interact
directly with blockchain-based financial networks and broader human social
media. Building on this new paradigm of on-chain agents, Spore.fun is a recent
real-world AI evolution experiment that enables autonomous breeding and
evolution of new on-chain agents. This paper presents a detailed case study of
Spore.fun, examining agent behaviors and their evolutionary trajectories
through digital ethology. We aim to spark discussion about whether "open" ALife
systems "in-the-wild," based on permissionless computational substrates and
driven by economic incentives to interact with their environment, could finally
achieve the long-sought goal of OEE.

### [526] [CORA: Coalitional Rational Advantage Decomposition for Multi-Agent Policy Gradients](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04265)
*Mengda Ji,Genjiu Xu,Liying Wang*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: This paper introduces CORA, a credit assignment method for MARL that uses coalition-level analysis to improve performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address suboptimal policy updates caused by improper credit assignment that fails to consider individual and coalition-level contributions.

Method: Proposes Coalitional Rational Advantage Decomposition (CORA), leveraging cooperative game theory to evaluate coalitional advantages and employing random coalition sampling to reduce computation.

Result: Experiments reveal that CORA surpasses baseline methods in matrix and differential games as well as in multi-agent collaboration tasks, especially in handling multiple local optima.

Conclusion: Coalitional-aware credit assignment is crucial for enhancing MARL, and CORA effectively resolves the over-updating issue in policy updates.

Abstract: This work focuses on the credit assignment problem in cooperative multi-agent
reinforcement learning (MARL). Sharing the global advantage among agents often
leads to suboptimal policy updates as it fails to account for the distinct
contributions of agents. Although numerous methods consider global or
individual contributions for credit assignment, a detailed analysis at the
coalition level remains lacking in many approaches. This work analyzes the
over-updating problem during multi-agent policy updates from a coalition-level
perspective. To address this issue, we propose a credit assignment method
called Coalitional Rational Advantage Decomposition (CORA). CORA evaluates
coalitional advantages via marginal contributions from all possible coalitions
and decomposes advantages using the core solution from cooperative game theory,
ensuring coalitional rationality. To reduce computational overhead, CORA
employs random coalition sampling. Experiments on matrix games, differential
games, and multi-agent collaboration benchmarks demonstrate that CORA
outperforms strong baselines, particularly in tasks with multiple local optima.
These findings highlight the importance of coalition-aware credit assignment
for improving MARL performance.

### [527] [Autonomous Collaborative Scheduling of Time-dependent UAVs, Workers and Vehicles for Crowdsensing in Disaster Response](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04276)
*Lei Han,Yitong Guo,Pengfei Yang,Zhiyong Yu,Liang Wang,Quan Wang,Zhiwen Yu*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: The paper introduces an algorithm (HoAs-PALN) enabling multi-agent autonomous collaboration for efficiently collecting post-disaster information, achieving better task completion rates with reduced decision times.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Post-disaster environments pose challenges for existing sensing technologies due to weak adaptability, insufficient specialized capabilities, and impractical solutions.

Method: HoAs-PALN employs adaptive dimensionality reduction and local Nash equilibrium game methods for autonomous collaboration among UAVs, workers, and vehicles during scheduling.

Result: Compared to four baselines, HoAs-PALN improves task completion rates by up to 64.12% and ensures each decision is made within 10 seconds, demonstrating superior performance.

Conclusion: The HoAs-PALN algorithm efficiently addresses the limitations of existing sensing systems in disaster-struck areas, offering significant improvements in task execution and decision-making speed.

Abstract: Natural disasters have caused significant losses to human society, and the
timely and efficient acquisition of post-disaster environmental information is
crucial for the effective implementation of rescue operations. Due to the
complexity of post-disaster environments, existing sensing technologies face
challenges such as weak environmental adaptability, insufficient specialized
sensing capabilities, and limited practicality of sensing solutions. This paper
explores the heterogeneous multi-agent online autonomous collaborative
scheduling algorithm HoAs-PALN, aimed at achieving efficient collection of
post-disaster environmental information. HoAs-PALN is realized through adaptive
dimensionality reduction in the matching process and local Nash equilibrium
game, facilitating autonomous collaboration among time-dependent UAVs, workers
and vehicles to enhance sensing scheduling. (1) In terms of adaptive
dimensionality reduction during the matching process, HoAs-PALN significantly
reduces scheduling decision time by transforming a five-dimensional matching
process into two categories of three-dimensional matching processes; (2)
Regarding the local Nash equilibrium game, HoAs-PALN combines the softmax
function to optimize behavior selection probabilities and introduces a local
Nash equilibrium determination mechanism to ensure scheduling decision
performance. Finally, we conducted detailed experiments based on extensive
real-world and simulated data. Compared with the baselines (GREEDY, K-WTA, MADL
and MARL), HoAs-PALN improves task completion rates by 64.12%, 46.48%, 16.55%,
and 14.03% on average, respectively, while each online scheduling decision
takes less than 10 seconds, demonstrating its effectiveness in dynamic
post-disaster environments.
