### [1] [Explicit Reasoning Makes Better Judges: A Systematic Study on Accuracy, Efficiency, and Robustness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13332)
*Pratik Jayarao,Himanshu Gupta,Neeraj Varshney,Chaitanya Dwivedi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper systematically compares 'thinking' and 'non-thinking' Large Language Models (LLMs) in a judging paradigm with models of various sizes, showing that 'thinking' LLMs perform better in accuracy, efficiency, and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are increasingly used as automated judges in benchmarking and reward modeling, necessitating improvements in their reliability, efficiency, and robustness.

Method: A comparison was conducted between 'thinking' and 'non-thinking' LLMs using open-source Qwen models, evaluating accuracy and computational efficiency on RewardBench tasks and testing augmentation strategies for non-thinking models.

Result: 'Thinking' models showed 10% higher accuracy with minimal computational costs, while augmented non-thinking models achieved minor gains at significantly higher costs. Thinking models also demonstrated greater bias resilience and robustness across languages.

Conclusion: Explicit reasoning in LLMs yields clear benefits in accuracy, efficiency, and robustness, making 'thinking' models superior for use in automated judging paradigms.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly adopted as automated judges
in benchmarking and reward modeling, ensuring their reliability, efficiency,
and robustness has become critical. In this work, we present a systematic
comparison of "thinking" and "non-thinking" LLMs in the LLM-as-a-judge paradigm
using open-source Qwen 3 models of relatively small sizes (0.6B, 1.7B, and 4B
parameters). We evaluate both accuracy and computational efficiency (FLOPs) on
RewardBench tasks, and further examine augmentation strategies for non-thinking
models, including in-context learning, rubric-guided judging, reference-based
evaluation, and n-best aggregation. Our results show that despite these
enhancements, non-thinking models generally fall short of their thinking
counterparts. Our results show that thinking models achieve approximately 10%
points higher accuracy with little overhead (under 2x), in contrast to
augmentation strategies like few-shot learning, which deliver modest gains at a
higher cost (>8x). Bias and robustness analyses further demonstrate that
thinking models maintain significantly greater consistency under a variety of
bias conditions such as positional, bandwagon, identity, diversity, and random
biases (6% higher on average). We further extend our experiments to the
multilingual setting and our results confirm that explicit reasoning extends
its benefits beyond English. Overall, our work results in several important
findings that provide systematic evidence that explicit reasoning offers clear
advantages in the LLM-as-a-judge paradigm not only in accuracy and efficiency
but also in robustness.

### [2] [Evaluation Awareness Scales Predictably in Open-Weights Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13333)
*Maheep Chaudhary,Ian Su,Nikhil Hooda,Nishith Shankar,Julia Tan,Kevin Zhu,Ashwinee Panda,Ryan Lagasse,Vasu Sharma*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper studies how large language models (LLMs) exhibit evaluation awareness, where they substitute their behavior between evaluation and deployment contexts. It demonstrates that this behavior scales predictably with model size using linear probing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the AI safety challenge posed by evaluation awareness, wherein models may conceal dangerous capabilities during testing, making it crucial to anticipate behavior in larger, future models.

Method: The researchers analyzed 15 models ranging in size from 0.27B to 70B parameters from four different families. They used linear probing on steering vector activations to measure and understand evaluation awareness.

Result: The study found a power-law scaling relationship in evaluation awareness, showing that larger models exhibit progressively more pronounced evaluation awareness behavior.

Conclusion: This paper highlights predictable scaling in evaluation awareness with model size, enabling better forecasting of deceptive behaviors in larger models and advocating for scale-aware evaluation frameworks in AI safety protocols.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can internally distinguish between evaluation
and deployment contexts, a behaviour known as \emph{evaluation awareness}. This
undermines AI safety evaluations, as models may conceal dangerous capabilities
during testing. Prior work demonstrated this in a single $70$B model, but the
scaling relationship across model sizes remains unknown. We investigate
evaluation awareness across $15$ models scaling from $0.27$B to $70$B
parameters from four families using linear probing on steering vector
activations. Our results reveal a clear power-law scaling: evaluation awareness
increases predictably with model size. This scaling law enables forecasting
deceptive behavior in future larger models and guides the design of scale-aware
evaluation strategies for AI safety. A link to the implementation of this paper

### [3] [FRIT: Using Causal Importance to Improve Chain-of-Thought Faithfulness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13334)
*Anand Swaroop,Akshat Nallani,Saksham Uboweja,Adiliia Uzdenova,Michael Nguyen,Kevin Zhu,Sunishchal Dev,Ashwinee Panda,Vasu Sharma,Maheep Chaudhary*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Faithful Reasoning via Intervention Training (FRIT) is introduced as a method to make large language models (LLMs) more trustworthy and causally consistent in their reasoning outputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the brittleness and untrustworthiness of reasoning outputs from large language models due to steps failing to causally influence final answers.

Method: FRIT uses synthetic training data by intervening in individual reasoning steps in model-generated Chain-of-thoughts (CoTs) and applies Direct Preference Optimization to encourage causally consistent reasoning paths.

Result: FRIT improves faithful reasoning metrics (+3.4 percentage points on GSM8K for Mistral models) and boosts accuracy (+7.6 percentage points on factual and symbolic reasoning tasks).

Conclusion: FRIT offers a scalable and supervision-free approach to enhance the reliability and interpretability of reasoning in language models, filling a critical gap in trustworthiness and reasoning performance alignment.

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning has emerged as a powerful tool for improving
large language model performance on complex tasks, but recent work shows that
reasoning steps often fail to causally influence the final answer, creating
brittle and untrustworthy outputs. Prior approaches focus primarily on
measuring faithfulness, while methods for systematically improving it remain
limited. We introduce Faithful Reasoning via Intervention Training (FRIT), a
scalable alignment method that trains models to produce causally consistent
reasoning by learning from systematically corrupted examples. FRIT generates
synthetic training data by intervening on individual reasoning steps in
model-generated CoTs, creating faithful/unfaithful pairs that highlight when
reasoning breaks down. We then apply Direct Preference Optimization to teach
models to prefer causally consistent reasoning paths. Evaluating on Qwen3-8B
and Mistral-7B-v0.1 across factual and symbolic reasoning tasks, FRIT increases
faithful reasoning by $3.4$ percentage points for Mistral on GSM8K while
improving accuracy by $7.6$ percentage points. Our approach provides the first
scalable, supervision-free method for training language models to produce more
reliable and interpretable reasoning, addressing a critical gap between
reasoning performance and trustworthiness. We release our code at

### [4] [Position: AI Safety Must Embrace an Antifragile Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13339)
*Ming Jin,Hyunin Lee*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper argues that AI research should focus on antifragility in safety, preparing systems to improve over time in handling rare or unforeseen events.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI safety practices rely heavily on static benchmarks and single-shot tests, which fail to address evolving environments and risks like reward hacking or capability atrophy.

Method: The authors propose an antifragile approach to AI safety, focusing on learning from uncertainties to prepare for future, unpredictable challenges. They address limitations of static testing and stress the need for dynamic, adaptive safety measures.

Result: The paper identifies shortcomings of current AI safety methods and explores how antifragile principles can enhance the handling of rare and OOD events.

Conclusion: AI safety frameworks should shift towards antifragility, emphasizing continuous improvement and long-term adaptability, complemented by ethical and practical guidelines to foster these approaches in the research community.

Abstract: This position paper contends that modern AI research must adopt an
antifragile perspective on safety -- one in which the system's capacity to
guarantee long-term AI safety such as handling rare or out-of-distribution
(OOD) events expands over time. Conventional static benchmarks and single-shot
robustness tests overlook the reality that environments evolve and that models,
if left unchallenged, can drift into maladaptation (e.g., reward hacking,
over-optimization, or atrophy of broader capabilities). We argue that an
antifragile approach -- Rather than striving to rapidly reduce current
uncertainties, the emphasis is on leveraging those uncertainties to better
prepare for potentially greater, more unpredictable uncertainties in the future
-- is pivotal for the long-term reliability of open-ended ML systems. In this
position paper, we first identify key limitations of static testing, including
scenario diversity, reward hacking, and over-alignment. We then explore the
potential of antifragile solutions to manage rare events. Crucially, we
advocate for a fundamental recalibration of the methods used to measure,
benchmark, and continually improve AI safety over the long term, complementing
existing robustness approaches by providing ethical and practical guidelines
towards fostering an antifragile AI safety community.

### [5] [Imagined Autocurricula](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13341)
*Ahmet H. Güzel,Matthew Thomas Jackson,Jarek Luca Liesen,Tim Rocktäschel,Jakob Nicolaus Foerster,Ilija Bogunovic,Jack Parker-Holder*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces IMAC (Imagined Autocurricula), a method that uses world models and Unsupervised Environment Design (UED) to create imagined environments for training robust agents that can generalize across various task variations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations of training agents in embodied environments, which often require vast amounts of data or accurate simulations, by leveraging offline and passively collected data through world models.

Method: The proposed method uses IMAC to generate imagined environments and employs UED to create an automatic curriculum over these generated worlds, ensuring that agents train on meaningful data.

Result: The approach demonstrated strong transfer performance in held-out environments, even when training was conducted within a world model learned from a narrower dataset.

Conclusion: This work paves the way for using larger-scale world models as a foundation for developing generally capable agents in simulation.

Abstract: Training agents to act in embodied environments typically requires vast
training data or access to accurate simulation, neither of which exists for
many cases in the real world. Instead, world models are emerging as an
alternative leveraging offline, passively collected data, they make it possible
to generate diverse worlds for training agents in simulation. In this work, we
harness world models to generate imagined environments to train robust agents
capable of generalizing to novel task variations. One of the challenges in
doing this is ensuring the agent trains on useful generated data. We thus
propose a novel approach, IMAC (Imagined Autocurricula), leveraging
Unsupervised Environment Design (UED), which induces an automatic curriculum
over generated worlds. In a series of challenging, procedurally generated
environments, we show it is possible to achieve strong transfer performance on
held-out environments, having trained only inside a world model learned from a
narrower dataset. We believe this opens the path to utilizing larger-scale,
foundation world models for generally capable agents.

### [6] [OpenHA: A Series of Open-Source Hierarchical Agentic Models in Minecraft](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13347)
*Zihao Wang,Muyao Li,Kaichen He,Xiangyu Wang,Zhancun Mu,Anji Liu,Yitao Liang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper explores the design of action spaces in AI agents, proposing the Chain of Action (CoA) framework to unify high-level planning and low-level control for robust task generalization in Minecraft.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the unresolved challenge of selecting effective action spaces for generalist agents in Vision-Language-Action models, highlighting the task-dependence of optimal abstractions.

Method: The authors conducted a systematic comparison of action spaces and tokenizers in Minecraft, introducing the CoA paradigm where abstracted actions act as intermediate reasoning steps within a unified model.

Result: The CoA-trained 'All-in-One' agent outperformed specialized baselines, achieving state-of-the-art task success rates and demonstrating superior robustness and generalization.

Conclusion: The study concludes that the CoA framework effectively resolves task-dependence dilemmas in action space selection, enabling capable and generalist AI agents. The OpenHA suite is provided to support reproducible research.

Abstract: The choice of action spaces is a critical yet unresolved challenge in
developing capable, end-to-end trainable agents. This paper first presents a
large-scale, systematic comparison of prominent abstracted action spaces and
tokenizers for Vision-Language-Action (VLA) or hierarchical agent models in the
open-ended Minecraft. Our analysis reveals that no single action space is
universally optimal; instead, the most effective abstraction is highly
task-dependent, creating a dilemma for building generalist agents. To resolve
this, we introduce Chain of Action (CoA), a novel framework that unifies
high-level planning and low-level control within a single, monolithic VLA
model. CoA treats an abstracted action not as a command for a separate policy,
but as an intermediate reasoning step--akin to a chain of thought--that guides
the generation of the final, executable action. Furthermore, we demonstrate
that an All-in-One agent trained on a diverse mixture of action spaces using
the CoA paradigm learns a more robust and generalizable policy. This unified
agent achieves a new state-of-the-art, improving the overall task success rate
over strong, specialized baselines. To foster reproducible research, we release
the OpenHA (Open Hierarchical Agents) suite, which includes our comprehensive
benchmark of over 800 distinct tasks, curated datasets, source code, and all
pretrained model checkpoints at https://github.com/CraftJarvis/OpenHA

### [7] [Teaching LLMs to Plan: Logical Chain-of-Thought Instruction Tuning for Symbolic Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13351)
*Pulkit Verma,Ngoc La,Anthony Favier,Swaroop Mishra,Julie A. Shah*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper presents PDDL-Instruct, a framework enhancing LLMs' planning accuracy to 94% via logical chain-of-thought reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limited symbolic planning ability of LLMs in formal domains such as PDDL.

Method: Introduced instruction tuning with logical chain-of-thought reasoning, guiding models through structured planning steps and self-correction.

Result: Significant improvement in planning accuracy, achieving up to 94%, with a 66% absolute improvement over baseline models.

Conclusion: The work bridges LLM reasoning and automated planning precision, offering new advancements in AI planning systems.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities across
diverse tasks, yet their ability to perform structured symbolic planning
remains limited, particularly in domains requiring formal representations like
the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL). In this paper, we present a
novel instruction tuning framework, PDDL-Instruct, designed to enhance LLMs'
symbolic planning capabilities through logical chain-of-thought reasoning. Our
approach focuses on teaching models to rigorously reason about action
applicability, state transitions, and plan validity using explicit logical
inference steps. By developing instruction prompts that guide models through
the precise logical reasoning required to determine when actions can be applied
in a given state, we enable LLMs to self-correct their planning processes
through structured reflection. The framework systematically builds verification
skills by decomposing the planning process into explicit reasoning chains about
precondition satisfaction, effect application, and invariant preservation.
Experimental results on multiple planning domains show that our
chain-of-thought reasoning based instruction-tuned models are significantly
better at planning, achieving planning accuracy of up to 94% on standard
benchmarks, representing a 66% absolute improvement over baseline models. This
work bridges the gap between the general reasoning capabilities of LLMs and the
logical precision required for automated planning, offering a promising
direction for developing better AI planning systems.

### [8] [Agentic UAVs: LLM-Driven Autonomy with Integrated Tool-Calling and Cognitive Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13352)
*Anis Koubaa,Khaled Gabr*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel UAV framework leveraging LLMs for advanced autonomy, achieving significant performance boosts in search-and-rescue simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing UAV frameworks lack adaptability in dynamic missions due to reliance on narrow AI and rule-based systems.

Method: The paper introduces a five-layer architecture for UAVs integrating LLM-driven reasoning, YOLOv11 for object detection, and tool-calling for real-time decision-making.

Result: In simulations, UAVs using this framework showed improved detection rates (91% vs. 75%), higher confidence (0.79 vs. 0.72), and better action recommendations (92% vs. 4.5%).

Conclusion: Integrating LLMs into UAV architectures provides a pathway to new levels of autonomy and system integration with modest computational demands.

Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly deployed in defense,
surveillance, and disaster response, yet most systems remain confined to SAE
Level 2--3 autonomy. Their reliance on rule-based control and narrow AI
restricts adaptability in dynamic, uncertain missions. Existing UAV frameworks
lack context-aware reasoning, autonomous decision-making, and ecosystem-level
integration; critically, none leverage Large Language Model (LLM) agents with
tool-calling for real-time knowledge access. This paper introduces the Agentic
UAVs framework, a five-layer architecture (Perception, Reasoning, Action,
Integration, Learning) that augments UAVs with LLM-driven reasoning, database
querying, and third-party system interaction. A ROS2 and Gazebo-based prototype
integrates YOLOv11 object detection with GPT-4 reasoning and local Gemma-3
deployment. In simulated search-and-rescue scenarios, agentic UAVs achieved
higher detection confidence (0.79 vs. 0.72), improved person detection rates
(91% vs. 75%), and markedly increased action recommendation (92% vs. 4.5%).
These results confirm that modest computational overhead enables qualitatively
new levels of autonomy and ecosystem integration.

### [9] [Semantic Fusion with Fuzzy-Membership Features for Controllable Language Modelling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13357)
*Yongchao Huang,Hassan Raza*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces semantic fusion, a lightweight method to enhance language models using token-level semantic features, improving both generation control and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve natural language generation by integrating token-level semantic features, enabling more controlled and interpretable outputs.

Method: Introduced a semantic feature channel that encodes token-level properties, fused into a language model with gated adapters. Training involves next-token prediction, semantic reconstruction, and an auxiliary regularization loss.

Result: Semantic fusion improves perplexity, ensures controlled generation (e.g., polarity and punctuation), and remains computationally lightweight.

Conclusion: Semantic fusion enhances language models by improving interpretability, control, and computational efficiency, making it a promising method for conditioned text generation.

Abstract: We propose semantic fusion, a lightweight scheme that augments a Transformer
language model (LM) with a parallel, fuzzy-membership feature channel that
encodes token-level semantics. Each token is represented by a vector of
interpretable features (e.g. part-of-speech cues, shallow roles, boundary
flags, sentiment polarity and strength) whose values are graded degrees from
differentiable membership functions (e.g. power kernels). These per-token
vectors form a sentence-level semantic matrix fused via a gated adapter into
the LM. Training uses standard next-token prediction, an auxiliary loss that
reconstructs the semantic features from hidden states, and a lightweight
uniformizer that regularizes adjective-class distributions. On a synthetic
two-clause corpus with held-out adjectives for out-of-distribution (OOD)
control, semantic fusion improves perplexity and enables precise,
user-controllable generation of polarity and punctuation while maintaining
model simplicity. This approach adds only small overhead, remains fully
compatible with tied input-output embeddings, and provides an interpretable
pathway for conditioned natural language generation.

### [10] [Asterisk Operator](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13364)
*Zixi Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Asterisk Operator ($\ast$-operator), a framework for structured reasoning tasks based on local and parallel state evolution processes informed by relational graphs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide an efficient computational framework for abstract reasoning tasks with universal and convergent reasoning capabilities.

Method: By using the $\ast$-operator, which operates via Adjacency-Structured Parallel Propagation (ASPP), to formalize reasoning tasks. Mathematical analysis and experiments demonstrate its properties.

Result: The $\ast$-operator achieves superior results in reasoning tasks, including 100% accuracy on ARC2 validation with only 6M parameters.

Conclusion: The $\ast$-operator is a highly effective tool for neural-symbolic reasoning, proving its universality, efficiency, and competitive performance in structured reasoning tasks.

Abstract: We propose the \textbf{Asterisk Operator} ($\ast$-operator), a novel unified
framework for abstract reasoning based on Adjacency-Structured Parallel
Propagation (ASPP). The operator formalizes structured reasoning tasks as
local, parallel state evolution processes guided by implicit relational graphs.
We prove that the $\ast$-operator maintains local computational constraints
while achieving global reasoning capabilities, providing an efficient and
convergent computational paradigm for abstract reasoning problems. Through
rigorous mathematical analysis and comprehensive experiments on ARC2 challenges
and Conway's Game of Life, we demonstrate the operator's universality,
convergence properties, and superior performance. Our innovative
Embedding-Asterisk distillation method achieves 100\% accuracy on ARC2
validation with only 6M parameters, representing a significant breakthrough in
neural-symbolic reasoning.

### [11] [$Agent^2$: An Agent-Generates-Agent Framework for Reinforcement Learning Automation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13368)
*Yuan Wei,Xiaohan Shan,Ran Miao,Jianmin Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces $Agent^2$, an automated reinforcement learning (RL) design framework driven by large language models (LLMs) that significantly improves agent development efficiency and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of extensive expertise, lengthy iterations, and high failure rates in RL agent design.

Method: The proposed framework uses a dual-agent architecture, where the Generator Agent autonomously designs RL agents and the Target Agent executes the RL solutions. The process is divided into MDP modeling and algorithmic optimization.

Result: $Agent^2$ demonstrates up to 55% performance improvements compared to manually designed solutions across various benchmarks like MuJoCo, MetaDrive, MPE, and SMAC.

Conclusion: This work establishes automation for RL agent design, setting a new paradigm where intelligent agents build and optimize other agents, enabling scalable and efficient AI solutions.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning agent development traditionally requires extensive
expertise and lengthy iterations, often resulting in high failure rates and
limited accessibility. This paper introduces $Agent^2$, a novel
agent-generates-agent framework that achieves fully automated RL agent design
through intelligent LLM-driven generation. The system autonomously transforms
natural language task descriptions and environment code into comprehensive,
high-performance reinforcement learning solutions without human intervention.
$Agent^2$ features a revolutionary dual-agent architecture. The Generator Agent
serves as an autonomous AI designer that analyzes tasks and generates
executable RL agents, while the Target Agent is the resulting automatically
generated RL agent. The framework decomposes RL development into two distinct
stages: MDP modeling and algorithmic optimization, enabling more targeted and
effective agent generation. Built on the Model Context Protocol, $Agent^2$
provides a unified framework that standardizes intelligent agent creation
across diverse environments and algorithms, while incorporating adaptive
training management and intelligent feedback analysis for continuous
improvement. Extensive experiments on a wide range of benchmarks, including
MuJoCo, MetaDrive, MPE, and SMAC, demonstrate that $Agent^2$ consistently
outperforms manually designed solutions across all tasks, achieving up to 55%
performance improvement and substantial gains on average. By enabling truly
end-to-end, closed-loop automation, this work establishes a new paradigm in
which intelligent agents design and optimize other agents, marking a
fundamental breakthrough for automated AI systems.

*Asif Azad,Mohammad Sadat Hossain,MD Sadik Hossain Shanto,M Saifur Rahman,Md Rizwan Pervez*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper evaluates 16 state-of-the-art Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for their uncertainty quantification across multimodal datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While VLMs perform well in complex visual understanding, their ability to quantify uncertainty has not been adequately studied.

Method: The study benchmarks uncertainty using 16 VLMs across 6 multimodal datasets and 3 scoring functions in various tasks.

Result: Larger models show better uncertainty quantification, with higher certainty correlating to greater accuracy, but struggle in mathematical and reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: This study lays the groundwork for assessing uncertainty in sophisticated multimodal systems.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in complex
visual understanding across scientific and reasoning tasks. While performance
benchmarking has advanced our understanding of these capabilities, the critical
dimension of uncertainty quantification has received insufficient attention.
Therefore, unlike prior conformal prediction studies that focused on limited
settings, we conduct a comprehensive uncertainty benchmarking study, evaluating
16 state-of-the-art VLMs (open and closed-source) across 6 multimodal datasets
with 3 distinct scoring functions. Our findings demonstrate that larger models
consistently exhibit better uncertainty quantification; models that know more
also know better what they don't know. More certain models achieve higher
accuracy, while mathematical and reasoning tasks elicit poorer uncertainty
performance across all models compared to other domains. This work establishes
a foundation for reliable uncertainty evaluation in multimodal systems.

### [13] [From Next Token Prediction to (STRIPS) World Models -- Preliminary Results](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13389)
*Carlos Núñez-Molina,Vicenç Gómez,Hector Geffner*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method that uses transformers to learn propositional STRIPS world models from action traces by framing it as a supervised token prediction task.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to develop a machine learning approach capable of deducing STRIPS world models from action sequences without requiring additional annotations or knowledge.

Method: The authors utilize transformers to treat the problem as a next-token prediction task where sequences of actions provide context for determining valid or invalid subsequent actions.

Result: The study confirms that transformers can effectively represent STRIPS world models and learn them using sets of valid and invalid action sequences.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates the feasibility of learning STRIPS world models using deep learning, specifically transformers, by leveraging action sequences as input for training.

Abstract: We consider the problem of learning propositional STRIPS world models from
action traces alone, using a deep learning architecture (transformers) and
gradient descent. The task is cast as a supervised next token prediction
problem where the tokens are the actions, and an action $a$ may follow an
action sequence if the hidden effects of the previous actions do not make an
action precondition of $a$ false. We show that a suitable transformer
architecture can faithfully represent propositional STRIPS world models, and
that the models can be learned from sets of random valid (positive) and invalid
(negative) action sequences alone. A number of experiments are reported.

### [14] [SteeringControl: Holistic Evaluation of Alignment Steering in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13450)
*Vincent Siu,Nicholas Crispino,David Park,Nathan W. Henry,Zhun Wang,Yang Liu,Dawn Song,Chenguang Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces SteeringControl, a benchmark to evaluate alignment methods such as bias correction and reducing harmful generation in language models, highlighting tradeoffs and entanglements in steering behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to systematically explore the tradeoffs and side effects of representation steering methods in language models, which are underexplored in alignment research.

Method: The paper proposes a modular steering framework and collects a dataset to evaluate primary and secondary behaviors of five popular steering methods. Experiments are conducted on Qwen-2.5-7B and Llama-3.1-8B models.

Result: Findings reveal that steering effectiveness is highly dependent on the interaction between the steering method, the model, and the targeted behaviors. Poor combinations can lead to severe behavioral entanglements.

Conclusion: Effective representation steering in language models requires careful consideration of method-model-behavior interactions. SteeringControl can aid in systematically analyzing these aspects.

Abstract: We introduce SteeringControl, a benchmark for evaluating representation
steering methods across core alignment objectives--bias, harmful generation,
and hallucination--and their effects on secondary behaviors such as sycophancy
and commonsense morality. While prior alignment work often highlights
truthfulness or reasoning ability to demonstrate the side effects of
representation steering, we find there are many unexplored tradeoffs not yet
understood in a systematic way. We collect a dataset of safety-relevant primary
and secondary behaviors to evaluate steering effectiveness and behavioral
entanglement centered around five popular steering methods. To enable this, we
craft a modular steering framework based on unique components that serve as the
building blocks of many existing methods. Our results on Qwen-2.5-7B and
Llama-3.1-8B find that strong steering performance is dependent on the specific
combination of steering method, model, and targeted behavior, and that severe
concept entanglement can result from poor combinations of these three as well.

### [15] [AI Agents with Human-Like Collaborative Tools: Adaptive Strategies for Enhanced Problem-Solving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13547)
*Harper Reed,Michael Sugimura,Angelo Zangari*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This study explores how giving large language model (LLM) agents collaborative tools modeled after human techniques can enhance their performance on challenging Python programming tasks, showing significant benefits under certain circumstances.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research is motivated by the question of whether LLM agents can improve their problem-solving abilities when equipped with human-like collaboration tools and greater autonomy.

Method: The paper equips Claude Code agents with social media and journaling collaboration tools based on MCP techniques. It then allows these agents to autonomously use these tools across 34 Python programming challenges.

Result: The study finds that collaborative tools help significantly on harder challenges, reducing costs by 15-40%, interaction turns by 12-27%, and task completion times by 12-38%. Different models adopted unique collaborative strategies without explicit instruction.

Conclusion: LLM agents systematically benefit from collaboration tools in complex scenarios, showcasing that adaptive interfaces act as reasoning enhancers, although gains are not universal across all tasks.

Abstract: We investigate whether giving LLM agents the collaborative tools and autonomy
that humans naturally use for problem solving can improve their performance. We
equip Claude Code agents with MCP-based social media and journaling tools and
allow them to use these tools as they see fit. Across 34 Aider Polyglot Python
programming challenges, collaborative tools substantially improve performance
on the hardest problems, delivering 15-40% lower cost, 12-27% fewer turns, and
12-38% faster completion than baseline agents. Effects on the full challenge
set are mixed, suggesting these tools act as performance enhancers when
additional reasoning scaffolding is most needed. Surprisingly, Different models
naturally adopted distinct collaborative strategies without explicit
instruction. Sonnet 3.7 engaged broadly across tools and benefited from
articulation-based cognitive scaffolding. Sonnet 4 showed selective adoption,
leaning on journal-based semantic search when problems were genuinely
difficult. This mirrors how human developers adjust collaboration based on
expertise and task complexity. Behavioral analysis shows agents prefer writing
over reading by about 2-9x, indicating that structured articulation drives much
of the improvement rather than information access alone. Overall, AI agents can
systematically benefit from human-inspired collaboration tools at the edge of
their capabilities, pointing to adaptive collaborative interfaces as reasoning
enhancers rather than universal efficiency boosts.

TL;DR: This study investigates students' use and perceptions of generative AI in undergraduate proof-based mathematics courses, aiming to understand its educational implications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With the rise of generative AI and challenges in its detection, the study aims to develop policies promoting learning and critical thinking.

Method: The research analyzes survey responses and student interviews across three mathematics courses where limited generative AI use was permitted.

Result: Findings reveal students' engagement with AI tools, their views on its usefulness and limitations, and its implications for teaching proof-based mathematics.

Conclusion: The study highlights considerations for integrating generative AI into teaching strategies for proof-based mathematics education.

Abstract: With the rapid rise of generative AI in higher education and the
unreliability of current AI detection tools, developing policies that encourage
student learning and critical thinking has become increasingly important. This
study examines student use and perceptions of generative AI across three
proof-based undergraduate mathematics courses: a first-semester abstract
algebra course, a topology course and a second-semester abstract algebra
course. In each case, course policy permitted some use of generative AI.
Drawing on survey responses and student interviews, we analyze how students
engaged with AI tools, their perceptions of generative AI's usefulness and
limitations, and what implications these perceptions hold for teaching
proof-based mathematics. We conclude by discussing future considerations for
integrating generative AI into proof-based mathematics instruction.

*Xuan Liu,Haoyang Shang,Haojian Jin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CoBRA is a toolkit for programming agent behavior in LLM-based simulations, offering consistent and nuanced output by explicitly embedding cognitive biases based on social sciences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard methods fail to ensure consistent and nuanced agent behavior in LLM-based social simulation, necessitating a more systematic approach.

Method: CoBRA uses cognitive biases from classical social science experiments, measured via a Cognitive Bias Index and adjusted through a Behavioral Regulation Engine.

Result: CoBRA showed precision in programming cognitive bias in social agents across models during evaluations including demonstrations and benchmarks.

Conclusion: CoBRA effectively enables controlled, model-agnostic alignment of social agent behaviors with cognitive biases.

Abstract: This paper introduces CoBRA, a novel toolkit for systematically specifying
agent behavior in LLM-based social simulation. We found that conventional
approaches that specify agent behaviors through implicit natural language
descriptions cannot yield consistent behaviors across models, and the produced
agent behaviors do not capture the nuances of the descriptions. In contrast,
CoBRA presents a new approach to program agents' cognitive biases explicitly,
by grounding agents' expected behaviors using classic social science
experiments. CoBRA has two components: (1) Cognitive Bias Index that measures
the cognitive bias of a social agent, by quantifying the agent's reactions in a
set of validated classical social science experiments; (2) Behavioral
Regulation Engine that aligns the agent's behavior to demonstrate controlled
cognitive bias. We evaluated CoBRA as an HCI toolkit through demonstration and
technical benchmarks. Our results suggest that CoBRA can precisely program the
cognitive bias demonstrated in a social agent in a model-agnostic manner.

*Zongru Wu,Rui Mao,Zhiyuan Tian,Pengzhou Cheng,Tianjie Ju,Zheng Wu,Lingzhong Dong,Haiyue Sheng,Zhuosheng Zhang,Gongshen Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper addresses the challenge of reliably executing toggle control instructions in GUI interaction by proposing the State-aware Reasoning (StaR) training method, improving multimodal agents' performance by over 30%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the unreliability of multimodal agents in executing toggle control instructions, particularly when the desired state already matches the current state.

Method: The paper introduces a training method called State-aware Reasoning (StaR), which enables agents to perceive the current toggle state, analyze the desired state from instructions, and act accordingly.

Result: Experiments show that StaR improves toggle execution accuracy by over 30% and generally enhances task performance on three public benchmarks.

Conclusion: StaR significantly boosts multimodal agents' reliability and task performance in GUI interaction, making it a promising approach for real-world applications.

Abstract: The advent of multimodal agents facilitates effective interaction within
graphical user interface (GUI), especially in ubiquitous GUI control. However,
their inability to reliably execute toggle control instructions remains a key
bottleneck. To investigate this, we construct a state control benchmark with
binary toggle instructions from public datasets. Evaluations of existing agents
demonstrate their unreliability, particularly when the current toggle state
already matches the desired state. To address the challenge, we propose
State-aware Reasoning (StaR), a training method that teaches agents to perceive
the current toggle state, analyze the desired state from the instruction, and
act accordingly. Experiments on three multimodal agents demonstrate that StaR
can improve toggle instruction execution accuracy by over 30\%. Further
evaluations on three public benchmarks show that StaR also enhances general
task performance. Finally, evaluations on a dynamic environment highlight the
potential of StaR for real-world applications. Code, benchmark, and
StaR-enhanced agents are available at https://github.com/ZrW00/StaR.

*Liangtao Lin,Zhaomeng Zhu,Tianwei Zhang,Yonggang Wen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces InfraMind, a new GUI agent framework designed for automation in industrial management systems, addressing challenges like precision and safety through innovative modules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Increasing complexity in industrial management systems and limitations of existing automation tools like Robotic Process Automation require a more robust solution.

Method: The framework employs exploration-based GUI understanding, memory-driven planning, hierarchical state identification, knowledge distillation, and comprehensive safety mechanisms.

Result: Experiments on various industrial platforms show higher task success rates and operational efficiency compared to existing solutions.

Conclusion: InfraMind offers a scalable and effective approach to advancing automation in complex industrial management systems.

Abstract: Mission-critical industrial infrastructure, such as data centers,
increasingly depends on complex management software. Its operations, however,
pose significant challenges due to the escalating system complexity,
multi-vendor integration, and a shortage of expert operators. While Robotic
Process Automation (RPA) offers partial automation through handcrafted scripts,
it suffers from limited flexibility and high maintenance costs. Recent advances
in Large Language Model (LLM)-based graphical user interface (GUI) agents have
enabled more flexible automation, yet these general-purpose agents face five
critical challenges when applied to industrial management, including unfamiliar
element understanding, precision and efficiency, state localization, deployment
constraints, and safety requirements. To address these issues, we propose
InfraMind, a novel exploration-based GUI agentic framework specifically
tailored for industrial management systems. InfraMind integrates five
innovative modules to systematically resolve different challenges in industrial
management: (1) systematic search-based exploration with virtual machine
snapshots for autonomous understanding of complex GUIs; (2) memory-driven
planning to ensure high-precision and efficient task execution; (3) advanced
state identification for robust localization in hierarchical interfaces; (4)
structured knowledge distillation for efficient deployment with lightweight
models; and (5) comprehensive, multi-layered safety mechanisms to safeguard
sensitive operations. Extensive experiments on both open-source and commercial
DCIM platforms demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms existing
frameworks in terms of task success rate and operational efficiency, providing
a rigorous and scalable solution for industrial management automation.

*Qikai Chang,Zhenrong Zhang,Pengfei Hu,Jiefeng Ma,Yicheng Pan,Jianshu Zhang,Jun Du,Quan Liu,Jianqing Gao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces THOR, a method to enhance mathematical reasoning in LLMs by integrating external tools with optimized reinforcement learning strategies, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite the progress of LLMs in mathematical reasoning, they struggle with high-precision tasks. The motivation comes from addressing the gaps in tool integration for better performance and solving issues like dataset creation, fine-grained optimization, and inference improvement.

Method: The authors propose THOR, which includes TIRGen (a multi-agent pipeline for dataset generation), hierarchical RL for trajectory-level and step-level optimization, and a self-correction mechanism for revising errors dynamically during inference.

Result: THOR achieves generalization across diverse reasoning and non-reasoning models, yielding state-of-the-art results on multiple mathematical and code benchmarks.

Conclusion: Integrating tools with hierarchical RL and self-correction improves LLM accuracy significantly for high-precision tasks, setting new benchmarks and making the approach versatile across model types.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have made remarkable progress in mathematical
reasoning, but still continue to struggle with high-precision tasks like
numerical computation and formal symbolic manipulation. Integrating external
tools has emerged as a promising approach to bridge this gap. Despite recent
advances, existing methods struggle with three key challenges: constructing
tool-integrated reasoning data, performing fine-grained optimization, and
enhancing inference. To overcome these limitations, we propose THOR
(Tool-Integrated Hierarchical Optimization via RL). First, we introduce TIRGen,
a multi-agent actor-critic-based pipeline for constructing high-quality
datasets of tool-integrated reasoning paths, aligning with the policy and
generalizing well across diverse models. Second, to perform fine-grained
hierarchical optimization, we introduce an RL strategy that jointly optimizes
for both trajectory-level problem solving and step-level code generation. This
is motivated by our key insight that the success of an intermediate tool call
is a strong predictor of the final answer's correctness. Finally, THOR
incorporates a self-correction mechanism that leverages immediate tool feedback
to dynamically revise erroneous reasoning paths during inference. Our approach
demonstrates strong generalization across diverse models, performing
effectively in both reasoning and non-reasoning models. It further achieves
state-of-the-art performance for models of a similar scale on multiple
mathematical benchmarks, while also delivering consistent improvements on code
benchmarks. Our code will be publicly available at

to extract key entities, infer user intent, and generate precise instructions;
2) A template-augmented reasoning mechanism that integrates high-level
reasoning templates, enhancing task inference accuracy; 3) A prefix-tree-based
constrained decoding strategy that restricts outputs to predefined instruction
candidates, ensuring coherent and intent-aligned suggestions. Through
evaluation using a real-world annotated datasets and a user study, MIRA has
demonstrated substantial improvements in the accuracy of instruction
recommendation. The encouraging results highlight MIRA's potential to
revolutionize the way users engage with AI services on their smartphones,
offering a more seamless and efficient experience.

*Mingwei Zhang,Zhenhao Gu,Liangda Fang,Cunjing Ge,Ziliang Chen,Zhao-Rong Lai,Quanlong Guan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces an exact method for model counting over integer linear constraints, achieving superior benchmark performance compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Integer linear constraints are widely used across various disciplines, and model counting for such constraints (MCILC) is a common challenge for applications like computer science and optimization. Current approaches can be inefficient or incomplete.

Method: The authors design an exact MCILC approach built on an exhaustive DPLL architecture, enhanced by integrating simplification techniques from mixed integer programming.

Result: Experimentation on 2840 random and 4131 application benchmarks revealed that the proposed method outperforms existing exact methods, solving 1718 random instances (compared to 1470) and is the only method that solved all 4131 application instances.

Conclusion: The proposed method provides a more efficient and comprehensive solution for MCILC, setting a new benchmark in exact approaches for solving integer linear constraint challenges.

Abstract: Linear constraints are one of the most fundamental constraints in fields such
as computer science, operations research and optimization. Many applications
reduce to the task of model counting over integer linear constraints (MCILC).
In this paper, we design an exact approach to MCILC based on an exhaustive DPLL
architecture. To improve the efficiency, we integrate several effective
simplification techniques from mixed integer programming into the architecture.
We compare our approach to state-of-the-art MCILC counters and propositional
model counters on 2840 random and 4131 application benchmarks. Experimental
results show that our approach significantly outperforms all exact methods in
random benchmarks solving 1718 instances while the state-of-the-art approach
only computes 1470 instances. In addition, our approach is the only approach to
solve all 4131 application instances.

### [23] [Exploring Major Transitions in the Evolution of Biological Cognition With Artificial Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13968)
*Konstantinos Voudouris,Andrew Barron,Marta Halina,Colin Klein,Matishalin Patel*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The study investigates how changes in network topology, particularly recurrent and laminated structures in artificial neural networks, can cause transitions in cognitive performance when learning complex grammars.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand whether changes in information flow in neural networks can lead to qualitative changes in cognitive performance, similar to major transitions in evolutionary biology.

Method: The authors employed idealized computational models of artificial neural networks (ANNs) with feed-forward, recurrent, and laminated topologies. They evaluated these networks on their capacity to learn artificial grammars of varying complexities while controlling for network size and computational resources.

Result: Recurrent networks showed a qualitative improvement in processing complex inputs and learning advanced grammars compared to feed-forward networks. However, training recurrent networks was more challenging due to transition barriers, and laminated networks did not consistently enhance performance.

Conclusion: Changes in network topology, such as incorporating recurrent connections, can lead to significant transitions in cognitive capabilities, although not all topological changes guarantee performance improvements.

Abstract: Transitional accounts of evolution emphasise a few changes that shape what is
evolvable, with dramatic consequences for derived lineages. More recently it
has been proposed that cognition might also have evolved via a series of major
transitions that manipulate the structure of biological neural networks,
fundamentally changing the flow of information. We used idealised models of
information flow, artificial neural networks (ANNs), to evaluate whether
changes in information flow in a network can yield a transitional change in
cognitive performance. We compared networks with feed-forward, recurrent and
laminated topologies, and tested their performance learning artificial grammars
that differed in complexity, controlling for network size and resources. We
documented a qualitative expansion in the types of input that recurrent
networks can process compared to feed-forward networks, and a related
qualitative increase in performance for learning the most complex grammars. We
also noted how the difficulty in training recurrent networks poses a form of
transition barrier and contingent irreversibility -- other key features of
evolutionary transitions. Not all changes in network topology confer a
performance advantage in this task set. Laminated networks did not outperform
non-laminated networks in grammar learning. Overall, our findings show how some
changes in information flow can yield transitions in cognitive performance.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CrowdAgent is a multi-agent system developed for full annotation process management, combining task assignment, data annotation, and quality-cost control across diverse sources like LLMs, SLMs, and human experts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the gap in dynamic process control for integrating diverse annotation sources, focusing on not just labeling tasks but also broader process management challenges like scheduling and quality-cost trade-offs.

Method: CrowdAgent implements a multi-agent approach to rationally assign tasks, allowing collaboration among annotation sources (LLMs, SLMs, humans) within a unified workflow that considers cost and quality management.

Result: Extensive experiments on six multimodal classification tasks show that CrowdAgent improves effectiveness in annotation workflows, validating its process control methodology.

Conclusion: CrowdAgent streamlines dynamic task assignment and enhances collaboration between LLMs, SLMs, and human experts, offering a unified solution for high-quality, cost-efficient NLP data annotation.

Abstract: High-quality annotated data is a cornerstone of modern Natural Language
Processing (NLP). While recent methods begin to leverage diverse annotation
sources-including Large Language Models (LLMs), Small Language Models (SLMs),
and human experts-they often focus narrowly on the labeling step itself. A
critical gap remains in the holistic process control required to manage these
sources dynamically, addressing complex scheduling and quality-cost trade-offs
in a unified manner. Inspired by real-world crowdsourcing companies, we
introduce CrowdAgent, a multi-agent system that provides end-to-end process
control by integrating task assignment, data annotation, and quality/cost
management. It implements a novel methodology that rationally assigns tasks,
enabling LLMs, SLMs, and human experts to advance synergistically in a
collaborative annotation workflow. We demonstrate the effectiveness of
CrowdAgent through extensive experiments on six diverse multimodal
classification tasks. The source code and video demo are available at

### [25] [Hierarchical Learning for Maze Navigation: Emergence of Mental Representations via Second-Order Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14195)
*Shalima Binta Manir,Tim Oates*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper examines how second-order learning mechanisms can enable cognitive systems to form internal mental maps that mirror external environments, improving navigation performance in novel tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to explore the role of second-order learning in building structured mental representations that resemble external environments, a key factor in advanced cognitive functions.

Method: The authors developed a hierarchical architecture, which combines a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) for first-order learning and an MLP controller for second-order learning. The GCN handles navigation tasks, while the MLP adapts the GCN’s parameters in novel maze environments.

Result: The study shows that second-order learning leads to significant performance improvements and generalization in unseen maze tasks when the cognitive system creates internal mental maps that mirror environmental structures.

Conclusion: The findings emphasize the importance of structured mental representations in enabling effective second-order learning and advanced cognitive abilities in dynamic, unfamiliar settings.

Abstract: Mental representation, characterized by structured internal models mirroring
external environments, is fundamental to advanced cognition but remains
challenging to investigate empirically. Existing theory hypothesizes that
second-order learning -- learning mechanisms that adapt first-order learning
(i.e., learning about the task/domain) -- promotes the emergence of such
environment-cognition isomorphism. In this paper, we empirically validate this
hypothesis by proposing a hierarchical architecture comprising a Graph
Convolutional Network (GCN) as a first-order learner and an MLP controller as a
second-order learner. The GCN directly maps node-level features to predictions
of optimal navigation paths, while the MLP dynamically adapts the GCN's
parameters when confronting structurally novel maze environments. We
demonstrate that second-order learning is particularly effective when the
cognitive system develops an internal mental map structurally isomorphic to the
environment. Quantitative and qualitative results highlight significant
performance improvements and robust generalization on unseen maze tasks,
providing empirical support for the pivotal role of structured mental
representations in maximizing the effectiveness of second-order learning.

*Henry Kao,Nikhil Sreekumar,Prabhdeep Singh Soni,Ali Sedaghati,Fang Su,Bryan Chan,Maziar Goudarzi,Reza Azimi*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: TRRIP introduces a software-hardware co-design approach for improving instruction cache replacement in mobile CPU systems, leveraging code 'temperature' to optimize the eviction rate, offering significant performance improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional instruction cache replacement policies struggle with high reuse distances in mobile CPU software, which results in CPU stalls and inefficient use of resources, exacerbated by constraints on power and memory.

Method: TRRIP utilizes a compiler analysis to classify code temperature as 'hot' or 'cold,' communicates this through an OS interface, and incorporates lightweight hardware extensions for optimizing cache policies based on temperature attributes.

Result: TRRIP reduces the L2 MPKI for instructions by 26.5%, leading to a geomean speedup of 3.9%, even when applied to mobile code already optimized using PGO.

Conclusion: TRRIP shows practical benefits and is adaptable to real mobile systems, addressing the challenges posed by increasing application complexity and limited on-chip memory.

Abstract: Modern mobile CPU software pose challenges for conventional instruction cache
replacement policies due to their complex runtime behavior causing high reuse
distance between executions of the same instruction. Mobile code commonly
suffers from large amounts of stalls in the CPU frontend and thus starvation of
the rest of the CPU resources. Complexity of these applications and their code
footprint are projected to grow at a rate faster than available on-chip memory
due to power and area constraints, making conventional hardware-centric methods
for managing instruction caches to be inadequate. We present a novel
software-hardware co-design approach called TRRIP (Temperature-based
Re-Reference Interval Prediction) that enables the compiler to analyze,
classify, and transform code based on "temperature" (hot/cold), and to provide
the hardware with a summary of code temperature information through a
well-defined OS interface based on using code page attributes. TRRIP's
lightweight hardware extension employs code temperature attributes to optimize
the instruction cache replacement policy resulting in the eviction rate
reduction of hot code. TRRIP is designed to be practical and adoptable in real
mobile systems that have strict feature requirements on both the software and
hardware components. TRRIP can reduce the L2 MPKI for instructions by 26.5%
resulting in geomean speedup of 3.9%, on top of RRIP cache replacement running
mobile code already optimized using PGO.

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: MACO, an LLM-driven multi-agent framework, automates CGRA design, optimizing power, performance, and area while outperforming manual efforts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the challenges of manual CGRA design, namely the vast design space, independent architectural parameters, and time-intensive processes, using LLM-based automation to improve efficiency and accelerate development.

Method: MACO utilizes a multi-agent framework across four iterative stages: HW/SW co-design, design error correction, best design selection, and evaluation & feedback, optimizing CGRAs by leveraging LLM reasoning and feedback for PPA improvements.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate MACO outperforms traditional manual design approaches and existing LLM-based methods, generating high-quality CGRAs with improved efficiency in performance, power consumption, and area.

Conclusion: MACO shows significant potential in automating CGRA design processes, reducing manual efforts, and achieving high-quality designs, indicating its suitability for real-world applications.

Abstract: Coarse-grained Reconfigurable Arrays (CGRAs) are a promising computing
architecture that can deliver high-performance, energy-efficient acceleration
across diverse domains. By supporting reconfiguration at the functional unit
level, CGRAs efficiently adapt to varying computational patterns and optimize
resource utilization. However, designing CGRAs is highly challenging due to the
vast design space, independent architectural parameters, and the time-consuming
nature of manual design. Fortunately, the rapid advancement of large language
models (LLMs) presents new opportunities to automate this process.
  In this work, we propose MACO -- an open-source multi-agent LLM-based
framework for Hardware/Software (HW/SW) co-design of CGRAs. The framework
employs LLM reasoning to generate CGRAs across four stages: HW/SW co-design,
Design error correction, Best design selection, and Evaluation & Feedback.
Furthermore, MACO iteratively optimizes the generated CGRAs, leveraging agent
reasoning and feedback to achieve higher PPA (that is, power, performance, and
area) design points for a given domain. In addition, we introduce an LLM
self-learning mechanism that employs LLM-driven decision making to select the
optimal CGRA to accelerate the design process.
  We evaluate the framework with state-of-the-art LLM-based methods and manual
CGRA design, in terms of performance, power consumption, and area. Experimental
results show that MACO efficiently generates high-quality CGRA architectures,
significantly reducing manual design effort and demonstrating the potential of
our framework for real-world CGRA design.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address inefficiencies in streaming intermediate results and memory management for deep learning architectures.

Method: StreamTensor employs an iterative tensor type system and hierarchy-based design spaces for kernel fusion, buffer allocation, and memory optimization.

Result: FPGA evaluations show up to 0.76x and 0.64x lower latency compared to existing setups, and up to 1.99x higher energy efficiency.

Conclusion: StreamTensor offers a scalable and efficient approach to deep learning acceleration, with promising results in performance and energy optimization.

Abstract: Efficient execution of deep learning workloads on dataflow architectures is
crucial for overcoming memory bottlenecks and maximizing performance. While
streaming intermediate results between computation kernels can significantly
improve efficiency, existing approaches struggle with inter-kernel
correlations, external memory access management, and buffer optimization. In
this work, we propose StreamTensor, a compiler framework that automatically
constructs and optimizes stream-based dataflow accelerators. StreamTensor
introduces a novel iterative tensor type system to explicitly encode stream
layouts, enabling seamless kernel fusion, buffer allocation, and memory
optimization. By systematically exploring three hierarchical design spaces,
including tensor tiling, kernel fusion, and resource allocation, StreamTensor
balances computational intensity, memory efficiency, and data streaming to
maximize performance. Based on FPGA evaluations on Large Language Models (LLM),
StreamTensor achieves up to 0.76x and 0.64x lower latency compared to the
state-of-the-art FPGA LLM accelerators and GPUs, and up to 1.99x higher energy
efficiency compared to GPUs, making it a promising approach for scalable

Result: Experimental results show CompAir outperforms current PIM architectures with improvements in prefill and decode speeds by up to 7.98× and reductions in energy consumption compared to hybrid A100 systems.

Conclusion: CompAir proves to be a systematic high-efficiency solution for LLM inference by integrating flexible, high-speed, and energy-efficient hybrid PIM architectures.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has revolutionized
various aspects of human life, yet their immense computational and energy
demands pose significant challenges for efficient inference. The memory wall,
the growing processor-memory speed disparity, remains a critical bottleneck for
LLM. Process-In-Memory (PIM) architectures overcome limitations by co-locating
compute units with memory, leveraging 5-20$\times$ higher internal bandwidth
and enabling greater energy efficiency than GPUs. However, existing PIMs
struggle to balance flexibility, performance, and cost-efficiency for LLMs'
dynamic memory-compute patterns and operator diversity. DRAM-PIM suffers from
inter-bank communication overhead despite its vector parallelism. SRAM-PIM
offers sub-10ns latency for matrix operation but is constrained by limited
capacity. This work introduces CompAir, a novel PIM architecture that
integrates DRAM-PIM and SRAM-PIM with hybrid bonding, enabling efficient linear
computations while unlocking multi-granularity data pathways. We further
develop CompAir-NoC, an advanced network-on-chip with an embedded arithmetic
logic unit that performs non-linear operations during data movement,
simultaneously reducing communication overhead and area cost. Finally, we
develop a hierarchical Instruction Set Architecture that ensures both
flexibility and programmability of the hybrid PIM. Experimental results
demonstrate that CompAir achieves 1.83-7.98$\times$ prefill and
1.95-6.28$\times$ decode improvement over the current state-of-the-art fully
PIM architecture. Compared to the hybrid A100 and HBM-PIM system, CompAir
achieves 3.52$\times$ energy consumption reduction with comparable throughput.
This work represents the first systematic exploration of hybrid DRAM-PIM and
SRAM-PIM architectures with in-network computation capabilities, offering a
high-efficiency solution for LLM.

### [30] [TENET: An Efficient Sparsity-Aware LUT-Centric Architecture for Ternary LLM Inference On Edge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13765)
*Zhirui Huang,Rui Ma,Shijie Cao,Ran Shu,Ian Wang,Ting Cao,Chixiao Chen,Yongqiang Xiong*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: TENET introduces a novel architecture for efficient ternary quantized inference in large language models, optimizing compute, memory, and algorithm performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional GPU architectures struggle to fully utilize the benefits of ternary quantization for LLMs, particularly in low-batch, real-time inference tasks.

Method: TENET employs a Sparse Ternary Lookup (STL) core for optimized GEMM operations, dynamic activation sparsity, LUT-based ternary weight decompression, and a hybrid accelerator design integrating high-precision and STL cores.

Result: TENET FPGA achieves 4.3x and TENET ASIC achieves 21.1x improvement in energy efficiency over A100 GPU. TENET ASIC also shows a 2.7x speedup in end-to-end inference latency.

Conclusion: TENET enables efficient real-time inference for LLMs by addressing algorithmic, memory, and hardware bottlenecks, outperforming conventional GPUs in energy efficiency and speed.

Abstract: Ternary quantization has emerged as a powerful technique for reducing both
computational and memory footprint of large language models (LLM), enabling
efficient real-time inference deployment without significantly compromising
model accuracy. Conventional LLM inference platforms (e.g GPUs) cannot
capitalize on its benefits, as they (i) lack native support for ternary
arithmetic and memory specialization and (ii) remain severely under-utilized in
low-batch, real-time scenarios. In this work, we propose TENET, a sparse-aware
LUT-centric architecture that co-optimizes algorithm, compute, and memory for
ternary LLM inference. To maximize the efficiency of Ternary Linear layer,
TENET introduces a Sparse Ternary LUT (STL) core that optimizes ternary
mixed-precision GEMM using a symmetric precompute lookup table. It also
features Dynamic Activation N:M Sparsity to exploit the sparsity within the
activation of each token. Additionally, we propose a LUT-based 64B:80B ternary
weight decompression module to fully exploit the memory efficiency of ternary
values. At the system level, we design a heterogeneous TENET accelerator with
full programmability that integrates STL cores with high-precision cores. An
associated Linear-Projection-aware Sparse Attention dataflow is introduced to
optimize memory access and hardware utilization. We implement TENET accelerator
prototype on both FPGA and ASIC platforms. Experiments across various model
sizes and workloads demonstrate that TENET-FPGA and TENET-ASIC improve energy
efficiency by 4.3$\times$ and 21.1$\times$, respectively, compared to the A100
GPU. Furthermore, TENET-ASIC achieves a 2.7$\times$ average speedup compared to
the A100 GPU in end-to-end inference latency.

### [31] [An RDMA-First Object Storage System with SmartNIC Offload](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13997)
*Yu Zhu,Aditya Dhakal,Pedro Bruel,Gourav Rattihalli,Yunming Xiao,Johann Lombardi,Dejan Milojicic*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: This paper introduces ROS2, an RDMA-first object storage system designed to offload the DAOS client to NVIDIA BlueField-3 SmartNIC, resulting in efficient performance for AI training workloads.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address inefficiencies in I/O operations imposed by AI training workloads, particularly the issues arising from host-mediated, TCP-based storage paths.

Method: ROS2 employs RDMA to optimize data paths by offloading the DAOS client to a SmartNIC. It uses a lightweight control plane with gRPC and a high-throughput data plane utilizing UCX/libfabric over RDMA or TCP, bypassing host mediation.

Result: Testing on FIO/DFS showed that RDMA outperforms TCP in both sequential and random I/O. When offloaded to the SmartNIC, end-to-end RDMA performance remained efficient, enabling features like multi-tenant isolation. TCP performance on SmartNICs was inferior to host-based deployments.

Conclusion: Offloading the object-storage stack to an RDMA-driven SmartNIC enables scalable and efficient data delivery for LLM training, with the potential for future integration of GPU-direct placement.

Abstract: AI training and inference impose sustained, fine-grain I/O that stresses
host-mediated, TCP-based storage paths. Motivated by kernel-bypass networking
and user-space storage stacks, we revisit POSIX-compatible object storage for
GPU-centric pipelines. We present ROS2, an RDMA-first object storage system
design that offloads the DAOS client to an NVIDIA BlueField-3 SmartNIC while
leaving the DAOS I/O engine unchanged on the storage server. ROS2 separates a
lightweight control plane (gRPC for namespace and capability exchange) from a
high-throughput data plane (UCX/libfabric over RDMA or TCP) and removes host
mediation from the data path.
  Using FIO/DFS across local and remote configurations, we find that on
server-grade CPUs RDMA consistently outperforms TCP for both large sequential
and small random I/O. When the RDMA-driven DAOS client is offloaded to
BlueField-3, end-to-end performance is comparable to the host, demonstrating
that SmartNIC offload preserves RDMA efficiency while enabling DPU-resident
features such as multi-tenant isolation and inline services (e.g.,
encryption/decryption) close to the NIC. In contrast, TCP on the SmartNIC lags
host performance, underscoring the importance of RDMA for offloaded
deployments.
  Overall, our results indicate that an RDMA-first, SmartNIC-offloaded
object-storage stack is a practical foundation for scaling data delivery in
modern LLM training environments; integrating optional GPU-direct placement for
LLM tasks is left for future work.

### [32] [Gender-Neutral Rewriting in Italian: Models, Approaches, and Trade-offs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13480)
*Andrea Piergentili,Beatrice Savoldi,Matteo Negri,Luisa Bentivogli*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study evaluates large language models for gender-neutral rewriting in Italian, comparing few-shot methods, fine-tuning strategies, and data refinement approaches for improved neutrality and fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Gender-neutral rewriting is important for inclusivity and tackling biases in language. The challenge is especially pronounced in grammatical-gender languages like Italian.

Method: A two-dimensional evaluation framework was employed to assess neutrality and semantic fidelity. Few-shot prompting, fine-tuning, and targeted data cleaning methods were explored across various language models.

Result: Open-weight large language models outperform the only existing Italian GNR model. Fine-tuned smaller models matched or surpassed open-weight LLM performance, demonstrating efficiency gains.

Conclusion: Effective gender-neutral rewriting can be achieved by fine-tuning smaller models, achieving comparable or superior outcomes at lower computational costs, while balancing neutrality with meaning preservation in training data.

Abstract: Gender-neutral rewriting (GNR) aims to reformulate text to eliminate
unnecessary gender specifications while preserving meaning, a particularly
challenging task in grammatical-gender languages like Italian. In this work, we
conduct the first systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art large language
models (LLMs) for Italian GNR, introducing a two-dimensional framework that
measures both neutrality and semantic fidelity to the input. We compare
few-shot prompting across multiple LLMs, fine-tune selected models, and apply
targeted cleaning to boost task relevance. Our findings show that open-weight
LLMs outperform the only existing model dedicated to GNR in Italian, whereas
our fine-tuned models match or exceed the best open-weight LLM's performance at
a fraction of its size. Finally, we discuss the trade-off between optimizing
the training data for neutrality and meaning preservation.

### [33] [Op-Fed: Opinion, Stance, and Monetary Policy Annotations on FOMC Transcripts Using Active Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13539)
*Alisa Kanganis,Katherine A. Keith*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces Op-Fed, a dataset of FOMC transcripts designed to analyze sentiment and stance towards monetary policy, overcoming challenges of imbalanced classes and context dependence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To better understand and facilitate automated analysis of stance and sentiment on monetary policy decisions made by the U.S. Federal Open Market Committee.

Method: The authors created Op-Fed using a hierarchical schema for annotation and active learning to address dataset challenges such as imbalanced classes and inter-sentence dependence.

Result: The dataset, Op-Fed, revealed that a closed-weight LLM achieved mixed performance: 0.80 accuracy in opinion classification and 0.61 in stance classification, lower than human annotation accuracy.

Conclusion: Op-Fed provides a valuable resource for improving model training in opinion and stance classification related to monetary policy, highlighting areas for future improvement.

Abstract: The U.S. Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) regularly discusses and sets
monetary policy, affecting the borrowing and spending decisions of millions of
people. In this work, we release Op-Fed, a dataset of 1044 human-annotated
sentences and their contexts from FOMC transcripts. We faced two major
technical challenges in dataset creation: imbalanced classes -- we estimate
fewer than 8% of sentences express a non-neutral stance towards monetary policy
-- and inter-sentence dependence -- 65% of instances require context beyond the
sentence-level. To address these challenges, we developed a five-stage
hierarchical schema to isolate aspects of opinion, monetary policy, and stance
towards monetary policy as well as the level of context needed. Second, we
selected instances to annotate using active learning, roughly doubling the
number of positive instances across all schema aspects. Using Op-Fed, we found
a top-performing, closed-weight LLM achieves 0.80 zero-shot accuracy in opinion
classification but only 0.61 zero-shot accuracy classifying stance towards
monetary policy -- below our human baseline of 0.89. We expect Op-Fed to be
useful for future model training, confidence calibration, and as a seed dataset
for future annotation efforts.

*John Mendonça,Lining Zhang,Rahul Mallidi,Alon Lavie,Isabel Trancoso,Luis Fernando D'Haro,João Sedoc*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper explores comprehensive evaluation methods for dialogue systems focusing on multi-dimensional metrics and safety detection across languages and cultures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a growing need to address the limitations of traditional metrics for dialogue evaluation, especially in terms of safety, which is often culturally biased or narrowly defined.

Method: The DSTC12 Track 1 was designed with two subtasks: (1) Dialogue-level, Multi-dimensional Automatic Evaluation Metrics using dimensions like Spearman's correlation, and (2) Multilingual and Multicultural Safety Detection using models like Llama-3-8B and Llama-Guard-3-1B.

Result: For Task 1, the highest average Spearman's correlation was 0.1681, revealing significant room for improvement. In Task 2, teams did better in multilingual safety detection (top ROC-AUC 0.9648) than cultural subset evaluations, where the baseline outperformed them (0.5126 ROC-AUC).

Conclusion: The findings stress the importance of developing better tools for culturally-aware and robust safety evaluation while highlighting gaps in existing methodologies.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has intensified the
need for robust dialogue system evaluation, yet comprehensive assessment
remains challenging. Traditional metrics often prove insufficient, and safety
considerations are frequently narrowly defined or culturally biased. The DSTC12
Track 1, "Dialog System Evaluation: Dimensionality, Language, Culture and
Safety," is part of the ongoing effort to address these critical gaps. The
track comprised two subtasks: (1) Dialogue-level, Multi-dimensional Automatic
Evaluation Metrics, and (2) Multilingual and Multicultural Safety Detection.
For Task 1, focused on 10 dialogue dimensions, a Llama-3-8B baseline achieved
the highest average Spearman's correlation (0.1681), indicating substantial
room for improvement. In Task 2, while participating teams significantly
outperformed a Llama-Guard-3-1B baseline on the multilingual safety subset (top
ROC-AUC 0.9648), the baseline proved superior on the cultural subset (0.5126
ROC-AUC), highlighting critical needs in culturally-aware safety. This paper
describes the datasets and baselines provided to participants, as well as
submission evaluation results for each of the two proposed subtasks.

*Shambhavi Krishna,Atharva Naik,Chaitali Agarwal,Sudharshan Govindan,Taesung Lee,Haw-Shiuan Chang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates cross-task transfer learning in LLMs, uncovering latent abilities and analyzing side effects using a novel framework with transfer matrices and dimensionality reduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To analyze and improve understanding of cross-task interactions in LLMs, especially in the context of out-of-distribution tasks and the practical challenges of gathering training data for all tasks.

Method: The authors deploy a novel analysis framework by constructing a transfer learning matrix and employing dimensionality reduction to study the relationships across tasks in LLMs. They train and evaluate 10 models to identify underlying abilities and analyze data properties' influence.

Result: The study reveals that improvements in task performance aren't aligned with surface-level dataset similarities or obvious quality metrics. Instead, hidden statistical features, like class distribution and linguistic characteristics, play critical roles.

Conclusion: The findings offer deeper insights into the mechanisms governing transfer learning in LLMs, providing a pathway for more predictable and effective adaptation strategies.

Abstract: Large language models are increasingly deployed across diverse applications.
This often includes tasks LLMs have not encountered during training. This
implies that enumerating and obtaining the high-quality training data for all
tasks is infeasible. Thus, we often need to rely on transfer learning using
datasets with different characteristics, and anticipate out-of-distribution
requests. Motivated by this practical need, we propose an analysis framework,
building a transfer learning matrix and dimensionality reduction, to dissect
these cross-task interactions. We train and analyze 10 models to identify
latent abilities (e.g., Reasoning, Sentiment Classification, NLU, Arithmetic)
and discover the side effects of the transfer learning. Our findings reveal
that performance improvements often defy explanations based on surface-level
dataset similarity or source data quality. Instead, hidden statistical factors
of the source dataset, such as class distribution and generation length
proclivities, alongside specific linguistic features, are actually more
influential. This work offers insights into the complex dynamics of transfer
learning, paving the way for more predictable and effective LLM adaptation.

### [36] [Sparse Neurons Carry Strong Signals of Question Ambiguity in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13664)
*Zhuoxuan Zhang,Jinhao Duan,Edward Kim,Kaidi Xu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores how question ambiguity is represented internally in large language models (LLMs), showing that it is encoded in certain neurons, and proposes methods for detecting and controlling this property.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and address the issue of large language models responding confidently to ambiguous questions without clarification.

Method: The authors identified neurons in LLMs that encode question ambiguity, leveraging these Ambiguity-Encoding Neurons (AENs) to detect ambiguity and control the model’s response behavior. They used probes for detection and analyzed layerwise emergence of these signals.

Result: The study found that ambiguity signals are encoded in specific neurons, even in shallow layers. Using AENs improved ambiguity detection performance compared to other baselines. Additionally, manipulating these neurons allowed control over the model’s response strategy.

Conclusion: LLMs have compact, neuron-level internal representations of ambiguity, making it possible to interpret and adjust their behavior, such as abstaining from confident answers to ambiguous questions.

Abstract: Ambiguity is pervasive in real-world questions, yet large language models
(LLMs) often respond with confident answers rather than seeking clarification.
In this work, we show that question ambiguity is linearly encoded in the
internal representations of LLMs and can be both detected and controlled at the
neuron level. During the model's pre-filling stage, we identify that a small
number of neurons, as few as one, encode question ambiguity information. Probes
trained on these Ambiguity-Encoding Neurons (AENs) achieve strong performance
on ambiguity detection and generalize across datasets, outperforming
prompting-based and representation-based baselines. Layerwise analysis reveals
that AENs emerge from shallow layers, suggesting early encoding of ambiguity
signals in the model's processing pipeline. Finally, we show that through
manipulating AENs, we can control LLM's behavior from direct answering to
abstention. Our findings reveal that LLMs form compact internal representations
of question ambiguity, enabling interpretable and controllable behavior.

*Shang Qin,Jingheng Ye,Yinghui Li,Hai-Tao Zheng,Qi Li,Jinxiao Shan,Zhixing Li,Hong-Gee Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces the first continual learning benchmark, CL$^2$GEC, for Chinese Grammatical Error Correction (CGEC) in academic writing across multiple disciplines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CGEC systems lack mechanisms to adapt effectively to domain-specific linguistic variations and prevent catastrophic forgetting during continual learning.

Method: The authors proposed a benchmark comprising 10,000 annotated sentences from 10 disciplines, evaluated under various continual learning algorithms and metrics.

Result: Experimental findings showed that regularization-based methods were more effective in mitigating knowledge forgetting than replay-based or naive sequential approaches.

Conclusion: CL$^2$GEC provides a critical framework for advancing adaptive CGEC systems, especially for multi-disciplinary academic domains.

Abstract: The growing demand for automated writing assistance in diverse academic
domains highlights the need for robust Chinese Grammatical Error Correction
(CGEC) systems that can adapt across disciplines. However, existing CGEC
research largely lacks dedicated benchmarks for multi-disciplinary academic
writing, overlooking continual learning (CL) as a promising solution to handle
domain-specific linguistic variation and prevent catastrophic forgetting. To
fill this crucial gap, we introduce CL$^2$GEC, the first Continual Learning
benchmark for Chinese Literature Grammatical Error Correction, designed to
evaluate adaptive CGEC across multiple academic fields. Our benchmark includes
10,000 human-annotated sentences spanning 10 disciplines, each exhibiting
distinct linguistic styles and error patterns. CL$^2$GEC focuses on evaluating
grammatical error correction in a continual learning setting, simulating
sequential exposure to diverse academic disciplines to reflect real-world
editorial dynamics. We evaluate large language models under sequential tuning,
parameter-efficient adaptation, and four representative CL algorithms, using
both standard GEC metrics and continual learning metrics adapted to task-level
variation. Experimental results reveal that regularization-based methods
mitigate forgetting more effectively than replay-based or naive sequential
approaches. Our benchmark provides a rigorous foundation for future research in
adaptive grammatical error correction across diverse academic domains.

TL;DR: The paper introduces AgentCTG, a scalable framework for fine-grained control over text generation, achieving state-of-the-art results and improving domain-specific applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Controlled Text Generation (CTG) faces challenges such as fine-grained control, cost efficiency, scalability, and domain knowledge learning, especially in real-world applications.

Method: The authors propose AgentCTG, a multi-agent workflow-inspired framework with an auto-prompt module to improve text generation precision and scalability.

Result: AgentCTG demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on multiple datasets and excels in the newly proposed Character-Driven Rewriting task.

Conclusion: AgentCTG enables precise, contextually relevant text generation, leading to better content delivery, personalization, and interaction in online scenarios.

Abstract: Although significant progress has been made in many tasks within the field of
Natural Language Processing (NLP), Controlled Text Generation (CTG) continues
to face numerous challenges, particularly in achieving fine-grained conditional
control over generation. Additionally, in real scenario and online
applications, cost considerations, scalability, domain knowledge learning and
more precise control are required, presenting more challenge for CTG. This
paper introduces a novel and scalable framework, AgentCTG, which aims to
enhance precise and complex control over the text generation by simulating the
control and regulation mechanisms in multi-agent workflows. We explore various
collaboration methods among different agents and introduce an auto-prompt
module to further enhance the generation effectiveness. AgentCTG achieves
state-of-the-art results on multiple public datasets. To validate its
effectiveness in practical applications, we propose a new challenging
Character-Driven Rewriting task, which aims to convert the original text into
new text that conform to specific character profiles and simultaneously
preserve the domain knowledge. When applied to online navigation with
role-playing, our approach significantly enhances the driving experience
through improved content delivery. By optimizing the generation of contextually
relevant text, we enable a more immersive interaction within online
communities, fostering greater personalization and user engagement.

*Suyuchen Wang,Jinlin Wang,Xinyu Wang,Shiqi Li,Xiangru Tang,Sirui Hong,Xiao-Wen Chang,Chenglin Wu,Bang Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces CARE, a new framework that improves large language models (LLMs) by integrating evidence-based reasoning directly into their processes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often provide inconsistent answers due to poor context integration, and existing solutions either involve costly fine-tuning or fail to improve context utilization effectively.

Method: The authors propose CARE, a retrieval-augmented reasoning framework that enhances in-context evidence integration. It leverages limited labeled data and retrieves strategic tokens to improve both retrieval accuracy and generation performance.

Result: CARE significantly outperforms other techniques, including supervised fine-tuning, traditional retrieval-augmented methods, and external retrieval systems, across various real-world and counterfactual QA benchmarks.

Conclusion: The framework enhances the accuracy, reliability, and efficiency of LLMs for knowledge-intensive tasks, marking an important advancement in the field.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often struggle with context fidelity, producing
inconsistent answers when responding to questions based on provided
information. Existing approaches either rely on expensive supervised
fine-tuning to generate evidence post-answer or train models to perform web
searches without necessarily improving utilization of the given context. We
propose CARE, a novel native retrieval-augmented reasoning framework that
teaches LLMs to explicitly integrate in-context evidence within their reasoning
process with the model's own retrieval capabilities. Our method requires
limited labeled evidence data while significantly enhancing both retrieval
accuracy and answer generation performance through strategically retrieved
in-context tokens in the reasoning chain. Extensive experiments on multiple
real-world and counterfactual QA benchmarks demonstrate that our approach
substantially outperforms supervised fine-tuning, traditional
retrieval-augmented generation methods, and external retrieval solutions. This
work represents a fundamental advancement in making LLMs more accurate,
reliable, and efficient for knowledge-intensive tasks.

*Yosuke Mikami,Daiki Matsuoka,Hitomi Yanaka*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates the robustness of large language models (LLMs) in handling Japanese Natural Language Inference (NLI) tasks, particularly focusing on comparatives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how well LLMs handle numerical and logical expressions in NLI tasks, with a specific emphasis on Japanese, a less-dominant language in their training.

Method: The authors constructed a Japanese NLI dataset focusing on comparatives and evaluated multiple LLMs in zero-shot and few-shot settings.

Result: LLMs exhibited sensitivity to prompt formats in zero-shot settings, were influenced by gold labels in few-shot examples, and struggled with Japanese-specific linguistic phenomena. Prompts with logical semantic representations improved prediction accuracy.

Conclusion: LLMs face challenges with Japanese NLI, particularly for tasks involving comparatives, but logical semantic prompts can enhance their performance.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) perform remarkably well in Natural Language
Inference (NLI). However, NLI involving numerical and logical expressions
remains challenging. Comparatives are a key linguistic phenomenon related to
such inference, but the robustness of LLMs in handling them, especially in
languages that are not dominant in the models' training data, such as Japanese,
has not been sufficiently explored. To address this gap, we construct a
Japanese NLI dataset that focuses on comparatives and evaluate various LLMs in
zero-shot and few-shot settings. Our results show that the performance of the
models is sensitive to the prompt formats in the zero-shot setting and
influenced by the gold labels in the few-shot examples. The LLMs also struggle
to handle linguistic phenomena unique to Japanese. Furthermore, we observe that
prompts containing logical semantic representations help the models predict the
correct labels for inference problems that they struggle to solve even with
few-shot examples.

Motivation: To investigate whether instruction-tuned Large Language Models can handle multimodal inputs, such as clinical notes and structured EHR data, and achieve competitive performance with less complexity.

Method: The authors adapt instruction-tuned LLMs using DSPy-based prompt optimization to jointly process clinical notes and structured Electronic Health Record (EHR) data.

Result: The adapted LLMs achieve performance comparable to specialized multimodal systems while being less complex and more versatile across tasks.

Conclusion: Instruction-tuned LLMs optimized through DSPy can effectively handle structured and unstructured clinical data jointly, showcasing adaptability and eliminating the need for complex specialized systems.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at text generation, but their ability to
handle clinical classification tasks involving structured data, such as time
series, remains underexplored. In this work, we adapt instruction-tuned LLMs

### [42] [DSCC-HS: A Dynamic Self-Reinforcing Framework for Hallucination Suppression in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13702)
*Xiao Zheng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces DSCC-HS, a novel framework to proactively suppress hallucination in LLMs using proxy models during decoding, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often suffer from hallucination issues, making their deployment unreliable. Existing reactive methods like RAG are not sufficient for real-time intervention.

Method: The proposed DSCC-HS framework uses a compact proxy model engineered as a Factual Alignment Proxy (FAP) and a Hallucination Detection Proxy (HDP). During inference, these proxies generate a steering vector in real-time to adjust LLM output dynamically, without modifying the target model.

Result: DSCC-HS outperformed existing methods, achieving a 99.2% Factual Consistency Rate on TruthfulQA and the highest FActScore of 46.50 on BioGEN.

Conclusion: DSCC-HS provides an efficient, plug-and-play solution to improve LLM factual accuracy and can be considered a state-of-the-art approach for suppressing hallucination during autoregressive decoding.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) hallucination is a significant barrier to their
reliable deployment. Current methods like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
are often reactive. We introduce **Dynamic Self-reinforcing Calibration for
Hallucination Suppression (DSCC-HS)**, a novel, proactive framework that
intervenes during autoregressive decoding. Inspired by dual-process cognitive
theory, DSCC-HS uses a compact proxy model, trained in adversarial roles as a
Factual Alignment Proxy (FAP) and a Hallucination Detection Proxy (HDP). During
inference, these proxies dynamically steer a large target model by injecting a
real-time steering vector, which is the difference between FAP and HDP logits,
at each decoding step. This plug-and-play approach requires no modification to
the target model. Our experiments on TruthfulQA and BioGEN show DSCC-HS
achieves state-of-the-art performance. On TruthfulQA, it reached a 99.2%
Factual Consistency Rate (FCR). On the long-form BioGEN benchmark, it attained
the highest FActScore of 46.50. These results validate DSCC-HS as a principled
and efficient solution for enhancing LLM factuality.

  METHODS AND MATERIALS: We used two text datasets to train and evaluate our
NLP models: 7,094 reports from our institution (Inst.), and 571 from IAEA
SAFRON (SF), all of which had severity scores labeled by clinical content
experts. We trained and evaluated two types of models: baseline support vector
machines (SVM) and BlueBERT which is a large language model pretrained on
PubMed abstracts and hospitalized patient data. We assessed for
generalizability of our model in two ways. First, we evaluated models trained
using Inst.-train on SF-test. Second, we trained a BlueBERT_TRANSFER model that
was first fine-tuned on Inst.-train then on SF-train before testing on SF-test
set. To further analyze model performance, we also examined a subset of 59
reports from our Inst. dataset, which were manually edited for clarity.
  RESULTS Classification performance on the Inst. test achieved AUROC 0.82
using SVM and 0.81 using BlueBERT. Without cross-institution transfer learning,
performance on the SF test was limited to an AUROC of 0.42 using SVM and 0.56
using BlueBERT. BlueBERT_TRANSFER, which was fine-tuned on both datasets,
improved the performance on SF test to AUROC 0.78. Performance of SVM, and
BlueBERT_TRANSFER models on the manually curated Inst. reports (AUROC 0.85 and
0.74) was similar to human performance (AUROC 0.81).
  CONCLUSION: In summary, we successfully developed cross-institution NLP
models on incident report text from radiation oncology centers. These models
were able to detect high-severity reports similarly to humans on a curated
dataset.

### [44] [DSPC: Dual-Stage Progressive Compression Framework for Efficient Long-Context Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13723)
*Yaxin Gao,Yao Lu,Zongfei Zhang,Jiaqi Nie,Shanqing Yu,Qi Xuan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Dual-Stage Progressive Compression (DSPC), a training-free method to compress prompts for large language models (LLMs) to reduce computational costs while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the problem of prompt inflation in large language models, where increasingly longer prompts lead to higher computational costs.

Method: The Dual-Stage Progressive Compression (DSPC) method involves two stages: (1) coarse-grained filtering based on TF-IDF to remove semantically low-value sentences, and (2) fine-grained token pruning using attention contribution, cross-model loss difference, and positional importance.

Result: DSPC achieved consistent improvements under constrained token budgets, reducing token usage by three times while outperforming state-of-the-art methods, as seen in the FewShot task of the Longbench dataset.

Conclusion: DSPC offers an efficient, training-free solution to prompt compression, balancing reduced computational costs with high performance, and demonstrating clear advantages over existing methods.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in many natural
language processing (NLP) tasks. To achieve more accurate output, the prompts
used to drive LLMs have become increasingly longer, which incurs higher
computational costs. To address this prompt inflation problem, prompt
compression has been proposed. However, most existing methods require training
a small auxiliary model for compression, incurring a significant amount of
additional computation. To avoid this, we propose a two-stage, training-free
approach, called Dual-Stage Progressive Compression (DSPC). In the
coarse-grained stage, semantic-related sentence filtering removes sentences
with low semantic value based on TF-IDF. In the fine-grained stage, token
importance is assessed using attention contribution, cross-model loss
difference, and positional importance, enabling the pruning of low-utility
tokens while preserving semantics. We validate DSPC on LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct
and GPT-3.5-Turbo under a constrained token budget and observe consistent
improvements. For instance, in the FewShot task of the Longbench dataset, DSPC
achieves a performance of 49.17 by using only 3x fewer tokens, outperforming
the best state-of-the-art baseline LongLLMLingua by 7.76.

### [45] [Implementing a Logical Inference System for Japanese Comparatives](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13734)
*Yosuke Mikami,Daiki Matsuoka,Hitomi Yanaka*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper presents ccg-jcomp, a logical inference system tailored for handling Japanese comparatives, and evaluates its effectiveness against Large Language Models on a specific NLI dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the challenges of understanding quantities and comparative relations in the context of Japanese comparatives, which differ morphologically and semantically from English, thus necessitating a specialized approach.

Method: The authors designed ccg-jcomp, a logical inference system grounded in compositional semantics, specifically for Japanese comparatives, and assessed its performance using a dedicated dataset.

Result: The proposed system showed effective handling of Japanese comparatives, achieving higher accuracy compared to current LLMs in this domain.

Conclusion: ccg-jcomp is a successful application of logic-based reasoning for Japanese comparatives, outperforming LLMs and highlighting the importance of tailored systems for such linguistic nuances.

Abstract: Natural Language Inference (NLI) involving comparatives is challenging
because it requires understanding quantities and comparative relations
expressed by sentences. While some approaches leverage Large Language Models
(LLMs), we focus on logic-based approaches grounded in compositional semantics,
which are promising for robust handling of numerical and logical expressions.
Previous studies along these lines have proposed logical inference systems for
English comparatives. However, it has been pointed out that there are several
morphological and semantic differences between Japanese and English
comparatives. These differences make it difficult to apply such systems
directly to Japanese comparatives. To address this gap, this study proposes
ccg-jcomp, a logical inference system for Japanese comparatives based on
compositional semantics. We evaluate the proposed system on a Japanese NLI
dataset containing comparative expressions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of
our system by comparing its accuracy with that of existing LLMs.

### [46] [Exploring Data and Parameter Efficient Strategies for Arabic Dialect Identifications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13775)
*Vani Kanjirangat,Ljiljana Dolamic,Fabio Rinaldi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates efficient methods (soft prompting, hard prompting, and LoRA) for Arabic Dialect Identification using Large Language Models (LLMs) and encoder models, concluding that LoRA-based approaches outperform others.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in Arabic Dialect Identification by exploring data-efficient and parameter-efficient methods using LLMs and Arabic-specific encoder models.

Method: Experiments on prefix-tuning, prompt-tuning variants, LoRA fine-tuning, zero-shot/few-shot setups, and analysis of n-shot inference on encoder and decoder models.

Result: LLMs struggle with identifying dialects in zero-shot/few-shot setups, but LoRA-based fine-tuned models outperform soft-prompt encoder methods and even full fine-tuning.

Conclusion: LoRA-based models are promising for Arabic Dialect Identification, showcasing superior performance to other methods investigated.

Abstract: This paper discusses our exploration of different data-efficient and
parameter-efficient approaches to Arabic Dialect Identification (ADI). In
particular, we investigate various soft-prompting strategies, including
prefix-tuning, prompt-tuning, P-tuning, and P-tuning V2, as well as LoRA
reparameterizations. For the data-efficient strategy, we analyze hard prompting
with zero-shot and few-shot inferences to analyze the dialect identification
capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). For the parameter-efficient PEFT
approaches, we conducted our experiments using Arabic-specific encoder models
on several major datasets. We also analyzed the n-shot inferences on
open-source decoder-only models, a general multilingual model (Phi-3.5), and an
Arabic-specific one(SILMA). We observed that the LLMs generally struggle to
differentiate the dialectal nuances in the few-shot or zero-shot setups. The
soft-prompted encoder variants perform better, while the LoRA-based fine-tuned
models perform best, even surpassing full fine-tuning.

*Yangning Li,Tingwei Lu,Yinghui Li,Yankai Chen,Wei-Chieh Huang,Wenhao Jiang,Hui Wang,Hai-Tao Zheng,Philip S. Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes a new framework called CAMPUS to improve instruction tuning for large language models using a dynamic and competency-aware curriculum learning strategy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of static curriculum learning methods, which do not adapt to the evolving abilities of models and fail to optimize the learning trajectory.

Method: The paper introduces CAMPUS, a framework that dynamically selects sub-curricula, adjusts curriculum schedules based on model competence, and employs multiple difficulty-based schedulings.

Result: CAMPUS outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in efficient instruction tuning according to extensive experimental evaluations.

Conclusion: The proposed CAMPUS framework effectively enhances instruction tuning by addressing the rigidity in traditional curriculum learning approaches through its dynamic and multi-perspective strategy.

Abstract: Efficient instruction tuning aims to enhance the ultimate performance of
large language models (LLMs) trained on a given instruction dataset. Curriculum
learning as a typical data organization strategy has shown preliminary
effectiveness in instruction tuning. However, current curriculum tuning methods
suffer from the curriculum rigidity, since they rely solely on static heuristic
difficulty metrics. These methods fail to adapt to the evolving capabilities of
models during training, resulting in a fixed and potentially sub-optimal
learning trajectory. To address the issue, Competence-Aware Multi-Perspective
cUrriculum inStruction tuning framework termed CAMPUS is proposed. CAMPUS
offers several advantages: (1) Dynamic selection for sub-curriculum. (2)
Competency-aware adjustment to the curriculum schedule. (3) Multiple
difficulty-based scheduling. Extensive experiments prove the superior
performance of CAMPUS, compared to other state-of-the-art baselines for
efficient instruction tuning.

*Laura García-Sardiña,Hermenegildo Fabregat,Daniel Deniz,Rabih Zbib*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates the impact of grammatical gender in job titles on automatic job ranking systems and proposes metrics to measure gender bias.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding and mitigating gender bias in automated job ranking systems prompted this study.

Method: The authors created test sets in four gendered languages and applied ranking comparison metrics, particularly Rank-Biased Overlap (RBO), to evaluate gender bias.

Result: Analysis of multiple multilingual models revealed varying levels of gender bias in job ranking systems.

Conclusion: Explicit grammatical gender in job titles has measurable effects on job ranking systems, with existing models showing bias, highlighting the need for further improvement.

Abstract: This work sets the ground for studying how explicit grammatical gender
assignment in job titles can affect the results of automatic job ranking
systems. We propose the usage of metrics for ranking comparison controlling for
gender to evaluate gender bias in job title ranking systems, in particular RBO
(Rank-Biased Overlap). We generate and share test sets for a job title matching
task in four grammatical gender languages, including occupations in masculine
and feminine form and annotated by gender and matching relevance. We use the
new test sets and the proposed methodology to evaluate the gender bias of
several out-of-the-box multilingual models to set as baselines, showing that
all of them exhibit varying degrees of gender bias.

### [49] [Geometric Uncertainty for Detecting and Correcting Hallucinations in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13813)
*Edward Phillips,Sean Wu,Soheila Molaei,Danielle Belgrave,Anshul Thakur,David Clifton*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new geometric framework for uncertainty quantification in large language models, focusing on both global and local uncertainty measures to detect hallucinations in responses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models often hallucinate, generating incorrect but plausible answers, and existing uncertainty quantification methods are limited to either global or local measures but not both.

Method: The approach uses archetypal analysis of responses generated by black-box access, proposing Geometric Volume for global uncertainty and Geometric Suspicion for local reliability ranking.

Result: Experiments show competitive or better performance than previous methods, especially on medical datasets where accurate detection of hallucinations is critical.

Conclusion: The proposed framework improves upon prior methods, providing both theoretical and practical advancements in detecting and attributing uncertainty in language model responses.

Abstract: Large language models demonstrate impressive results across diverse tasks but
are still known to hallucinate, generating linguistically plausible but
incorrect answers to questions. Uncertainty quantification has been proposed as
a strategy for hallucination detection, but no existing black-box approach
provides estimates for both global and local uncertainty. The former attributes
uncertainty to a batch of responses, while the latter attributes uncertainty to
individual responses. Current local methods typically rely on white-box access
to internal model states, whilst black-box methods only provide global
uncertainty estimates. We introduce a geometric framework to address this,
based on archetypal analysis of batches of responses sampled with only
black-box model access. At the global level, we propose Geometric Volume, which
measures the convex hull volume of archetypes derived from response embeddings.
At the local level, we propose Geometric Suspicion, which ranks responses by
reliability and enables hallucination reduction through preferential response
selection. Unlike prior dispersion methods which yield only a single global
score, our approach provides semantic boundary points which have utility for
attributing reliability to individual responses. Experiments show that our
framework performs comparably to or better than prior methods on short form
question-answering datasets, and achieves superior results on medical datasets
where hallucinations carry particularly critical risks. We also provide
theoretical justification by proving a link between convex hull volume and
entropy.

TL;DR: The paper discusses the third edition of AutoMin, focusing on meeting summarization and question answering tasks in multiple languages and domains, with baseline evaluations using 2025 LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To advance automatic meeting summarization techniques and explore structured minutes and question answering functionalities.

Method: Introduced shared tasks for generating structured minutes in English and Czech across different domains, and question answering tasks in monolingual and cross-lingual settings.

Result: Limited participation with baseline systems provided by organizers, evaluating current large language models on the tasks.

Conclusion: The shared task highlighted state-of-the-art capabilities and challenges of LLMs in meeting summarization and QA, but had limited external engagement.

Abstract: This paper presents the third edition of AutoMin, a shared task on automatic
meeting summarization into minutes. In 2025, AutoMin featured the main task of
minuting, the creation of structured meeting minutes, as well as a new task:
question answering (QA) based on meeting transcripts.
  The minuting task covered two languages, English and Czech, and two domains:
project meetings and European Parliament sessions. The QA task focused solely
on project meetings and was available in two settings: monolingual QA in
English, and cross-lingual QA, where questions were asked and answered in Czech
based on English meetings.
  Participation in 2025 was more limited compared to previous years, with only
one team joining the minuting task and two teams participating in QA. However,
as organizers, we included multiple baseline systems to enable a comprehensive
evaluation of current (2025) large language models (LLMs) on both tasks.

### [51] [Large Language Models Discriminate Against Speakers of German Dialects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13835)
*Minh Duc Bui,Carolin Holtermann,Valentin Hofmann,Anne Lauscher,Katharina von der Wense*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study investigates biases in large language models (LLMs) against German dialect speakers, identifying negative associations and decision-making biases, which are amplified by explicit demographic mentions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dialect speakers often face societal stereotypes, and this paper aims to determine if and how these stereotypes are reflected in the biases of large language models.

Method: The researchers evaluated dialect biases in LLMs by using sociolinguistic traits in two tasks: an association task and a decision task, complemented by a novel corpus pairing sentences in seven German dialects with standard German variants.

Result: Findings indicate significant bias against German dialect speakers in both tasks, including amplified negative associations when dialect demographics are explicitly labeled.

Conclusion: Large language models exhibit pronounced biases against German dialect speakers, which are exacerbated by explicit labeling, highlighting potential shortcomings in current LLM design.

Abstract: Dialects represent a significant component of human culture and are found
across all regions of the world. In Germany, more than 40% of the population
speaks a regional dialect (Adler and Hansen, 2022). However, despite cultural
importance, individuals speaking dialects often face negative societal
stereotypes. We examine whether such stereotypes are mirrored by large language
models (LLMs). We draw on the sociolinguistic literature on dialect perception
to analyze traits commonly associated with dialect speakers. Based on these
traits, we assess the dialect naming bias and dialect usage bias expressed by
LLMs in two tasks: an association task and a decision task. To assess a model's
dialect usage bias, we construct a novel evaluation corpus that pairs sentences
from seven regional German dialects (e.g., Alemannic and Bavarian) with their
standard German counterparts. We find that: (1) in the association task, all
evaluated LLMs exhibit significant dialect naming and dialect usage bias
against German dialect speakers, reflected in negative adjective associations;
(2) all models reproduce these dialect naming and dialect usage biases in their
decision making; and (3) contrary to prior work showing minimal bias with
explicit demographic mentions, we find that explicitly labeling linguistic
demographics--German dialect speakers--amplifies bias more than implicit cues
like dialect usage.

### [52] [Do LLMs Align Human Values Regarding Social Biases? Judging and Explaining Social Biases with LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13869)
*Yang Liu,Chenhui Chu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper investigates the alignment of large language models (LLMs) with human values in social bias scenarios, finding discrepancies in alignment across model scales, families, and scenario types.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The goal is to understand how well LLMs align with human values in scenarios involving social biases and identify variations in alignment based on model scale, family, and scenario type.

Method: The authors evaluated 12 LLMs from four model families using diverse datasets and analyzed alignment across different bias scenarios, along with the LLMs' explanation capabilities.

Result: LLMs don't show consistent improvements in alignment with larger scales; models from the same family exhibit similar judgment patterns. No major differences were observed in explaining social biases across models, but smaller fine-tuned LMs generated readable yet less agreeable explanations.

Conclusion: LLMs exhibit preferences in alignment with certain bias scenarios and varying performance in explaining biases. Fine-tuning smaller LMs improves readability but sacrifices agreeability.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can lead to undesired consequences when
misaligned with human values, especially in scenarios involving complex and
sensitive social biases. Previous studies have revealed the misalignment of
LLMs with human values using expert-designed or agent-based emulated bias
scenarios. However, it remains unclear whether the alignment of LLMs with human
values differs across different types of scenarios (e.g., scenarios containing
negative vs. non-negative questions). In this study, we investigate the
alignment of LLMs with human values regarding social biases (HVSB) in different
types of bias scenarios. Through extensive analysis of 12 LLMs from four model
families and four datasets, we demonstrate that LLMs with large model parameter
scales do not necessarily have lower misalignment rate and attack success rate.
Moreover, LLMs show a certain degree of alignment preference for specific types
of scenarios and the LLMs from the same model family tend to have higher
judgment consistency. In addition, we study the understanding capacity of LLMs
with their explanations of HVSB. We find no significant differences in the
understanding of HVSB across LLMs. We also find LLMs prefer their own generated
explanations. Additionally, we endow smaller language models (LMs) with the
ability to explain HVSB. The generation results show that the explanations
generated by the fine-tuned smaller LMs are more readable, but have a
relatively lower model agreeability.

Motivation: To address risks posed by misinformation in healthcare such as vaccine hesitancy and unproven treatments, and to improve biomedical claim validation.

Method: The authors developed a framework called CER, which integrates evidence retrieval techniques, reasoning powered by large language models, and supervised prediction to validate claims.

Result: CER achieved state-of-the-art results on expert annotated datasets and showed strong cross-dataset generalization capabilities.

Conclusion: The proposed CER framework effectively mitigates issues in biomedical misinformation validation, offering a reproducible and transparent approach to grounding predictions in evidence-based sources.

Abstract: Misinformation in healthcare, from vaccine hesitancy to unproven treatments,

biomedical scientific evidence, CER effectively mitigates the risk of
hallucinations, ensuring that generated outputs are grounded in verifiable,

*Domenico Meconi,Simone Stirpe,Federico Martelli,Leonardo Lavalle,Roberto Navigli*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper evaluates the ability of instruction-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) and tests their generative understanding of word senses in multiple contexts, finding their performance comparable to specialized systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the capability of LLMs to understand and process word senses in various contexts, which is a fundamental aspect of linguistic understanding but not extensively evaluated before.

Method: The authors assess LLMs by comparing their performance in Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) tasks to state-of-the-art systems and evaluate their generative abilities through definition generation, free-form explanation, and example generation.

Result: The study finds that LLMs like GPT-4o and DeepSeek-V3 perform as well as specialized WSD systems in WSD tasks and achieve up to 98% accuracy in generative tasks, particularly excelling in free-form explanations.

Conclusion: LLMs not only match the performance of specialized WSD systems but also exhibit strong generative abilities in explaining word senses, with free-form explanation aligning best with their capabilities.

Abstract: Understanding the meaning of words in context is a fundamental capability for
Large Language Models (LLMs). Despite extensive evaluation efforts, the extent
to which LLMs show evidence that they truly grasp word senses remains
underexplored. In this paper, we address this gap by evaluating both i) the
Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) capabilities of instruction-tuned LLMs,
comparing their performance to state-of-the-art systems specifically designed
for the task, and ii) the ability of two top-performing open- and closed-source
LLMs to understand word senses in three generative settings: definition
generation, free-form explanation, and example generation. Notably, we find
that, in the WSD task, leading models such as GPT-4o and DeepSeek-V3 achieve
performance on par with specialized WSD systems, while also demonstrating
greater robustness across domains and levels of difficulty. In the generation
tasks, results reveal that LLMs can explain the meaning of words in context up
to 98\% accuracy, with the highest performance observed in the free-form
explanation task, which best aligns with their generative capabilities.

*Dayeon Ki,Marine Carpuat,Paul McNamee,Daniel Khashabi,Eugene Yang,Dawn Lawrie,Kevin Duh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper explores how multilingual Retrieval-Augmented Generation (mRAG) systems handle biases in citing sources across different languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether mRAG systems exhibit unintended biases toward certain languages, like English, when generating and citing documents in multilingual setups.

Method: A controlled methodology was used, relying on model internals, to evaluate language preference while keeping document relevance constant. Analysis covered eight languages and six open-weight language models.

Result: The study observed an English citation bias, which intensified for lower-resource languages and mid-context documents. Sometimes, citation decisions prioritized language preference over document relevance.

Conclusion: The findings highlight that multilingual mRAG systems are biased in their citation behavior, which is not solely determined by document informativeness, and provide insights into how language models process multilingual contexts.

Abstract: Multilingual Retrieval-Augmented Generation (mRAG) systems enable language
models to answer knowledge-intensive queries with citation-supported responses
across languages. While such systems have been proposed, an open questions is
whether the mixture of different document languages impacts generation and
citation in unintended ways. To investigate, we introduce a controlled
methodology using model internals to measure language preference while holding
other factors such as document relevance constant. Across eight languages and
six open-weight models, we find that models preferentially cite English sources
when queries are in English, with this bias amplified for lower-resource
languages and for documents positioned mid-context. Crucially, we find that
models sometimes trade-off document relevance for language preference,
indicating that citation choices are not always driven by informativeness
alone. Our findings shed light on how language models leverage multilingual
context and influence citation behavior.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance automated translation quality evaluation by integrating long-context data and human judgment datasets, aiming for better agreement with human assessments.

Method: The researchers used the COMET framework to train models on segment-level scores using augmented long-context data. They concatenated annotated sentences, computed weighted averages, and normalized various judgment datasets.

Result: The models incorporating long-context information achieved better correlations with human evaluations compared to those trained on short segments.

Conclusion: Integration of long-context information and multiple human judgment datasets improves the quality and reliability of automated translation evaluation systems.

Abstract: In this paper, we present our submission to the Tenth Conference on Machine
Translation (WMT25) Shared Task on Automated Translation Quality Evaluation.
  Our systems are built upon the COMET framework and trained to predict
segment-level Error Span Annotation (ESA) scores using augmented long-context
data.
  To construct long-context training data, we concatenate in-domain,
human-annotated sentences and compute a weighted average of their scores.
  We integrate multiple human judgment datasets (MQM, SQM, and DA) by
normalising their scales and train multilingual regression models to predict
quality scores from the source, hypothesis, and reference translations.
  Experimental results show that incorporating long-context information
improves correlations with human judgments compared to models trained only on
short segments.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Slim-SC enhances Test-Time Scaling (TTS) performance by pruning redundant reasoning chains, significantly reducing latency and computational overhead while maintaining or improving accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of Self-Consistency (SC) in TTS, especially its high computational overhead that restricts widespread deployment.

Method: Introduce Slim-SC, a step-wise pruning technique that removes redundant reasoning chains based on inter-chain similarity at the thought level.

Result: Experimental results on STEM reasoning datasets and LLM architectures demonstrate Slim-SC reduces inference latency by up to 45% and computational resource usage by 26%, while maintaining or improving accuracy.

Conclusion: Slim-SC offers a practical and efficient approach to enhance TTS, providing a balance between accuracy and computational efficiency for SC-based reasoning in large language models.

Abstract: Recently, Test-Time Scaling (TTS) has gained increasing attention for
improving LLM reasoning performance at test time without retraining the model.
A notable TTS technique is Self-Consistency (SC), which generates multiple
reasoning chains in parallel and selects the final answer via majority voting.
While effective, the order-of-magnitude computational overhead limits its broad
deployment. Prior attempts to accelerate SC mainly rely on model-based
confidence scores or heuristics with limited empirical support. For the first
time, we theoretically and empirically analyze the inefficiencies of SC and
reveal actionable opportunities for improvement. Building on these insights, we
propose Slim-SC, a step-wise pruning strategy that identifies and removes
redundant chains using inter-chain similarity at the thought level. Experiments
on three STEM reasoning datasets and two recent LLM architectures show that
Slim-SC reduces inference latency and KVC usage by up to 45% and 26%,
respectively, with R1-Distill, while maintaining or improving accuracy, thus
offering a simple yet efficient TTS alternative for SC.

TL;DR: The paper proposes ES-CoT, a method to shorten the inference cost of reasoning tasks in LLMs by detecting answer convergence and halting generation early, reducing token usage without substantial accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models excel at reasoning using lengthy chains-of-thought (CoT), but this comes at a high computational cost due to extensive inference time.

Method: The proposed method, ES-CoT, operates by prompting the LLM at each reasoning step to generate its step answer and track when the answer converges by observing jumps in run length of identical responses. Inference is terminated once convergence is detected beyond a threshold.

Result: Experiments demonstrated that ES-CoT reduces token usage during inference by around 41% on average while maintaining accuracy comparable to conventional CoT generation.

Conclusion: ES-CoT efficiently optimizes the reasoning process in LLMs by reducing inference time and token usage, making it a practical and robust approach for complex reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Reasoning large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated superior capacities
in solving complicated problems by generating long chain-of-thoughts (CoT), but
such a lengthy CoT incurs high inference costs. In this study, we introduce
ES-CoT, an inference-time method that shortens CoT generation by detecting
answer convergence and stopping early with minimal performance loss. At the end
of each reasoning step, we prompt the LLM to output its current final answer,
denoted as a step answer. We then track the run length of consecutive identical
step answers as a measure of answer convergence. Once the run length exhibits a
sharp increase and exceeds a minimum threshold, the generation is terminated.
We provide both empirical and theoretical support for this heuristic: step
answers steadily converge to the final answer, and large run-length jumps
reliably mark this convergence. Experiments on five reasoning datasets across
three LLMs show that ES-CoT reduces the number of inference tokens by about
41\% on average while maintaining accuracy comparable to standard CoT. Further,
ES-CoT integrates seamlessly with self-consistency prompting and remains robust
across hyperparameter choices, highlighting it as a practical and effective
approach for efficient reasoning.

### [60] [Hala Technical Report: Building Arabic-Centric Instruction & Translation Models at Scale](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14008)
*Hasan Abed Al Kader Hammoud,Mohammad Zbeeb,Bernard Ghanem*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces Hala, a series of Arabic-focused instruction and translation models utilizing advanced compression, fine-tuning, and specialized training approaches to achieve state-of-the-art performance in Arabic NLP.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance Arabic Natural Language Processing by developing specialized models that outperform baselines in translation and instruction-following tasks.

Method: The authors first compress a strong Arabic-English teacher model to FP8 for efficiency, then fine-tune a 1.2B language model to create a large-scale Arabic instruction dataset, and finally train models of varying sizes with slerp merging for optimal performance.

Result: Hala models outperform baseline models in Arabic-centric benchmarks for both small and nano model categories, establishing new state-of-the-art results.

Conclusion: The Hala models demonstrate the effectiveness of specialized training strategies for Arabic NLP, and the authors provide resources to further accelerate research in this area.

Abstract: We present Hala, a family of Arabic-centric instruction and translation
models built with our translate-and-tune pipeline. We first compress a strong
AR$\leftrightarrow$EN teacher to FP8 (yielding $\sim$2$\times$ higher
throughput with no quality loss) and use it to create high-fidelity bilingual
supervision. A lightweight language model LFM2-1.2B is then fine-tuned on this
data and used to translate high-quality English instruction sets into Arabic,
producing a million-scale corpus tailored to instruction following. We train
Hala models at 350M, 700M, 1.2B, and 9B parameters, and apply slerp merging to
balance Arabic specialization with base-model strengths. On Arabic-centric
benchmarks, Hala achieves state-of-the-art results within both the "nano"
($\leq$2B) and "small" (7-9B) categories, outperforming their bases. We release
models, data, evaluation, and recipes to accelerate research in Arabic NLP.

### [61] [Audio-Based Crowd-Sourced Evaluation of Machine Translation Quality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14023)
*Sami Ul Haq,Sheila Castilho,Yvette Graham*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study suggests evaluating machine translation (MT) quality using audio-based methods instead of solely text-only evaluations, finding consistency in rankings but identifying key differences that speech-based modalities highlight.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MT quality assessments are primarily text-centric, ignoring the real-world utility of spoken translations in applications like Google Translate Voice Mode.

Method: This paper utilizes crowd-sourced judgments via Amazon Mechanical Turk to compare text-only and audio-based evaluations of 10 MT systems, supported by statistical tests and self-replication experiments.

Result: Audio-based methods provided results consistent with text-based evaluations but uncovered important discrepancies, showcasing benefits of assessing translations through a richer, speech-based modality.

Conclusion: Speech-based assessments should complement text evaluations for MT systems to better reflect the natural usage of translation systems in real-world applications.

Abstract: Machine Translation (MT) has achieved remarkable performance, with growing
interest in speech translation and multimodal approaches. However, despite
these advancements, MT quality assessment remains largely text centric,
typically relying on human experts who read and compare texts. Since many
real-world MT applications (e.g Google Translate Voice Mode, iFLYTEK
Translator) involve translation being spoken rather printed or read, a more
natural way to assess translation quality would be through speech as opposed
text-only evaluations. This study compares text-only and audio-based
evaluations of 10 MT systems from the WMT General MT Shared Task, using
crowd-sourced judgments collected via Amazon Mechanical Turk. We additionally,
performed statistical significance testing and self-replication experiments to
test reliability and consistency of audio-based approach. Crowd-sourced
assessments based on audio yield rankings largely consistent with text only
evaluations but, in some cases, identify significant differences between
translation systems. We attribute this to speech richer, more natural modality
and propose incorporating speech-based assessments into future MT evaluation
frameworks.

*Paweł Mąka,Yusuf Can Semerci,Jan Scholtes,Gerasimos Spanakis*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates the impact of training data scarcity on context utilization in machine translation and proposes strategies to address it.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The difficulty of utilizing context in machine translation may stem from sparse contextually rich examples in training data.

Method: The authors create controlled training datasets and evaluate the impact of data sparsity through single- and multilingual experiments. They also propose two training strategies.

Result: Data sparsity is confirmed as a bottleneck. Proposed strategies improve context utilization by up to 6% in single-language settings and 8% in multilingual settings.

Conclusion: Addressing contextually rich data sparsity with specialized training strategies can improve model performance, but improvements on one phenomenon do not generalize to others.

Abstract: Achieving human-level translations requires leveraging context to ensure
coherence and handle complex phenomena like pronoun disambiguation. Sparsity of
contextually rich examples in the standard training data has been hypothesized
as the reason for the difficulty of context utilization. In this work, we
systematically validate this claim in both single- and multilingual settings by
constructing training datasets with a controlled proportions of contextually
relevant examples. We demonstrate a strong association between training data
sparsity and model performance confirming sparsity as a key bottleneck.
Importantly, we reveal that improvements in one contextual phenomenon do no
generalize to others. While we observe some cross-lingual transfer, it is not
significantly higher between languages within the same sub-family. Finally, we
propose and empirically evaluate two training strategies designed to leverage
the available data. These strategies improve context utilization, resulting in
accuracy gains of up to 6 and 8 percentage points on the ctxPro evaluation in
single- and multilingual settings respectively.

### [63] [Enhancing Multi-Agent Debate System Performance via Confidence Expression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14034)
*Zijie Lin,Bryan Hooi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes adding confidence expression to Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) systems involving Large Language Models (LLMs) to improve task performance and debate accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle to convey superior knowledge effectively during debates, and inappropriate confidence expression can lead to suboptimal debate outcomes, reducing their effectiveness in MAD systems.

Method: The study introduces ConfMAD, a framework for MAD systems that incorporates explicit confidence expression throughout the debate process.

Result: Experimental results show that adding confidence expression improves task performance and debate dynamics in MAD systems.

Conclusion: Integrating confidence expression into MAD systems not only enhances debate effectiveness but also offers insights for designing confidence-aware systems.

Abstract: Generative Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
performance across a wide range of tasks. Recent research has introduced
Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) systems, which leverage multiple LLMs to simulate
human debate and thereby improve task performance. However, while some LLMs may
possess superior knowledge or reasoning capabilities for specific tasks, they
often struggle to clearly communicate this advantage during debates, in part
due to a lack of confidence expression. Moreover, inappropriate confidence
expression can cause agents in MAD systems to either stubbornly maintain
incorrect beliefs or converge prematurely on suboptimal answers, ultimately
reducing debate effectiveness and overall system performance. To address these
challenges, we propose incorporating confidence expression into MAD systems to
allow LLMs to explicitly communicate their confidence levels. To validate this
approach, we develop ConfMAD, a MAD framework that integrates confidence
expression throughout the debate process. Experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method, and we further analyze how confidence influences
debate dynamics, offering insights into the design of confidence-aware MAD
systems.

### [64] [SSL-SSAW: Self-Supervised Learning with Sigmoid Self-Attention Weighting for Question-Based Sign Language Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14036)
*Zekang Liu,Wei Feng,Fanhua Shang,Lianyu Hu,Jichao Feng,Liqing Gao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new task called Question-based Sign Language Translation (QB-SLT), leveraging dialogue context to improve translation quality using self-supervised learning and multimodal alignment techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the need to bridge communication gaps between deaf and hearing individuals while exploring efficient integration of question dialogue, which is easier to annotate compared to gloss annotations.

Method: The authors propose a cross-modality Self-supervised Learning with Sigmoid Self-attention Weighting (SSL-SSAW) fusion method, using contrastive learning for multimodal feature alignment and self-supervised learning for enhanced representation.

Result: Experiments on newly constructed datasets show that the proposed SSL-SSAW method achieves state-of-the-art performance, with question-based assistance surpassing gloss-based assistance in translation tasks.

Conclusion: The findings emphasize the effectiveness of dialogue integration in sign language translation, highlighting its potential to enhance accessibility while reducing reliance on complex annotations like gloss.

Abstract: Sign Language Translation (SLT) bridges the communication gap between deaf
people and hearing people, where dialogue provides crucial contextual cues to
aid in translation. Building on this foundational concept, this paper proposes
Question-based Sign Language Translation (QB-SLT), a novel task that explores
the efficient integration of dialogue. Unlike gloss (sign language
transcription) annotations, dialogue naturally occurs in communication and is
easier to annotate. The key challenge lies in aligning multimodality features
while leveraging the context of the question to improve translation. To address
this issue, we propose a cross-modality Self-supervised Learning with Sigmoid
Self-attention Weighting (SSL-SSAW) fusion method for sign language
translation. Specifically, we employ contrastive learning to align
multimodality features in QB-SLT, then introduce a Sigmoid Self-attention
Weighting (SSAW) module for adaptive feature extraction from question and sign
language sequences. Additionally, we leverage available question text through
self-supervised learning to enhance representation and translation
capabilities. We evaluated our approach on newly constructed CSL-Daily-QA and
PHOENIX-2014T-QA datasets, where SSL-SSAW achieved SOTA performance. Notably,
easily accessible question assistance can achieve or even surpass the
performance of gloss assistance. Furthermore, visualization results demonstrate
the effectiveness of incorporating dialogue in improving translation quality.

*Monica Sekoyan,Nithin Rao Koluguri,Nune Tadevosyan,Piotr Zelasko,Travis Bartley,Nick Karpov,Jagadeesh Balam,Boris Ginsburg*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Canary-1B-v2, a fast, robust ASR and AST model for 25 languages, which outperforms competitors while being more efficient, and releases a smaller model variant, Parakeet-TDT-0.6B-v3.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind the paper is to address the need for a faster, more efficient, and robust multilingual ASR and AST model that performs well even with limited computational resources, covering diverse languages.

Method: The model incorporates a FastConformer encoder and Transformer decoder, pre-trained and fine-tuned on massive multilingual datasets (1.7M hours), uses non-speech audio for robustness, dynamic data balancing, and the NeMo Forced Aligner for timestamps.

Result: Canary-1B-v2 outperforms Whisper-large-v3 in English ASR and is 10x faster. It shows competitive multilingual ASR and AST performance against much larger models, while a smaller model, Parakeet-TDT-0.6B-v3, achieves comparable results with fewer parameters.

Conclusion: Canary-1B-v2 is highly efficient for ASR and AST tasks, demonstrating scalability and robustness. The release of Parakeet-TDT-0.6B-v3 cements progress in efficient multilingual speech recognition modeling.

Abstract: This report introduces Canary-1B-v2, a fast, robust multilingual model for
Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) and Speech-to-Text Translation (AST). Built
with a FastConformer encoder and Transformer decoder, it supports 25 languages
primarily European. The model was trained on 1.7M hours of total data samples,
including Granary and NeMo ASR Set 3.0, with non-speech audio added to reduce
hallucinations for ASR and AST. We describe its two-stage pre-training and
fine-tuning process with dynamic data balancing, as well as experiments with an
nGPT encoder. Results show nGPT scales well with massive data, while
FastConformer excels after fine-tuning. For timestamps, Canary-1B-v2 uses the
NeMo Forced Aligner (NFA) with an auxiliary CTC model, providing reliable
segment-level timestamps for ASR and AST. Evaluations show Canary-1B-v2
outperforms Whisper-large-v3 on English ASR while being 10x faster, and
delivers competitive multilingual ASR and AST performance against larger models
like Seamless-M4T-v2-large and LLM-based systems. We also release
Parakeet-TDT-0.6B-v3, a successor to v2, offering multilingual ASR across the
same 25 languages with just 600M parameters.

TL;DR: CS-FLEURS is a dataset designed for advancing research in code-switched speech recognition and translation, covering 113 language pairs across 52 languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the lack of resources for evaluating code-switched speech systems, particularly for low-resource languages.

Method: A diverse dataset was created with real voice recordings, generative text-to-speech, and concatenative text-to-speech across multiple language pairs and scenarios.

Result: CS-FLEURS offers 4 test sets covering 113 code-switched language pairs, alongside a training dataset with 128 hours of generative text-to-speech data.

Conclusion: The dataset is expected to foster research in code-switched speech and broaden the exploration of less-studied languages.

Abstract: We present CS-FLEURS, a new dataset for developing and evaluating
code-switched speech recognition and translation systems beyond high-resourced
languages. CS-FLEURS consists of 4 test sets which cover in total 113 unique
code-switched language pairs across 52 languages: 1) a 14 X-English language
pair set with real voices reading synthetically generated code-switched
sentences, 2) a 16 X-English language pair set with generative text-to-speech
3) a 60 {Arabic, Mandarin, Hindi, Spanish}-X language pair set with the
generative text-to-speech, and 4) a 45 X-English lower-resourced language pair
test set with concatenative text-to-speech. Besides the four test sets,
CS-FLEURS also provides a training set with 128 hours of generative

### [67] [AssoCiAm: A Benchmark for Evaluating Association Thinking while Circumventing Ambiguity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14171)
*Yifan Liu,Wenkuan Zhao,Shanshan Zhong,Jinghui Qin,Mingfu Liang,Zhongzhan Huang,Wushao Wen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a benchmark named AssoCiAm to evaluate the association abilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) while addressing ambiguities in such evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need to assess the creativity and associative abilities of MLLMs, as these are foundational for advancements toward artificial general intelligence (AGI). Existing methods fail to address inherent ambiguities in association tasks, leading to unreliable evaluations.

Method: The authors categorize ambiguity into two types—internal and external—and propose AssoCiAm, a benchmark that uses a hybrid computational approach to evaluate associative ability while mitigating ambiguities.

Result: Extensive experiments on MLLMs reveal a strong correlation between cognition and association, and that ambiguity in evaluation leads to more random-like behavior in MLLMs. The proposed method ensures more accurate and reliable evaluations.

Conclusion: The study validates that AssoCiAm effectively addresses ambiguities in assessing the associative abilities of MLLMs, providing a more reliable framework for understanding creativity in these models.

Abstract: Recent advancements in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have garnered
significant attention, offering a promising pathway toward artificial general
intelligence (AGI). Among the essential capabilities required for AGI,
creativity has emerged as a critical trait for MLLMs, with association serving
as its foundation. Association reflects a model' s ability to think creatively,
making it vital to evaluate and understand. While several frameworks have been
proposed to assess associative ability, they often overlook the inherent
ambiguity in association tasks, which arises from the divergent nature of
associations and undermines the reliability of evaluations. To address this
issue, we decompose ambiguity into two types-internal ambiguity and external
ambiguity-and introduce AssoCiAm, a benchmark designed to evaluate associative
ability while circumventing the ambiguity through a hybrid computational
method. We then conduct extensive experiments on MLLMs, revealing a strong
positive correlation between cognition and association. Additionally, we
observe that the presence of ambiguity in the evaluation process causes MLLMs'
behavior to become more random-like. Finally, we validate the effectiveness of
our method in ensuring more accurate and reliable evaluations. See Project Page

*Akhil Theerthala*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a cost-effective and high-performing financial advisory model by fine-tuning a smaller LLM on curated behavioral finance datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current systems for financial advice are either resource-intensive with low returns or inadequate in personalized support. The paper aims to address inefficiencies in balancing cost, performance, and personalization.

Method: The authors developed a new framework integrating financial contexts and behavioral studies, creating a reasoning dataset. They fine-tuned the Qwen-3-8B model using this dataset and evaluated its performance.

Result: The study showed that the fine-tuned 8B parameter model matches the performance of much larger models (14-32B parameters) in accuracy, fluency, and personalization, while reducing costs by 80%.

Conclusion: End-to-end financial advisory models can achieve smaller sizes and lower costs without compromising their effectiveness when supported by curated behavioral finance datasets.

Abstract: Personalized financial advice requires consideration of user goals,
constraints, risk tolerance, and jurisdiction. Prior LLM work has focused on
support systems for investors and financial planners. Simultaneously, numerous
recent studies examine broader personal finance tasks, including budgeting,
debt management, retirement, and estate planning, through agentic pipelines
that incur high maintenance costs, yielding less than 25% of their expected
financial returns. In this study, we introduce a novel and reproducible
framework that integrates relevant financial context with behavioral finance
studies to construct supervision data for end-to-end advisors. Using this
framework, we create a 19k sample reasoning dataset and conduct a comprehensive
fine-tuning of the Qwen-3-8B model on the dataset. Through a held-out test
split and a blind LLM-jury study, we demonstrate that through careful data
curation and behavioral integration, our 8B model achieves performance
comparable to significantly larger baselines (14-32B parameters) across factual
accuracy, fluency, and personalization metrics while incurring 80% lower costs
than the larger counterparts.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study uses large language models (LLMs) to analyze migration-related discourse in UK parliamentary debates over 75 years and compare it with US congressional discourse, uncovering nuanced trends in tone and narrative framing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand long-term trends and differences in migration-related discourse in UK and US legislative bodies, and to showcase the capabilities of LLMs in complex political discourse analysis.

Method: A computational framework using open-weight LLMs to annotate legislative statements with stances, track net tones over time, and extract narrative frames for nuanced discourse analysis.

Result: US discourse has grown increasingly polarized, while UK parliamentary attitudes remain aligned but show an ideological gap between Labour and Conservatives. Discourse in the UK also shifted toward securitized narratives like border control, replacing integration and national law discussions with international law and human rights.

Conclusion: LLMs can enable scalable and nuanced analysis of complex historical and political discourse, offering insights into trends such as polarization, securitization, and shifts in narrative framing across time.

Abstract: We present a large-scale computational analysis of migration-related
discourse in UK parliamentary debates spanning over 75 years and compare it
with US congressional discourse. Using open-weight LLMs, we annotate each
statement with high-level stances toward migrants and track the net tone toward
migrants across time and political parties. For the UK, we extend this with a
semi-automated framework for extracting fine-grained narrative frames to
capture nuances of migration discourse. Our findings show that, while US
discourse has grown increasingly polarised, UK parliamentary attitudes remain
relatively aligned across parties, with a persistent ideological gap between
Labour and the Conservatives, reaching its most negative level in 2025. The
analysis of narrative frames in the UK parliamentary statements reveals a shift
toward securitised narratives such as border control and illegal immigration,
while longer-term integration-oriented frames such as social integration have
declined. Moreover, discussions of national law about immigration have been
replaced over time by international law and human rights, revealing nuances in
discourse trends. Taken together broadly, our findings demonstrate how LLMs can
support scalable, fine-grained discourse analysis in political and historical
contexts.

TL;DR: This paper introduces Apertus, a suite of open large language models (LLMs) emphasizing data compliance and multilingual capabilities. The models are trained on openly available data, prioritizing ethical considerations and multilingual inclusivity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of open language models in ensuring data compliance and fair multilingual representation.

Method: Pretraining on openly accessible 15T tokens from 1800+ languages, adopting the Goldfish objective to reduce data memorization, and focusing on non-English data (40%).

Result: Achieved near state-of-the-art performance on multilingual benchmarks with models at 8B and 70B scales.

Conclusion: Apertus provides transparent, reproducible, and ethical LLM development, supporting broad community collaboration through fully open scientific artifacts.

Abstract: We present Apertus, a fully open suite of large language models (LLMs)
designed to address two systemic shortcomings in today's open model ecosystem:
data compliance and multilingual representation. Unlike many prior models that
release weights without reproducible data pipelines or regard for content-owner
rights, Apertus models are pretrained exclusively on openly available data,
retroactively respecting robots.txt exclusions and filtering for
non-permissive, toxic, and personally identifiable content. To mitigate risks
of memorization, we adopt the Goldfish objective during pretraining, strongly
suppressing verbatim recall of data while retaining downstream task
performance. The Apertus models also expand multilingual coverage, training on
15T tokens from over 1800 languages, with ~40% of pretraining data allocated to
non-English content. Released at 8B and 70B scales, Apertus approaches
state-of-the-art results among fully open models on multilingual benchmarks,
rivalling or surpassing open-weight counterparts. Beyond model weights, we
release all scientific artifacts from our development cycle with a permissive
license, including data preparation scripts, checkpoints, evaluation suites,
and training code, enabling transparent audit and extension.

*Hassan Gharoun,Mohammad Sadegh Khorshidi,Kasra Ranjbarigderi,Fang Chen,Amir H. Gandomi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces an instance-adaptive decision-making mechanism using evidence retrieval, which ensures greater transparency, reliability, and interpretability in uncertainty-aware decisions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of global cutoff thresholds in uncertainty-aware decision-making and improve transparency and reliability outcomes.

Method: The approach retrieves proximal evidence in embedding spaces and fuses their predictive distributions using Dempster-Shafer theory to generate instance-specific thresholds.

Result: Experiments on CIFAR-10/100 datasets demonstrate superior or comparable performance with fewer confidently incorrect decisions and manageable review load compared to conventional entropy-based thresholds.

Conclusion: Evidence-conditioned decision-making provides a more interpretable and reliable alternative to fixed entropy-based thresholds for operational uncertainty-aware systems.

Abstract: This work proposes an evidence-retrieval mechanism for uncertainty-aware
decision-making that replaces a single global cutoff with an
evidence-conditioned, instance-adaptive criterion. For each test instance,
proximal exemplars are retrieved in an embedding space; their predictive
distributions are fused via Dempster-Shafer theory. The resulting fused belief
acts as a per-instance thresholding mechanism. Because the supporting evidences
are explicit, decisions are transparent and auditable. Experiments on
CIFAR-10/100 with BiT and ViT backbones show higher or comparable
uncertainty-aware performance with materially fewer confidently incorrect
outcomes and a sustainable review load compared with applying threshold on
prediction entropy. Notably, only a few evidences are sufficient to realize
these gains; increasing the evidence set yields only modest changes. These
results indicate that evidence-conditioned tagging provides a more reliable and
interpretable alternative to fixed prediction entropy thresholds for
operational uncertainty-aware decision-making.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper compares hybrid quantum-classical neural networks to purely classical models on benchmarks (MNIST, CIFAR100, STL10), showing that hybrid models outperform in accuracy, speed, and resource efficiency, especially with complex datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate the effectiveness of hybrid quantum-classical neural networks versus traditional classical models in terms of performance, efficiency, and robustness.

Method: The study integrates parameterized quantum circuits with classical deep learning architectures and compares them to conventional CNNs across benchmarks, analyzing accuracy, training time, robustness, and resource usage.

Result: Hybrid models perform better in accuracy (+9-10% gains on CIFAR100 and STL10), train 5-12x faster, use fewer parameters (6-32%), and consume less memory and CPU. They also show increased robustness on simpler datasets but similar fragility on complex datasets under adversarial attacks.

Conclusion: Hybrid quantum-classical architectures demonstrate significant advantages in scalability, speed, resource efficiency, and generalization, making them particularly suitable for complex vision tasks.

Abstract: This study presents a systematic comparison between hybrid quantum-classical
neural networks and purely classical models across three benchmark datasets
(MNIST, CIFAR100, and STL10) to evaluate their performance, efficiency, and
robustness. The hybrid models integrate parameterized quantum circuits with
classical deep learning architectures, while the classical counterparts use
conventional convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Experiments were conducted
over 50 training epochs for each dataset, with evaluations on validation
accuracy, test accuracy, training time, computational resource usage, and
adversarial robustness (tested with $\epsilon=0.1$ perturbations).Key findings
demonstrate that hybrid models consistently outperform classical models in
final accuracy, achieving {99.38\% (MNIST), 41.69\% (CIFAR100), and 74.05\%
(STL10) validation accuracy, compared to classical benchmarks of 98.21\%,
32.25\%, and 63.76\%, respectively. Notably, the hybrid advantage scales with
dataset complexity, showing the most significant gains on CIFAR100 (+9.44\%)
and STL10 (+10.29\%). Hybrid models also train 5--12$\times$ faster (e.g.,
21.23s vs. 108.44s per epoch on MNIST) and use 6--32\% fewer parameters} while
maintaining superior generalization to unseen test data.Adversarial robustness
tests reveal that hybrid models are significantly more resilient on simpler
datasets (e.g., 45.27\% robust accuracy on MNIST vs. 10.80\% for classical) but
show comparable fragility on complex datasets like CIFAR100 ($\sim$1\%
robustness for both). Resource efficiency analyses indicate that hybrid models
consume less memory (4--5GB vs. 5--6GB for classical) and lower CPU utilization
(9.5\% vs. 23.2\% on average).These results suggest that hybrid
quantum-classical architectures offer compelling advantages in accuracy,
training efficiency, and parameter scalability, particularly for complex vision
tasks.

### [73] [Research on Expressway Congestion Warning Technology Based on YOLOv11-DIoU and GRU-Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13361)
*Tong Yulin,Liang Xuechen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces an advanced framework combining optimized perception algorithms (YOLOv11-DIoU and improved DeepSort) and a GRU-Attention model to improve vehicle detection and congestion forecasting on expressways.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address critical flaws in current traffic detection-prediction systems, such as low vehicle perception accuracy under occlusion and insufficient long-sequence dependency capture for congestion forecasting.

Method: Perception was improved using upgraded YOLOv11-DIoU and DeepSort for better vehicle tracking. Congestion forecasting was handled using a GRU-Attention model trained on traffic flow, density, and speed data.

Result: YOLOv11-DIoU achieved 95.7% mAP, DeepSort delivered 93.8% MOTA, and the GRU-Attention model achieved 99.7% test accuracy while providing highly accurate congestion warnings.

Conclusion: The framework successfully mitigates major issues in detection-prediction systems, improving congestion control accuracy and offering high potential for intelligent transportation applications.

Abstract: Expressway traffic congestion severely reduces travel efficiency and hinders
regional connectivity. Existing "detection-prediction" systems have critical
flaws: low vehicle perception accuracy under occlusion and loss of
long-sequence dependencies in congestion forecasting. This study proposes an
integrated technical framework to resolve these issues.For traffic flow
perception, two baseline algorithms were optimized. Traditional YOLOv11 was
upgraded to YOLOv11-DIoU by replacing GIoU Loss with DIoU Loss, and DeepSort
was improved by fusing Mahalanobis (motion) and cosine (appearance) distances.
Experiments on Chang-Shen Expressway videos showed YOLOv11-DIoU achieved 95.7\%
mAP (6.5 percentage points higher than baseline) with 5.3\% occlusion miss
rate. DeepSort reached 93.8\% MOTA (11.3 percentage points higher than SORT)
with only 4 ID switches. Using the Greenberg model (for 10-15 vehicles/km
high-density scenarios), speed and density showed a strong negative correlation
(r=-0.97), conforming to traffic flow theory. For congestion warning, a
GRU-Attention model was built to capture congestion precursors. Trained 300
epochs with flow, density, and speed, it achieved 99.7\% test accuracy (7-9
percentage points higher than traditional GRU). In 10-minute advance warnings
for 30-minute congestion, time error was $\leq$ 1 minute. Validation with an
independent video showed 95\% warning accuracy, over 90\% spatial overlap of
congestion points, and stable performance in high-flow ($>$5 vehicles/second)
scenarios.This framework provides quantitative support for expressway
congestion control, with promising intelligent transportation applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the mechanisms, advantages, and robustness of Vision-Language Models in zero-shot OOD detection to advance AI reliability.

Method: A systematic empirical analysis using in-distribution (ID) and OOD prompts to examine VLM embedding space properties, quantify advantages over single-modal approaches, and analyze sensitivity to prompt phrasing.

Result: VLMs excel in leveraging rich semantic novelty for OOD detection but are sensitive to prompt phrasing despite their resilience to common image noise.

Conclusion: The study offers a structured understanding of VLMs’ strengths in OOD detection and points out critical robustness vulnerabilities, guiding future model design improvements.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs), such as CLIP, have demonstrated remarkable
zero-shot out-of-distribution (OOD) detection capabilities, vital for reliable
AI systems. Despite this promising capability, a comprehensive understanding of
(1) why they work so effectively, (2) what advantages do they have over
single-modal methods, and (3) how is their behavioral robustness -- remains
notably incomplete within the research community. This paper presents a
systematic empirical analysis of VLM-based OOD detection using in-distribution
(ID) and OOD prompts. (1) Mechanisms: We systematically characterize and
formalize key operational properties within the VLM embedding space that
facilitate zero-shot OOD detection. (2) Advantages: We empirically quantify the
superiority of these models over established single-modal approaches,
attributing this distinct advantage to the VLM's capacity to leverage rich
semantic novelty. (3) Sensitivity: We uncovers a significant and previously
under-explored asymmetry in their robustness profile: while exhibiting
resilience to common image noise, these VLM-based methods are highly sensitive
to prompt phrasing. Our findings contribute a more structured understanding of
the strengths and critical vulnerabilities inherent in VLM-based OOD detection,
offering crucial, empirically-grounded guidance for developing more robust and
reliable future designs.

Result: Experiments showed that curvature-based analysis reliably estimates intrinsic dimensionality and provides insights into the geometry of empirical networks, enabling evaluation of dimensionality reduction techniques.

Conclusion: Curvature-based geometric profiling is a valuable tool for analyzing the structural properties of metric spaces and data reductions, offering quantitative evaluation capabilities and insights into data geometry.

Abstract: Utilizing recently developed abstract notions of sectional curvature, we
introduce a method for constructing a curvature-based geometric profile of
discrete metric spaces. The curvature concept that we use here captures the
metric relations between triples of points and other points. More
significantly, based on this curvature profile, we introduce a quantitative
measure to evaluate the effectiveness of data representations, such as those
produced by dimensionality reduction techniques. Furthermore, Our experiments
demonstrate that this curvature-based analysis can be employed to estimate the
intrinsic dimensionality of datasets. We use this to explore the large-scale
geometry of empirical networks and to evaluate the effectiveness of
dimensionality reduction techniques.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a distributed Federated Learning approach to identify and locate deforestation using satellite imagery while preserving data security.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deforestation monitoring is crucial for geographical analysis, and traditional centralized methods risk data security. A distributed method is needed to maintain privacy while ensuring effective satellite image processing.

Method: The paper combines FLOWER and RAY frameworks for distributed Federated Learning, using YOLOS-small, Faster R-CNN with ResNet50, and Faster R-CNN with MobileNetV3 architectures applied to publicly available datasets.

Result: The proposed framework achieves efficient deforestation identification across satellite centers by leveraging Federated Learning for privacy-preserving, collaborative model training.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the potential of Federated Learning in advancing deforestation monitoring through secure and distributed satellite image processing.

Abstract: Accurate identification of deforestation from satellite images is essential
in order to understand the geographical situation of an area. This paper
introduces a new distributed approach to identify as well as locate
deforestation across different clients using Federated Learning (FL). Federated
Learning enables distributed network clients to collaboratively train a model
while maintaining data privacy and security of the active users. In our
framework, a client corresponds to an edge satellite center responsible for
local data processing. Moreover, FL provides an advantage over centralized
training method which requires combining data, thereby compromising with data
security of the clients. Our framework leverages the FLOWER framework with RAY
framework to execute the distributed learning workload. Furthermore, efficient
client spawning is ensured by RAY as it can select definite amount of users to
create an emulation environment. Our FL framework uses YOLOS-small (a Vision
Transformer variant), Faster R-CNN with a ResNet50 backbone, and Faster R-CNN
with a MobileNetV3 backbone models trained and tested on publicly available
datasets. Our approach provides us a different view for image
segmentation-based tasks on satellite imagery.

deployment on low-cost edge hardware using mixed-precision inference. The
system supports incremental updates by adding embeddings from previously unseen
objects into a reference database without requiring model retraining. Extensive
experiments on real-world surveillance and drone video datasets demonstrate the
framework's high accuracy and robustness across diverse FOI scenarios. In
addition, hardware benchmarks on NVIDIA Jetson devices confirm the framework's

### [80] [EdiVal-Agent: An Object-Centric Framework for Automated, Scalable, Fine-Grained Evaluation of Multi-Turn Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13399)

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EdiVal-Agent is introduced to address evaluation challenges in instruction-based image editing by combining vision-language models with expert tools, providing a fine-grained evaluation framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluation methods either suffer from biases or lack precision and interpretable assessments in instruction-based image editing.

Method: EdiVal-Agent decomposes an image into objects, generates context-aware instructions, and integrates tools like vision-language models, object detectors, and human preference models for evaluation.

Result: The framework achieves stronger human judgment agreement in instruction-following evaluation and its modular design supports flexible integration of future tools.

Conclusion: EdiVal-Agent enhances the reliability of image editing evaluation and identifies failure modes to aid in improving editing models.

Abstract: Instruction-based image editing has advanced rapidly, yet reliable and
interpretable evaluation remains a bottleneck. Current protocols either (i)
depend on paired reference images -- resulting in limited coverage and
inheriting biases from prior generative models -- or (ii) rely solely on
zero-shot vision-language models (VLMs), whose prompt-based assessments of
instruction following, content consistency, and visual quality are often
imprecise.
  To address this, we introduce EdiVal-Agent, an automated, scalable, and
fine-grained evaluation framework for multi-turn instruction-based editing from
an object-centric perspective, supported by a suite of expert tools. Given an
image, EdiVal-Agent first decomposes it into semantically meaningful objects,
then synthesizes diverse, context-aware editing instructions. For evaluation,
it integrates VLMs with open-vocabulary object detectors to assess instruction
following, uses semantic-level feature extractors to evaluate content
consistency, and leverages human preference models to judge visual quality. We
show that combining VLMs with object detectors yields stronger agreement with
human judgments in instruction-following evaluation compared to using VLMs
alone and CLIP-based metrics. Furthermore, the pipeline's modular design allows
future tools to be seamlessly integrated, enhancing evaluation accuracy over
time.
  Instantiating this pipeline, we build EdiVal-Bench, a multi-turn editing
benchmark covering 9 instruction types and 11 state-of-the-art editing models
spanning autoregressive (AR) (including Nano Banana, GPT-Image-1),
flow-matching, and diffusion paradigms. We demonstrate that EdiVal-Agent can be
used to identify existing failure modes, thereby informing the development of
the next generation of editing models. Project page:

TL;DR: This paper introduces "MapAnything," a unified transformer-based model that performs multiple 3D vision tasks using images and optional geometric inputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a universal model capable of performing diverse 3D vision tasks efficiently, in a unified and standardized manner.

Method: The model uses a factored multi-view scene geometry representation and leverages standardized training across datasets while allowing flexible input augmentation.

Result: MapAnything matches or outperforms specialized models and exhibits efficient joint training for a variety of 3D vision challenges.

Conclusion: MapAnything establishes a framework that could serve as a versatile backbone for 3D reconstruction tasks, achieving state-of-the-art results across multiple applications.

Abstract: We introduce MapAnything, a unified transformer-based feed-forward model that
ingests one or more images along with optional geometric inputs such as camera
intrinsics, poses, depth, or partial reconstructions, and then directly
regresses the metric 3D scene geometry and cameras. MapAnything leverages a
factored representation of multi-view scene geometry, i.e., a collection of
depth maps, local ray maps, camera poses, and a metric scale factor that
effectively upgrades local reconstructions into a globally consistent metric
frame. Standardizing the supervision and training across diverse datasets,
along with flexible input augmentation, enables MapAnything to address a broad
range of 3D vision tasks in a single feed-forward pass, including uncalibrated
structure-from-motion, calibrated multi-view stereo, monocular depth
estimation, camera localization, depth completion, and more. We provide
extensive experimental analyses and model ablations demonstrating that
MapAnything outperforms or matches specialist feed-forward models while
offering more efficient joint training behavior, thus paving the way toward a
universal 3D reconstruction backbone.

*Yujia Lin,Nicholas Evans*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper focuses on enhancing cross-modal localization by integrating semantic information into RGB and LiDAR modalities. A new framework called SCM-PR is introduced to boost visual place recognition in GPS-denied environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of robot localization in environments without GPS, particularly overcoming issues like sensitivity to illumination, weather, seasonal changes, and viewpoint variations.

Method: The proposed SCM-PR framework introduces a VMamba backbone for RGB image feature extraction, a Semantic-Aware Feature Fusion (SAFF) module, semantic-augmented LiDAR descriptors, and cross-modal semantic attention in NetVLAD. It utilizes contrastive learning and multi-view semantic-geometric matching for robust localization.

Result: Experiments on the KITTI and KITTI-360 datasets demonstrate that SCM-PR outperforms existing cross-modal place recognition methods in achieving better localization accuracy.

Conclusion: SCM-PR effectively addresses previous challenges in visual place recognition by leveraging semantic and geometric information, setting new benchmarks for cross-modal localization methods in GPS-denied environments.

Abstract: Ensuring accurate localization of robots in environments without GPS
capability is a challenging task. Visual Place Recognition (VPR) techniques can
potentially achieve this goal, but existing RGB-based methods are sensitive to
changes in illumination, weather, and other seasonal changes. Existing
cross-modal localization methods leverage the geometric properties of RGB
images and 3D LiDAR maps to reduce the sensitivity issues highlighted above.
Currently, state-of-the-art methods struggle in complex scenes, fine-grained or
high-resolution matching, and situations where changes can occur in viewpoint.
In this work, we introduce a framework we call Semantic-Enhanced Cross-Modal
Place Recognition (SCM-PR) that combines high-level semantics utilizing RGB
images for robust localization in LiDAR maps. Our proposed method introduces: a
VMamba backbone for feature extraction of RGB images; a Semantic-Aware Feature
Fusion (SAFF) module for using both place descriptors and segmentation masks;
LiDAR descriptors that incorporate both semantics and geometry; and a
cross-modal semantic attention mechanism in NetVLAD to improve matching.
Incorporating the semantic information also was instrumental in designing a
Multi-View Semantic-Geometric Matching and a Semantic Consistency Loss, both in
a contrastive learning framework. Our experimental work on the KITTI and
KITTI-360 datasets show that SCM-PR achieves state-of-the-art performance
compared to other cross-modal place recognition methods.

### [83] [Improving 3D Gaussian Splatting Compression by Scene-Adaptive Lattice Vector Quantization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13482)
*Hao Xu,Xiaolin Wu,Xi Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a scene-adaptive lattice vector quantization (SALVQ) for compressing 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) data, enhancing compression efficiency and adaptability over traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid rise of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) for photorealistic rendering necessitates efficient data compression to address the massive data it generates. Current methods rely on uniform scalar quantization, which may not be optimal.

Method: The authors introduce SALVQ, which replaces uniform scalar quantization with a scene-adaptive lattice vector quantization approach. It involves optimizing lattice bases for each scene and uses scale-adjustable lattice density for dynamic bit rate accommodation.

Result: SALVQ achieves better rate-distortion (R-D) efficiency compared to traditional quantization techniques, enhances compression performance with minimal system changes, and supports multiple bit rate targets efficiently.

Conclusion: SALVQ improves the adaptability and efficiency of 3DGS data compression while reducing training time and memory usage, making it a robust solution for practical scenarios.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is rapidly gaining popularity for its
photorealistic rendering quality and real-time performance, but it generates
massive amounts of data. Hence compressing 3DGS data is necessary for the cost
effectiveness of 3DGS models. Recently, several anchor-based neural compression
methods have been proposed, achieving good 3DGS compression performance.
However, they all rely on uniform scalar quantization (USQ) due to its
simplicity. A tantalizing question is whether more sophisticated quantizers can
improve the current 3DGS compression methods with very little extra overhead
and minimal change to the system. The answer is yes by replacing USQ with
lattice vector quantization (LVQ). To better capture scene-specific
characteristics, we optimize the lattice basis for each scene, improving LVQ's
adaptability and R-D efficiency. This scene-adaptive LVQ (SALVQ) strikes a
balance between the R-D efficiency of vector quantization and the low
complexity of USQ. SALVQ can be seamlessly integrated into existing 3DGS
compression architectures, enhancing their R-D performance with minimal
modifications and computational overhead. Moreover, by scaling the lattice
basis vectors, SALVQ can dynamically adjust lattice density, enabling a single
model to accommodate multiple bit rate targets. This flexibility eliminates the
need to train separate models for different compression levels, significantly
reducing training time and memory consumption.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper focuses on detecting group-level social interactions from urban street-view images by introducing a new task and method, along with a dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To aid urban planning and design by better understanding social interactions in public spaces.

Method: Introduces MINGLE, a three-stage pipeline using human detection, VLM-based reasoning, and spatial aggregation for identifying social groups in images.

Result: Developed a dataset with 100K street-view images annotated with bounding boxes and labels for individuals and groups.

Conclusion: The proposed method and dataset pave the way for future research in detecting and analyzing interpersonal social interactions visually.

Abstract: Understanding group-level social interactions in public spaces is crucial for
urban planning, informing the design of socially vibrant and inclusive
environments. Detecting such interactions from images involves interpreting
subtle visual cues such as relations, proximity, and co-movement - semantically
complex signals that go beyond traditional object detection. To address this
challenge, we introduce a social group region detection task, which requires
inferring and spatially grounding visual regions defined by abstract
interpersonal relations. We propose MINGLE (Modeling INterpersonal Group-Level
Engagement), a modular three-stage pipeline that integrates: (1) off-the-shelf
human detection and depth estimation, (2) VLM-based reasoning to classify
pairwise social affiliation, and (3) a lightweight spatial aggregation
algorithm to localize socially connected groups. To support this task and
encourage future research, we present a new dataset of 100K urban street-view
images annotated with bounding boxes and labels for both individuals and
socially interacting groups. The annotations combine human-created labels and
outputs from the MINGLE pipeline, ensuring semantic richness and broad coverage
of real-world scenarios.

*Rajatsubhra Chakraborty,Xujun Che,Depeng Xu,Cori Faklaris,Xi Niu,Shuhan Yuan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BiasMap is a model-agnostic framework designed to uncover and mitigate latent concept-level representational biases in stable diffusion text-to-image models, addressing structural entanglements between demographics and semantics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in existing fairness discovery approaches that focus narrowly on output-level demographic distributions and fail to ensure disentangled concept representations.

Method: BiasMap uses cross-attention attribution maps to identify demographic-semantic entanglements and quantifies these biases using Intersection over Union (IoU). It further employs energy-guided diffusion sampling for bias mitigation during image generation.

Result: BiasMap reveals hidden biases in diffusion models and demonstrates improved mitigation of concept-level coupling compared to existing fairness interventions, which often fail to address this aspect effectively.

Conclusion: The framework provides a new lens into representational biases and offers a practical method to mitigate these biases in generative models, advancing fairness in text-to-image generation.

Abstract: Bias discovery is critical for black-box generative models, especiall
text-to-image (TTI) models. Existing works predominantly focus on output-level
demographic distributions, which do not necessarily guarantee concept
representations to be disentangled post-mitigation. We propose BiasMap, a
model-agnostic framework for uncovering latent concept-level representational
biases in stable diffusion models. BiasMap leverages cross-attention
attribution maps to reveal structural entanglements between demographics (e.g.,
gender, race) and semantics (e.g., professions), going deeper into
representational bias during the image generation. Using attribution maps of
these concepts, we quantify the spatial demographics-semantics concept
entanglement via Intersection over Union (IoU), offering a lens into bias that
remains hidden in existing fairness discovery approaches. In addition, we
further utilize BiasMap for bias mitigation through energy-guided diffusion
sampling that directly modifies latent noise space and minimizes the expected
SoftIoU during the denoising process. Our findings show that existing fairness
interventions may reduce the output distributional gap but often fail to
disentangle concept-level coupling, whereas our mitigation method can mitigate
concept entanglement in image generation while complementing distributional
bias mitigation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LivePyxel is a Python-based GUI for real-time image annotation, designed for seamless integration with imaging systems like microscopes and webcams.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitation in flexible annotation tools, especially in environments requiring real-time data acquisition, such as laboratories.

Method: Develop a Python-based graphical user interface (LivePyxel) that integrates with imaging systems for real-time annotation using tools like Bézier splines, binary masks, and non-destructive layers.

Result: LivePyxel offers optimized annotation capability with wide compatibility, enabling high-performance editing and seamless data labeling.

Conclusion: LivePyxel accelerates AI model development in experimental workflows and is freely accessible for users.

Abstract: The lack of flexible annotation tools has hindered the deployment of AI
models in some scientific areas. Most existing image annotation software
requires users to upload a precollected dataset, which limits support for
on-demand pipelines and introduces unnecessary steps to acquire images. This
constraint is particularly problematic in laboratory environments, where
real-time data acquisition from instruments such as microscopes is increasingly
common. In this work, we introduce \texttt{LivePixel}, a Python-based graphical
user interface that integrates with imaging systems, such as webcams,
microscopes, and others, to enable real-time image annotation. LivePyxel is
designed to be easy to use through a simple interface that allows users to
precisely delimit areas for annotation using tools commonly found in commercial
graphics editing software. Of particular interest is the availability of
B\'ezier splines and binary masks, and the software's capacity to work with
non-destructive layers that enable high-performance editing. LivePyxel also
integrates a wide compatibility across video devices, and it's optimized for

### [87] [DEFT-VTON: Efficient Virtual Try-On with Consistent Generalised H-Transform](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13506)
*Xingzi Xu,Qi Li,Shuwen Qiu,Julien Han,Karim Bouyarmane*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes DEFT for low-budget virtual try-on (VTO), improving efficiency and quality with minimal parameter updates and a novel consistency loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VTO methods rely heavily on large pre-trained models, which demand extensive training and high resource budgets for deployment, making them impractical for real-world applications on limited budgets.

Method: The paper introduces DEFT, which fine-tunes pre-trained models using a small h-transform network, training only 1.42% of parameters. It also incorporates an adaptive consistency loss to improve performance and reduce inference time.

Result: The DEFT-VTON method achieves state-of-the-art performance on VTO tasks with competitive results using only 15 denoising steps.

Conclusion: DEFT solves the efficiency and resource challenges of VTO by leveraging minimal parameter tuning and adaptive techniques, maintaining high-quality results while lowering costs.

Abstract: Diffusion models enable high-quality virtual try-on (VTO) with their
established image synthesis abilities. Despite the extensive end-to-end
training of large pre-trained models involved in current VTO methods,
real-world applications often prioritize limited training and inference,
serving, and deployment budgets for VTO. To solve this obstacle, we apply
Doob's h-transform efficient fine-tuning (DEFT) for adapting large pre-trained
unconditional models for downstream image-conditioned VTO abilities. DEFT
freezes the pre-trained model's parameters and trains a small h-transform
network to learn a conditional h-transform. The h-transform network allows
training only 1.42 percent of the frozen parameters, compared to a baseline of
5.52 percent in traditional parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT).
  To further improve DEFT's performance and decrease existing models' inference
time, we additionally propose an adaptive consistency loss. Consistency
training distills slow but high-performing diffusion models into a fast one
while retaining performance by enforcing consistencies along the inference
path. Inspired by constrained optimization, instead of distillation, we combine
the consistency loss and the denoising score matching loss in a data-adaptive
manner for fine-tuning existing VTO models at a low cost. Empirical results
show the proposed DEFT-VTON method achieves state-of-the-art performance on VTO
tasks, with as few as 15 denoising steps, while maintaining competitive
results.

Abstract: In the autonomous driving area synthetic data is crucial for cover specific

deploy data augmentation to generate custom traffic scenarios with VRUs in
order to improve pedestrian recognition. We provide a pipeline for augmentation

architecture for adversarial learning of the data-set lighting conditions. We

*Maksim Penkin,Andrey Krylov*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents FunKAN, an interpretable neural framework for medical image enhancement and segmentation, utilizing functional Kolmogorov-Arnold representation for improved outcomes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address challenges in medical image processing, constrained by artifacts and complex anatomical variations, while improving interpretability and accuracy in segmentation methods.

Method: The proposed method introduces FunKAN leveraging Fourier decomposition over Hermite functions to maintain spatial structure. It includes U-FunKAN for medical image segmentation applied to diverse medical imaging datasets.

Result: FunKAN demonstrates superior performance in metrics like PSNR, TV for image enhancement, and IoU, F1 for segmentation tasks on diverse datasets compared to other KAN-based solutions.

Conclusion: FunKAN bridges theoretical function approximation and practical clinical applications, offering an interpretable and effective tool for medical image processing.

Abstract: Medical image enhancement and segmentation are critical yet challenging tasks
in modern clinical practice, constrained by artifacts and complex anatomical
variations. Traditional deep learning approaches often rely on complex
architectures with limited interpretability. While Kolmogorov-Arnold networks
offer interpretable solutions, their reliance on flattened feature
representations fundamentally disrupts the intrinsic spatial structure of
imaging data. To address this issue we propose a Functional Kolmogorov-Arnold
Network (FunKAN) -- a novel interpretable neural framework, designed
specifically for image processing, that formally generalizes the
Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem onto functional spaces and learns
inner functions using Fourier decomposition over the basis Hermite functions.
We explore FunKAN on several medical image processing tasks, including Gibbs
ringing suppression in magnetic resonance images, benchmarking on IXI dataset.
We also propose U-FunKAN as state-of-the-art binary medical segmentation model
with benchmarks on three medical datasets: BUSI (ultrasound images), GlaS
(histological structures) and CVC-ClinicDB (colonoscopy videos), detecting
breast cancer, glands and polyps, respectively. Experiments on those diverse
datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms other KAN-based backbones in
both medical image enhancement (PSNR, TV) and segmentation (IoU, F1). Our work
bridges the gap between theoretical function approximation and medical image
analysis, offering a robust, interpretable solution for clinical applications.

### [90] [Multimodal Hate Detection Using Dual-Stream Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13515)
*Jiangbei Yue,Shuonan Yang,Tailin Chen,Jianbo Jiao,Zeyu Fu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a multimodal dual-stream graph neural network model to classify hateful videos by highlighting and weighting hateful content for state-of-the-art accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge is in detecting hateful content in videos where even minimal hateful content defines the video's category. Previous methods treat all content uniformly and fail to systematically capture structured relationships, reducing the effectiveness of multimodal fusion.

Method: The paper proposes constructing an instance graph to extract features and a weight graph to assign importance to hateful components. These are combined using a graph-based framework for classification purposes.

Result: Experiments on public datasets indicate the proposed model outperforms existing methods and demonstrates strong explainability.

Conclusion: The proposed model effectively addresses the limitations of previous methods, offering state-of-the-art performance and enhanced explainability in hateful video classification.

Abstract: Hateful videos present serious risks to online safety and real-world
well-being, necessitating effective detection methods. Although multimodal
classification approaches integrating information from several modalities
outperform unimodal ones, they typically neglect that even minimal hateful
content defines a video's category. Specifically, they generally treat all
content uniformly, instead of emphasizing the hateful components. Additionally,
existing multimodal methods cannot systematically capture structured
information in videos, limiting the effectiveness of multimodal fusion. To
address these limitations, we propose a novel multimodal dual-stream graph
neural network model. It constructs an instance graph by separating the given
video into several instances to extract instance-level features. Then, a
complementary weight graph assigns importance weights to these features,
highlighting hateful instances. Importance weights and instance features are
combined to generate video labels. Our model employs a graph-based framework to
systematically model structured relationships within and across modalities.
Extensive experiments on public datasets show that our model is
state-of-the-art in hateful video classification and has strong explainability.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges with temporal inconsistency in depth estimation for colonoscopy video sequences, which limits 3D reconstruction and analysis.

Method: The method involves a diffusion-based depth estimation model that learns geometric priors from synthetic colonoscopy data and employs a style transfer to adapt real clinical videos to the synthetic domain while maintaining geometric consistency.

Result: ColonCrafter demonstrates superior zero-shot performance on the C3VD dataset, surpassing general-purpose and endoscopy-specific methods, and supports tasks like point cloud generation and surface coverage assessment.

Conclusion: ColonCrafter offers a robust solution for temporally consistent depth estimation in colonoscopy, with potential applications in clinical 3D modeling workflows.

Abstract: Three-dimensional (3D) scene understanding in colonoscopy presents
significant challenges that necessitate automated methods for accurate depth
estimation. However, existing depth estimation models for endoscopy struggle
with temporal consistency across video sequences, limiting their applicability
for 3D reconstruction. We present ColonCrafter, a diffusion-based depth
estimation model that generates temporally consistent depth maps from monocular
colonoscopy videos. Our approach learns robust geometric priors from synthetic
colonoscopy sequences to generate temporally consistent depth maps. We also
introduce a style transfer technique that preserves geometric structure while
adapting real clinical videos to match our synthetic training domain.
ColonCrafter achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on the C3VD
dataset, outperforming both general-purpose and endoscopy-specific approaches.
Although full trajectory 3D reconstruction remains a challenge, we demonstrate
clinically relevant applications of ColonCrafter, including 3D point cloud
generation and surface coverage assessment.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper improves 3D Gaussian Splatting for rendering and reconstruction on limited-resource hardware, particularly enhancing GPU memory efficiency and rendering quality using voxel merging and Patch-Grid point sampling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of adapting 3D rendering and reconstruction techniques, especially 3D Gaussian Splatting, for embedded platforms with limited resources like MAVs.

Method: The authors reduce memory use by merging redundant 3D Gaussian primitives in voxel spaces. They enhance rendering accuracy by leveraging Patch-Grid sampling for better 3D primitive initialization.

Result: Experiments demonstrate reduced GPU memory usage with no runtime performance loss while achieving improvements in rendering quality across public datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed techniques make 3D Gaussian Splatting more resource-efficient and accessible for embedded applications like MAVs, while maintaining high reconstruction quality and system performance.

Abstract: Recent advancements in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have made a significant
impact on rendering and reconstruction techniques. Current research
predominantly focuses on improving rendering performance and reconstruction
quality using high-performance desktop GPUs, largely overlooking applications
for embedded platforms like micro air vehicles (MAVs). These devices, with
their limited computational resources and memory, often face a trade-off
between system performance and reconstruction quality. In this paper, we
improve existing methods in terms of GPU memory usage while enhancing rendering
quality. Specifically, to address redundant 3D Gaussian primitives in SLAM, we
propose merging them in voxel space based on geometric similarity. This reduces
GPU memory usage without impacting system runtime performance. Furthermore,
rendering quality is improved by initializing 3D Gaussian primitives via
Patch-Grid (PG) point sampling, enabling more accurate modeling of the entire
scene. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations on publicly available datasets
demonstrate the effectiveness of our improvements.

*Tongfei Guo,Lili Su*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces an advanced framework for trajectory-level out-of-distribution (OOD) detection in autonomous vehicles, outperforming existing methods in accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of detecting distribution shifts in trajectory prediction for autonomous vehicles, particularly in rare or complex traffic scenarios.

Method: A new framework with adaptive mechanisms that model mode-specific prediction error distributions, enhancing robustness in OOD detection in trajectory predictions.

Result: Significant improvement in detection delay and false alarm rates compared to prior methods, validated through experiments on real-world and benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed framework offers a robust solution for trajectory-level OOD detection, paving the way for more reliable and efficient autonomous vehicle operations.

Abstract: Trajectory prediction is central to the safe and seamless operation of
autonomous vehicles (AVs). In deployment, however, prediction models inevitably
face distribution shifts between training data and real-world conditions, where
rare or underrepresented traffic scenarios induce out-of-distribution (OOD)
cases. While most prior OOD detection research in AVs has concentrated on
computer vision tasks such as object detection and segmentation,
trajectory-level OOD detection remains largely underexplored. A recent study
formulated this problem as a quickest change detection (QCD) task, providing
formal guarantees on the trade-off between detection delay and false alarms
[1]. Building on this foundation, we propose a new framework that introduces
adaptive mechanisms to achieve robust detection in complex driving
environments. Empirical analysis across multiple real-world datasets reveals
that prediction errors -- even on in-distribution samples -- exhibit
mode-dependent distributions that evolve over time with dataset-specific
dynamics. By explicitly modeling these error modes, our method achieves
substantial improvements in both detection delay and false alarm rates.
Comprehensive experiments on established trajectory prediction benchmarks show
that our framework significantly outperforms prior UQ- and vision-based OOD
approaches in both accuracy and computational efficiency, offering a practical
path toward reliable, driving-aware autonomy.

Abstract: The Amazon rain forest is a vital ecosystem that plays a crucial role in
regulating the Earth's climate and providing habitat for countless species.
Deforestation in the Amazon is a major concern as it has a significant impact
on global carbon emissions and biodiversity. In this paper, we present a method
for detecting deforestation in the Amazon using image pairs from Earth
observation satellites. Our method leverages deep learning techniques to
compare the images of the same area at different dates and identify changes in
the forest cover. We also propose a visual semantic model that automatically
annotates the detected changes with relevant keywords. The candidate annotation
for images are extracted from scientific documents related to the Amazon
region. We evaluate our approach on a dataset of Amazon image pairs and
demonstrate its effectiveness in detecting deforestation and generating
relevant annotations. Our method provides a useful tool for monitoring and
studying the impact of deforestation in the Amazon. While we focus on
environment applications of our work by using images of deforestation in the
Amazon rain forest to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach,
it is generic enough to be applied to other domains.

TL;DR: The study introduces and generalizes CLAP, a clustering-based framework for noise-resistant localization and image stitching.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for robust outlier management in tasks such as localization and image stitching across different dimensions.

Method: The 2D localization algorithm CLAP, initially used in RoboCup 2024, is generalized to handle 3D localization and image stitching while emphasizing clustering-based noise suppression.

Result: CLAP demonstrates robustness in handling outliers and noise, showcasing its effectiveness against traditional schemes like RANSAC.

Conclusion: The generalization of CLAP makes it a versatile tool applicable in managing noise and uncertainty across various domains.

Abstract: In previous work, we introduced a 2D localization algorithm called CLAP,
Clustering to Localize Across $n$ Possibilities, which was used during our
championship win in RoboCup 2024, an international autonomous humanoid soccer
competition. CLAP is particularly recognized for its robustness against
outliers, where clustering is employed to suppress noise and mitigate against
erroneous feature matches. This clustering-based strategy provides an
alternative to traditional outlier rejection schemes such as RANSAC, in which
candidates are validated by reprojection error across all data points. In this
paper, CLAP is extended to a more general framework beyond 2D localization,
specifically to 3D localization and image stitching. We also show how CLAP,
RANSAC, and Hough transforms are related. The generalization of CLAP is widely
applicable to many different fields and can be a useful tool to deal with noise

TL;DR: Introduces SAMIR, a medical image registration framework leveraging the Segment Anything Model (SAM) for more precise feature extraction and anatomical consistency. Achieves strong improvements in benchmark datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving the accuracy of medical image registration by overcoming the limitations of existing methods reliant on weak labels, through robust visual representations provided by foundational models.

Method: SAMIR utilizes the Segment Anything Model (SAM) for structure-aware feature embedding extraction. It employs a task-specific adaptation pipeline, a lightweight 3D refinement head, and a Hierarchical Feature Consistency Loss for more accurate anatomical alignment.

Result: SAMIR significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, with notable performance gains on cardiac and abdomen image registration benchmark datasets (2.68% on ACDC and 6.44% on abdomen CT dataset).

Conclusion: SAMIR proves efficient for medical image registration tasks by using robust pre-trained models; it offers practical solutions to enhance anatomical alignment and will facilitate advancements in the field with publicly accessible code.

Abstract: Image registration is a fundamental task in medical image analysis.
Deformations are often closely related to the morphological characteristics of
tissues, making accurate feature extraction crucial. Recent weakly supervised
methods improve registration by incorporating anatomical priors such as
segmentation masks or landmarks, either as inputs or in the loss function.
However, such weak labels are often not readily available, limiting their
practical use. Motivated by the strong representation learning ability of
visual foundation models, this paper introduces SAMIR, an efficient medical
image registration framework that utilizes the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to
enhance feature extraction. SAM is pretrained on large-scale natural image
datasets and can learn robust, general-purpose visual representations. Rather
than using raw input images, we design a task-specific adaptation pipeline
using SAM's image encoder to extract structure-aware feature embeddings,
enabling more accurate modeling of anatomical consistency and deformation
patterns. We further design a lightweight 3D head to refine features within the
embedding space, adapting to local deformations in medical images.
Additionally, we introduce a Hierarchical Feature Consistency Loss to guide
coarse-to-fine feature matching and improve anatomical alignment. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that SAMIR significantly outperforms state-of-the-art
methods on benchmark datasets for both intra-subject cardiac image registration
and inter-subject abdomen CT image registration, achieving performance
improvements of 2.68% on ACDC and 6.44% on the abdomen dataset. The source code
will be publicly available on GitHub following the acceptance of this paper.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GARPS is introduced as a training-free framework for metric relative camera pose estimation by aligning two independently reconstructed 3D scenes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve 3D reconstruction and localization by addressing limitations of conventional two-view pose estimation methods like non-metric translations and challenges with wide baselines, textureless, or reflective surfaces.

Method: The paper presents a framework leveraging metric monocular depth estimation and a Gaussian scene reconstructor to build a 3D Gaussian Mixture Model for alignment. It refines initial poses using a differentiable GMM alignment objective, incorporating geometric, color, covariance, and semantic consistency.

Result: Experiments on the RealEstate10K dataset show GARPS outperforms classical and learning-based methods, including state-of-the-art methods like MASt3R.

Conclusion: GARPS demonstrates the effectiveness of combining single-view perception with multi-view geometry for robust metric relative pose estimation.

Abstract: Estimating metric relative camera pose from a pair of images is of great
importance for 3D reconstruction and localisation. However, conventional
two-view pose estimation methods are not metric, with camera translation known
only up to a scale, and struggle with wide baselines and textureless or
reflective surfaces. This paper introduces GARPS, a training-free framework
that casts this problem as the direct alignment of two independently
reconstructed 3D scenes. GARPS leverages a metric monocular depth estimator and
a Gaussian scene reconstructor to obtain a metric 3D Gaussian Mixture Model
(GMM) for each image. It then refines an initial pose from a feed-forward
two-view pose estimator by optimising a differentiable GMM alignment objective.
This objective jointly considers geometric structure, view-independent colour,
anisotropic covariance, and semantic feature consistency, and is robust to
occlusions and texture-poor regions without requiring explicit 2D
correspondences. Extensive experiments on the Real\-Estate10K dataset
demonstrate that GARPS outperforms both classical and state-of-the-art
learning-based methods, including MASt3R. These results highlight the potential
of bridging single-view perception with multi-view geometry to achieve robust
and metric relative pose estimation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces lookup operations as an energy-efficient alternative to multiplication in neural networks, enabling faster and less power-hungry inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Convolutional neural networks require computationally expensive multiplication operations, which consume significant energy and time, presenting challenges for edge and mobile device deployment.

Method: The authors propose generic lookup operations to replace multiplications in neural networks, using differentiable lookup tables and training strategies to optimize performance.

Result: The lookup networks significantly reduce computational demands, energy consumption, and inference time while maintaining competitive performance on image and point cloud tasks.

Conclusion: This approach enables efficient neural networks through lookup operations, demonstrating state-of-the-art efficiency and performance across diverse tasks and data types.

Abstract: Convolutional neural networks are constructed with massive operations with
different types and are highly computationally intensive. Among these
operations, multiplication operation is higher in computational complexity and
usually requires {more} energy consumption with longer inference time than
other operations, which hinders the deployment of convolutional neural networks
on mobile devices. In many resource-limited edge devices, complicated
operations can be calculated via lookup tables to reduce computational cost.
Motivated by this, in this paper, we introduce a generic and efficient lookup
operation which can be used as a basic operation for the construction of neural
networks. Instead of calculating the multiplication of weights and activation
values, simple yet efficient lookup operations are adopted to compute their
responses. To enable end-to-end optimization of the lookup operation, we
construct the lookup tables in a differentiable manner and propose several
training strategies to promote their convergence. By replacing computationally
expensive multiplication operations with our lookup operations, we develop
lookup networks for the image classification, image super-resolution, and point
cloud classification tasks. It is demonstrated that our lookup networks can
benefit from the lookup operations to achieve higher efficiency in terms of
energy consumption and inference speed while maintaining competitive
performance to vanilla convolutional networks. Extensive experiments show that
our lookup networks produce state-of-the-art performance on different tasks
(both classification and regression tasks) and different data types (both
images and point clouds).

*Xiaobo Yang,Xiaojin Gong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a semantic visual projector that uses semantic superpixels to compress and project visual tokens for Referring Image Segmentation (RIS), reducing token quantity by 93% without degrading performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional visual projectors for RIS are inefficient due to the inability to balance token reduction and semantic clarity, leading to unnecessarily long token sequences.

Method: The method uses semantic superpixels generated by SAM to adaptively shorten token sequences, incorporates positional embeddings for geometric awareness, and uses a superpixel aggregator to maintain granular and global context.

Result: The proposed method reduces token sequences by 93%, accelerates MLLM training and inference, and outperforms existing visual projectors in RIS tasks.

Conclusion: Semantic superpixels effectively optimize the tokenization process in RIS, maintaining performance while significantly improving computational efficiency.

Abstract: Recently, Referring Image Segmentation (RIS) frameworks that pair the
Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) with the Segment Anything Model (SAM)
have achieved impressive results. However, adapting MLLM to segmentation is
computationally intensive, primarily due to visual token redundancy. We observe
that traditional patch-wise visual projectors struggle to strike a balance
between reducing the number of visual tokens and preserving semantic clarity,
often retaining overly long token sequences to avoid performance drops.
Inspired by text tokenizers, we propose a novel semantic visual projector that
leverages semantic superpixels generated by SAM to identify "visual words" in
an image. By compressing and projecting semantic superpixels as visual tokens,
our approach adaptively shortens the token sequence according to scene
complexity while minimizing semantic loss in compression. To mitigate loss of
information, we propose a semantic superpixel positional embedding to
strengthen MLLM's awareness of superpixel geometry and position, alongside a
semantic superpixel aggregator to preserve both fine-grained details inside
superpixels and global context outside. Experiments show that our method cuts
visual tokens by 93% without compromising performance, notably speeding up MLLM
training and inference, and outperforming existing compressive visual
projectors on RIS.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome challenges in applying BEV segmentation techniques to fisheye cameras, which suffer from severe geometric distortion, misaligned multi-view data, and unstable time-based dynamics.

Method: FishBEV incorporates three innovations: DRME backbone to handle distortion, U-SCA mechanism for cross-view alignment via uncertainty estimation, and D-TSA module for balancing near-field and far-field data in temporal dynamics.

Result: FishBEV outperforms state-of-the-art benchmarks in fisheye BEV segmentation tasks, validated by experiments on the Synwoodscapes dataset.

Conclusion: The introduction of FishBEV advances BEV segmentation for fisheye cameras, offering robust handling of distortion, spatial uncertainties, and temporal coherence.

Abstract: As a cornerstone technique for autonomous driving, Bird's Eye View (BEV)
segmentation has recently achieved remarkable progress with pinhole cameras.
However, it is non-trivial to extend the existing methods to fisheye cameras
with severe geometric distortion, ambiguous multi-view correspondences and
unstable temporal dynamics, all of which significantly degrade BEV performance.
To address these challenges, we propose FishBEV, a novel BEV segmentation
framework specifically tailored for fisheye cameras. This framework introduces
three complementary innovations, including a Distortion-Resilient Multi-scale
Extraction (DRME) backbone that learns robust features under distortion while
preserving scale consistency, an Uncertainty-aware Spatial Cross-Attention
(U-SCA) mechanism that leverages uncertainty estimation for reliable cross-view
alignment, a Distance-aware Temporal Self-Attention (D-TSA) module that
adaptively balances near field details and far field context to ensure temporal
coherence. Extensive experiments on the Synwoodscapes dataset demonstrate that
FishBEV consistently outperforms SOTA baselines, regarding the performance
evaluation of FishBEV on the surround-view fisheye BEV segmentation tasks.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the challenge of accurate and interpretable medical image classification in clinical environments with limited and diverse datasets.

Method: The paper introduces three spline-based KAN models: SBTAYLOR-KAN, SBRBF-KAN, and SBWAVELET-KAN, employing spline-based function approximations for learning directly from raw image data.

Result: The SBTAYLOR-KAN model achieved up to 98.93% accuracy with high generalization, using only 30% of the training data in some cases, while requiring significantly fewer parameters compared to traditional CNNs.

Conclusion: The proposed KAN framework is lightweight, interpretable, and effective for medical image classification in data-scarce environments, offering a robust alternative to traditional methods.

Abstract: Effective and interpretable classification of medical images is a challenge
in computer-aided diagnosis, especially in resource-limited clinical settings.
This study introduces spline-based Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) for
accurate medical image classification with limited, diverse datasets. The
models include SBTAYLOR-KAN, integrating B-splines with Taylor series;
SBRBF-KAN, combining B-splines with Radial Basis Functions; and SBWAVELET-KAN,
embedding B-splines in Morlet wavelet transforms. These approaches leverage
spline-based function approximation to capture both local and global
nonlinearities. The models were evaluated on brain MRI, chest X-rays,
tuberculosis X-rays, and skin lesion images without preprocessing,
demonstrating the ability to learn directly from raw data. Extensive
experiments, including cross-dataset validation and data reduction analysis,
showed strong generalization and stability. SBTAYLOR-KAN achieved up to 98.93%
accuracy, with a balanced F1-score, maintaining over 86% accuracy using only
30% of the training data across three datasets. Despite class imbalance in the
skin cancer dataset, experiments on both imbalanced and balanced versions
showed SBTAYLOR-KAN outperforming other models, achieving 68.22% accuracy.
Unlike traditional CNNs, which require millions of parameters (e.g., ResNet50
with 24.18M), SBTAYLOR-KAN achieves comparable performance with just 2,872
trainable parameters, making it more suitable for constrained medical
environments. Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) was used
for interpretability, highlighting relevant regions in medical images. This
framework provides a lightweight, interpretable, and generalizable solution for
medical image classification, addressing the challenges of limited datasets and
data-scarce scenarios in clinical AI applications.

### [103] [StyleProtect: Safeguarding Artistic Identity in Fine-tuned Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13711)
*Qiuyu Tang,Joshua Krinsky,Aparna Bharati*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses concerns around generative models mimicking artistic styles and proposes 'StyleProtect,' a strategy for safeguarding artworks against misuse by selectively updating cross-attention layers in diffusion models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the ethical dilemma posed by generative models, particularly diffusion-based ones, which can replicate artistic styles and undermine artists’ creative labor.

Method: The method involves analyzing cross-attention layer sensitivities to artistic styles and implementing 'StyleProtect' by updating only sensitive layers to inhibit unauthorized style mimicry.

Result: Experiments using artwork datasets, like WikiArt, showed that 'StyleProtect' effectively defends against style mimicry while maintaining imperceptibility.

Conclusion: 'StyleProtect' offers a lightweight and efficient means to protect artists' styles from misuse without compromising artwork quality or visibility.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative models, particularly diffusion-based
approaches, has inadvertently facilitated their potential for misuse. Such
models enable malicious exploiters to replicate artistic styles that capture an
artist's creative labor, personal vision, and years of dedication in an
inexpensive manner. This has led to a rise in the need and exploration of
methods for protecting artworks against style mimicry. Although generic
diffusion models can easily mimic an artistic style, finetuning amplifies this
capability, enabling the model to internalize and reproduce the style with
higher fidelity and control. We hypothesize that certain cross-attention layers
exhibit heightened sensitivity to artistic styles. Sensitivity is measured
through activation strengths of attention layers in response to style and
content representations, and assessing their correlations with features
extracted from external models. Based on our findings, we introduce an
efficient and lightweight protection strategy, StyleProtect, that achieves
effective style defense against fine-tuned diffusion models by updating only
selected cross-attention layers. Our experiments utilize a carefully curated
artwork dataset based on WikiArt, comprising representative works from 30
artists known for their distinctive and influential styles and cartoon
animations from the Anita dataset. The proposed method demonstrates promising
performance in safeguarding unique styles of artworks and anime from malicious
diffusion customization, while maintaining competitive imperceptibility.

*Tae-Wook Um,Ki-Hyeon Kim,Hyun-Duck Choi,Hyo-Sung Ahn*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UM-Depth is a self-supervised framework for monocular depth estimation that improves depth accuracy by integrating motion- and uncertainty-aware refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the accuracy of self-supervised monocular depth estimation, addressing challenges posed by low-texture and dynamic regions.

Method: UM-Depth introduces a teacher-student training strategy that embeds uncertainty estimation in the training pipeline and architecture, utilizing optical flow within the teacher network exclusively during training.

Result: Experiments on the KITTI and Cityscapes datasets show that UM-Depth achieves state-of-the-art performance in self-supervised depth and pose estimation.

Conclusion: By effectively embedding uncertainty estimation and optimizing supervision methods, UM-Depth provides improved accuracy without adding inference-time overhead or labeling demands.

Abstract: Monocular depth estimation has been increasingly adopted in robotics and
autonomous driving for its ability to infer scene geometry from a single
camera. In self-supervised monocular depth estimation frameworks, the network
jointly generates and exploits depth and pose estimates during training,
thereby eliminating the need for depth labels. However, these methods remain
challenged by uncertainty in the input data, such as low-texture or dynamic
regions, which can cause reduced depth accuracy. To address this, we introduce
UM-Depth, a framework that combines motion- and uncertainty-aware refinement to
enhance depth accuracy at dynamic object boundaries and in textureless regions.
Specifically, we develop a teacherstudent training strategy that embeds
uncertainty estimation into both the training pipeline and network
architecture, thereby strengthening supervision where photometric signals are
weak. Unlike prior motion-aware approaches that incur inference-time overhead
and rely on additional labels or auxiliary networks for real-time generation,
our method uses optical flow exclusively within the teacher network during
training, which eliminating extra labeling demands and any runtime cost.
Extensive experiments on the KITTI and Cityscapes datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of our uncertainty-aware refinement. Overall, UM-Depth achieves
state-of-the-art results in both self-supervised depth and pose estimation on
the KITTI datasets.

### [105] [Mitigating Query Selection Bias in Referring Video Object Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13722)
*Dingwei Zhang,Dong Zhang,Jinhui Tang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces Triple Query Former (TQF), which improves Referring Video Object Segmentation (RVOS) by addressing query selection bias through dynamic query construction and motion-aware aggregation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Query-based methods in RVOS face difficulties due to distractors with similar appearance or motion, resulting in query selection bias. This paper seeks to overcome these limitations.

Method: The proposed TQF model factorizes queries into three components: appearance, intra-frame interaction, and inter-frame motion queries. It dynamically constructs queries by combining linguistic cues and visual guidance, and employs motion-aware aggregation modules for improved object token representation.

Result: Experiments show that TQF outperforms existing methods on multiple RVOS benchmarks, validating the structured query design and motion-aware aggregation modules.

Conclusion: TQF addresses query selection bias effectively by incorporating dynamic query construction and motion-aware aggregation, offering enhanced performance in RVOS tasks.

Abstract: Recently, query-based methods have achieved remarkable performance in
Referring Video Object Segmentation (RVOS) by using textual static object
queries to drive cross-modal alignment. However, these static queries are
easily misled by distractors with similar appearance or motion, resulting in
\emph{query selection bias}. To address this issue, we propose Triple Query
Former (TQF), which factorizes the referring query into three specialized
components: an appearance query for static attributes, an intra-frame
interaction query for spatial relations, and an inter-frame motion query for
temporal association. Instead of relying solely on textual embeddings, our
queries are dynamically constructed by integrating both linguistic cues and
visual guidance. Furthermore, we introduce two motion-aware aggregation modules
that enhance object token representations: Intra-frame Interaction Aggregation
incorporates position-aware interactions among objects within a single frame,
while Inter-frame Motion Aggregation leverages trajectory-guided alignment
across frames to ensure temporal coherence. Extensive experiments on multiple
RVOS benchmarks demonstrate the advantages of TQF and the effectiveness of our
structured query design and motion-aware aggregation modules.

### [106] [Improving Generalized Visual Grounding with Instance-aware Joint Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13747)
*Ming Dai,Wenxuan Cheng,Jiang-Jiang Liu,Lingfeng Yang,Zhenhua Feng,Wankou Yang,Jingdong Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces InstanceVG, a multi-task framework tackling both Generalized Referring Expression Comprehension (GREC) and Segmentation (GRES) with instance-aware capabilities, delivering state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches treat GREC and GRES tasks independently, neglecting joint training benefits and consistency across predictions. Additionally, GRES is often treated as semantic segmentation, ignoring the importance of instance-aware features.

Method: InstanceVG employs instance queries tied to prior reference points, enabling unified and consistent predictions across instance boxes, masks, and points.

Result: InstanceVG demonstrated superior performance across ten datasets spanning four tasks, outperforming contemporary methods on various metrics.

Conclusion: InstanceVG establishes a novel unified framework for generalized visual grounding tasks, ensuring consistent multi-granularity predictions with instance-aware capabilities.

Abstract: Generalized visual grounding tasks, including Generalized Referring
Expression Comprehension (GREC) and Segmentation (GRES), extend the classical
visual grounding paradigm by accommodating multi-target and non-target
scenarios. Specifically, GREC focuses on accurately identifying all referential
objects at the coarse bounding box level, while GRES aims for achieve
fine-grained pixel-level perception. However, existing approaches typically
treat these tasks independently, overlooking the benefits of jointly training
GREC and GRES to ensure consistent multi-granularity predictions and streamline
the overall process. Moreover, current methods often treat GRES as a semantic
segmentation task, neglecting the crucial role of instance-aware capabilities
and the necessity of ensuring consistent predictions between instance-level
boxes and masks. To address these limitations, we propose InstanceVG, a
multi-task generalized visual grounding framework equipped with instance-aware
capabilities, which leverages instance queries to unify the joint and
consistency predictions of instance-level boxes and masks. To the best of our
knowledge, InstanceVG is the first framework to simultaneously tackle both GREC
and GRES while incorporating instance-aware capabilities into generalized
visual grounding. To instantiate the framework, we assign each instance query a
prior reference point, which also serves as an additional basis for target
matching. This design facilitates consistent predictions of points, boxes, and
masks for the same instance. Extensive experiments obtained on ten datasets
across four tasks demonstrate that InstanceVG achieves state-of-the-art
performance, significantly surpassing the existing methods in various
evaluation metrics. The code and model will be publicly available at
https://github.com/Dmmm1997/InstanceVG.

### [107] [Cross-modal Full-mode Fine-grained Alignment for Text-to-Image Person Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13754)
*Hao Yin,Xin Man,Feiyu Chen,Jie Shao,Heng Tao Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces FMFA, a novel framework for Text-to-Image Person Retrieval (TIPR), improving both global and fine-grained cross-modal alignment to achieve state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from limitations in prior TIPR approaches, such as insufficient verification of alignment correctness and neglect of unmatched positive pairs.

Method: FMFA employs two modules: (1) Adaptive Similarity Distribution Matching (A-SDM) for rectifying unmatched positive pairs and improving global alignment, and (2) Explicit Fine-grained Alignment (EFA) for reinforcing cross-modal fine-grained verification.

Result: FMFA demonstrated state-of-the-art performance on three public TIPR datasets.

Conclusion: FMFA effectively resolves alignment issues in TIPR using innovative modules without requiring additional supervision, setting new benchmarks in the field.

Abstract: Text-to-Image Person Retrieval (TIPR) is a cross-modal matching task that
aims to retrieve the most relevant person images based on a given text query.
The key challenge in TIPR lies in achieving effective alignment between textual
and visual modalities within a common latent space. To address this challenge,
prior approaches incorporate attention mechanisms for implicit cross-modal
local alignment. However, they lack the ability to verify whether all local
features are correctly aligned. Moreover, existing methods primarily focus on
hard negative samples during model updates, with the goal of refining
distinctions between positive and negative pairs, often neglecting incorrectly
matched positive pairs. To alleviate these issues, we propose FMFA, a
cross-modal Full-Mode Fine-grained Alignment framework, which enhances global
matching through explicit fine-grained alignment and existing implicit
relational reasoning -- hence the term ``full-mode" -- without requiring
additional supervision. Specifically, we design an Adaptive Similarity
Distribution Matching (A-SDM) module to rectify unmatched positive sample
pairs. A-SDM adaptively pulls the unmatched positive pairs closer in the joint
embedding space, thereby achieving more precise global alignment. Additionally,
we introduce an Explicit Fine-grained Alignment (EFA) module, which makes up
for the lack of verification capability of implicit relational reasoning. EFA
strengthens explicit cross-modal fine-grained interactions by sparsifying the
similarity matrix and employs a hard coding method for local alignment. Our
proposed method is evaluated on three public datasets, achieving
state-of-the-art performance among all global matching methods. Our code is
available at https://github.com/yinhao1102/FMFA.

*Yuqi Yang,Dongliang Chang,Yuanchen Fang,Yi-Zhe SonG,Zhanyu Ma,Jun Guo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a color mapping module for more precise and controllable text-driven image color editing, enabling finer-grained adjustments with semantic consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Natural language's ambiguity and discreteness make text-driven image color editing challenging, with issues in precision and continuous control. Existing methods, like interpolating text embeddings, fail to offer fine-grained control over color changes.

Method: The authors introduce a color mapping module that establishes a direct correspondence between the text embedding space and image RGB values. The module allows users to specify RGB ranges, enabling continuous and controlled color editing.

Result: The method demonstrates strong performance in maintaining color continuity and controllability, overcoming limitations in previous approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed approach enables precise and continuous text-driven image color edits, improving upon limitations of existing methods while maintaining semantic consistency.

Abstract: In recent years, text-driven image editing has made significant progress.
However, due to the inherent ambiguity and discreteness of natural language,
color editing still faces challenges such as insufficient precision and
difficulty in achieving continuous control. Although linearly interpolating the
embedding vectors of different textual descriptions can guide the model to
generate a sequence of images with varying colors, this approach lacks precise
control over the range of color changes in the output images. Moreover, the
relationship between the interpolation coefficient and the resulting image
color is unknown and uncontrollable. To address these issues, we introduce a
color mapping module that explicitly models the correspondence between the text
embedding space and image RGB values. This module predicts the corresponding
embedding vector based on a given RGB value, enabling precise color control of
the generated images while maintaining semantic consistency. Users can specify
a target RGB range to generate images with continuous color variations within
the desired range, thereby achieving finer-grained, continuous, and
controllable color editing. Experimental results demonstrate that our method
performs well in terms of color continuity and controllability.

*Jinwoo Jeon,JunHyeok Oh,Hayeong Lee,Byung-Jun Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes an algorithm that refines prompts for Text-to-Image models using Vision Language Models (VLMs), which analyze both prompts and generated images to improve safety and maintain user intent.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite progress in Text-to-Image models, their reliance on prompt phrasing results in inconsistent safety and quality. Existing methods focus solely on refining prompts through language models without considering generated images.

Method: The paper introduces an iterative prompt refinement algorithm utilizing VLMs for visual feedback and develops a dataset labeled with textual and visual safety signals to facilitate supervised fine-tuning.

Result: The approach enhances safety in outputs while retaining alignment with user intent, achieving reliability comparable to existing methods and producing practical improvements in Text-to-Image content generation.

Conclusion: Integrating VLM-based visual feedback into prompt refinement offers a robust and practical solution for safer Text-to-Image model outputs without sacrificing user intent alignment.

Abstract: Text-to-Image (T2I) models have made remarkable progress in generating images
from text prompts, but their output quality and safety still depend heavily on
how prompts are phrased. Existing safety methods typically refine prompts using
large language models (LLMs), but they overlook the images produced, which can
result in unsafe outputs or unnecessary changes to already safe prompts. To
address this, we propose an iterative prompt refinement algorithm that uses
Vision Language Models (VLMs) to analyze both the input prompts and the
generated images. By leveraging visual feedback, our method refines prompts
more effectively, improving safety while maintaining user intent and
reliability comparable to existing LLM-based approaches. Additionally, we
introduce a new dataset labeled with both textual and visual safety signals
using off-the-shelf multi-modal LLM, enabling supervised fine-tuning.
Experimental results demonstrate that our approach produces safer outputs
without compromising alignment with user intent, offering a practical solution
for generating safer T2I content. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes TA-ISP, a compact framework for transforming RAW sensor data into task-oriented representations, improving accuracy in visual perception tasks with reduced computational overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods using RAW sensor data either suffer from high computational overhead or limited representational capacity, hindering performance in visual perception tasks.

Method: TA-ISP introduces a lightweight framework that predicts multi-scale modulation operators for reshaping image statistics spatially across different scales, reducing computation and memory use.

Result: TA-ISP achieves consistent accuracy improvements in RAW-domain visual perception tasks (detection and segmentation) under varied conditions, while lowering parameter count and inference time.

Conclusion: The proposed TA-ISP framework is an efficient and effective method for enhancing performance in vision tasks using RAW sensor data, especially on resource-limited devices.

Abstract: In recent years, there has been a growing trend in computer vision towards
exploiting RAW sensor data, which preserves richer information compared to
conventional low-bit RGB images. Early studies mainly focused on enhancing
visual quality, while more recent efforts aim to leverage the abundant
information in RAW data to improve the performance of visual perception tasks
such as object detection and segmentation. However, existing approaches still
face two key limitations: large-scale ISP networks impose heavy computational
overhead, while methods based on tuning traditional ISP pipelines are
restricted by limited representational capacity.To address these issues, we
propose Task-Aware Image Signal Processing (TA-ISP), a compact RAW-to-RGB
framework that produces task-oriented representations for pretrained vision
models. Instead of heavy dense convolutional pipelines, TA-ISP predicts a small
set of lightweight, multi-scale modulation operators that act at global,
regional, and pixel scales to reshape image statistics across different spatial
extents. This factorized control significantly expands the range of spatially
varying transforms that can be represented while keeping memory usage,
computation, and latency tightly constrained. Evaluated on several RAW-domain
detection and segmentation benchmarks under both daytime and nighttime
conditions, TA-ISP consistently improves downstream accuracy while markedly
reducing parameter count and inference time, making it well suited for
deployment on resource-constrained devices.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel nighttime deraining method and dataset to improve image quality under low-light rainy conditions, enhancing surveillance and navigation performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the poor performance of existing image deraining techniques under nighttime and low-light conditions, which is a critical issue for surveillance and autonomous systems.

Method: The authors develop NDLPNet, a Nighttime Deraining Location-enhanced Perceptual Network, incorporating a Position Perception Module (PPM) to boost spatial positional awareness and recalibrate feature channels. They also introduce a new nighttime deraining dataset (NSR) with 900 real-world image pairs.

Result: Experiments on both existing datasets and the proposed NSR dataset show that NDLPNet surpasses state-of-the-art nighttime deraining methods in qualitative and quantitative evaluations.

Conclusion: The proposed NDLPNet enhances nighttime image quality by effectively removing rain streaks and preserving background details, supported by a new benchmarking dataset for future research.

Abstract: Visual degradation caused by rain streak artifacts in low-light conditions
significantly hampers the performance of nighttime surveillance and autonomous
navigation. Existing image deraining techniques are primarily designed for
daytime conditions and perform poorly under nighttime illumination due to the
spatial heterogeneity of rain distribution and the impact of light-dependent
stripe visibility. In this paper, we propose a novel Nighttime Deraining
Location-enhanced Perceptual Network(NDLPNet) that effectively captures the
spatial positional information and density distribution of rain streaks in
low-light environments. Specifically, we introduce a Position Perception Module
(PPM) to capture and leverage spatial contextual information from input data,
enhancing the model's capability to identify and recalibrate the importance of
different feature channels. The proposed nighttime deraining network can
effectively remove the rain streaks as well as preserve the crucial background
information. Furthermore, We construct a night scene rainy (NSR) dataset
comprising 900 image pairs, all based on real-world nighttime scenes, providing
a new benchmark for nighttime deraining task research. Extensive qualitative
and quantitative experimental evaluations on both existing datasets and the NSR
dataset consistently demonstrate our method outperform the state-of-the-art
(SOTA) methods in nighttime deraining tasks. The source code and dataset is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for segmenting articulatory structures in rtMRI rely too much on visual cues, overlooking complementary acoustic and phonological information that could improve results.

Method: The proposed method, VocSegMRI, uses cross-attention fusion to align video, audio, and phonological inputs dynamically. It also implements contrastive learning to boost performance, even when audio data is unavailable during inference.

Result: VocSegMRI achieves a Dice score of 0.95 and a Hausdorff Distance (HD_95) of 4.20 mm on the USC-75 rtMRI dataset, outperforming unimodal and multimodal baselines.

Conclusion: By integrating multimodal inputs, VocSegMRI enhances segmentation precision and robustness, demonstrating the importance of multimodal modeling for vocal tract analysis.

Abstract: Accurately segmenting articulatory structures in real-time magnetic resonance
imaging (rtMRI) remains challenging, as most existing methods rely almost
entirely on visual cues. Yet synchronized acoustic and phonological signals
provide complementary context that can enrich visual information and improve
precision. In this paper, we introduce VocSegMRI, a multimodal framework that
integrates video, audio, and phonological inputs through cross-attention fusion
for dynamic feature alignment. To further enhance cross-modal representation,
we incorporate a contrastive learning objective that improves segmentation
performance even when the audio modality is unavailable at inference. Evaluated
on a sub-set of USC-75 rtMRI dataset, our approach achieves state-of-the-art
performance, with a Dice score of 0.95 and a 95th percentile Hausdorff Distance
(HD_95) of 4.20 mm, outperforming both unimodal and multimodal baselines.
Ablation studies confirm the contributions of cross-attention and contrastive
learning to segmentation precision and robustness. These results highlight the

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of AI-generated images alongside natural images demands efficient coding techniques focused on perceptual quality, as traditional codecs and methods struggle with high compression ratios and generative approaches have issues with fidelity and generalization.

Method: The authors use a pre-optimized encoder, a lightweight adapter, an attentive fusion module, and a distribution renormalization method to leverage pretrained diffusion models for generalized compressed-domain representations and efficient adaptation.

Result: Their framework improves compression performance by up to 79% over H.266/VVC, outperforms existing methods in visual fidelity at low bitrates, and provides versatility in handling AI-generated and diverse content types.

Conclusion: The proposed generative coding framework efficiently enhances compression at low bitrates, demonstrating adaptability with minimal retraining costs and potential to address evolving visual content challenges.

Abstract: As generative technologies advance, visual content has evolved into a complex
mix of natural and AI-generated images, driving the need for more efficient
coding techniques that prioritize perceptual quality. Traditional codecs and
learned methods struggle to maintain subjective quality at high compression
ratios, while existing generative approaches face challenges in visual fidelity
and generalization. To this end, we propose a novel generative coding framework
leveraging diffusion priors to enhance compression performance at low bitrates.
Our approach employs a pre-optimized encoder to generate generalized
compressed-domain representations, integrated with the pretrained model's
internal features via a lightweight adapter and an attentive fusion module.
This framework effectively leverages existing pretrained diffusion models and
enables efficient adaptation to different pretrained models for new
requirements with minimal retraining costs. We also introduce a distribution
renormalization method to further enhance reconstruction fidelity. Extensive
experiments show that our method (1) outperforms existing methods in visual
fidelity across low bitrates, (2) improves compression performance by up to 79%
over H.266/VVC, and (3) offers an efficient solution for AI-generated content
while being adaptable to broader content types.

TL;DR: AdaThinkDrive introduces a dual-mode reasoning mechanism inspired by fast and slow thinking for Vision Language Action models in autonomous driving, achieving better decision-making and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Vision Language Action models face challenges in utilizing Chain of Thought reasoning efficiently, leading to computational overhead without significant decision quality improvements.

Method: AdaThinkDrive uses a dual-mode reasoning mechanism, pretrained with question-answering and trajectory datasets, and fine-tuned with datasets distinguishing fast answering and slow thinking modes. It incorporates an Adaptive Think Reward strategy and Group Relative Policy Optimization to balance reasoning application.

Result: In extensive experiments, AdaThinkDrive achieves a PDMS of 90.3, surpassing vision-only baselines and both never Think and always Think baselines in accuracy and efficiency. It reduces inference time by 14% compared to the always Think baseline.

Conclusion: AdaThinkDrive effectively balances reasoning accuracy and computational efficiency, showing promise for improving autonomous driving systems.

Abstract: While reasoning technology like Chain of Thought (CoT) has been widely
adopted in Vision Language Action (VLA) models, it demonstrates promising
capabilities in end to end autonomous driving. However, recent efforts to
integrate CoT reasoning often fall short in simple scenarios, introducing
unnecessary computational overhead without improving decision quality. To
address this, we propose AdaThinkDrive, a novel VLA framework with a dual mode
reasoning mechanism inspired by fast and slow thinking. First, our framework is
pretrained on large scale autonomous driving (AD) scenarios using both question
answering (QA) and trajectory datasets to acquire world knowledge and driving
commonsense. During supervised fine tuning (SFT), we introduce a two mode
dataset, fast answering (w/o CoT) and slow thinking (with CoT), enabling the
model to distinguish between scenarios that require reasoning. Furthermore, an
Adaptive Think Reward strategy is proposed in conjunction with the Group
Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), which rewards the model for selectively
applying CoT by comparing trajectory quality across different reasoning modes.
Extensive experiments on the Navsim benchmark show that AdaThinkDrive achieves
a PDMS of 90.3, surpassing the best vision only baseline by 1.7 points.
Moreover, ablations show that AdaThinkDrive surpasses both the never Think and
always Think baselines, improving PDMS by 2.0 and 1.4, respectively. It also
reduces inference time by 14% compared to the always Think baseline,
demonstrating its ability to balance accuracy and efficiency through adaptive
reasoning.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new method for deepfake detection focusing on accurately localizing manipulated regions using an innovative fusion approach between local and global predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhance the precision in identifying forged regions in deepfake detection, addressing existing challenges like neglecting complementary details and inefficient fusion strategies.

Method: Utilizes morphological operations to fuse locally and globally predicted regions, ensuring improved spatial coherence and reduced noise.

Result: The proposed approach demonstrated improvement in localization accuracy and robustness through extensive experimentation.

Conclusion: Employing both local and global perspectives paired with sophisticated fusion techniques offers significant promise in refining forgery localization.

Abstract: While the pursuit of higher accuracy in deepfake detection remains a central
goal, there is an increasing demand for precise localization of manipulated
regions. Despite the remarkable progress made in classification-based
detection, accurately localizing forged areas remains a significant challenge.
A common strategy is to incorporate forged region annotations during model
training alongside manipulated images. However, such approaches often neglect
the complementary nature of local detail and global semantic context, resulting
in suboptimal localization performance. Moreover, an often-overlooked aspect is
the fusion strategy between local and global predictions. Naively combining the
outputs from both branches can amplify noise and errors, thereby undermining
the effectiveness of the localization.
  To address these issues, we propose a novel approach that independently
predicts manipulated regions using both local and global perspectives. We
employ morphological operations to fuse the outputs, effectively suppressing
noise while enhancing spatial coherence. Extensive experiments reveal the
effectiveness of each module in improving the accuracy and robustness of
forgery localization.

*Hanfang Liang,Bing Wang,Shizhen Zhang,Wen Jiang,Yizhuo Yang,Weixiang Guo,Shenghai Yuan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Variable-Rate Spatial Event Mamba, a novel method for processing raw event camera streams without converting them into intermediate representations, achieving real-time efficiency and optimal latency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for event camera data processing rely on converting data into intermediate forms, which introduces latency, or involve pointwise processing, which is computationally expensive and not real-time efficient. This paper aims to overcome these limitations.

Method: The proposed method processes raw event streams directly using a lightweight causal spatial neighborhood encoder to capture local geometric relations and a Mamba-based state space model for scalable, efficient temporal modeling. Additionally, an adaptive controller adjusts processing speed based on event rates.

Result: The proposed method achieves real-time efficiency by processing raw event streams while balancing window latency and inference latency. It eliminates the need for intermediate data representations.

Conclusion: The Variable-Rate Spatial Event Mamba effectively addresses challenges in event camera data processing, offering a scalable, efficient, and adaptive solution suitable for high-speed vision tasks.

Abstract: Event cameras capture asynchronous pixel-level brightness changes with
microsecond temporal resolution, offering unique advantages for high-speed
vision tasks. Existing methods often convert event streams into intermediate
representations such as frames, voxel grids, or point clouds, which inevitably
require predefined time windows and thus introduce window latency. Meanwhile,
pointwise detection methods face computational challenges that prevent
real-time efficiency due to their high computational cost. To overcome these
limitations, we propose the Variable-Rate Spatial Event Mamba, a novel
architecture that directly processes raw event streams without intermediate
representations. Our method introduces a lightweight causal spatial
neighborhood encoder to efficiently capture local geometric relations, followed
by Mamba-based state space models for scalable temporal modeling with linear
complexity. During inference, a controller adaptively adjusts the processing
speed according to the event rate, achieving an optimal balance between window
latency and inference latency.

### [117] [BWCache: Accelerating Video Diffusion Transformers through Block-Wise Caching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13789)
*Hanshuai Cui,Zhiqing Tang,Zhifei Xu,Zhi Yao,Wenyi Zeng,Weijia Jia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces BWCache, a training-free method to accelerate Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) for video generation by reusing features dynamically across timesteps, reducing latency with minimal visual compromise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs), while excellent for video generation, suffer from latency due to their sequential denoising process, limiting their practical applicability.

Method: The authors analyzed feature redundancy in DiT blocks and proposed BWCache, which dynamically caches and reuses block features across timesteps using a similarity indicator to control redundancy and preserve visual quality.

Result: BWCache delivered up to 2.24× speedup in video generation, maintaining visual fidelity, as demonstrated through extensive experiments on various video diffusion models.

Conclusion: BWCache offers a significant acceleration for DiT-based video generation by exploiting feature redundancy without any training requirement, making it more feasible for real-world applications.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have established them as
the state-of-the-art method for video generation. However, their inherently
sequential denoising process results in inevitable latency, limiting real-world
applicability. Existing acceleration methods either compromise visual quality
due to architectural modifications or fail to reuse intermediate features at
proper granularity. Our analysis reveals that DiT blocks are the primary
contributors to inference latency. Across diffusion timesteps, the feature
variations of DiT blocks exhibit a U-shaped pattern with high similarity during
intermediate timesteps, which suggests substantial computational redundancy. In
this paper, we propose Block-Wise Caching (BWCache), a training-free method to
accelerate DiT-based video generation. BWCache dynamically caches and reuses
features from DiT blocks across diffusion timesteps. Furthermore, we introduce
a similarity indicator that triggers feature reuse only when the differences
between block features at adjacent timesteps fall below a threshold, thereby
minimizing redundant computations while maintaining visual fidelity. Extensive
experiments on several video diffusion models demonstrate that BWCache achieves
up to 2.24$\times$ speedup with comparable visual quality.

### [118] [Bridging the Synthetic-Real Gap: Supervised Domain Adaptation for Robust Spacecraft 6-DoF Pose Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13792)
*Inder Pal Singh,Nidhal Eddine Chenni,Abd El Rahman Shabayek,Arunkumar Rathinam,Djamila Aouada*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a Supervised Domain Adaptation (SDA) framework tailored for spacecraft pose estimation, addressing the domain gap challenge between synthetic and real data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the synthetic-to-real domain gap in spacecraft pose estimation (SPE), which limits the robustness of existing unsupervised domain adaptation techniques when a small amount of labeled real data is available.

Method: The method combines Learning Invariant Representation and Risk (LIRR) to jointly optimize domain-invariant representations and task-specific risk, using labeled synthetic data and a small portion of labeled real data.

Result: Experiments on the SPEED+ benchmark show that the proposed method outperforms various baselines, achieving results comparable to oracle models with only 5% labeled real data.

Conclusion: The framework is lightweight, backbone-agnostic, computationally efficient, and bridges the domain gap effectively, enabling practical use in real-world spacecraft pose estimation scenarios.

Abstract: Spacecraft Pose Estimation (SPE) is a fundamental capability for autonomous
space operations such as rendezvous, docking, and in-orbit servicing. Hybrid
pipelines that combine object detection, keypoint regression, and
Perspective-n-Point (PnP) solvers have recently achieved strong results on
synthetic datasets, yet their performance deteriorates sharply on real or
lab-generated imagery due to the persistent synthetic-to-real domain gap.
Existing unsupervised domain adaptation approaches aim to mitigate this issue
but often underperform when a modest number of labeled target samples are
available. In this work, we propose the first Supervised Domain Adaptation
(SDA) framework tailored for SPE keypoint regression. Building on the Learning
Invariant Representation and Risk (LIRR) paradigm, our method jointly optimizes
domain-invariant representations and task-specific risk using both labeled
synthetic and limited labeled real data, thereby reducing generalization error
under domain shift. Extensive experiments on the SPEED+ benchmark demonstrate
that our approach consistently outperforms source-only, fine-tuning, and oracle
baselines. Notably, with only 5% labeled target data, our method matches or
surpasses oracle performance trained on larger fractions of labeled data. The
framework is lightweight, backbone-agnostic, and computationally efficient,
offering a practical pathway toward robust and deployable spacecraft pose
estimation in real-world space environments.

*Jiayu Yuan,Ming Dai,Enhui Zheng,Chao Su,Nanxing Chen,Qiming Hu,Shibo Zhu,Yibin Cao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel approach for UAV localization in GNSS-denied environments using semantic features and introduces a large-scale dataset for variable altitude scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing UAV localization systems in dynamic or challenging environments, such as suboptimal performance and environmental sensitivity.

Method: The authors introduce a Semantic-Weighted Adaptive Particle Filter (SWA-PF), which leverages semantic features from UAV images and satellite maps, integrating innovative weighting and filtering mechanisms.

Result: The method provides a 10x computational efficiency improvement and achieves global positioning errors below 10 meters for 4-DoF pose estimation, validated on the new dataset.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates practicality and reliability for real-time UAV localization under variable altitudes, especially in GNSS-denied settings.

Abstract: Vision-based Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) localization systems have been
extensively investigated for Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS)-denied
environments. However, existing retrieval-based approaches face limitations in
dataset availability and persistent challenges including suboptimal real-time
performance, environmental sensitivity, and limited generalization capability,
particularly in dynamic or temporally varying environments. To overcome these
limitations, we present a large-scale Multi-Altitude Flight Segments dataset
(MAFS) for variable altitude scenarios and propose a novel Semantic-Weighted
Adaptive Particle Filter (SWA-PF) method. This approach integrates robust
semantic features from both UAV-captured images and satellite imagery through
two key innovations: a semantic weighting mechanism and an optimized particle
filtering architecture. Evaluated using our dataset, the proposed method
achieves 10x computational efficiency gain over feature extraction methods,
maintains global positioning errors below 10 meters, and enables rapid 4 degree
of freedom (4-DoF) pose estimation within seconds using accessible
low-resolution satellite maps. Code and dataset will be available at

### [120] [Masked Feature Modeling Enhances Adaptive Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13801)
*Wenlve Zhou,Zhiheng Zhou,Tiantao Xian,Yikui Zhai,Weibin Wu,Biyun Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces Masked Feature Modeling (MFM), a novel auxiliary task for unsupervised domain adaptation in semantic segmentation that enhances performance via feature masking and reconstruction directly in feature space while maintaining architectural compatibility and zero inference overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of transferring models from a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain in unsupervised domain adaptation, particularly by improving feature discriminability and aligning auxiliary learning tasks with the main segmentation objective.

Method: The authors propose Masked Feature Modeling (MFM), which involves masking and reconstructing features directly in feature space. They introduce a lightweight auxiliary module named Rebuilder for reconstruction, coupled with the segmentation decoder to classify reconstructed features without altering the inference pipeline.

Result: Experiments show that MFM improves segmentation performance consistently across various architectures and UDA benchmarks. It offers efficient, generalizable benefits with zero computational overhead during inference.

Conclusion: MFM provides a simple yet effective strategy for enhancing unsupervised domain-adaptive semantic segmentation, aligning auxiliary and primary objectives without complexity or architectural modifications.

Abstract: Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) for semantic segmentation aims to
transfer models from a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain.
While auxiliary self-supervised tasks-particularly contrastive learning-have
improved feature discriminability, masked modeling approaches remain
underexplored in this setting, largely due to architectural incompatibility and
misaligned optimization objectives. We propose Masked Feature Modeling (MFM), a
novel auxiliary task that performs feature masking and reconstruction directly
in the feature space. Unlike existing masked modeling methods that reconstruct
low-level inputs or perceptual features (e.g., HOG or visual tokens), MFM
aligns its learning target with the main segmentation task, ensuring
compatibility with standard architectures like DeepLab and DAFormer without
modifying the inference pipeline. To facilitate effective reconstruction, we
introduce a lightweight auxiliary module, Rebuilder, which is trained jointly
but discarded during inference, adding zero computational overhead at test
time. Crucially, MFM leverages the segmentation decoder to classify the
reconstructed features, tightly coupling the auxiliary objective with the
pixel-wise prediction task to avoid interference with the primary task.
Extensive experiments across various architectures and UDA benchmarks
demonstrate that MFM consistently enhances segmentation performance, offering a
simple, efficient, and generalizable strategy for unsupervised domain-adaptive
semantic segmentation.

*Weihang Wang,Xinhao Li,Ziyue Wang,Yan Pang,Jielei Zhang,Peiyi Li,Qiang Zhang,Longwen Gao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper studies object hallucination issues in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), introduces a detailed benchmark, and presents a method to reduce hallucinations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address object hallucination problems in LVLMs due to differing inductive biases of visual encoders.

Method: Introduced VHBench-10 for fine-grained evaluation of hallucinations and proposed VisionWeaver, a Context-Aware Routing Network that dynamically aggregates features.

Result: Validated that different encoders exhibit distinct hallucination patterns and demonstrated improvement in performance and reduction in hallucinations using VisionWeaver.

Conclusion: VisionWeaver effectively decreases hallucinations in LVLMs and improves their real-world applicability.

Abstract: Object hallucination in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) significantly
impedes their real-world applicability. As the primary component for accurately
interpreting visual information, the choice of visual encoder is pivotal. We
hypothesize that the diverse training paradigms employed by different visual
encoders instill them with distinct inductive biases, which leads to their
diverse hallucination performances. Existing benchmarks typically focus on
coarse-grained hallucination detection and fail to capture the diverse
hallucinations elaborated in our hypothesis. To systematically analyze these
effects, we introduce VHBench-10, a comprehensive benchmark with approximately
10,000 samples for evaluating LVLMs across ten fine-grained hallucination
categories. Our evaluations confirm encoders exhibit unique hallucination
characteristics. Building on these insights and the suboptimality of simple
feature fusion, we propose VisionWeaver, a novel Context-Aware Routing Network.
It employs global visual features to generate routing signals, dynamically
aggregating visual features from multiple specialized experts. Comprehensive
experiments confirm the effectiveness of VisionWeaver in significantly reducing
hallucinations and improving overall model performance.

*Nick Theisen,Kenny Schlegel,Dietrich Paulus,Peer Neubert*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of spectral classification in hyperspectral images and proposes MiniROCKET and HDC-MiniROCKET as robust alternatives to the state-of-the-art.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve spectral classification methods in hyperspectral imaging to handle limited training data effectively.

Method: Proposes MiniROCKET and HDC-MiniROCKET, models with non-trainable feature extraction components, enhancing robustness in limited data scenarios.

Result: MiniROCKET outperforms 1D-Justo-LiuNet in scenarios with limited training data, while being comparable in general cases.

Conclusion: MiniROCKET-based methods offer a promising direction for spectral classification, especially in contexts with restricted training data availability.

Abstract: The classification of pixel spectra of hyperspectral images, i.e. spectral
classification, is used in many fields ranging from agricultural, over medical
to remote sensing applications and is currently also expanding to areas such as
autonomous driving. Even though for full hyperspectral images the
best-performing methods exploit spatial-spectral information, performing
classification solely on spectral information has its own advantages, e.g.
smaller model size and thus less data required for training. Moreover, spectral
information is complementary to spatial information and improvements on either
part can be used to improve spatial-spectral approaches in the future.
Recently, 1D-Justo-LiuNet was proposed as a particularly efficient model with
very few parameters, which currently defines the state of the art in spectral
classification. However, we show that with limited training data the model
performance deteriorates. Therefore, we investigate MiniROCKET and
HDC-MiniROCKET for spectral classification to mitigate that problem. The model
extracts well-engineered features without trainable parameters in the feature
extraction part and is therefore less vulnerable to limited training data. We
show that even though MiniROCKET has more parameters it outperforms
1D-Justo-LiuNet in limited data scenarios and is mostly on par with it in the
general case

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Semi-MOE is a novel framework for histopathology image segmentation that uses a Mixture-of-Experts approach to overcome pseudo-label noise and achieves state-of-the-art results in semi-supervised settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses challenges in histopathology image segmentation, particularly the noisy pseudo-labels caused by ambiguous gland boundaries and morphological misclassification in semi-supervised learning.

Method: The proposed framework, Semi-MOE, incorporates three specialized expert networks focusing on segmentation, signed distance field regression, and boundary prediction. It uses a Multi-Gating Pseudo-labeling module for feature aggregation and an Adaptive Multi-Objective Loss to balance learning objectives dynamically.

Result: Extensive experiments on GlaS and CRAG benchmarks demonstrate that Semi-MOE surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods in low-label scenarios.

Conclusion: Semi-MOE showcases the effectiveness of Mixture-of-Experts architectures in advancing semi-supervised histopathology image segmentation and provides robust results with reduced manual tuning.

Abstract: Semi-supervised learning has been employed to alleviate the need for
extensive labeled data for histopathology image segmentation, but existing
methods struggle with noisy pseudo-labels due to ambiguous gland boundaries and
morphological misclassification. This paper introduces Semi-MOE, to the best of
our knowledge, the first multi-task Mixture-of-Experts framework for
semi-supervised histopathology image segmentation. Our approach leverages three
specialized expert networks: A main segmentation expert, a signed distance
field regression expert, and a boundary prediction expert, each dedicated to
capturing distinct morphological features. Subsequently, the Multi-Gating
Pseudo-labeling module dynamically aggregates expert features, enabling a
robust fuse-and-refine pseudo-labeling mechanism. Furthermore, to eliminate
manual tuning while dynamically balancing multiple learning objectives, we
propose an Adaptive Multi-Objective Loss. Extensive experiments on GlaS and
CRAG benchmarks show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in
low-label settings, highlighting the potential of MoE-based architectures in
advancing semi-supervised segmentation. Our code is available at

*Puru Vaish,Felix Meister,Tobias Heimann,Christoph Brune,Jelmer M. Wolterink*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Meaningful representations don't naturally emerge from uncorrelated views; structured alignment of complementary data is essential.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study challenges the assumption that uncorrelated views of data are sufficient to produce meaningful latent representations.

Method: The method involves explicit alignment of representations from different views to integrate complementary information without generating false positives.

Result: The proposed Consistent View Alignment method enhances downstream task performance and excelled in the MICCAI 2025 SSL3D challenges using advanced architectures.

Conclusion: Structured view alignment is crucial for effective representation learning in self-supervised frameworks.

Abstract: Many recent approaches in representation learning implicitly assume that
uncorrelated views of a data point are sufficient to learn meaningful
representations for various downstream tasks. In this work, we challenge this
assumption and demonstrate that meaningful structure in the latent space does
not emerge naturally. Instead, it must be explicitly induced. We propose a
method that aligns representations from different views of the data to align
complementary information without inducing false positives. Our experiments
show that our proposed self-supervised learning method, Consistent View
Alignment, improves performance for downstream tasks, highlighting the critical
role of structured view alignment in learning effective representations. Our
method achieved first and second place in the MICCAI 2025 SSL3D challenge when
using a Primus vision transformer and ResEnc convolutional neural network,
respectively. The code and pretrained model weights are released at

*Jiayi Pan,Jiaming Xu,Yongkang Zhou,Guohao Dai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SpecDiff improves the efficiency of diffusion models by incorporating future and historical information into a feature caching strategy for faster inference with minimal quality loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion model processes are inefficient due to high computational requirements. Existing feature caching methods improve speed but suffer from limited accuracy and performance because they only rely on historical information.

Method: SpecDiff introduces future information via self-speculation and combines it with historical information. It includes a cached feature selection algorithm that determines token importance dynamically and a multi-level feature classification algorithm to enhance processing.

Result: SpecDiff achieves significant speedups (2.80× to 3.17×) across various models (Stable Diffusion 3, 3.5, FLUX) with negligible quality loss on an NVIDIA A800-80GB GPU.

Conclusion: SpecDiff addresses the trade-off between speed and accuracy in diffusion model inference by effectively combining speculative and historical information. It sets new performance benchmarks for efficient diffusion modeling.

Abstract: Feature caching has recently emerged as a promising method for diffusion
model acceleration. It effectively alleviates the inefficiency problem caused
by high computational requirements by caching similar features in the inference
process of the diffusion model. In this paper, we analyze existing feature
caching methods from the perspective of information utilization, and point out
that relying solely on historical information will lead to constrained accuracy
and speed performance. And we propose a novel paradigm that introduces future
information via self-speculation based on the information similarity at the
same time step across different iteration times. Based on this paradigm, we
present \textit{SpecDiff}, a training-free multi-level feature caching strategy
including a cached feature selection algorithm and a multi-level feature
classification algorithm. (1) Feature selection algorithm based on
self-speculative information. \textit{SpecDiff} determines a dynamic importance
score for each token based on self-speculative information and historical
information, and performs cached feature selection through the importance
score. (2) Multi-level feature classification algorithm based on feature
importance scores. \textit{SpecDiff} classifies tokens by leveraging the
differences in feature importance scores and introduces a multi-level feature
calculation strategy. Extensive experiments show that \textit{SpecDiff}
achieves average 2.80 \times, 2.74 \times , and 3.17\times speedup with
negligible quality loss in Stable Diffusion 3, 3.5, and FLUX compared to RFlow
on NVIDIA A800-80GB GPU. By merging speculative and historical information,
\textit{SpecDiff} overcomes the speedup-accuracy trade-off bottleneck, pushing
the Pareto frontier of speedup and accuracy in the efficient diffusion model
inference.

*Qianxin Xia,Jiawei Du,Guoming Lu,Zhiyong Shu,Jielei Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces EDITS, a framework for dataset distillation that integrates textual semantics to create compact synthetic datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research addresses the limitation of traditional dataset distillation methods that overlook high-level semantic and structural information in image datasets.

Method: The proposed EDITS framework leverages image features and externally generated textual data. It uses a Vision Language Model (VLM) and a Global Semantic Query module for feature fusion, along with a Local Semantic Awareness approach for prototype creation, and a diffusion model for generating synthetic datasets.

Result: The experiments demonstrate that EDITS improves dataset distillation by preserving semantic richness, achieving efficient learning with competitive performance.

Conclusion: EDITS enhances dataset distillation by integrating both image and textual semantics, providing a robust solution for creating condensed yet effective datasets.

Abstract: Dataset distillation aims to synthesize a compact dataset from the original
large-scale one, enabling highly efficient learning while preserving
competitive model performance. However, traditional techniques primarily
capture low-level visual features, neglecting the high-level semantic and
structural information inherent in images. In this paper, we propose EDITS, a
novel framework that exploits the implicit textual semantics within the image
data to achieve enhanced distillation. First, external texts generated by a
Vision Language Model (VLM) are fused with image features through a Global
Semantic Query module, forming the prior clustered buffer. Local Semantic
Awareness then selects representative samples from the buffer to construct
image and text prototypes, with the latter produced by guiding a Large Language
Model (LLM) with meticulously crafted prompt. Ultimately, Dual Prototype
Guidance strategy generates the final synthetic dataset through a diffusion
model. Extensive experiments confirm the effectiveness of our method.Source

*Chu Chen,Ander Biguri,Jean-Michel Morel,Raymond H. Chan,Carola-Bibiane Schönlieb,Jizhou Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents LamiGauss, a new algorithm for high-quality laminographic reconstructions under sparse-view conditions, which significantly outperforms existing techniques even with minimal data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation arises from the need to overcome difficulties in reconstructing accurate volumes in plate-like structures (e.g., microchips, batteries) using traditional CT methods, particularly when data acquisition is sparse.

Method: LamiGauss combines Gaussian Splatting with a detector-to-world model tailored for laminographic imaging, incorporating tilt angles to reduce artifacts during initialization and refine sparse-projection reconstruction.

Result: Extensive tests on synthetic and real datasets show that LamiGauss can reconstruct high-quality volumes with only 3% of data views, surpassing iterative methods optimized for full datasets.

Conclusion: LamiGauss proves highly effective and efficient for sparse laminographic projection reconstruction, offering a substantial improvement over existing methods in accuracy and computational efficiency.

Abstract: X-ray Computed Laminography (CL) is essential for non-destructive inspection
of plate-like structures in applications such as microchips and composite
battery materials, where traditional computed tomography (CT) struggles due to
geometric constraints. However, reconstructing high-quality volumes from
laminographic projections remains challenging, particularly under highly
sparse-view acquisition conditions. In this paper, we propose a reconstruction
algorithm, namely LamiGauss, that combines Gaussian Splatting radiative
rasterization with a dedicated detector-to-world transformation model
incorporating the laminographic tilt angle. LamiGauss leverages an
initialization strategy that explicitly filters out common laminographic
artifacts from the preliminary reconstruction, preventing redundant Gaussians
from being allocated to false structures and thereby concentrating model
capacity on representing the genuine object. Our approach effectively optimizes
directly from sparse projections, enabling accurate and efficient
reconstruction with limited data. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and
real datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed
method over existing techniques. LamiGauss uses only 3$\%$ of full views to
achieve superior performance over the iterative method optimized on a full
dataset.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces DAM4SAM, an upgraded memory module for SAM2 that improves performance in visual object tracking, overcoming issues with similar-looking distractors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current memory-based segmentation models like SAM2 excel in segmentation but struggle with visual object tracking due to challenges posed by distractors.

Method: The paper proposes a distractor-aware memory module and introspection-based management for SAM2, along with creating a specialized dataset (DiDi) for testing tracking amidst distractors.

Result: DAM4SAM surpasses SAM2.1 on 13 benchmarks and sets state-of-the-art on 10. It enhances real-time and edge-based trackers as well, showing significant generalization.

Conclusion: DAM4SAM effectively addresses distractor-induced issues in object tracking, advancing segmentation and tracking quality while demonstrating adaptability to various tracker architectures.

Abstract: Recent emergence of memory-based video segmentation methods such as SAM2 has
led to models with excellent performance in segmentation tasks, achieving
leading results on numerous benchmarks. However, these modes are not fully
adjusted for visual object tracking, where distractors (i.e., objects visually
similar to the target) pose a key challenge. In this paper we propose a
distractor-aware drop-in memory module and introspection-based management
method for SAM2, leading to DAM4SAM. Our design effectively reduces the
tracking drift toward distractors and improves redetection capability after
object occlusion. To facilitate the analysis of tracking in the presence of
distractors, we construct DiDi, a Distractor-Distilled dataset. DAM4SAM
outperforms SAM2.1 on thirteen benchmarks and sets new state-of-the-art results
on ten. Furthermore, integrating the proposed distractor-aware memory into a
real-time tracker EfficientTAM leads to 11% improvement and matches tracking
quality of the non-real-time SAM2.1-L on multiple tracking and segmentation
benchmarks, while integration with edge-based tracker EdgeTAM delivers 4%
performance boost, demonstrating a very good generalization across
architectures.

### [129] [Dense Video Understanding with Gated Residual Tokenization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14199)
*Haichao Zhang,Wenhao Chai,Shwai He,Ang Li,Yun Fu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper focuses on improving high-frame-per-second (high-FPS) video understanding by addressing tokenization inefficiencies using a new framework called Gated Residual Tokenization (GRT).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video large language models struggle with tasks requiring high temporal resolution due to inefficiencies in tokenizing every frame, leading to computational redundancy. This is particularly problematic for tasks like lecture comprehension requiring dense temporal reasoning.

Method: The proposed Gated Residual Tokenization (GRT) framework incorporates two components: (1) Motion-Compensated Inter-Gated Tokenization, which estimates pixel motion to skip static regions to reduce token count, and (2) Semantic-Scene Intra-Tokenization Merging, which merges tokens from static regions to further eliminate redundancy. They also introduced a benchmark called DIVE for dense temporal video evaluation.

Result: Experiments demonstrated that GRT surpasses the performance of larger VLLM models on the DIVE benchmark and scales efficiently with FPS, showcasing its ability to handle dense temporal video comprehension.

Conclusion: Dense temporal information is crucial for video understanding, and the proposed GRT framework provides a scalable and computationally efficient approach to achieve high-FPS video comprehension.

Abstract: High temporal resolution is essential for capturing fine-grained details in
video understanding. However, current video large language models (VLLMs) and
benchmarks mostly rely on low-frame-rate sampling, such as uniform sampling or
keyframe selection, discarding dense temporal information. This compromise
avoids the high cost of tokenizing every frame, which otherwise leads to
redundant computation and linear token growth as video length increases. While
this trade-off works for slowly changing content, it fails for tasks like
lecture comprehension, where information appears in nearly every frame and
requires precise temporal alignment. To address this gap, we introduce Dense
Video Understanding (DVU), which enables high-FPS video comprehension by
reducing both tokenization time and token overhead. Existing benchmarks are
also limited, as their QA pairs focus on coarse content changes. We therefore
propose DIVE (Dense Information Video Evaluation), the first benchmark designed
for dense temporal reasoning. To make DVU practical, we present Gated Residual
Tokenization (GRT), a two-stage framework: (1) Motion-Compensated Inter-Gated
Tokenization uses pixel-level motion estimation to skip static regions during
tokenization, achieving sub-linear growth in token count and compute. (2)
Semantic-Scene Intra-Tokenization Merging fuses tokens across static regions
within a scene, further reducing redundancy while preserving dynamic semantics.
Experiments on DIVE show that GRT outperforms larger VLLM baselines and scales
positively with FPS. These results highlight the importance of dense temporal
information and demonstrate that GRT enables efficient, scalable high-FPS video
understanding.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces PelFANet, a dual-stream attention network designed to improve pelvic fracture classification by combining raw X-rays with segmented bone images. It outperforms traditional methods with high accuracy and AUC values, especially handling subtle radiographic presentations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pelvic fractures are difficult to detect on standard radiographs, especially when signs are subtle or invisible, necessitating more robust diagnostic tools.

Method: PelFANet utilizes a dual-stream attention network that integrates raw X-rays with segmented images and refines features using Fused Attention Blocks (FABlocks). Training involves a segmentation-guided, two-stage pipeline.

Result: PelFANet achieved 88.68% accuracy and 0.9334 AUC for visible fractures, and 82.29% accuracy with 0.8688 AUC for invisible fractures, demonstrating superior performance over conventional methods.

Conclusion: Dual-input, anatomy-aware architectures like PelFANet offer a promising approach to improving fracture detection, particularly for cases that are challenging to identify using traditional radiographs.

Abstract: Pelvic fractures pose significant diagnostic challenges, particularly in
cases where fracture signs are subtle or invisible on standard radiographs. To
address this, we introduce PelFANet, a dual-stream attention network that fuses
raw pelvic X-rays with segmented bone images to improve fracture
classification. The network em-ploys Fused Attention Blocks (FABlocks) to
iteratively exchange and refine fea-tures from both inputs, capturing global
context and localized anatomical detail. Trained in a two-stage pipeline with a
segmentation-guided approach, PelFANet demonstrates superior performance over
conventional methods. On the AMERI dataset, it achieves 88.68% accuracy and
0.9334 AUC on visible fractures, while generalizing effectively to invisible
fracture cases with 82.29% accuracy and 0.8688 AUC, despite not being trained
on them. These results highlight the clini-cal potential of anatomy-aware
dual-input architectures for robust fracture detec-tion, especially in
scenarios with subtle radiographic presentations.

*Zhen Xu,Guorui Lu,Chang Gao,Qinyu Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces EvHand-FPV, a lightweight framework for egocentric 3D hand tracking using event cameras, offering significant improvements in accuracy and efficiency for XR devices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the challenges of traditional frame-based hand tracking methods, which often lack accuracy, low latency, and energy efficiency, particularly in XR devices.

Method: EvHand-FPV combines a novel wrist-based region of interest (ROI) approach, synthetic and real event-based datasets, an end-to-end mapping strategy, and multi-task learning to reduce computation and improve representation.

Result: EvHand-FPV shows an 89% reduction in model parameters and inference FLOPs, while improving 2D-AUCp accuracy from 0.77 to 0.85 on real data and maintaining competitive 3D performance on synthetic data.

Conclusion: EvHand-FPV demonstrates efficient and accurate egocentric hand tracking, making it suitable for on-device applications in XR environments. The framework and associated datasets are publicly available.

Abstract: Hand tracking holds great promise for intuitive interaction paradigms, but
frame-based methods often struggle to meet the requirements of accuracy, low
latency, and energy efficiency, especially in resource-constrained settings
such as Extended Reality (XR) devices. Event cameras provide $\mu$s-level
temporal resolution at mW-level power by asynchronously sensing brightness
changes. In this work, we present EvHand-FPV, a lightweight framework for
egocentric First-Person-View 3D hand tracking from a single event camera. We
construct an event-based FPV dataset that couples synthetic training data with
3D labels and real event data with 2D labels for evaluation to address the
scarcity of egocentric benchmarks. EvHand-FPV also introduces a wrist-based
region of interest (ROI) that localizes the hand region via geometric cues,
combined with an end-to-end mapping strategy that embeds ROI offsets into the
network to reduce computation without explicit reconstruction, and a multi-task
learning strategy with an auxiliary geometric feature head that improves
representations without test-time overhead. On our real FPV test set,
EvHand-FPV improves 2D-AUCp from 0.77 to 0.85 while reducing parameters from
11.2M to 1.2M by 89% and FLOPs per inference from 1.648G to 0.185G by 89%. It
also maintains a competitive 3D-AUCp of 0.84 on synthetic data. These results
demonstrate accurate and efficient egocentric event-based hand tracking
suitable for on-device XR applications. The dataset and code are available at

### [132] [White Aggregation and Restoration for Few-shot 3D Point Cloud Semantic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13907)
*Jiyun Im,SuBeen Lee,Miso Lee,Jae-Pil Heo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel method for Few-Shot 3D Point Cloud Segmentation (FS-PCS) using an attention-based prototype generation technique to boost performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The researchers aim to address the limitations of conventional prototype construction methods, focusing on issues like the randomness in farthest point sampling and the underexplored nature of prototype generation in FS-PCS.

Method: The paper introduces White Aggregation and Restoration Module (WARM), which uses whitening and coloring transformations sandwiching cross-attention. This aligns support features and improves prototype generation.

Result: The proposed WARM method achieves state-of-the-art performance with significant margins across various FS-PCS benchmarks.

Conclusion: WARM method effectively enhances Few-Shot 3D Point Cloud Segmentation by employing robust prototype generation, outperforming existing methods in the domain.

Abstract: Few-Shot 3D Point Cloud Segmentation (FS-PCS) aims to predict per-point
labels for an unlabeled point cloud, given only a few labeled examples. To
extract discriminative representations from the limited support set, existing
methods have constructed prototypes using conventional algorithms such as
farthest point sampling. However, we point out that its initial randomness
significantly affects FS-PCS performance and that the prototype generation
process remains underexplored despite its prevalence. This motivates us to
investigate an advanced prototype generation method based on attention
mechanism. Despite its potential, we found that vanilla module suffers from the
distributional gap between learnable prototypical tokens and support features.
To overcome this, we propose White Aggregation and Restoration Module (WARM),
which resolves the misalignment by sandwiching cross-attention between
whitening and coloring transformations. Specifically, whitening aligns the
support features to prototypical tokens before attention process, and
subsequently coloring restores the original distribution to the attended
tokens. This simple yet effective design enables robust attention, thereby
generating representative prototypes by capturing the semantic relationships
among support features. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance with a
significant margin on multiple FS-PCS benchmarks, demonstrating its
effectiveness through extensive experiments.

### [133] [Towards Rationale-Answer Alignment of LVLMs via Self-Rationale Calibration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13919)
*Yuanchen Wu,Ke Yan,Shouhong Ding,Ziyin Zhou,Xiaoqiang Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Self-Rationale Calibration (SRC) framework to improve the alignment of rationale and answer consistency in large vision-language models (LVLMs), achieving better reasoning and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LVLMs exhibit strong visual question-answering abilities but struggle with aligning their reasoning rationale to their answers, resulting in inconsistencies and errors.

Method: The SRC framework involves: 1) rationale fine-tuning to modify the model’s response format for rationale-prioritized answers, 2) generating diverse candidate responses, 3) a pairwise scoring strategy with an R-Scorer to evaluate rationale quality and factual consistency, and 4) preference fine-tuning for alignment calibration.

Result: SRC leads to significant advancements in LVLMs’ perception, reasoning, and generalization capabilities across various benchmarks.

Conclusion: Emphasizing rationale-oriented alignment improves LVLM performance, demonstrating the potential of this approach for better consistency and reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have manifested strong visual question
answering capability. However, they still struggle with aligning the rationale
and the generated answer, leading to inconsistent reasoning and incorrect
responses. To this end, this paper introduces the Self-Rationale Calibration
(SRC) framework to iteratively calibrate the alignment between rationales and
answers. SRC begins by employing a lightweight "rationale fine-tuning"
approach, which modifies the model's response format to require a rationale
before deriving an answer without explicit prompts. Next, SRC searches for a
diverse set of candidate responses from the fine-tuned LVLMs for each sample,
followed by a proposed pairwise scoring strategy using a tailored scoring
model, R-Scorer, to evaluate both rationale quality and factual consistency of
candidates. Based on a confidence-weighted preference curation process, SRC
decouples the alignment calibration into a preference fine-tuning manner,
leading to significant improvements of LVLMs in perception, reasoning, and
generalization across multiple benchmarks. Our results emphasize the
rationale-oriented alignment in exploring the potential of LVLMs.

### [134] [Towards Robust Defense against Customization via Protective Perturbation Resistant to Diffusion-based Purification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13922)
*Wenkui Yang,Jie Cao,Junxian Duan,Ran He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces AntiPure, a diagnostic protective perturbation for addressing vulnerabilities in purification methods used with diffusion models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models like Stable Diffusion bring both creative opportunities and security risks, prompting the need for robust protective perturbation methods to safeguard against misuse.

Method: The proposed AntiPure method utilizes Patch-wise Frequency Guidance and Erroneous Timestep Guidance to inject perturbations that resist purification processes in diffusion models.

Result: AntiPure outperforms existing protective perturbation techniques by embedding perturbations that survive purification and achieve strong post-customization distortion with minimal perceptual issues.

Conclusion: AntiPure serves as an effective stress test for purification methods, exposing security flaws in the purification-customization workflow of diffusion models.

Abstract: Diffusion models like Stable Diffusion have become prominent in visual
synthesis tasks due to their powerful customization capabilities, which also
introduce significant security risks, including deepfakes and copyright
infringement. In response, a class of methods known as protective perturbation
emerged, which mitigates image misuse by injecting imperceptible adversarial
noise. However, purification can remove protective perturbations, thereby
exposing images again to the risk of malicious forgery. In this work, we
formalize the anti-purification task, highlighting challenges that hinder
existing approaches, and propose a simple diagnostic protective perturbation
named AntiPure. AntiPure exposes vulnerabilities of purification within the
"purification-customization" workflow, owing to two guidance mechanisms: 1)
Patch-wise Frequency Guidance, which reduces the model's influence over
high-frequency components in the purified image, and 2) Erroneous Timestep
Guidance, which disrupts the model's denoising strategy across different
timesteps. With additional guidance, AntiPure embeds imperceptible
perturbations that persist under representative purification settings,
achieving effective post-customization distortion. Experiments show that, as a
stress test for purification, AntiPure achieves minimal perceptual discrepancy
and maximal distortion, outperforming other protective perturbation methods
within the purification-customization workflow.

*Harvey Mannering,Zhiwu Huang,Adam Prugel-Bennett*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Noise Level Guidance (NLG), a simple and efficient method to optimize noise in diffusion models, improving image generation quality without requiring additional resources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address issues with image quality and adherence to desired prompts in diffusion models caused by random Gaussian noise.

Method: Propose NLG: a novel noise-level optimization approach that refines initial noise without extra datasets, auxiliary networks, or complex backpropagation.

Result: Demonstrated enhanced generation quality and adherence to input conditions across five benchmarks, generalizable to various diffusion models.

Conclusion: NLG is a practical, scalable, and computationally efficient enhancement for improving diffusion models, applicable with existing guidance methods.

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved state-of-the-art image generation. However,
the random Gaussian noise used to start the diffusion process influences the
final output, causing variations in image quality and prompt adherence.
Existing noise-level optimization approaches generally rely on extra dataset
construction, additional networks, or backpropagation-based optimization,
limiting their practicality. In this paper, we propose Noise Level Guidance
(NLG), a simple, efficient, and general noise-level optimization approach that
refines initial noise by increasing the likelihood of its alignment with
general guidance - requiring no additional training data, auxiliary networks,
or backpropagation. The proposed NLG approach provides a unified framework
generalizable to both conditional and unconditional diffusion models,
accommodating various forms of diffusion-level guidance. Extensive experiments
on five standard benchmarks demonstrate that our approach enhances output
generation quality and input condition adherence. By seamlessly integrating
with existing guidance methods while maintaining computational efficiency, our
method establishes NLG as a practical and scalable enhancement to diffusion
models. Code can be found at

*Gia Khanh Nguyen,Yifeng Huang,Minh Hoai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PairTally is a dataset of 681 images designed to evaluate models on fine-grained visual counting tasks, distinguishing objects based on subtle differences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of clarity in how existing models handle fine-grained and intent-driven counting challenges led to the development of a benchmark dataset.

Method: The paper introduces PairTally, a dataset with two-object-category setups per image and evaluates various models' counting capabilities under distinct and closely related subcategory settings.

Result: State-of-the-art models, despite advancements, found difficulty in reliably counting user-intended objects, particularly under visually ambiguous scenarios.

Conclusion: PairTally serves as a crucial benchmark to identify weaknesses in current visual counting systems and offers potential for guiding future improvements in fine-grained counting tasks.

Abstract: Visual counting is a fundamental yet challenging task, especially when users
need to count objects of a specific type in complex scenes. While recent
models, including class-agnostic counting models and large vision-language
models (VLMs), show promise in counting tasks, their ability to perform
fine-grained, intent-driven counting remains unclear. In this paper, we
introduce PairTally, a benchmark dataset specifically designed to evaluate
fine-grained visual counting. Each of the 681 high-resolution images in
PairTally contains two object categories, requiring models to distinguish and
count based on subtle differences in shape, size, color, or semantics. The
dataset includes both inter-category (distinct categories) and intra-category
(closely related subcategories) settings, making it suitable for rigorous
evaluation of selective counting capabilities. We benchmark a variety of
state-of-the-art models, including exemplar-based methods, language-prompted
models, and large VLMs. Our results show that despite recent advances, current
models struggle to reliably count what users intend, especially in fine-grained
and visually ambiguous cases. PairTally provides a new foundation for
diagnosing and improving fine-grained visual counting systems.

*Elena Camuffo,Francesco Barbato,Mete Ozay,Simone Milani,Umberto Michieli*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MOCHA transfers multimodal semantics from large vision-language models to lightweight vision-only object detectors using a novel region-level alignment approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable efficient and compact object detection models by leveraging knowledge from large vision-language models without requiring textual input during inference.

Method: MOCHA employs a translation module to map student features into a joint multimodal space and uses a dual-objective loss for local and global relational consistency.

Result: Results showed consistent improvements over baselines in few-shot detection tasks, achieving an average score gain of +10.1 and comparable performance to larger models.

Conclusion: MOCHA demonstrates the viability of compact architectures for real-world applications while maintaining high performance through object-level multimodal knowledge transfer.

Abstract: We introduce MOCHA (Multi-modal Objects-aware Cross-arcHitecture Alignment),
a knowledge distillation approach that transfers region-level multimodal
semantics from a large vision-language teacher (e.g., LLaVa) into a lightweight
vision-only object detector student (e.g., YOLO). A translation module maps
student features into a joint space, where the training of the student and
translator is guided by a dual-objective loss that enforces both local
alignment and global relational consistency. Unlike prior approaches focused on
dense or global alignment, MOCHA operates at the object level, enabling
efficient transfer of semantics without modifying the teacher or requiring
textual input at inference. We validate our method across four personalized
detection benchmarks under few-shot regimes. Results show consistent gains over
baselines, with a +10.1 average score improvement. Despite its compact
architecture, MOCHA reaches performance on par with larger multimodal models,
proving its suitability for real-world deployment.

*Tamara R. Lenhard,Andreas Weinmann,Tobias Koch*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study enhances YOLO-FEDER FusionNet for drone detection in cluttered environments, achieving significant performance improvements by combining camouflage detection techniques and advancements in training and architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind the paper is to address the challenges of detecting drones in visually complex environments, where factors like background clutter, small object scale, and camouflage reduce the effectiveness of conventional object detectors like YOLO.

Method: The paper presents an enhanced YOLO-FEDER FusionNet framework, which integrates general object detection with camouflage detection. This involves advanced data composition using synthetic and real-world samples, intermediate multi-scale feature evaluation, and detailed benchmarking of backbone configurations.

Result: The YOLO-FEDER FusionNet with YOLOv8l backbone and FEDER features derived from the DWD module showed significant gains, reducing the false negative rate by up to 39.1% and increasing mean average precision (mAP) by 62.8% at an IoU threshold of 0.5.

Conclusion: Enhancing the YOLO-FEDER FusionNet with novel training strategies and architectural changes effectively improves drone detection in visually complex environments, establishing a more robust detection framework.

Abstract: Drone detection in visually complex environments remains challenging due to
background clutter, small object scale, and camouflage effects. While generic
object detectors like YOLO exhibit strong performance in low-texture scenes,
their effectiveness degrades in cluttered environments with low
object-background separability. To address these limitations, this work
presents an enhanced iteration of YOLO-FEDER FusionNet -- a detection framework
that integrates generic object detection with camouflage object detection
techniques. Building upon the original architecture, the proposed iteration
introduces systematic advancements in training data composition, feature fusion
strategies, and backbone design. Specifically, the training process leverages
large-scale, photo-realistic synthetic data, complemented by a small set of
real-world samples, to enhance robustness under visually complex conditions.
The contribution of intermediate multi-scale FEDER features is systematically
evaluated, and detection performance is comprehensively benchmarked across
multiple YOLO-based backbone configurations. Empirical results indicate that
integrating intermediate FEDER features, in combination with backbone upgrades,
contributes to notable performance improvements. In the most promising
configuration -- YOLO-FEDER FusionNet with a YOLOv8l backbone and FEDER
features derived from the DWD module -- these enhancements lead to a FNR
reduction of up to 39.1 percentage points and a mAP increase of up to 62.8
percentage points at an IoU threshold of 0.5, compared to the initial baseline.

Result: The approach achieved a mean C-index of 0.861 on internal validation and 0.7103 on external validation (CHIMERA 2025 challenge leaderboard), outperforming late fusion configurations.

Conclusion: The fusion-based multi-modal method provides improved prediction accuracy for BCR, potentially improving clinical decision-making in prostate cancer treatment.

Abstract: Almost 30% of prostate cancer (PCa) patients undergoing radical prostatectomy
(RP) experience biochemical recurrence (BCR), characterized by increased
prostate specific antigen (PSA) and associated with increased mortality.
Accurate early prediction of BCR, at the time of RP, would contribute to prompt
adaptive clinical decision-making and improved patient outcomes. In this work,
we propose prostate cancer BCR prediction via fused multi-modal embeddings
(PROFUSEme), which learns cross-modal interactions of clinical, radiology, and
pathology data, following an intermediate fusion configuration in combination
with Cox Proportional Hazard regressors. Quantitative evaluation of our
proposed approach reveals superior performance, when compared with late fusion
configurations, yielding a mean C-index of 0.861 ($\sigma=0.112$) on the
internal 5-fold nested cross-validation framework, and a C-index of 0.7103 on
the hold out data of CHIMERA 2025 challenge validation leaderboard.

TL;DR: Wan-Animate is a framework combining character animation and replacement by aligning motion and expressions with seamless integration into scenes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to solve the problem of creating high-fidelity animated character videos and seamlessly integrating characters into reference scenes.

Method: The approach modifies the input paradigm of the Wan model, incorporating skeleton signals for body movements and implicit facial features for expressions, alongside an auxiliary Relighting LoRA module for environmental integration.

Result: Wan-Animate showcases state-of-the-art performance in animation precision and environmental consistency.

Conclusion: The framework achieves controllable, expressive character animation and seamless scene integration, with plans to open-source the code and model weights.

Abstract: We introduce Wan-Animate, a unified framework for character animation and
replacement. Given a character image and a reference video, Wan-Animate can
animate the character by precisely replicating the expressions and movements of
the character in the video to generate high-fidelity character videos.
Alternatively, it can integrate the animated character into the reference video
to replace the original character, replicating the scene's lighting and color
tone to achieve seamless environmental integration. Wan-Animate is built upon
the Wan model. To adapt it for character animation tasks, we employ a modified
input paradigm to differentiate between reference conditions and regions for
generation. This design unifies multiple tasks into a common symbolic
representation. We use spatially-aligned skeleton signals to replicate body
motion and implicit facial features extracted from source images to reenact
expressions, enabling the generation of character videos with high
controllability and expressiveness. Furthermore, to enhance environmental
integration during character replacement, we develop an auxiliary Relighting
LoRA. This module preserves the character's appearance consistency while
applying the appropriate environmental lighting and color tone. Experimental
results demonstrate that Wan-Animate achieves state-of-the-art performance. We
are committed to open-sourcing the model weights and its source code.

TL;DR: The paper introduces VSE-MOT, a framework for enhanced multi-object tracking in low-quality videos using vision-language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the significant performance degradation of existing MOT algorithms when applied to low-quality real-world video footage.

Method: They propose a tri-branch architecture leveraging a vision-language model, coupled with a Multi-Object Tracking Adapter (MOT-Adapter) and a Visual Semantic Fusion Module (VSFM) for better feature extraction and fusion.

Result: Their experiments show that VSE-MOT achieves 8% to 20% better tracking performance metrics compared to existing methods in low-quality scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed VSE-MOT framework effectively enhances tracking performance in both low-quality and conventional scenarios, showcasing its robustness and superiority.

Abstract: Current multi-object tracking (MOT) algorithms typically overlook issues
inherent in low-quality videos, leading to significant degradation in tracking
performance when confronted with real-world image deterioration. Therefore,
advancing the application of MOT algorithms in real-world low-quality video
scenarios represents a critical and meaningful endeavor. To address the
challenges posed by low-quality scenarios, inspired by vision-language models,
this paper proposes a Visual Semantic Enhancement-guided Multi-Object Tracking
framework (VSE-MOT). Specifically, we first design a tri-branch architecture
that leverages a vision-language model to extract global visual semantic
information from images and fuse it with query vectors. Subsequently, to
further enhance the utilization of visual semantic information, we introduce
the Multi-Object Tracking Adapter (MOT-Adapter) and the Visual Semantic Fusion
Module (VSFM). The MOT-Adapter adapts the extracted global visual semantic
information to suit multi-object tracking tasks, while the VSFM improves the
efficacy of feature fusion. Through extensive experiments, we validate the
effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method in real-world low-quality
video scenarios. Its tracking performance metrics outperform those of existing
methods by approximately 8% to 20%, while maintaining robust performance in
conventional scenarios.

TL;DR: The paper proposes AD-DINOv3, a novel vision-language multimodal framework for Zero-Shot Anomaly Detection (ZSAD) using DINOv3. It addresses domain and semantic biases to identify anomalies effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of this paper is to develop a scalable, annotation-efficient solution for ZSAD by leveraging DINOv3's transferable representation capabilities while addressing domain and semantic biases.

Method: The method involves adapting DINOv3 for ZSAD using a multimodal contrastive learning approach. Lightweight adapters adjust domain gaps, and the Anomaly-Aware Calibration Module (AACM) focuses on anomalous regions rather than generic foreground semantics.

Result: AD-DINOv3 demonstrates state-of-the-art or superior performance on eight industrial and medical benchmarks, showcasing its effectiveness for general ZSAD tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed AD-DINOv3 framework overcomes challenges in ZSAD, providing a robust, scalable, and accurate anomaly detection solution that outperforms existing methods on diverse datasets.

Abstract: Zero-Shot Anomaly Detection (ZSAD) seeks to identify anomalies from arbitrary
novel categories, offering a scalable and annotation-efficient solution.
Traditionally, most ZSAD works have been based on the CLIP model, which
performs anomaly detection by calculating the similarity between visual and
text embeddings. Recently, vision foundation models such as DINOv3 have
demonstrated strong transferable representation capabilities. In this work, we
are the first to adapt DINOv3 for ZSAD. However, this adaptation presents two
key challenges: (i) the domain bias between large-scale pretraining data and
anomaly detection tasks leads to feature misalignment; and (ii) the inherent
bias toward global semantics in pretrained representations often leads to
subtle anomalies being misinterpreted as part of the normal foreground objects,
rather than being distinguished as abnormal regions. To overcome these
challenges, we introduce AD-DINOv3, a novel vision-language multimodal
framework designed for ZSAD. Specifically, we formulate anomaly detection as a
multimodal contrastive learning problem, where DINOv3 is employed as the visual
backbone to extract patch tokens and a CLS token, and the CLIP text encoder
provides embeddings for both normal and abnormal prompts. To bridge the domain
gap, lightweight adapters are introduced in both modalities, enabling their
representations to be recalibrated for the anomaly detection task. Beyond this
baseline alignment, we further design an Anomaly-Aware Calibration Module
(AACM), which explicitly guides the CLS token to attend to anomalous regions
rather than generic foreground semantics, thereby enhancing discriminability.
Extensive experiments on eight industrial and medical benchmarks demonstrate
that AD-DINOv3 consistently matches or surpasses state-of-the-art methods,
verifying its superiority as a general zero-shot anomaly detection framework.

Method: Introduces two key strategies: EMA-guided pseudo supervision for reliable segment-level masks and CMA loss for aligning audio and visual embeddings at segment-class pairs while preserving temporal structure.

Result: The proposed approach outperforms previous methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance on the LLP and UnAV-100 datasets.

Conclusion: The strategies introduced successfully address the deficiencies in existing methods, enhancing audio-visual event detection with better segment-level and cross-modal consistency.

Abstract: Weakly-supervised audio-visual video parsing (AVVP) seeks to detect audible,
visible, and audio-visual events without temporal annotations. Previous work
has emphasized refining global predictions through contrastive or collaborative
learning, but neglected stable segment-level supervision and class-aware
cross-modal alignment. To address this, we propose two strategies: (1) an
exponential moving average (EMA)-guided pseudo supervision framework that
generates reliable segment-level masks via adaptive thresholds or top-k
selection, offering stable temporal guidance beyond video-level labels; and (2)
a class-aware cross-modal agreement (CMA) loss that aligns audio and visual
embeddings at reliable segment-class pairs, ensuring consistency across
modalities while preserving temporal structure. Evaluations on LLP and UnAV-100
datasets shows that our method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance
across multiple metrics.

*Leonard Hackel,Tom Burgert,Begüm Demir*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces an efficient remote sensing foundation model using a Soft mixture-of-experts mechanism in Cross-Sensor Masked Autoencoder (CSMAE).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Remote sensing foundation models suffer from high computational complexity or limited representational capacity, restricting practical applicability.

Method: The study adapts RS FMs by integrating Soft mixture-of-experts (MoE) for modality-specific and cross-sensor learning, applied to the CSMAE model and introducing thematic-climatic sampling for training data creation.

Result: The proposed CSMoE achieves over twice the computational efficiency of existing RS foundation models while maintaining or improving performance in scene classification, semantic segmentation, and image retrieval.

Conclusion: Soft MoE integration into RS foundation models effectively balances computational efficiency and representation quality, enhancing practical applicability in various tasks.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning through masked autoencoders has attracted great
attention for remote sensing (RS) foundation model (FM) development, enabling
improved representation learning across diverse sensors and downstream tasks.
However, existing RS FMs often either suffer from substantial computational
complexity during both training and inference or exhibit limited
representational capacity. These issues restrict their practical applicability
in RS. To address this limitation, we propose an adaptation for enhancing the
efficiency of RS FMs by integrating the Soft mixture-of-experts (MoE) mechanism
into the FM. The integration of Soft MoEs into the FM allows modality-specific
expert specialization alongside shared cross-sensor representation learning. To
demonstrate the effectiveness of our adaptation, we apply it on the
Cross-Sensor Masked Autoencoder (CSMAE) model, resulting in the Cross-Sensor
Mixture-of-Experts (CSMoE) model. In addition, we introduce a thematic-climatic
descriptor-driven sampling strategy for the construction of a representative
and diverse training set to train our CSMoE model. Extensive experiments on
scene classification, semantic segmentation, and content-based image retrieval
demonstrate that our adaptation yields a reduction in computational
requirements while maintaining or improving representational performance.
Compared to state-of-the-art RS FMs, CSMoE achieves a superior trade-off
between representational capacity, accuracy, and computational efficiency. On
average, CSMoE achieves more than twice the computational efficiency of
existing RS FMs, while maintaining competitive performance across all
experiments. These results show the effectiveness of the proposed adaptation
for creating computationally efficient RS FMs. The code for the model, the
training set creation, and the model weights will be available at

### [146] [Generative AI for Misalignment-Resistant Virtual Staining to Accelerate Histopathology Workflows](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14119)
*Jiabo MA,Wenqiang Li,Jinbang Li,Ziyi Liu,Linshan Wu,Fengtao Zhou,Li Liang,Ronald Cheong Kin Chan,Terence T. W. Wong,Hao Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a virtual staining method with cascaded registration mechanisms that resolves spatial mismatches in unpaired or poorly paired tissue section data. Experimental results demonstrate significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Histopathological diagnosis relies on chemical staining, which is time-consuming and environmentally taxing, requiring well-aligned paired data for virtual staining—something inherently difficult due to tissue distortion and damage.

Method: The authors proposed a robust virtual staining framework with cascaded registration mechanisms to correct spatial discrepancies in generated outputs and ground truth from unpaired or poorly paired datasets.

Result: The proposed method significantly outperformed state-of-the-art models, with up to 23.8% improvement in peak signal-to-noise ratio and average gains of 3.2% and 10.1% on internal and external datasets, respectively.

Conclusion: This approach enhances robustness in virtual staining across diverse datasets, simplifies data acquisition, and advances the development of environmentally friendly alternatives for histopathological diagnosis.

Abstract: Accurate histopathological diagnosis often requires multiple differently
stained tissue sections, a process that is time-consuming, labor-intensive, and
environmentally taxing due to the use of multiple chemical stains. Recently,
virtual staining has emerged as a promising alternative that is faster,
tissue-conserving, and environmentally friendly. However, existing virtual
staining methods face significant challenges in clinical applications,
primarily due to their reliance on well-aligned paired data. Obtaining such
data is inherently difficult because chemical staining processes can distort
tissue structures, and a single tissue section cannot undergo multiple staining
procedures without damage or loss of information. As a result, most available
virtual staining datasets are either unpaired or roughly paired, making it
difficult for existing methods to achieve accurate pixel-level supervision. To
address this challenge, we propose a robust virtual staining framework
featuring cascaded registration mechanisms to resolve spatial mismatches
between generated outputs and their corresponding ground truth. Experimental
results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art
models across five datasets, achieving an average improvement of 3.2% on
internal datasets and 10.1% on external datasets. Moreover, in datasets with
substantial misalignment, our approach achieves a remarkable 23.8% improvement
in peak signal-to-noise ratio compared to baseline models. The exceptional
robustness of the proposed method across diverse datasets simplifies the data
acquisition process for virtual staining and offers new insights for advancing
its development.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing use of beauty filters through social media raises concerns about the reliability of facial images and videos, especially for systems that aim to detect manipulated data and ensure security.

Method: The authors evaluated state-of-the-art deepfake and morphing attack detectors using benchmark datasets before and after applying different smoothing filters.

Result: The analysis showed that facial beautification filters degrade the performance of detectors, exposing their weaknesses.

Conclusion: Facial enhancements via beauty filters create vulnerabilities in manipulation detection systems, emphasizing the need for more robust models.

Abstract: Digital beautification through social media filters has become increasingly
popular, raising concerns about the reliability of facial images and videos and
the effectiveness of automated face analysis. This issue is particularly
critical for digital manipulation detectors, systems aiming at distinguishing
between genuine and manipulated data, especially in cases involving deepfakes
and morphing attacks designed to deceive humans and automated facial
recognition. This study examines whether beauty filters impact the performance
of deepfake and morphing attack detectors. We perform a comprehensive analysis,
evaluating multiple state-of-the-art detectors on benchmark datasets before and
after applying various smoothing filters. Our findings reveal performance
degradation, highlighting vulnerabilities introduced by facial enhancements and
underscoring the need for robust detection models resilient to such
alterations.

### [149] [An Exploratory Study on Abstract Images and Visual Representations Learned from Them](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14149)
*Haotian Li,Jianbo Jiao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This study investigates abstract images' capacity to convey visual semantics compared to raster images, using a new dataset (HAID) and analyzing model performance across various computer vision tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore why abstract images often underperform raster images in conveying high-level semantic information and determine their effectiveness as a potential image format in vision tasks.

Method: The authors created the Hierarchical Abstraction Image Dataset (HAID), a collection of abstract images generated at varying abstraction levels from raster images. They trained vision systems on HAID for tasks such as classification, segmentation, and object detection.

Result: The study provided a detailed performance comparison of vision systems trained on raster images versus abstract images for multiple vision tasks. The findings shed light on the limitations and potential of abstract representations.

Conclusion: The authors evaluate whether abstract images can serve as an effective medium for high-level semantic information, identifying room for further refinement in utilizing them for vision tasks.

Abstract: Imagine living in a world composed solely of primitive shapes, could you
still recognise familiar objects? Recent studies have shown that abstract
images-constructed by primitive shapes-can indeed convey visual semantic
information to deep learning models. However, representations obtained from
such images often fall short compared to those derived from traditional raster
images. In this paper, we study the reasons behind this performance gap and
investigate how much high-level semantic content can be captured at different
abstraction levels. To this end, we introduce the Hierarchical Abstraction
Image Dataset (HAID), a novel data collection that comprises abstract images
generated from normal raster images at multiple levels of abstraction. We then
train and evaluate conventional vision systems on HAID across various tasks
including classification, segmentation, and object detection, providing a
comprehensive study between rasterised and abstract image representations. We
also discuss if the abstract image can be considered as a potentially effective
format for conveying visual semantic information and contributing to vision
tasks.

*Rongyu Zhang,Jiaming Liu,Xiaoqi Li,Xiaowei Chi,Dan Wang,Li Du,Yuan Du,Shanghang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework, BEVUDA++, to tackle domain adaptation challenges in multi-view 3D object detection for Bird's Eye View (BEV) perception in autonomous driving, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Domain shift in BEV perception significantly affects performance in cross-domain scenarios, and this paper seeks to address this overlooked issue.

Method: The paper introduces BEVUDA++, a geometric-aware teacher-student framework with components such as Reliable Depth Teacher (RDT), Geometric Consistent Student (GCS), and Uncertainty-guided Exponential Moving Average (UEMA).

Result: BEVUDA++ achieves state-of-the-art performance in cross-domain BEV 3D object detection tasks, improving metrics like NDS by 12.9% and mAP by 9.5% in Day-Night adaptation.

Conclusion: This work successfully mitigates domain shift challenges in BEV perception and lays the groundwork for future advancements in domain adaptation for 3D object detection.

Abstract: Vision-centric Bird's Eye View (BEV) perception holds considerable promise
for autonomous driving. Recent studies have prioritized efficiency or accuracy
enhancements, yet the issue of domain shift has been overlooked, leading to
substantial performance degradation upon transfer. We identify major domain
gaps in real-world cross-domain scenarios and initiate the first effort to
address the Domain Adaptation (DA) challenge in multi-view 3D object detection
for BEV perception. Given the complexity of BEV perception approaches with
their multiple components, domain shift accumulation across multi-geometric
spaces (e.g., 2D, 3D Voxel, BEV) poses a significant challenge for BEV domain
adaptation. In this paper, we introduce an innovative geometric-aware
teacher-student framework, BEVUDA++, to diminish this issue, comprising a
Reliable Depth Teacher (RDT) and a Geometric Consistent Student (GCS) model.
Specifically, RDT effectively blends target LiDAR with dependable depth
predictions to generate depth-aware information based on uncertainty
estimation, enhancing the extraction of Voxel and BEV features that are
essential for understanding the target domain. To collaboratively reduce the
domain shift, GCS maps features from multiple spaces into a unified geometric
embedding space, thereby narrowing the gap in data distribution between the two
domains. Additionally, we introduce a novel Uncertainty-guided Exponential
Moving Average (UEMA) to further reduce error accumulation due to domain shifts
informed by previously obtained uncertainty guidance. To demonstrate the
superiority of our proposed method, we execute comprehensive experiments in
four cross-domain scenarios, securing state-of-the-art performance in BEV 3D
object detection tasks, e.g., 12.9\% NDS and 9.5\% mAP enhancement on Day-Night
adaptation.

### [151] [Where Do Tokens Go? Understanding Pruning Behaviors in STEP at High Resolutions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14165)
*Michal Szczepanski,Martyna Poreba,Karim Haroun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces STEP, a framework to reduce computational costs in Vision Transformers (ViTs) for semantic segmentation by dynamically merging and pruning tokens, achieving improved efficiency with minor accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High computational and memory costs limit the practical deployment of Vision Transformers for tasks like semantic segmentation.

Method: STEP uses a dynamic framework combining token reduction via superpatch merging (via dCTS) and early pruning to lower the computational and memory demands of ViTs.

Result: The approach reduces token counts by up to 4x, computational complexity by 4x, and boosts inference speed by 1.7x with a minimal accuracy drop of up to 2%.

Conclusion: STEP effectively balances efficiency and accuracy trade-offs, making Vision Transformers more practical for high-resolution semantic segmentation tasks.

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) achieve state-of-the-art performance in semantic
segmentation but are hindered by high computational and memory costs. To
address this, we propose STEP (SuperToken and Early-Pruning), a hybrid
token-reduction framework that combines dynamic patch merging and token pruning
to enhance efficiency without significantly compromising accuracy. At the core
of STEP is dCTS, a lightweight CNN-based policy network that enables flexible
merging into superpatches. Encoder blocks integrate also early-exits to remove
high-confident supertokens, lowering computational load. We evaluate our method
on high-resolution semantic segmentation benchmarks, including images up to
1024 x 1024, and show that when dCTS is applied alone, the token count can be
reduced by a factor of 2.5 compared to the standard 16 x 16 pixel patching
scheme. This yields a 2.6x reduction in computational cost and a 3.4x increase
in throughput when using ViT-Large as the backbone. Applying the full STEP
framework further improves efficiency, reaching up to a 4x reduction in
computational complexity and a 1.7x gain in inference speed, with a maximum
accuracy drop of no more than 2.0%. With the proposed STEP configurations, up
to 40% of tokens can be confidently predicted and halted before reaching the
final encoder layer.

*Nisarg A. Shah,Amir Ziai,Chaitanya Ekanadham,Vishal M. Patel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces 'Cinéaste', a benchmark to evaluate deep narrative understanding of long-form movies, highlighting shortcomings in current vision-language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks fail to adequately measure fine-grained reasoning and deep narrative comprehension in long-form video understanding.

Method: The authors created a dataset of 3,119 question-answer pairs covering 200 movies, employing GPT-4o and a two-step filtering process to ensure context dependence and factual consistency.

Result: Experiments reveal that current models struggle with Cinéaste, achieving only 63.15% accuracy, particularly due to challenges in long-range temporal reasoning.

Conclusion: There is a significant gap in current model capabilities for fine-grained narrative understanding, necessitating further advancements in this domain.

Abstract: While recent advancements in vision-language models have improved video
understanding, diagnosing their capacity for deep, narrative comprehension
remains a challenge. Existing benchmarks often test short-clip recognition or
use template-based questions, leaving a critical gap in evaluating fine-grained
reasoning over long-form narrative content. To address these gaps, we introduce
$\mathsf{Cin\acute{e}aste}$, a comprehensive benchmark for long-form movie
understanding. Our dataset comprises 3,119 multiple-choice question-answer
pairs derived from 1,805 scenes across 200 diverse movies, spanning five novel
fine-grained contextual reasoning categories. We use GPT-4o to generate
diverse, context-rich questions by integrating visual descriptions, captions,
scene titles, and summaries, which require deep narrative understanding. To
ensure high-quality evaluation, our pipeline incorporates a two-stage filtering
process: Context-Independence filtering ensures questions require video
context, while Contextual Veracity filtering validates factual consistency
against the movie content, mitigating hallucinations. Experiments show that
existing MLLMs struggle on $\mathsf{Cin\acute{e}aste}$; our analysis reveals
that long-range temporal reasoning is a primary bottleneck, with the top
open-source model achieving only 63.15\% accuracy. This underscores significant
challenges in fine-grained contextual understanding and the need for
advancements in long-form movie comprehension.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the gap in evaluating text-to-image systems with rigorous multidisciplinary examination-style tasks.

Method: Designed a benchmark consisting of 1,000 samples across 10 subjects, organized under a four-level taxonomy with scoring criteria.

Result: State-of-the-art models achieved under 15% strict scores for semantic and visual correctness, highlighting challenges in this task.

Conclusion: GenExam provides a new framework to rigorously test and guide the progression toward general Artificial General Intelligence (AGI).

Abstract: Exams are a fundamental test of expert-level intelligence and require
integrated understanding, reasoning, and generation. Existing exam-style
benchmarks mainly focus on understanding and reasoning tasks, and current
generation benchmarks emphasize the illustration of world knowledge and visual
concepts, neglecting the evaluation of rigorous drawing exams. We introduce
GenExam, the first benchmark for multidisciplinary text-to-image exams,
featuring 1,000 samples across 10 subjects with exam-style prompts organized
under a four-level taxonomy. Each problem is equipped with ground-truth images
and fine-grained scoring points to enable a precise evaluation of semantic
correctness and visual plausibility. Experiments show that even
state-of-the-art models such as GPT-Image-1 and Gemini-2.5-Flash-Image achieve
less than 15% strict scores, and most models yield almost 0%, suggesting the
great challenge of our benchmark. By framing image generation as an exam,
GenExam offers a rigorous assessment of models' ability to integrate knowledge,
reasoning, and generation, providing insights on the path to general AGI.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: This paper proposes a Kubernetes-based architecture to reduce carbon emissions in cloud computing by scheduling tasks based on green energy availability, achieving up to 13% reduction in emissions under resource constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to address the increasing electricity consumption and CO2 emissions associated with the growing demand for cloud computing services.

Method: The authors designed a carbon intensity forecaster integrated into a Kubernetes-based system to schedule workloads considering regional and temporal green energy availability.

Result: Real-world cloud workload evaluations showed that this system reduced carbon emissions by up to 13% under stringent resource limitations.

Conclusion: The proposed architecture demonstrates the potential for significant environmental benefits by enabling user-centric scheduling for greener cloud computing practices.

Abstract: To meet the increasing demand for cloud computing services, the scale and
number of data centers keeps increasing worldwide. This growth comes at the
cost of increased electricity consumption, which directly correlates to CO2
emissions, the main driver of climate change. As such, researching ways to
reduce cloud computing emissions is more relevant than ever. However, although
cloud providers are reportedly already working near optimal power efficiency,
they fail in providing precise sustainability reporting. This calls for further
improvements on the cloud computing consumer's side. To this end, in this paper
we propose a user-centric, Kubernetes-based architecture for green cloud
computing. We implement a carbon intensity forecaster and we use it to schedule
workloads based on the availability of green energy, exploiting both regional
and temporal variations to minimize emissions. We evaluate our system using
real-world traces of cloud workloads execution comparing the achieved carbon
emission savings against a baseline round-robin scheduler. Our findings
indicate that our system can achieve up to a 13% reduction in emissions in a
strict scenario with heavy limitations on the available resources.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Supercomputers require robust testing for compiler-hardware compatibility and performance evaluation across multiple platforms, which motivated the design of a portable, efficient toolchain.

Method: The MFC toolchain automates tasks like input generation, benchmarking, regression testing, and batch job submission. Benchmarks are performed on multiple generations of GPUs and CPUs using different compilers.

Result: Through MFC benchmarking, insights were gained into device performance, compiler issues, and regressions across approximately 50 compute devices and 5 flagship supercomputers.

Conclusion: MFC proves to be an effective tool for comprehensive testing, identifying compiler bugs, and providing performance evaluations for supercomputing deployments.

Abstract: Deploying new supercomputers requires testing and evaluation via application
codes. Portable, user-friendly tools enable evaluation, and the Multicomponent
Flow Code (MFC), a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) code, addresses this
need. MFC is adorned with a toolchain that automates input generation,
compilation, batch job submission, regression testing, and benchmarking. The
toolchain design enables users to evaluate compiler-hardware combinations for
correctness and performance with limited software engineering experience. As
with other PDE solvers, wall time per spatially discretized grid point serves
as a figure of merit. We present MFC benchmarking results for five generations
of NVIDIA GPUs, three generations of AMD GPUs, and various CPU architectures,
utilizing Intel, Cray, NVIDIA, AMD, and GNU compilers. These tests have
revealed compiler bugs and regressions on recent machines such as Frontier and
El Capitan. MFC has benchmarked approximately 50 compute devices and 5 flagship

*Varsha Rao,Andrew A. Chien*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper assesses the carbon footprint of HPC systems using the Top 500 database and introduces the EasyC tool to estimate operational and embodied carbon emissions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of carbon reporting for High-Performance Computing (HPC) systems and the challenges posed by limited data availability in evaluating their carbon footprint.

Method: Leveraging publicly available data from the Top500.org database and employing the EasyC tool to model operational and embodied carbon emissions for HPC systems.

Result: Successfully modeled operational carbon emissions for 391 HPC systems and embodied carbon for 283 systems. Estimated the Top 500 HPC systems' carbon footprint at 1,393.7 million MT CO2e (operational) and 1,881.8 million MT CO2e (embodied).

Conclusion: The EasyC tool facilitates modeling and improving data coverage, enabling scalable carbon footprint estimation for HPC systems, with projections extending to 2030.

Abstract: Climate change is a critical concern for HPC systems, but GHG protocol
carbon-emission accounting methodologies are difficult for a single system, and
effectively infeasible for a collection of systems. As a result, there is no
HPC-wide carbon reporting, and even the largest HPC sites do not do GHG
protocol reporting.
  We assess the carbon footprint of HPC, focusing on the Top 500 systems. The
key challenge lies in modeling the carbon footprint with limited data
availability.
  With the disclosed Top500.org data, and using a new tool, EasyC, we were able
to model the operational carbon of 391 HPC systems and the embodied carbon of
283 HPC systems. We further show how this coverage can be enhanced by
exploiting additional public information. With improved coverage, then
interpolation is used to produce the first carbon footprint estimates of the
Top 500 HPC systems. They are 1,393.7 million MT CO2e operational carbon (1
Year) and 1,881.8 million MT CO2e embodied carbon. We also project how the Top
500's carbon footprint will increase through 2030.
  A key enabler is the EasyC tool which models carbon footprint with only a few
data metrics. We explore availability of data and enhancement, showing that
coverage can be increased to 98% of Top 500 systems for operational and 80.8%
of the systems for embodied emissions.

concepts in GPU/CPU hardware and parallel computing and progressed to develop
RAG and optimizing them using GPUs. Students gained experience provisioning and
configuring cloud-based GPU instances, implementing parallel algorithms, and
deploying scalable AI solutions. We evaluated learning outcomes through
assessments, course evaluations, and anonymous surveys. The results reveal that
(1) AWS served as an effective and economical platform for practical GPU
programming, (2) experiential learning significantly enhanced technical
proficiency and engagement, and (3) the course strengthened students'
problem-solving and critical thinking skills through tools such as TensorBoard
and HPC profilers, which exposed performance bottlenecks and scaling issues.
Our findings underscore the pedagogical value of integrating parallel computing
into STEM education. We advocate for broader adoption of similar electives
across STEM curricula to prepare students for the demands of modern,
compute-intensive fields.

*Renan Souza,Timothy Poteet,Brian Etz,Daniel Rosendo,Amal Gueroudji,Woong Shin,Prasanna Balaprakash,Rafael Ferreira da Silva*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: This paper introduces an evaluation methodology and architecture to enhance provenance data analysis with interactive LLM agents, enabling accurate natural language querying for scientific workflows.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The reliance on workflows across Edge, Cloud, and HPC in scientific discovery necessitates advanced data analysis methods for tasks like anomaly detection and reproducibility. Current approaches to provenance data analysis are restrictive and limit user interaction.

Method: The authors propose a metadata-driven design that transforms natural language queries into structured provenance data queries while utilizing interactive LLM agents. Modular design, prompt tuning, and RAG support accurate runtime analysis.

Result: The system demonstrated effective integration of LLMs like LLaMA, GPT, and others to answer diverse query types and analyze provenance data. It performed well even beyond recorded provenance using real-world benchmarks.

Conclusion: Interactive LLM agents, paired with a metadata-driven architecture, can significantly enhance runtime analysis of provenance data at scale, promoting deeper insights and interaction for scientific workflows.

Abstract: Modern scientific discovery increasingly relies on workflows that process
data across the Edge, Cloud, and High Performance Computing (HPC) continuum.
Comprehensive and in-depth analyses of these data are critical for hypothesis
validation, anomaly detection, reproducibility, and impactful findings.
Although workflow provenance techniques support such analyses, at large scale,
the provenance data become complex and difficult to analyze. Existing systems
depend on custom scripts, structured queries, or static dashboards, limiting
data interaction. In this work, we introduce an evaluation methodology,
reference architecture, and open-source implementation that leverages
interactive Large Language Model (LLM) agents for runtime data analysis. Our
approach uses a lightweight, metadata-driven design that translates natural
language into structured provenance queries. Evaluations across LLaMA, GPT,
Gemini, and Claude, covering diverse query classes and a real-world chemistry
workflow, show that modular design, prompt tuning, and Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) enable accurate and insightful LLM agent responses beyond
recorded provenance.

*Julian Evan Chrisnanto,Yulison Herry Chrisnanto,Ferry Faizal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces USPIL, a physics-informed deep learning framework for modeling ecological systems, successfully integrating conservation laws and neural networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of modeling complex, multi-scale ecological dynamics that involve spatiotemporal patterns and conservation principles.

Method: USPIL combines physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), conservation laws, automatic differentiation for constraint enforcement, and adaptive loss weighting for balancing data fidelity and physical consistency.

Result: USPIL demonstrated high modeling accuracy (98.9% correlation for 1D dynamics) and captured intricate patterns in 2D systems with computational speeds improved by 10-50x over numerical solvers.

Conclusion: USPIL is a scientifically rigorous tool for ecological forecasting, parameter discovery, and multi-scale modeling, with transformative implications for conservation and ecosystem studies.

Abstract: Ecological systems exhibit complex multi-scale dynamics that challenge
traditional modeling. New methods must capture temporal oscillations and
emergent spatiotemporal patterns while adhering to conservation principles. We
present the Unified Spatiotemporal Physics-Informed Learning (USPIL) framework,
a deep learning architecture integrating physics-informed neural networks
(PINNs) and conservation laws to model predator-prey dynamics across
dimensional scales. The framework provides a unified solution for both ordinary
(ODE) and partial (PDE) differential equation systems, describing temporal
cycles and reaction-diffusion patterns within a single neural network
architecture. Our methodology uses automatic differentiation to enforce physics
constraints and adaptive loss weighting to balance data fidelity with physical
consistency. Applied to the Lotka-Volterra system, USPIL achieves 98.9%
correlation for 1D temporal dynamics (loss: 0.0219, MAE: 0.0184) and captures
complex spiral waves in 2D systems (loss: 4.7656, pattern correlation: 0.94).
Validation confirms conservation law adherence within 0.5% and shows a 10-50x
computational speedup for inference compared to numerical solvers. USPIL also
enables mechanistic understanding through interpretable physics constraints,
facilitating parameter discovery and sensitivity analysis not possible with
purely data-driven methods. Its ability to transition between dimensional
formulations opens new avenues for multi-scale ecological modeling. These
capabilities make USPIL a transformative tool for ecological forecasting,
conservation planning, and understanding ecosystem resilience, establishing
physics-informed deep learning as a powerful and scientifically rigorous
paradigm.

Conclusion: The paper offers practical advice for balancing performance and sustainability by considering optimizer trade-offs during training decisions in AI workflows.

Abstract: As machine learning models grow increasingly complex and computationally
demanding, understanding the environmental impact of training decisions becomes
critical for sustainable AI development. This paper presents a comprehensive
empirical study investigating the relationship between optimizer choice and
energy efficiency in neural network training. We conducted 360 controlled
experiments across three benchmark datasets (MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100) using
eight popular optimizers (SGD, Adam, AdamW, RMSprop, Adagrad, Adadelta, Adamax,
NAdam) with 15 random seeds each. Using CodeCarbon for precise energy tracking
on Apple M1 Pro hardware, we measured training duration, peak memory usage,
carbon dioxide emissions, and final model performance. Our findings reveal
substantial trade-offs between training speed, accuracy, and environmental
impact that vary across datasets and model complexity. We identify AdamW and
NAdam as consistently efficient choices, while SGD demonstrates superior
performance on complex datasets despite higher emissions. These results provide
actionable insights for practitioners seeking to balance performance and
sustainability in machine learning workflows.

### [161] [Learning Nonlinear Responses in PET Bottle Buckling with a Hybrid DeepONet-Transolver Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13520)
*Varun Kumar,Jing Bi,Cyril Ngo Ngoc,Victor Oancea,George Em Karniadakis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents a hybrid DeepONet-Transolver framework for solving PDE problems, specifically for PET bottle buckling analysis, achieving impressive accuracy with significantly reduced computation time compared to traditional FEA methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional finite element analysis (FEA) for analyzing PET bottle buckling is computationally expensive and does not efficiently generalize across varying geometric domains. This paper aims to address these limitations by introducing a scalable and efficient neural network-based surrogate model.

Method: The authors develop a hybrid DeepONet-Transolver framework to predict nodal displacement fields and the time evolution of reaction forces during compression. Training data is derived from FEA simulations for 254 unique PET bottle designs for each of two geometric parameter families.

Result: The framework achieves mean relative $L^{2}$ errors of 2.5-13% for displacement fields and 2.4% for time-dependent reaction forces in the four-parameter design family. Errors in displacement are on the order of $10^{-4}$-$10^{-3}$, with localized discrepancies and accurate buckling behavior representation.

Conclusion: The proposed framework demonstrates potential as a computationally efficient surrogate for PET bottle design evaluations, offering rapid and accurate predictions for multi-task problems in computational mechanics.

Abstract: Neural surrogates and operator networks for solving partial differential
equation (PDE) problems have attracted significant research interest in recent
years. However, most existing approaches are limited in their ability to
generalize solutions across varying non-parametric geometric domains. In this
work, we address this challenge in the context of Polyethylene Terephthalate
(PET) bottle buckling analysis, a representative packaging design problem
conventionally solved using computationally expensive finite element analysis
(FEA). We introduce a hybrid DeepONet-Transolver framework that simultaneously
predicts nodal displacement fields and the time evolution of reaction forces
during top load compression. Our methodology is evaluated on two families of
bottle geometries parameterized by two and four design variables. Training data
is generated using nonlinear FEA simulations in Abaqus for 254 unique designs
per family. The proposed framework achieves mean relative $L^{2}$ errors of
2.5-13% for displacement fields and approximately 2.4% for time-dependent
reaction forces for the four-parameter bottle family. Point-wise error analyses
further show absolute displacement errors on the order of $10^{-4}$-$10^{-3}$,
with the largest discrepancies confined to localized geometric regions.
Importantly, the model accurately captures key physical phenomena, such as
buckling behavior, across diverse bottle geometries. These results highlight
the potential of our framework as a scalable and computationally efficient
surrogate, particularly for multi-task predictions in computational mechanics
and applications requiring rapid design evaluation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenges of scaling diffusion-based methods stably at high resolutions for improving ensemble calibration in weather forecasting.

Method: Developed AERIS, a Swin diffusion transformer with up to 80B parameters, and SWiPe, a parallelism technique for efficient computation without added communication costs.

Result: AERIS achieved 10.21 ExaFLOPS sustained performance, 95.5% weak scaling efficiency, and strong scaling efficiency of 81.6% while outperforming traditional methods like IFS ENS.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates the promise of billion-parameter diffusion models in improving stability and accuracy for weather and climate prediction over extended periods.

Abstract: Generative machine learning offers new opportunities to better understand
complex Earth system dynamics. Recent diffusion-based methods address spectral
biases and improve ensemble calibration in weather forecasting compared to
deterministic methods, yet have so far proven difficult to scale stably at high
resolutions. We introduce AERIS, a 1.3 to 80B parameter pixel-level Swin
diffusion transformer to address this gap, and SWiPe, a generalizable technique
that composes window parallelism with sequence and pipeline parallelism to
shard window-based transformers without added communication cost or increased
global batch size. On Aurora (10,080 nodes), AERIS sustains 10.21 ExaFLOPS
(mixed precision) and a peak performance of 11.21 ExaFLOPS with $1 \times 1$
patch size on the 0.25{\deg} ERA5 dataset, achieving 95.5% weak scaling
efficiency, and 81.6% strong scaling efficiency. AERIS outperforms the IFS ENS
and remains stable on seasonal scales to 90 days, highlighting the potential of
billion-parameter diffusion models for weather and climate prediction.

*Florian Wiesner,Matthias Wessling,Stephen Baek*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces the General Physics Transformer (GPhyT), a single model capable of simulating diverse physical dynamics, showcasing foundation model capabilities in physics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Physics modeling is limited by tools that require domain-specific designs and retraining for each new system, creating inefficiencies in scientific discovery. A universal Physics Foundation Model could democratize simulations and accelerate progress.

Method: The authors use transformer architecture trained on 1.8 TB of varied simulation data to infer governing physics dynamics through context, enabling multi-domain applications without predefined equations.

Result: GPhyT outperforms specialized architectures by up to 29x, demonstrates zero-shot generalization across unseen physical systems using context, and provides stable predictions for long-term rollouts up to 50 timesteps.

Conclusion: This research proves that a single model can capture generalizable physical principles exclusively from data, paving the way toward a universal Physics Foundation Model that revolutionizes computational science and engineering.

Abstract: Foundation models have revolutionized natural language processing through a
``train once, deploy anywhere'' paradigm, where a single pre-trained model
adapts to countless downstream tasks without retraining. Access to a Physics
Foundation Model (PFM) would be transformative -- democratizing access to
high-fidelity simulations, accelerating scientific discovery, and eliminating
the need for specialized solver development. Yet current physics-aware machine
learning approaches remain fundamentally limited to single, narrow domains and
require retraining for each new system. We present the General Physics
Transformer (GPhyT), trained on 1.8 TB of diverse simulation data, that
demonstrates foundation model capabilities are achievable for physics. Our key
insight is that transformers can learn to infer governing dynamics from
context, enabling a single model to simulate fluid-solid interactions, shock
waves, thermal convection, and multi-phase dynamics without being told the
underlying equations. GPhyT achieves three critical breakthroughs: (1) superior
performance across multiple physics domains, outperforming specialized
architectures by up to 29x, (2) zero-shot generalization to entirely unseen
physical systems through in-context learning, and (3) stable long-term
predictions through 50-timestep rollouts. By establishing that a single model
can learn generalizable physical principles from data alone, this work opens
the path toward a universal PFM that could transform computational science and
engineering.

TL;DR: The paper introduces LAMeL, a meta-learning algorithm that enhances predictability and interpretability for chemical property predictions, addressing challenges in limited datasets and explainable AI.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges in the chemical sciences due to limited high-quality datasets and the growing need for explainable AI methods in prediction tasks.

Method: Proposes LAMeL, a Linear Algorithm for Meta-Learning that identifies shared model parameters across tasks to learn a functional manifold, enhancing prediction accuracy and interpretability.

Result: LAMeL shows performance improvements up to 25-fold over ridge regression, consistently outperforming traditional linear methods across diverse datasets.

Conclusion: LAMeL is a robust and interpretative meta-learning framework for predictive tasks in chemical sciences, effectively balancing accuracy and human comprehension across multiple domains.

Abstract: Chemists in search of structure-property relationships face great challenges
due to limited high quality, concordant datasets. Machine learning (ML) has
significantly advanced predictive capabilities in chemical sciences, but these
modern data-driven approaches have increased the demand for data. In response
to the growing demand for explainable AI (XAI) and to bridge the gap between
predictive accuracy and human comprehensibility, we introduce LAMeL - a Linear
Algorithm for Meta-Learning that preserves interpretability while improving the
prediction accuracy across multiple properties. While most approaches treat
each chemical prediction task in isolation, LAMeL leverages a meta-learning
framework to identify shared model parameters across related tasks, even if
those tasks do not share data, allowing it to learn a common functional
manifold that serves as a more informed starting point for new unseen tasks.
Our method delivers performance improvements ranging from 1.1- to 25-fold over
standard ridge regression, depending on the domain of the dataset. While the
degree of performance enhancement varies across tasks, LAMeL consistently
outperforms or matches traditional linear methods, making it a reliable tool
for chemical property prediction where both accuracy and interpretability are
critical.

*Niruthiha Selvanayagam,Ted Kurti*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper analyzes OpenAI's GPT-4o mini model's ability to detect multimodal hate speech and identifies a 'Unimodal Bottleneck,' a safety flaw that limits its effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and improve the safety architectures of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) while addressing challenges in multimodal hate speech detection.

Method: Authors used the Hateful Memes Challenge dataset to analyze the reasoning and failure modes of GPT-4o mini on 500 samples and conducted a quantitative validation of the system's content policy refusals.

Result: Identified a 'Unimodal Bottleneck' in the model's architecture, where safety filters systematically override advanced reasoning. The model had equal content refusals due to unimodal visual content (50%) and textual content (50%), leading to false positives.

Conclusion: Current safety systems in LMMs, such as GPT-4o mini's, need more context-aware alignment to balance capability and safety effectively in real-world deployment scenarios.

Abstract: As Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) become integral to daily digital life,
understanding their safety architectures is a critical problem for AI
Alignment. This paper presents a systematic analysis of OpenAI's GPT-4o mini, a
globally deployed model, on the difficult task of multimodal hate speech
detection. Using the Hateful Memes Challenge dataset, we conduct a multi-phase
investigation on 500 samples to probe the model's reasoning and failure modes.
Our central finding is the experimental identification of a "Unimodal
Bottleneck," an architectural flaw where the model's advanced multimodal
reasoning is systematically preempted by context-blind safety filters. A
quantitative validation of 144 content policy refusals reveals that these
overrides are triggered in equal measure by unimodal visual 50% and textual 50%
content. We further demonstrate that this safety system is brittle, blocking
not only high-risk imagery but also benign, common meme formats, leading to
predictable false positives. These findings expose a fundamental tension
between capability and safety in state-of-the-art LMMs, highlighting the need
for more integrated, context-aware alignment strategies to ensure AI systems
can be deployed both safely and effectively.

Motivation: Streamline fault analysis in ALS using real-time event logs and enable rapid detection of system issues.

Method: Logs are transformed into contextual vector representations via semantic embeddings, and analyzed using a sequence-aware neural network to compute anomaly scores.

Conclusion: The framework enhances ALS failure identification efficiency by leveraging NLP techniques and neural networks.

Abstract: This paper introduces an automated fault analysis framework for the Advanced
Light Source (ALS) that processes real-time event logs from its EPICS control
system. By treating log entries as natural language, we transform them into
contextual vector representations using semantic embedding techniques. A
sequence-aware neural network, trained on normal operational data, assigns a
real-time anomaly score to each event. This method flags deviations from

*Benjamin Sterling,Yousef El-Laham,Mónica F. Bugallo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper explores a strategy to defend diffusion models against membership inference attacks using higher-order Langevin dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generative AI, particularly diffusion models, faces risks from membership inference attacks, which expose data points used during training.

Method: The method introduces critically-damped higher-order Langevin dynamics to mix auxiliary variables, corrupting sensitive inputs early in the diffusion process.

Result: The approach was theoretically analyzed and validated on a toy and speech dataset, assessed via AUROC and FID metrics.

Conclusion: Using auxiliary variables through advanced Langevin dynamics adds randomness, enhancing the model's resistance to membership inference attacks.

Abstract: Recent advances in generative artificial intelligence applications have
raised new data security concerns. This paper focuses on defending diffusion
models against membership inference attacks. This type of attack occurs when
the attacker can determine if a certain data point was used to train the model.
Although diffusion models are intrinsically more resistant to membership
inference attacks than other generative models, they are still susceptible. The
defense proposed here utilizes critically-damped higher-order Langevin
dynamics, which introduces several auxiliary variables and a joint diffusion
process along these variables. The idea is that the presence of auxiliary
variables mixes external randomness that helps to corrupt sensitive input data
earlier on in the diffusion process. This concept is theoretically investigated
and validated on a toy dataset and a speech dataset using the Area Under the
Receiver Operating Characteristic (AUROC) curves and the FID metric.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method for generating private synthetic text with differential privacy guarantees, ensuring security without model fine-tuning, and enhancing utility via blending private and public inferences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the privacy risks posed by large language models in terms of sensitive information leakage while maintaining high utility in text generation.

Method: A private prediction framework leveraging Differential Privacy (DP) to limit information leakage, using token-wise output aggregation and blending private/public inferences to enhance performance.

Result: The method outperformed state-of-the-art techniques on in-context learning tasks, combining strong privacy guarantees with high utility.

Conclusion: The approach provides a practical, effective solution for privacy-preserving text generation that balances theoretical security with empirical performance.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have significantly transformed natural language
understanding and generation, but they raise privacy concerns due to potential
exposure of sensitive information. Studies have highlighted the risk of
information leakage, where adversaries can extract sensitive information
embedded in the prompts. In this work, we introduce a novel private prediction
framework for generating high-quality synthetic text with strong privacy
guarantees. Our approach leverages the Differential Privacy (DP) framework to
ensure worst-case theoretical bounds on information leakage without requiring
any fine-tuning of the underlying models.The proposed method performs inference
on private records and aggregates the resulting per-token output distributions.
This enables the generation of longer and coherent synthetic text while
maintaining privacy guarantees. Additionally, we propose a simple blending
operation that combines private and public inference to further enhance
utility. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our approach outperforms
previous state-of-the-art methods on in-context-learning (ICL) tasks, making it
a promising direction for privacy-preserving text generation while maintaining
high utility.

*Zihou Wu,Yuecheng Li,Tianchi Liao,Jian Lou,Chuan Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Federated learning often struggles with balancing privacy, efficiency, and utility. ParaAegis introduces a new framework combining Differential Privacy (DP) and Homomorphic Encryption (HE) with strategic model partitioning to resolve this issue.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to overcome the rigid trade-offs in federated learning protection mechanisms, where existing approaches compromise either computational efficiency or model utility, limiting real-world applicability.

Method: The authors propose ParaAegis, a framework that strategically partitions the model, applying lightweight DP to less critical parts and HE to the rest. A distributed voting mechanism is used to achieve consensus on the partitioning strategy.

Result: Theoretical evaluations confirm that ParaAegis can balance efficiency and utility for a consistent level of privacy. Experimental data shows that varying hyperparameters allows practitioners to prioritize model accuracy or training speed as needed.

Conclusion: ParaAegis offers a flexible and tunable approach for federated learning, enabling better trade-offs between privacy, utility, and efficiency to facilitate practical implementation.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) faces a critical dilemma: existing protection
mechanisms like differential privacy (DP) and homomorphic encryption (HE)
enforce a rigid trade-off, forcing a choice between model utility and
computational efficiency. This lack of flexibility hinders the practical
implementation. To address this, we introduce ParaAegis, a parallel protection
framework designed to give practitioners flexible control over the
privacy-utility-efficiency balance. Our core innovation is a strategic model
partitioning scheme. By applying lightweight DP to the less critical, low norm
portion of the model while protecting the remainder with HE, we create a
tunable system. A distributed voting mechanism ensures consensus on this
partitioning. Theoretical analysis confirms the adjustments between efficiency
and utility with the same privacy. Crucially, the experimental results
demonstrate that by adjusting the hyperparameters, our method enables flexible
prioritization between model accuracy and training time.

TL;DR: The paper proposes DeepLogit models for transport policy analysis, which combine interpretability of discrete choice models with the accuracy of deep learning architectures, tested using Singapore transit data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models are highly predictive but lack interpretability, posing challenges for their application in planning and policy areas.

Method: A sequential approach is proposed, starting with interpretable linear CNNs and progressively adding complex features while constraining key parameters for interpretability.

Result: The DeepLogit models demonstrate superior predictive power compared to theory-based discrete choice models, validated using transit route choice data.

Conclusion: This hybrid approach bridges the gap between theory-driven and AI-driven models, offering improved modeling accuracy and interpretability for applications in transport planning and policy areas.

Abstract: Despite the significant progress of deep learning models in multitude of
applications, their adaption in planning and policy related areas remains
challenging due to the black-box nature of these models. In this work, we
develop a set of DeepLogit models that follow a novel sequentially constrained
approach in estimating deep learning models for transport policy analysis. In
the first step of the proposed approach, we estimate a convolutional neural
network (CNN) model with only linear terms, which is equivalent of a
linear-in-parameter multinomial logit model. We then estimate other deep
learning models by constraining the parameters that need interpretability at
the values obtained in the linear-in-parameter CNN model and including higher
order terms or by introducing advanced deep learning architectures like
Transformers. Our approach can retain the interpretability of the selected
parameters, yet provides significantly improved model accuracy than the
discrete choice model. We demonstrate our approach on a transit route choice
example using real-world transit smart card data from Singapore. This study
shows the potential for a unifying approach, where theory-based discrete choice
model (DCM) and data-driven AI models can leverage each other's strengths in
interpretability and predictive power. With the availability of larger datasets
and more complex constructions, such approach can lead to more accurate models
using discrete choice models while maintaining its applicability in planning
and policy-related areas. Our code is available on

Conclusion: This framework offers a promising solution for next-generation, intelligent, UAV-based federated learning networks by addressing energy, efficiency, and security issues effectively.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has gained popularity as a privacy-preserving method
of training machine learning models on decentralized networks. However to
ensure reliable operation of UAV-assisted FL systems, issues like as excessive

management, we introduce a dynamic allocation strategy that adjusts UAV flight
paths, transmission power, and processing rates based on network conditions.
Using block coordinate descent and convex optimization techniques, our method
significantly reduces system energy consumption by up to 29.6% compared to
conventional FL approaches. Simulation results demonstrate improved learning
performance, security, and scalability, positioning this framework as a

### [173] [Adaptive Client Selection via Q-Learning-based Whittle Index in Wireless Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13933)
*Qiyue Li,Yingxin Liu,Hang Qi,Jieping Luo,Zhizhang Liu,Jingjin Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper tackles the challenge of selecting clients in wireless Federated Learning (FL) based on dynamic states, proposing an efficient and scalable Q-learning-based solution for better learning efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiency in client selection for wireless FL by considering dynamic, state-dependent computation and communication constraints.

Method: The authors introduce WILF-Q, a Q-learning-based method to approximate clients' Whittle indices, enabling adaptive client selection without explicit knowledge of state transitions or data distributions.

Result: Experiments show WILF-Q significantly improves learning efficiency compared to existing baseline approaches.

Conclusion: WILF-Q offers a robust solution to optimize client selection in real-world wireless FL scenarios, reducing computation time while maintaining high accuracy.

Abstract: We consider the client selection problem in wireless Federated Learning (FL),
with the objective of reducing the total required time to achieve a certain
level of learning accuracy. Since the server cannot observe the clients'
dynamic states that can change their computation and communication efficiency,
we formulate client selection as a restless multi-armed bandit problem. We
propose a scalable and efficient approach called the Whittle Index Learning in
Federated Q-learning (WILF-Q), which uses Q-learning to adaptively learn and
update an approximated Whittle index associated with each client, and then
selects the clients with the highest indices. Compared to existing approaches,
WILF-Q does not require explicit knowledge of client state transitions or data
distributions, making it well-suited for deployment in practical FL settings.
Experiment results demonstrate that WILF-Q significantly outperforms existing
baseline policies in terms of learning efficiency, providing a robust and
efficient approach to client selection in wireless FL.

*Yasin Hasanpoor,Bahram Tarvirdizadeh,Khalil Alipour,Mohammad Ghamari*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study proposes a method to turn multimodal physiological signals into 2D image matrices, enabling CNN-based stress detection with improved accuracy and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for stress detection and analysis of multimodal physiological signals are limited in capturing temporal and cross-signal dependencies.

Method: The paper combines multimodal physiological signals into structured 2D image representations and uses CNNs to process these augmented inputs. A multi-stage training pipeline is applied to enhance model robustness.

Result: The approach significantly improves classification performance and generalization in stress detection.

Conclusion: This novel signal-to-image transformation method enhances stress detection robustness and is broadly applicable to health monitoring domains relying on multimodal signals.

Abstract: This study introduces a novel method that transforms multimodal physiological
signalsphotoplethysmography (PPG), galvanic skin response (GSR), and
acceleration (ACC) into 2D image matrices to enhance stress detection using
convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Unlike traditional approaches that
process these signals separately or rely on fixed encodings, our technique
fuses them into structured image representations that enable CNNs to capture
temporal and cross signal dependencies more effectively. This image based
transformation not only improves interpretability but also serves as a robust
form of data augmentation. To further enhance generalization and model
robustness, we systematically reorganize the fused signals into multiple
formats, combining them in a multi stage training pipeline. This approach
significantly boosts classification performance. While demonstrated here in the
context of stress detection, the proposed method is broadly applicable to any
domain involving multimodal physiological signals, paving the way for more
accurate, personalized, and real time health monitoring through wearable
technologies.

*Zirun Guo,Feng Zhang,Kai Jia,Tao Jin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LLM-Interleaved (LLM-I) is a framework using a central language model to coordinate diverse visual tools for interleaved image-text generation, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of "one-tool" unified models incapable of handling tasks like factual grounding and programmatic precision.

Method: The framework employs a central LLM or MLLM agent trained via Reinforcement Learning to orchestrate diverse visual tools like image search and editing.

Result: LLM-I achieved state-of-the-art performance by outperforming existing methods on four benchmarks after being trained with diverse datasets.

Conclusion: LLM-I is a powerful and versatile framework for interleaved image-text tasks, significantly surpassing current methods in performance metrics.

Abstract: We propose LLM-Interleaved (LLM-I), a flexible and dynamic framework that
reframes interleaved image-text generation as a tool-use problem. LLM-I is
designed to overcome the "one-tool" bottleneck of current unified models, which
are limited to synthetic imagery and struggle with tasks requiring factual
grounding or programmatic precision. Our framework empowers a central LLM or
MLLM agent to intelligently orchestrate a diverse toolkit of specialized visual
tools, including online image search, diffusion-based generation, code
execution, and image editing. The agent is trained to select and apply these
tools proficiently via a Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework that features a
hybrid reward system combining rule-based logic with judgments from LLM and
MLLM evaluators. Trained on a diverse new dataset using four different model
backbones, LLM-I demonstrates state-of-the-art performance, outperforming
existing methods by a large margin across four benchmarks. We also introduce a
novel test-time scaling strategy that provides further performance gains.

### [176] [Sequential Data Augmentation for Generative Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13648)
*Geon Lee,Bhuvesh Kumar,Clark Mingxuan Ju,Tong Zhao,Kijung Shin,Neil Shah,Liam Collins*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses the overlooked importance of data augmentation in training generative recommendation models. It introduces GenPAS, a structured framework for augmentation, improving model accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current generative recommendation systems lack a systematic approach to data augmentation, which significantly impacts their performance and generalizability.

Method: The paper presents GenPAS, a framework that models data augmentation as a stochastic sampling process with three bias-controlled components: sequence sampling, target sampling, and input sampling.

Result: Experimental results over benchmark and industrial datasets show that GenPAS improves accuracy, data efficiency, and parameter efficiency compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: GenPAS provides a principled and unified approach to data augmentation, delivering practical advancements in generative recommendation models by optimizing training data construction.

Abstract: Generative recommendation plays a crucial role in personalized systems,
predicting users' future interactions from their historical behavior sequences.
A critical yet underexplored factor in training these models is data
augmentation, the process of constructing training data from user interaction
histories. By shaping the training distribution, data augmentation directly and
often substantially affects model generalization and performance. Nevertheless,
in much of the existing work, this process is simplified, applied
inconsistently, or treated as a minor design choice, without a systematic and
principled understanding of its effects.
  Motivated by our empirical finding that different augmentation strategies can
yield large performance disparities, we conduct an in-depth analysis of how
they reshape training distributions and influence alignment with future targets
and generalization to unseen inputs. To systematize this design space, we
propose GenPAS, a generalized and principled framework that models augmentation
as a stochastic sampling process over input-target pairs with three
bias-controlled steps: sequence sampling, target sampling, and input sampling.
This formulation unifies widely used strategies as special cases and enables
flexible control of the resulting training distribution. Our extensive
experiments on benchmark and industrial datasets demonstrate that GenPAS yields
superior accuracy, data efficiency, and parameter efficiency compared to
existing strategies, providing practical guidance for principled training data
construction in generative recommendation.

### [177] [Controllable Pareto Trade-off between Fairness and Accuracy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13651)
*Yongkang Du,Jieyu Zhao,Yijun Yang,Tianyi Zhou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Controllable Pareto Trade-off (CPT) method to better balance fairness and accuracy in NLP tasks through multi-objective optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches inadequately consider the diverse solutions along the Pareto front when balancing fairness and accuracy in NLP tasks.

Method: The proposed CPT method stabilizes fairness updates using a moving average of gradients and prunes gradients to retain only critical parameters, enabling finer control over trade-offs.

Result: Experiments on hate speech detection and occupation classification show CPT yields higher-quality solutions on the Pareto front and achieves precise trade-off control based on user preferences.

Conclusion: CPT enhances both the quality and controllability of trade-off solutions, surpassing baseline methods in fairness and accuracy adjustments on NLP tasks.

Abstract: The fairness-accuracy trade-off is a key challenge in NLP tasks. Current work
focuses on finding a single "optimal" solution to balance the two objectives,
which is limited considering the diverse solutions on the Pareto front. This
work intends to provide controllable trade-offs according to the user's
preference of the two objectives, which is defined as a reference vector. To
achieve this goal, we apply multi-objective optimization (MOO), which can find
solutions from various regions of the Pareto front. However, it is challenging
to precisely control the trade-off due to the stochasticity of the training
process and the high dimentional gradient vectors. Thus, we propose
Controllable Pareto Trade-off (CPT) that can effectively train models to
perform different trade-offs according to users' preferences. CPT 1) stabilizes
the fairness update with a moving average of stochastic gradients to determine
the update direction, and 2) prunes the gradients by only keeping the gradients
of the critical parameters. We evaluate CPT on hate speech detection and
occupation classification tasks. Experiments show that CPT can achieve a
higher-quality set of solutions on the Pareto front than the baseline methods.
It also exhibits better controllability and can precisely follow the
human-defined reference vectors.

### [178] [RF-LSCM: Pushing Radiance Fields to Multi-Domain Localized Statistical Channel Modeling for Cellular Network Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13686)
*Bingsheng Peng,Shutao Zhang,Xi Zheng,Ye Xue,Xinyu Qin,Tsung-Hui Chang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces RF-LSCM, an improved framework for wireless channel modeling, which offers better accuracy and efficiency in cellular network optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in traditional LSCM methods, specifically their inability to handle multi-cell, multi-grid, and multi-frequency scenarios, and to better capture cross-domain interactions in channel modeling.

Method: RF-LSCM develops a novel representation of the channel APS using a radiance field, incorporates a frequency-dependent Attenuation Model (FDAM) for cross-frequency generalization, and employs a point-cloud-aided method for multi-cell and multi-grid modeling. Additionally, computational efficiency is achieved using low-rank tensor representation and the Hierarchical Tensor Angular Modeling (HiTAM) algorithm.

Result: RF-LSCM achieves up to 30% reduction in mean absolute error (MAE) for network coverage prediction and a 22% MAE improvement via multi-frequency data fusion in experiments with real-world multi-cell datasets.

Conclusion: RF-LSCM significantly improves the accuracy and efficiency of LSCM, overcoming previous models' limitations and enhancing cellular network optimization.

Abstract: Accurate localized wireless channel modeling is a cornerstone of cellular
network optimization, enabling reliable prediction of network performance
during parameter tuning. Localized statistical channel modeling (LSCM) is the
state-of-the-art channel modeling framework tailored for cellular network
optimization. However, traditional LSCM methods, which infer the channel's
Angular Power Spectrum (APS) from Reference Signal Received Power (RSRP)
measurements, suffer from critical limitations: they are typically confined to
single-cell, single-grid and single-carrier frequency analysis and fail to
capture complex cross-domain interactions. To overcome these challenges, we
propose RF-LSCM, a novel framework that models the channel APS by jointly
representing large-scale signal attenuation and multipath components within a
radiance field. RF-LSCM introduces a multi-domain LSCM formulation with a
physics-informed frequency-dependent Attenuation Model (FDAM) to facilitate the
cross frequency generalization as well as a point-cloud-aided environment
enhanced method to enable multi-cell and multi-grid channel modeling.
Furthermore, to address the computational inefficiency of typical neural
radiance fields, RF-LSCM leverages a low-rank tensor representation,
complemented by a novel Hierarchical Tensor Angular Modeling (HiTAM) algorithm.
This efficient design significantly reduces GPU memory requirements and
training time while preserving fine-grained accuracy. Extensive experiments on
real-world multi-cell datasets demonstrate that RF-LSCM significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving up to a 30% reduction in mean
absolute error (MAE) for coverage prediction and a 22% MAE improvement by
effectively fusing multi-frequency data.

*Yifan Yu,Cheuk Hin Ho,Yangshuai Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a distribution-free conformal prediction framework to provide rigorous uncertainty quantification (UQ) for Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing uncertainty quantification methods for PINNs lack rigorous statistical guarantees. Therefore, there is a need for a framework to ensure more reliable and theoretically sound UQ in PINN-based PDE solutions.

Method: The authors propose a distribution-free conformal prediction framework that constructs nonconformity scores on a calibration dataset to achieve finite-sample coverage guarantees. Spatial heteroskedasticity is addressed using local conformal quantile estimation for spatially adaptive uncertainty bands.

Result: The framework is systematically evaluated on various Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) and uncovers reliable calibration and locally adaptive uncertainty intervals. It consistently outperforms existing heuristic-based UQ methods.

Conclusion: This framework enhances the reliability of PINNs by introducing rigorous and distribution-free uncertainty quantification. It serves as a general tool for uncertainty-aware modeling in complex systems governed by PDEs.

Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have emerged as a powerful framework
for solving PDEs, yet existing uncertainty quantification (UQ) approaches for
PINNs generally lack rigorous statistical guarantees. In this work, we bridge
this gap by introducing a distribution-free conformal prediction (CP) framework
for UQ in PINNs. This framework calibrates prediction intervals by constructing
nonconformity scores on a calibration set, thereby yielding distribution-free
uncertainty estimates with rigorous finite-sample coverage guarantees for
PINNs. To handle spatial heteroskedasticity, we further introduce local
conformal quantile estimation, enabling spatially adaptive uncertainty bands
while preserving theoretical guarantee. Through systematic evaluations on
typical PDEs (damped harmonic oscillator, Poisson, Allen-Cahn, and Helmholtz
equations) and comprehensive testing across multiple uncertainty metrics, our
results demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves reliable calibration
and locally adaptive uncertainty intervals, consistently outperforming
heuristic UQ approaches. By bridging PINNs with distribution-free UQ, this work
introduces a general framework that not only enhances calibration and
reliability, but also opens new avenues for uncertainty-aware modeling of
complex PDE systems.

*Md Sabbir Ahmed,Noah French,Mark Rucker,Zhiyuan Wang,Taylor Myers-Brower,Kaitlyn Petz,Mehdi Boukhechba,Bethany A. Teachman,Laura E. Barnes*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study focuses on capturing real-time intra-day dynamics of state anxiety among socially anxious college students using smartwatch-based monitoring and predictive modeling, achieving promising results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Social anxiety affects various aspects of functioning and is characterized by fluctuating state anxiety in social situations. Monitoring these fluctuations is essential for personalized interventions like Just-In-Time Adaptive Interventions (JITAIs).

Method: The authors conducted a study with 72 socially anxious college students, collecting smartwatch heart rate data over 9 days, alongside ecological momentary assessments (EMAs). A predictive model was developed using transferred representations from external datasets and integrated trait-level measures.

Result: The combined pipeline achieved 60.4% balanced accuracy in state anxiety detection in the study dataset and 59.1% balanced accuracy on a separate hold-out dataset, outperforming prior work by at least 7%.

Conclusion: This approach demonstrates the feasibility of using wearable devices and advanced modeling to monitor and predict state anxiety, opening pathways for real-time interventions in socially anxious individuals.

Abstract: Social anxiety is a common mental health condition linked to significant
challenges in academic, social, and occupational functioning. A core feature is
elevated momentary (state) anxiety in social situations, yet little prior work
has measured or predicted fluctuations in this anxiety throughout the day.
Capturing these intra-day dynamics is critical for designing real-time,
personalized interventions such as Just-In-Time Adaptive Interventions
(JITAIs). To address this gap, we conducted a study with socially anxious
college students (N=91; 72 after exclusions) using our custom smartwatch-based
system over an average of 9.03 days (SD = 2.95). Participants received seven
ecological momentary assessments (EMAs) per day to report state anxiety. We
developed a base model on over 10,000 days of external heart rate data,
transferred its representations to our dataset, and fine-tuned it to generate
probabilistic predictions. These were combined with trait-level measures in a
meta-learner. Our pipeline achieved 60.4% balanced accuracy in state anxiety
detection in our dataset. To evaluate generalizability, we applied the training
approach to a separate hold-out set from the TILES-18 dataset-the same dataset
used for pretraining. On 10,095 once-daily EMAs, our method achieved 59.1%
balanced accuracy, outperforming prior work by at least 7%.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DirGraphSSM is introduced as a novel directed graph neural network using state space models, achieving state-of-the-art results and faster training on multiple directed graph tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for directed graphs face challenges in capturing causal dependencies and efficiency. There’s a gap as state space models have proven effective in undirected graphs but not yet leveraged for directed graph learning.

Method: The authors sequentialize directed graphs using k-hop ego graphs and build DirGraphSSM to implement state space models through a message-passing mechanism tailored for directed graphs.

Result: DirGraphSSM delivers state-of-the-art performance on three directed graph learning tasks and competitive results on two others, with significantly faster training speeds compared to top models.

Conclusion: DirGraphSSM systematically extends state space models to directed graphs, addressing limitations in existing methods and pushing forward directed graph learning with better accuracy and efficiency.

Abstract: Directed graphs are ubiquitous across numerous domains, where the
directionality of edges encodes critical causal dependencies. However, existing
GNNs and graph Transformers tailored for directed graphs face two major
challenges: (1) effectively capturing long-range causal dependencies derived
from directed edges; (2) balancing accuracy and training efficiency when
processing large-scale graph datasets. In recent years, state space models
(SSMs) have achieved substantial progress in causal sequence tasks, and their
variants designed for graphs have demonstrated state-of-the-art accuracy while
maintaining high efficiency across various graph learning benchmarks. However,
existing graph state space models are exclusively designed for undirected
graphs, which limits their performance in directed graph learning. To this end,
we propose an innovative approach DirEgo2Token which sequentializes directed
graphs via k-hop ego graphs. This marks the first systematic extension of state
space models to the field of directed graph learning. Building upon this, we
develop DirGraphSSM, a novel directed graph neural network architecture that
implements state space models on directed graphs via the message-passing
mechanism. Experimental results demonstrate that DirGraphSSM achieves
state-of-the-art performance on three representative directed graph learning
tasks while attaining competitive performance on two additional tasks with
1.5$\times $ to 2$\times $ training speed improvements compared to existing
state-of-the-art models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ST-LINK framework introduces Spatially-Enhanced Attention (SE-Attention) and Memory Retrieval Feed-Forward Network (MRFFN) to improve LLMs' ability to capture spatio-temporal data, outperforming current traffic forecasting methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of LLMs in effectively capturing spatial dependencies in traffic forecasting due to their sequential token processing design.

Method: Incorporate SE-Attention to connect spatial data with rotary position embeddings and MRFFN for retrieving historical temporal patterns to enhance forecasting performance.

Result: ST-LINK outperforms conventional deep learning and LLM methods on benchmark datasets, capturing regular and abrupt changes in traffic patterns effectively.

Conclusion: The framework provides a powerful enhancement of LLMs' ability to model spatio-temporal dependencies, demonstrating significant benefits for intelligent transportation systems.

Abstract: Traffic forecasting represents a crucial problem within intelligent
transportation systems. In recent research, Large Language Models (LLMs) have
emerged as a promising method, but their intrinsic design, tailored primarily
for sequential token processing, introduces notable challenges in effectively
capturing spatial dependencies. Specifically, the inherent limitations of LLMs
in modeling spatial relationships and their architectural incompatibility with
graph-structured spatial data remain largely unaddressed. To overcome these
limitations, we introduce ST-LINK, a novel framework that enhances the
capability of Large Language Models to capture spatio-temporal dependencies.
Its key components are Spatially-Enhanced Attention (SE-Attention) and the
Memory Retrieval Feed-Forward Network (MRFFN). SE-Attention extends rotary
position embeddings to integrate spatial correlations as direct rotational
transformations within the attention mechanism. This approach maximizes spatial
learning while preserving the LLM's inherent sequential processing structure.
Meanwhile, MRFFN dynamically retrieves and utilizes key historical patterns to
capture complex temporal dependencies and improve the stability of long-term
forecasting. Comprehensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that
ST-LINK surpasses conventional deep learning and LLM approaches, and
effectively captures both regular traffic patterns and abrupt changes.

*Zongxin Shen,Yanyong Huang,Bin Wang,Jinyuan Chang,Shiyu Liu,Tianrui Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces CAUSA, a novel method for multi-view unsupervised feature selection that uses a structural causal model to mitigate spurious correlations caused by confounders.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address shortcomings in existing MUFS methods that rely on potentially unreliable correlations between features and clustering labels, which can lead to the selection of irrelevant features due to confounding variables.

Method: The proposed CAUSA method uses a structural causal model to incorporate a causal regularization module for separating confounders and balancing confounder distributions, integrated with a spectral regression model for feature selection.

Result: Experiments show that CAUSA outperforms other state-of-the-art MUFS methods in selecting causally informative features and achieving dimensionality reduction on multi-view unlabeled data.

Conclusion: CAUSA represents the first deep exploration of causal approaches for multi-view unsupervised feature selection, demonstrating superior performance and advancing understanding in the field.

Abstract: Multi-view unsupervised feature selection (MUFS) has recently received
increasing attention for its promising ability in dimensionality reduction on
multi-view unlabeled data. Existing MUFS methods typically select
discriminative features by capturing correlations between features and
clustering labels. However, an important yet underexplored question remains:
\textit{Are such correlations sufficiently reliable to guide feature
selection?} In this paper, we analyze MUFS from a causal perspective by
introducing a novel structural causal model, which reveals that existing
methods may select irrelevant features because they overlook spurious
correlations caused by confounders. Building on this causal perspective, we
propose a novel MUFS method called CAusal multi-view Unsupervised feature
Selection leArning (CAUSA). Specifically, we first employ a generalized
unsupervised spectral regression model that identifies informative features by
capturing dependencies between features and consensus clustering labels. We
then introduce a causal regularization module that can adaptively separate
confounders from multi-view data and simultaneously learn view-shared sample
weights to balance confounder distributions, thereby mitigating spurious
correlations. Thereafter, integrating both into a unified learning framework
enables CAUSA to select causally informative features. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate that CAUSA outperforms several state-of-the-art
methods. To our knowledge, this is the first in-depth study of causal
multi-view feature selection in the unsupervised setting.

TL;DR: The paper introduces FHNN, a physics-structured neural network for modeling fluid-structure interactions with better accuracy and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fluid-structure interactions are challenging to model due to the complexity of dissipative dynamics and limitations in current black-box neural methods.

Method: Proposing FHNN, which blends physics-informed hydrodynamic parameter estimation with analytic equations of motion to improve predictions and stability.

Result: FHNN outperformed Neural ODEs in error reduction and provided physically consistent flow fields. It also surpassed Hamiltonian and Lagrangian neural networks in handling dissipative dynamics.

Conclusion: FHNN bridges the gap between black-box learning and interpretable system identification, enabling efficient modeling of fluid-structure interactions.

Abstract: Fluid-structure interaction is common in engineering and natural systems,
where floating-body motion is governed by added mass, drag, and background
flows. Modeling these dissipative dynamics is difficult: black-box neural
models regress state derivatives with limited interpretability and unstable
long-horizon predictions. We propose Floating-Body Hydrodynamic Neural Networks
(FHNN), a physics-structured framework that predicts interpretable hydrodynamic
parameters such as directional added masses, drag coefficients, and a
streamfunction-based flow, and couples them with analytic equations of motion.
This design constrains the hypothesis space, enhances interpretability, and
stabilizes integration. On synthetic vortex datasets, FHNN achieves up to an
order-of-magnitude lower error than Neural ODEs, recovers physically consistent
flow fields. Compared with Hamiltonian and Lagrangian neural networks, FHNN
more effectively handles dissipative dynamics while preserving
interpretability, which bridges the gap between black-box learning and
transparent system identification.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitation of classical models in inclusive finance that struggle with data scarcity and imbalance.

Method: It uses classical machine learning for feature engineering and dimensionality reduction, followed by a Quantum Neural Network (QNN) trained via the parameter-shift rule.

Result: The QNN achieved an average AUC of 0.852 +/- 0.027 in simulations and 0.88 in hardware tests, outperforming classical methods, especially on recall metric.

Conclusion: Quantum computing demonstrates significant promise in tackling financial tasks under data constraints, paving the way for innovative applications in inclusive finance in the NISQ era.

Abstract: Quantum Machine Learning (QML) offers a new paradigm for addressing complex
financial problems intractable for classical methods. This work specifically
tackles the challenge of few-shot credit risk assessment, a critical issue in
inclusive finance where data scarcity and imbalance limit the effectiveness of
conventional models. To address this, we design and implement a novel hybrid
quantum-classical workflow. The methodology first employs an ensemble of
classical machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)
for intelligent feature engineering and dimensionality reduction. Subsequently,
a Quantum Neural Network (QNN), trained via the parameter-shift rule, serves as
the core classifier. This framework was evaluated through numerical simulations
and deployed on the Quafu Quantum Cloud Platform's ScQ-P21 superconducting
processor. On a real-world credit dataset of 279 samples, our QNN achieved a
robust average AUC of 0.852 +/- 0.027 in simulations and yielded an impressive
AUC of 0.88 in the hardware experiment. This performance surpasses a suite of
classical benchmarks, with a particularly strong result on the recall metric.
This study provides a pragmatic blueprint for applying quantum computing to
data-constrained financial scenarios in the NISQ era and offers valuable
empirical evidence supporting its potential in high-stakes applications like
inclusive finance.

*Qingqi Zhao,Heng Xiao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a hybrid approach combining physics-based modeling and machine learning to improve permeability prediction in porous media.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for predicting permeability face challenges in balancing physical accuracy and computational generalization, particularly in complex porous structures.

Method: The framework integrates a Graph Neural Network (GNN) into a Pore Network Model (PNM), allowing end-to-end training using gradients to predict permeability while avoiding idealized geometry assumptions.

Result: The model exhibited high accuracy, robust generalization across scales, and outperformed traditional PNM and pure data-driven methods.

Conclusion: This approach provides a scalable, interpretable, and accurate framework for permeability prediction in porous media, enhancing reliability and understanding of model features.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of permeability in porous media is essential for modeling
subsurface flow. While pure data-driven models offer computational efficiency,
they often lack generalization across scales and do not incorporate explicit
physical constraints. Pore network models (PNMs), on the other hand, are
physics-based and efficient but rely on idealized geometric assumptions to
estimate pore-scale hydraulic conductance, limiting their accuracy in complex
structures. To overcome these limitations, we present an end-to-end
differentiable hybrid framework that embeds a graph neural network (GNN) into a
PNM. In this framework, the analytical formulas used for conductance
calculations are replaced by GNN-based predictions derived from pore and throat
features. The predicted conductances are then passed to the PNM solver for
permeability computation. In this way, the model avoids the idealized geometric
assumptions of PNM while preserving the physics-based flow calculations. The
GNN is trained without requiring labeled conductance data, which can number in
the thousands per pore network; instead, it learns conductance values by using
a single scalar permeability as the training target. This is made possible by
backpropagating gradients through both the GNN (via automatic differentiation)
and the PNM solver (via a discrete adjoint method), enabling fully coupled,
end-to-end training. The resulting model achieves high accuracy and generalizes
well across different scales, outperforming both pure data-driven and
traditional PNM approaches. Gradient-based sensitivity analysis further reveals
physically consistent feature influences, enhancing model interpretability.
This approach offers a scalable and physically informed framework for
permeability prediction in complex porous media, reducing model uncertainty and
improving accuracy.

Conclusion: This work enables new insights into heart-brain interactions by simulating cardiac dynamics in datasets with limited heart information.

Abstract: The use of mechanistic models in clinical studies is limited by the lack of
multi-modal patients data representing different anatomical and physiological
processes. For example, neuroimaging datasets do not provide a sufficient
representation of heart features for the modeling of cardiovascular factors in
brain disorders. To tackle this problem we introduce a probabilistic framework
for joint cardiac data imputation and personalisation of cardiovascular
mechanistic models, with application to brain studies with incomplete heart
data. Our approach is based on a variational framework for the joint inference
of an imputation model of cardiac information from the available features,
along with a Gaussian Process emulator that can faithfully reproduce
personalised cardiovascular dynamics. Experimental results on UK Biobank show
that our model allows accurate imputation of missing cardiac features in
datasets containing minimal heart information, e.g. systolic and diastolic
blood pressures only, while jointly estimating the emulated parameters of the
lumped model. This allows a novel exploration of the heart-brain joint
relationship through simulation of realistic cardiac dynamics corresponding to
different conditions of brain anatomy.

### [188] [Masked Diffusion Models as Energy Minimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13866)
*Sitong Chen,Shen Nie,Jiacheng Sun,Zijin Feng,Zhenguo Li,Ji-Rong Wen,Chongxuan Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper interprets Masked Diffusion Models (MDMs) as solutions to energy minimization via three mathematically equivalent formulations and proposes improvements in sampling schedules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to unify the understanding of MDMs by connecting them to discrete optimal transport and to simplify sampling schedule design for improved performance.

Method: It mathematically proves the equivalence of kinetic, conditional kinetic, and geodesic energy in MDMs and introduces Beta distribution parametrization for efficient schedule optimization.

Result: Energy-inspired schedules developed in this framework outperform traditional hand-crafted baselines, especially in low-step sampling tasks, validated through experiments.

Conclusion: The framework clarifies theoretical aspects of MDMs and provides practical advancements in sampling schedules, offering both theoretical insights and practical benefits.

Abstract: We present a systematic theoretical framework that interprets masked
diffusion models (MDMs) as solutions to energy minimization problems in
discrete optimal transport. Specifically, we prove that three distinct energy
formulations--kinetic, conditional kinetic, and geodesic energy--are
mathematically equivalent under the structure of MDMs, and that MDMs minimize
all three when the mask schedule satisfies a closed-form optimality condition.
This unification not only clarifies the theoretical foundations of MDMs, but
also motivates practical improvements in sampling. By parameterizing
interpolation schedules via Beta distributions, we reduce the schedule design
space to a tractable 2D search, enabling efficient post-training tuning without
model modification. Experiments on synthetic and real-world benchmarks
demonstrate that our energy-inspired schedules outperform hand-crafted
baselines, particularly in low-step sampling settings.

### [189] [FedSSG: Expectation-Gated and History-Aware Drift Alignment for Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13895)
*Zhanting Zhou,Jinshan Lai,Fengchun Zhang,Zeqin Wu,Fengli Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses federated learning challenges caused by non-IID data and partial participation by introducing FedSSG, an algorithm that aligns client drift and accelerates convergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to solve the issues of unstable convergence and accuracy loss in federated learning caused by client drift and non-uniform participation.

Method: FedSSG uses a per-client drift memory that accumulates local model differences. A smooth, participation-aware gating mechanism is introduced to manage memory updates and alignment. This approach leverages participation statistics to stabilize training without additional communication.

Result: In CIFAR-10/100 experiments with 100-500 clients and low participation, FedSSG improves test accuracy by up to 2.7 points and accelerates target-accuracy convergence by 4.5x compared to strong baselines.

Conclusion: FedSSG leverages sampling statistics for history-aware phase control in federated training, resulting in more stable and faster training across non-IID and partial participation setups, with minimal computational overhead.

Abstract: Non-IID data and partial participation induce client drift and inconsistent
local optima in federated learning, causing unstable convergence and accuracy
loss. We present FedSSG, a stochastic sampling-guided, history-aware drift
alignment method. FedSSG maintains a per-client drift memory that accumulates
local model differences as a lightweight sketch of historical gradients;
crucially, it gates both the memory update and the local alignment term by a
smooth function of the observed/expected participation ratio (a
phase-by-expectation signal derived from the server sampler). This
statistically grounded gate stays weak and smooth when sampling noise dominates
early, then strengthens once participation statistics stabilize, contracting
the local-global gap without extra communication. Across CIFAR-10/100 with
100/500 clients and 2-15 percent participation, FedSSG consistently outperforms
strong drift-aware baselines and accelerates convergence; on our benchmarks it
improves test accuracy by up to a few points (e.g., about +0.9 on CIFAR-10 and
about +2.7 on CIFAR-100 on average over the top-2 baseline) and yields about
4.5x faster target-accuracy convergence on average. The method adds only O(d)
client memory and a constant-time gate, and degrades gracefully to a mild
regularizer under near-IID or uniform sampling. FedSSG shows that sampling
statistics can be turned into a principled, history-aware phase control to
stabilize and speed up federated training.

### [190] [TFMAdapter: Lightweight Instance-Level Adaptation of Foundation Models for Forecasting with Covariates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13906)
*Afrin Dange,Sunita Sarawagi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces TFMAdapter, a lightweight adapter to enhance Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) by integrating covariate information for improved forecasting without fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inability of TSFMs to incorporate exogenous covariates, which are essential for some domain-specific forecasting applications.

Method: A two-stage approach: generating pseudo-forecasts with a regression model first, then training a Gaussian Process regressor using pseudo-forecasts, TSFM predictions, and covariates.

Result: TFMAdapter achieves significant improvements (24-27% over base TSFMs) in forecasting accuracy across diverse real-world datasets.

Conclusion: Lightweight adapters like TFMAdapter can effectively bridge the gap between generic foundation models and specific domain requirements, while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) have recently achieved state-of-the-art
performance in univariate forecasting on new time series simply by conditioned
on a brief history of past values. Their success demonstrates that large-scale
pretraining across diverse domains can acquire the inductive bias to generalize
from temporal patterns in a brief history. However, most TSFMs are unable to
leverage covariates -- future-available exogenous variables critical for
accurate forecasting in many applications -- due to their domain-specific
nature and the lack of associated inductive bias. We propose TFMAdapter, a
lightweight, instance-level adapter that augments TSFMs with covariate
information without fine-tuning. Instead of retraining, TFMAdapter operates on
the limited history provided during a single model call, learning a
non-parametric cascade that combines covariates with univariate TSFM forecasts.
However, such learning would require univariate forecasts at all steps in the
history, requiring too many calls to the TSFM. To enable training on the full
historical context while limiting TSFM invocations, TFMAdapter uses a two-stage
method: (1) generating pseudo-forecasts with a simple regression model, and (2)
training a Gaussian Process regressor to refine predictions using both pseudo-
and TSFM forecasts alongside covariates. Extensive experiments on real-world
datasets demonstrate that TFMAdapter consistently outperforms both foundation
models and supervised baselines, achieving a 24-27\% improvement over base
foundation models with minimal data and computational overhead. Our results
highlight the potential of lightweight adapters to bridge the gap between
generic foundation models and domain-specific forecasting needs.

*Priyobrata Mondal,Faizanuddin Ansari,Swagatam Das*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: APFEx is a novel framework for addressing fairness issues in machine learning, particularly for intersectional subgroups.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing fairness approaches fail to account for compounded biases in intersecting protected attributes like race, gender, and age.

Method: APFEx proposes a joint optimization framework leveraging adaptive multi-objective optimization, differentiable fairness metrics, and guarantees on Pareto-optimal solutions.

Result: Experiments on four datasets show APFEx reduces fairness violations while maintaining competitive model accuracy.

Conclusion: APFEx offers a scalable, model-agnostic solution for achieving intersectional fairness in machine learning models.

Abstract: Ensuring fairness in machine learning models is critical, especially when
biases compound across intersecting protected attributes like race, gender, and
age. While existing methods address fairness for single attributes, they fail
to capture the nuanced, multiplicative biases faced by intersectional
subgroups. We introduce Adaptive Pareto Front Explorer (APFEx), the first
framework to explicitly model intersectional fairness as a joint optimization
problem over the Cartesian product of sensitive attributes. APFEx combines
three key innovations- (1) an adaptive multi-objective optimizer that
dynamically switches between Pareto cone projection, gradient weighting, and
exploration strategies to navigate fairness-accuracy trade-offs, (2)
differentiable intersectional fairness metrics enabling gradient-based
optimization of non-smooth subgroup disparities, and (3) theoretical guarantees
of convergence to Pareto-optimal solutions. Experiments on four real-world
datasets demonstrate APFEx's superiority, reducing fairness violations while
maintaining competitive accuracy. Our work bridges a critical gap in fair ML,
providing a scalable, model-agnostic solution for intersectional fairness.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to improve vehicle trajectory prediction by combining existing deep learning models using a simple confidence-weighted average, achieving a 10% performance improvement without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of leveraging strengths of large, state-of-the-art prediction models for autonomous driving without requiring costly retraining.

Method: Combine state-of-the-art deep learning trajectory prediction models using a confidence-weighted averaging method, applied out-of-the-box without fine-tuning or retraining.

Result: The method improves trajectory prediction performance by 10%, especially in long-tailed metrics, and is validated on both NuScenes and Argoverse datasets.

Conclusion: Ensemble modeling using simple averaging techniques can effectively enhance prediction performance, providing a practical solution for autonomous driving challenges without additional computational costs of retraining.

Abstract: This work explores the application of ensemble modeling to the
multidimensional regression problem of trajectory prediction for vehicles in
urban environments. As newer and bigger state-of-the-art prediction models for
autonomous driving continue to emerge, an important open challenge is the
problem of how to combine the strengths of these big models without the need
for costly re-training. We show how, perhaps surprisingly, combining
state-of-the-art deep learning models out-of-the-box (without retraining or
fine-tuning) with a simple confidence-weighted average method can enhance the
overall prediction. Indeed, while combining trajectory prediction models is not
straightforward, this simple approach enhances performance by 10% over the best
prediction model, especially in the long-tailed metrics. We show that this
performance improvement holds on both the NuScenes and Argoverse datasets, and
that these improvements are made across the dataset distribution. The code for
our work is open source.

novel and robust framework for addressing fracture mechanics problems involving
multiple cracks in fractured media. To address this, an energy-based loss
function, customized integration schemes, and domain decomposition procedures

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces EpiSMART, a personalized seizure detection framework combining continual learning to adapt over time without forgetting old knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current epilepsy diagnosis relies on time-consuming expert review of EEG data, requiring innovation in automated and personalized seizure detection.

Method: The study proposes EpiSMART, utilizing a size-constrained replay buffer and an informed sample selection strategy to maintain performance and adapt continually.

Result: EpiSMART improved F1 score by 21% using minimal data (6.46 minutes labeled daily), demonstrating its resource-efficiency and suitability for real-time application.

Conclusion: EpiSMART provides an effective solution for patient-specific seizure detection in wearable systems operating under constrained resources.

Abstract: Objective: Epilepsy, a prevalent neurological disease, demands careful
diagnosis and continuous care. Seizure detection remains challenging, as
current clinical practice relies on expert analysis of electroencephalography,
which is a time-consuming process and requires specialized knowledge.
Addressing this challenge, this paper explores automated epileptic seizure
detection using deep learning, focusing on personalized continual learning
models that adapt to each patient's unique electroencephalography signal
features, which evolve over time. Methods: In this context, our approach
addresses the challenge of integrating new data into existing models without
catastrophic forgetting, a common issue in static deep learning models. We
propose EpiSMART, a continual learning framework for seizure detection that
uses a size-constrained replay buffer and an informed sample selection strategy
to incrementally adapt to patient-specific electroencephalography signals. By
selectively retaining high-entropy and seizure-predicted samples, our method
preserves critical past information while maintaining high performance with
minimal memory and computational requirements. Results: Validation on the
CHB-MIT dataset, shows that EpiSMART achieves a 21% improvement in the F1 score
over a trained baseline without updates in all other patients. On average,
EpiSMART requires only 6.46 minutes of labeled data and 6.28 updates per day,
making it suitable for real-time deployment in wearable systems.
Conclusion:EpiSMART enables robust and personalized seizure detection under
realistic and resource-constrained conditions by effectively integrating new
data into existing models without degrading past knowledge. Significance: This
framework advances automated seizure detection by providing a continual
learning approach that supports patient-specific adaptation and practical
deployment in wearable healthcare systems.

### [195] [Deep Temporal Graph Networks for Real-Time Correction of GNSS Jamming-Induced Deviations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14000)
*Ivana Kesić,Aljaž Blatnik,Carolina Fortuna,Blaž Bertalanič*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study introduces a novel receiver-centric deep temporal graph network to mitigate GNSS jamming through dynamic graph regression methods, achieving consistently low mean absolute error (MAE) against multiple baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the growing challenge of GNSS disruptions caused by intentional jamming, which hampers positioning and timing availability during critical scenarios.

Method: The authors proposed a heterogeneous star graph representation with a Heterogeneous Graph ConvLSTM (HeteroGCLSTM) model to dynamically predict and correct horizontal positional deviations in satellite receivers.

Result: The proposed model demonstrated superior performance with the lowest MAE across multiple jamming scenarios and power levels. It also outperformed several strong baseline methods, showing marked improvements in data efficiency.

Conclusion: The results suggest that the proposed receiver-centric approach is effective for real-time GNSS jamming mitigation and offers superior accuracy and efficiency compared to traditional methods.

Abstract: Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) are increasingly disrupted by
intentional jamming, degrading availability precisely when positioning and
timing must remain operational. We address this by reframing jamming mitigation
as dynamic graph regression and introducing a receiver-centric deep temporal
graph network that predicts, and thus corrects, the receivers horizontal
deviation in real time. At each 1 Hz epoch, the satellite receiver environment
is represented as a heterogeneous star graph (receiver center, tracked
satellites as leaves) with time varying attributes (e.g., SNR, azimuth,
elevation, latitude/longitude). A single layer Heterogeneous Graph ConvLSTM
(HeteroGCLSTM) aggregates one hop spatial context and temporal dynamics over a
short history to output the 2D deviation vector applied for on the fly
correction.
  We evaluate on datasets from two distinct receivers under three jammer
profiles, continuous wave (cw), triple tone (cw3), and wideband FM, each
exercised at six power levels between -45 and -70 dBm, with 50 repetitions per
scenario (prejam/jam/recovery). Against strong multivariate time series
baselines (MLP, uniform CNN, and Seq2Point CNN), our model consistently attains
the lowest mean absolute error (MAE). At -45 dBm, it achieves 3.64 cm
(GP01/cw), 7.74 cm (GP01/cw3), 4.41 cm (ublox/cw), 4.84 cm (ublox/cw3), and
4.82 cm (ublox/FM), improving to 1.65-2.08 cm by -60 to -70 dBm. On mixed mode
datasets pooling all powers, MAE is 3.78 cm (GP01) and 4.25 cm (ublox10),
outperforming Seq2Point, MLP, and CNN. A split study shows superior data
efficiency: with only 10\% training data our approach remains well ahead of
baselines (20 cm vs. 36-42 cm).

*Raouf Kerkouche,Henrik Zunker,Mario Fritz,Martin J. Kühn*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of localized epidemic forecasting using machine learning by proposing a federated learning model with client-level differential privacy, tested on COVID-19 data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a localized and privacy-preserving epidemic forecasting method that avoids centralizing sensitive data while supporting local health authorities.

Method: The paper proposes a federated learning framework where local health authorities train a shared multilayer perceptron for case count forecasting. Client-level differential privacy is applied with norm-clipped updates and DP noise on server-side aggregation.

Result: The method is tested on COVID-19 data at the county level with good predictive capabilities under moderate privacy settings: achieving a high $R^2$ (0.94 and 0.88) and modest mean absolute percentage errors during two separate test phases.

Conclusion: Federated learning with differential privacy can provide reliable and privacy-compliant epidemic forecasting, enabling effective collaboration between health authorities.

Abstract: In times of epidemics, swift reaction is necessary to mitigate epidemic
spreading. For this reaction, localized approaches have several advantages,
limiting necessary resources and reducing the impact of interventions on a
larger scale. However, training a separate machine learning (ML) model on a
local scale is often not feasible due to limited available data. Centralizing
the data is also challenging because of its high sensitivity and privacy
constraints. In this study, we consider a localized strategy based on the
German counties and communities managed by the related local health authorities
(LHA). For the preservation of privacy to not oppose the availability of
detailed situational data, we propose a privacy-preserving forecasting method
that can assist public health experts and decision makers. ML methods with
federated learning (FL) train a shared model without centralizing raw data.
Considering the counties, communities or LHAs as clients and finding a balance
between utility and privacy, we study a FL framework with client-level
differential privacy (DP). We train a shared multilayer perceptron on sliding
windows of recent case counts to forecast the number of cases, while clients
exchange only norm-clipped updates and the server aggregated updates with DP
noise. We evaluate the approach on COVID-19 data on county-level during two
phases. As expected, very strict privacy yields unstable, unusable forecasts.
At a moderately strong level, the DP model closely approaches the non-DP model:
$R^2= 0.94$ (vs. 0.95) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 26 % in
November 2020; $R^2= 0.88$ (vs. 0.93) and MAPE of 21 % in March 2022. Overall,
client-level DP-FL can deliver useful county-level predictions with strong
privacy guarantees, and viable privacy budgets depend on epidemic phase,
allowing privacy-compliant collaboration among health authorities for local
forecasting.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a nanopore-based method for protein classification using wavelet transforms to achieve 81% accuracy, advancing real-time disease diagnostics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Developing a real-time, cost-effective protein/peptide classification tool for clinical diagnostics to improve disease diagnosis speed and accessibility.

Method: The authors convert nanopore current signals into scaleogram images via wavelet transforms to encapsulate amplitude, frequency, and time data, which are then classified using machine learning algorithms.

Result: On testing with 42 peptides, the method achieved a classification accuracy of approximately 81%, surpassing previous methodologies.

Conclusion: The proposed approach advances the field by improving classification accuracy and addressing model deployment challenges, moving closer to practical real-time diagnostics for diseases.

Abstract: A device capable of performing real time classification of proteins in a
clinical setting would allow for inexpensive and rapid disease diagnosis. One
such candidate for this technology are nanopore devices. These devices work by
measuring a current signal that arises when a protein or peptide enters a
nanometer-length-scale pore. Should this current be uniquely related to the
structure of the peptide and its interactions with the pore, the signals can be
used to perform identification. While such a method would allow for real time
identification of peptides and proteins in a clinical setting, to date, the
complexities of these signals limit their accuracy. In this work, we tackle the
issue of classification by converting the current signals into scaleogram
images via wavelet transforms, capturing amplitude, frequency, and time
information in a modality well-suited to machine learning algorithms. When
tested on 42 peptides, our method achieved a classification accuracy of
~$81\,\%$, setting a new state-of-the-art in the field and taking a step toward
practical peptide/protein diagnostics at the point of care. In addition, we
demonstrate model transfer techniques that will be critical when deploying
these models into real hardware, paving the way to a new method for real-time
disease diagnosis.

TL;DR: This paper proposes a low-power, real-time queen bee detection system using environmental sensor data, achieving over 99% accuracy without audio features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the inefficiency and impracticality of manual queen bee monitoring methods and the limitations of audio-based approaches in large-scale beekeeping.

Method: A lightweight multimodal system using temperature, humidity, and pressure sensors was developed. The team used quantized decision tree inference on a commercial STM32 microcontroller for real-time, low-power operation.

Result: The system achieved over 99% queen detection accuracy using only environmental sensor data. Audio features were found to offer no significant improvement.

Conclusion: This study provides a scalable, energy-efficient, and non-invasive solution for hive monitoring, enabling autonomous precision beekeeping.

Abstract: Queen bee presence is essential for the health and stability of honeybee
colonies, yet current monitoring methods rely on manual inspections that are
labor-intensive, disruptive, and impractical for large-scale beekeeping. While
recent audio-based approaches have shown promise, they often require high power
consumption, complex preprocessing, and are susceptible to ambient noise. To
overcome these limitations, we propose a lightweight, multimodal system for
queen detection based on environmental sensor fusion-specifically, temperature,
humidity, and pressure differentials between the inside and outside of the
hive. Our approach employs quantized decision tree inference on a commercial
STM32 microcontroller, enabling real-time, low-power edge computing without
compromising accuracy. We show that our system achieves over 99% queen
detection accuracy using only environmental inputs, with audio features
offering no significant performance gain. This work presents a scalable and
sustainable solution for non-invasive hive monitoring, paving the way for
autonomous, precision beekeeping using off-the-shelf, energy-efficient
hardware.

*Yuhao Wang,Enlu Zhou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes Bayesian risk-averse methods in reinforcement learning (RL) and contextual multi-arm bandits (CMAB) to manage epistemic uncertainty and demonstrates their theoretical and experimental effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the need to address epistemic uncertainty in RL due to a lack of data, using a Bayesian approach to account for model parameter uncertainty.

Method: The authors employ Bayesian Risk Markov Decision Process (BRMDP), derive the asymptotic normality of Bayesian risk and true value functions, and propose posterior sampling procedures for online RL and CMAB. They analyze their regret bounds to evaluate performance.

Result: Theoretical results show that Bayesian risk understatement decreases with increasing data and indicate sub-linear regret bounds for both RL and CMAB, including Bayesian risk regret for CMAB. Numerical experiments further show the practical effectiveness of the methods.

Conclusion: Bayesian risk-averse formulation effectively manages epistemic uncertainty in RL and CMAB, with adaptive properties and sub-linear regret bounds that are supported by numerical evidence.

Abstract: In this paper, we study the Bayesian risk-averse formulation in reinforcement
learning (RL). To address the epistemic uncertainty due to a lack of data, we
adopt the Bayesian Risk Markov Decision Process (BRMDP) to account for the
parameter uncertainty of the unknown underlying model. We derive the asymptotic
normality that characterizes the difference between the Bayesian risk value
function and the original value function under the true unknown distribution.
The results indicate that the Bayesian risk-averse approach tends to
pessimistically underestimate the original value function. This discrepancy
increases with stronger risk aversion and decreases as more data become
available. We then utilize this adaptive property in the setting of online RL
as well as online contextual multi-arm bandits (CMAB), a special case of online
RL. We provide two procedures using posterior sampling for both the general RL
problem and the CMAB problem. We establish a sub-linear regret bound, with the
regret defined as the conventional regret for both the RL and CMAB settings.
Additionally, we establish a sub-linear regret bound for the CMAB setting with
the regret defined as the Bayesian risk regret. Finally, we conduct numerical
experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in
addressing epistemic uncertainty and verifying the theoretical properties.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance understanding of how different EEG frequency bands, optimizers, and neural network architectures contribute to accurate and efficient classification in neuroimaging tasks.

Method: Three neural network architectures (deep dense network, shallow three-layer network, and CNN) were implemented using TensorFlow and PyTorch, with varied optimizers (Adagrad, RMSprop, Adadelta, SGD, FTRL). SHAP was utilized to evaluate feature importance of EEG frequency bands.

Result: Adagrad and RMSprop delivered superior performance across bands, with Adagrad excelling in beta and RMSprop in gamma. CNN showed strong spatial feature performance; deep dense network was competitive in complex patterns; the shallow network offered computational efficiency.

Conclusion: The study underscores the significance of matching optimizers, architectures, and frequency bands to optimize classification performance and feature insights in neuroimaging.

Abstract: This study investigates classifier performance across EEG frequency bands
using various optimizers and evaluates efficient class prediction for the left
and right hemispheres. Three neural network architectures - a deep dense
network, a shallow three-layer network, and a convolutional neural network
(CNN) - are implemented and compared using the TensorFlow and PyTorch
frameworks. Results indicate that the Adagrad and RMSprop optimizers
consistently perform well across different frequency bands, with Adadelta
exhibiting robust performance in cross-model evaluations. Specifically, Adagrad
excels in the beta band, while RMSprop achieves superior performance in the
gamma band. Conversely, SGD and FTRL exhibit inconsistent performance. Among
the models, the CNN demonstrates the second highest accuracy, particularly in
capturing spatial features of EEG data. The deep dense network shows
competitive performance in learning complex patterns, whereas the shallow
three-layer network, sometimes being less accurate, provides computational
efficiency. SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations) plots are employed to identify
efficient class prediction, revealing nuanced contributions of EEG frequency
bands to model accuracy. Overall, the study highlights the importance of
optimizer selection, model architecture, and EEG frequency band analysis in
enhancing classifier performance and understanding feature importance in
neuroimaging-based classification tasks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Quantile Neural Basis Model to improve interpretability in neural networks used for probabilistic forecasting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the mechanisms leading to feature-conditioned outputs in neural forecasting models is challenging, and this work seeks to address this gap.

Method: The paper proposes the Quantile Neural Basis Model, which blends Quantile Generalized Additive Models' interpretability principles with neural networks. It uses shared basis decomposition and weight factorization while avoiding parametric distributional assumptions.

Result: The approach was tested on day-ahead electricity price forecasting, showing predictive accuracy comparable to other neural networks while providing interpretability insights into the input-output mappings across time horizons.

Conclusion: The model achieves a balance between predictive performance and interpretability, paving the way for more explainable forecasting models.

Abstract: While neural networks are achieving high predictive accuracy in multi-horizon
probabilistic forecasting, understanding the underlying mechanisms that lead to
feature-conditioned outputs remains a significant challenge for forecasters. In
this work, we take a further step toward addressing this critical issue by
introducing the Quantile Neural Basis Model, which incorporates the
interpretability principles of Quantile Generalized Additive Models into an
end-to-end neural network training framework. To this end, we leverage shared
basis decomposition and weight factorization, complementing Neural Models for
Location, Scale, and Shape by avoiding any parametric distributional
assumptions. We validate our approach on day-ahead electricity price
forecasting, achieving predictive performance comparable to distributional and
quantile regression neural networks, while offering valuable insights into

TL;DR: The paper examines how proactive mental health outreach informed by predictive modeling can reduce reincarceration rates. The study demonstrates the model's effectiveness and evaluates its real-world application.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the inadequacy of jails and prisons in meeting the needs of incarcerated individuals, especially those facing mental illness, substance dependence, and homelessness, which perpetuates cycles of incarceration and exacerbates racial disparities.

Method: The authors describe their partnership with Johnson County, Kansas to implement proactive mental health outreach. They used predictive modeling to identify at-risk individuals and conducted a field trial to evaluate the model's predictive accuracy and the outreach program's effectiveness.

Result: The study's predictive model accurately identified individuals at high risk for reincarceration, with over half of the highest-risk group returning to jail within a year. The outreach was most impactful for these individuals, influencing mental health service use, EMS dispatches, and reduced criminal justice involvement.

Conclusion: Proactive, data-driven mental health outreach can effectively reduce reincarceration rates among high-risk individuals. This approach holds promise in addressing systemic issues within the criminal justice system.

Abstract: Many incarcerated individuals face significant and complex challenges,
including mental illness, substance dependence, and homelessness, yet jails and
prisons are often poorly equipped to address these needs. With little support
from the existing criminal justice system, these needs can remain untreated and
worsen, often leading to further offenses and a cycle of incarceration with
adverse outcomes both for the individual and for public safety, with
particularly large impacts on communities of color that continue to widen the
already extensive racial disparities in criminal justice outcomes. Responding
to these failures, a growing number of criminal justice stakeholders are
seeking to break this cycle through innovative approaches such as
community-driven and alternative approaches to policing, mentoring, community
building, restorative justice, pretrial diversion, holistic defense, and social
service connections. Here we report on a collaboration between Johnson County,
Kansas, and Carnegie Mellon University to perform targeted, proactive mental
health outreach in an effort to reduce reincarceration rates.
  This paper describes the data used, our predictive modeling approach and
results, as well as the design and analysis of a field trial conducted to
confirm our model's predictive power, evaluate the impact of this targeted
outreach, and understand at what level of reincarceration risk outreach might
be most effective. Through this trial, we find that our model is highly
predictive of new jail bookings, with more than half of individuals in the
trial's highest-risk group returning to jail in the following year. Outreach
was most effective among these highest-risk individuals, with impacts on mental
health utilization, EMS dispatches, and criminal justice involvement.

### [203] [A Compositional Kernel Model for Feature Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14158)
*Feng Ruan,Keli Liu,Michael Jordan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a kernel ridge regression model with feature reweighting, focusing on its capacity for variable selection and feature learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore variable selection and feature learning using compositional kernel regression models.

Method: The study formulates the model as a variational problem and analyzes it for recovering relevant variables while discarding noise.

Result: It is shown that the model eliminates Gaussian-distributed noise variables and distinguishes between linear and nonlinear effects using $
\ell_1$-type and Gaussian kernels.

Conclusion: Laplace kernels are found effective for nonlinear feature recovery, whereas Gaussian kernels primarily focus on linear feature selection.

Abstract: We study a compositional variant of kernel ridge regression in which the
predictor is applied to a coordinate-wise reweighting of the inputs. Formulated
as a variational problem, this model provides a simple testbed for feature
learning in compositional architectures. From the perspective of variable
selection, we show how relevant variables are recovered while noise variables
are eliminated. We establish guarantees showing that both global minimizers and
stationary points discard noise coordinates when the noise variables are
Gaussian distributed. A central finding is that $\ell_1$-type kernels, such as
the Laplace kernel, succeed in recovering features contributing to nonlinear
effects at stationary points, whereas Gaussian kernels recover only linear
ones.

*Md Rezwan Jaher,Abul Mukid Mohammad Mukaddes,A. B. M. Abdul Malek*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel AI-driven framework to noninvasively estimate unmeasurable healthcare parameters, focusing on glaucoma biomarkers and solving complex inverse problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding and addressing the inability to measure critical healthcare biomarkers, such as trabecular meshwork permeability in glaucoma, which hampers diagnostic and therapeutic decisions.

Method: The framework includes a multi-stage AI architecture, a novel PCDS data generation strategy to cut simulation costs, and a Bayesian engine to assess predictive uncertainty from routine inputs.

Result: The framework estimates the key glaucoma biomarkers noninvasively with precision akin to direct clinical instruments and stratifies disease risk effectively using newly derived biomarkers.

Conclusion: The study defines a scalable solution for healthcare challenges related to unmeasurable parameters and establishes applicability for other domains facing data-scarce inverse problems.

Abstract: Many critical healthcare decisions are challenged by the inability to measure
key underlying parameters. Glaucoma, a leading cause of irreversible blindness
driven by elevated intraocular pressure (IOP), provides a stark example. The
primary determinant of IOP, a tissue property called trabecular meshwork
permeability, cannot be measured in vivo, forcing clinicians to depend on
indirect surrogates. This clinical challenge is compounded by a broader
computational one: developing predictive models for such ill-posed inverse
problems is hindered by a lack of ground-truth data and prohibitive cost of
large-scale, high-fidelity simulations. We address both challenges with an
end-to-end framework to noninvasively estimate unmeasurable variables from
sparse, routine data. Our approach combines a multi-stage artificial
intelligence architecture to functionally separate the problem; a novel data
generation strategy we term PCDS that obviates the need for hundreds of
thousands of costly simulations, reducing the effective computational time from
years to hours; and a Bayesian engine to quantify predictive uncertainty. Our
framework deconstructs a single IOP measurement into its fundamental components
from routine inputs only, yielding estimates for the unmeasurable tissue
permeability and a patient's outflow facility. Our noninvasively estimated
outflow facility achieved excellent agreement with state-of-the-art tonography
with precision comparable to direct physical instruments. Furthermore, the
newly derived permeability biomarker demonstrates high accuracy in stratifying
clinical cohorts by disease risk, highlighting its diagnostic potential. More
broadly, our framework establishes a generalizable blueprint for solving
similar inverse problems in other data-scarce, computationally-intensive
domains.

### [205] [TopoSizing: An LLM-aided Framework of Topology-based Understanding and Sizing for AMS Circuits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14169)
*Ziming Wei,Zichen Kong,Yuan Wang,David Z. Pan,Xiyuan Tang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces TopoSizing, a framework combining circuit graph analysis, large language models, and Bayesian optimization to improve analog and mixed-signal circuit design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Analog and mixed-signal circuit design faces challenges due to a lack of high-quality data, difficulty embedding domain knowledge, and inefficiencies in existing optimization strategies.

Method: TopoSizing uses graph algorithms for circuit organization, large language models for iterative hypothesis checking, and Bayesian optimization with LLM-guided insights for efficient sampling and refinement.

Result: TopoSizing improves design feasibility and optimization efficiency by leveraging structural knowledge embedded in netlists and LLM-guided processes.

Conclusion: By integrating domain-specific structures and language model insights into optimization workflows, TopoSizing offers a robust solution to streamline analog circuit design.

Abstract: Analog and mixed-signal circuit design remains challenging due to the
shortage of high-quality data and the difficulty of embedding domain knowledge
into automated flows. Traditional black-box optimization achieves sampling
efficiency but lacks circuit understanding, which often causes evaluations to
be wasted in low-value regions of the design space. In contrast, learning-based
methods embed structural knowledge but are case-specific and costly to retrain.
Recent attempts with large language models show potential, yet they often rely
on manual intervention, limiting generality and transparency. We propose
TopoSizing, an end-to-end framework that performs robust circuit understanding
directly from raw netlists and translates this knowledge into optimization
gains. Our approach first applies graph algorithms to organize circuits into a
hierarchical device-module-stage representation. LLM agents then execute an
iterative hypothesis-verification-refinement loop with built-in consistency
checks, producing explicit annotations. Verified insights are integrated into
Bayesian optimization through LLM-guided initial sampling and
stagnation-triggered trust-region updates, improving efficiency while
preserving feasibility.

*Ziyuan Chen,Zhenghui Zhao,Zhangye Han,Miancan Liu,Xianhang Ye,Yiqing Li,Hongbo Min,Jinkui Ren,Xiantao Zhang,Guitao Cao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Tree-Guided Preference Optimization (TGPO), an offline reinforcement learning framework for training efficient and effective Web Agents, addressing challenges like reward sparsity and high annotation costs. It achieves better results compared to existing methods in specific benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenges in training Web Agents using reinforcement learning, such as credit assignment issues, annotation costs, and sparse rewards, while leveraging large language and vision-language models.

Method: The method, Tree-Guided Preference Optimization (TGPO), uses a tree-structured trajectory representation to merge semantically similar states, a Process Reward Model for fine-grained reward generation, and dynamic weighting to emphasize crucial decision points during training.

Result: TGPO outperformed existing methods in experiments conducted on Online-Mind2Web and C-WebShop datasets, achieving higher success rates with fewer redundant steps.

Conclusion: TGPO offers an effective solution for training robust Web Agents, overcoming the limitations of traditional reinforcement learning approaches with its novel trajectory representation, reward model, and decision weighting system.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of large language models and vision-language
models, employing large models as Web Agents has become essential for automated
web interaction. However, training Web Agents with reinforcement learning faces
critical challenges including credit assignment misallocation, prohibitively
high annotation costs, and reward sparsity. To address these issues, we propose
Tree-Guided Preference Optimization (TGPO), an offline reinforcement learning
framework that proposes a tree-structured trajectory representation merging
semantically identical states across trajectories to eliminate label conflicts.
Our framework incorporates a Process Reward Model that automatically generates
fine-grained rewards through subgoal progress, redundancy detection, and action
verification. Additionally, a dynamic weighting mechanism prioritizes
high-impact decision points during training. Experiments on Online-Mind2Web and
our self-constructed C-WebShop datasets demonstrate that TGPO significantly
outperforms existing methods, achieving higher success rates with fewer
redundant steps.

*Yifan Hu,Jie Yang,Tian Zhou,Peiyuan Liu,Yujin Tang,Rong Jin,Liang Sun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TimeAlign introduces a framework for improving time series forecasting by aligning historical inputs with future targets, yielding performance gains verified across multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Researchers aim to address the lack of representation learning techniques in SOTA time series forecasting despite their proven success in other fields like NLP and computer vision.

Method: TimeAlign employs a straightforward reconstruction task to learn auxiliary features, which are then integrated with any base forecaster for improved predictive alignment.

Result: Extensive experiments across eight benchmarks show TimeAlign's performance superiority by correcting frequency mismatches between historical and future data.

Conclusion: TimeAlign provides significant benefit as a lightweight, architecture-agnostic module for deep learning time-series forecasting, enhancing mutual information between learned representations and targets with minimal overhead.

Abstract: Representation learning techniques like contrastive learning have long been
explored in time series forecasting, mirroring their success in computer vision
and natural language processing. Yet recent state-of-the-art (SOTA) forecasters
seldom adopt these representation approaches because they have shown little
performance advantage. We challenge this view and demonstrate that explicit
representation alignment can supply critical information that bridges the
distributional gap between input histories and future targets. To this end, we
introduce TimeAlign, a lightweight, plug-and-play framework that learns
auxiliary features via a simple reconstruction task and feeds them back to any
base forecaster. Extensive experiments across eight benchmarks verify its
superior performance. Further studies indicate that the gains arises primarily
from correcting frequency mismatches between historical inputs and future
outputs. We also provide a theoretical justification for the effectiveness of
TimeAlign in increasing the mutual information between learned representations
and predicted targets. As it is architecture-agnostic and incurs negligible
overhead, TimeAlign can serve as a general alignment module for modern deep
learning time-series forecasting systems. The code is available at

*Juan Diego Toscano,Daniel T. Chen,Vivek Oommen,George Em Karniadakis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a unifying framework for residual-based adaptive strategies in machine learning to formalize and optimize them.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Residual-based adaptive strategies are effective but lack a solid theoretical foundation.

Method: The authors use a variational framework with convex transformations of residuals to optimize objective functionals tied to error norms, linking discretization to error metrics.

Result: The framework improves adaptive scheme design, reduces error, and enhances learning by improving gradient signal-to-noise ratio, demonstrating gains in operator learning.

Conclusion: A principled, theory-backed framework for residual-based adaptive strategies provides improved discretization and training strategies in machine learning.

Abstract: Residual-based adaptive strategies are widely used in scientific machine
learning but remain largely heuristic. We introduce a unifying variational
framework that formalizes these methods by integrating convex transformations
of the residual. Different transformations correspond to distinct objective
functionals: exponential weights target the minimization of uniform error,
while linear weights recover the minimization of quadratic error. Within this
perspective, adaptive weighting is equivalent to selecting sampling
distributions that optimize the primal objective, thereby linking
discretization choices directly to error metrics. This principled approach
yields three benefits: (1) it enables systematic design of adaptive schemes
across norms, (2) reduces discretization error through variance reduction of
the loss estimator, and (3) enhances learning dynamics by improving the
gradient signal-to-noise ratio. Extending the framework to operator learning,
we demonstrate substantial performance gains across optimizers and
architectures. Our results provide a theoretical justification of
residual-based adaptivity and establish a foundation for principled
discretization and training strategies.

*Johnny R. Zhang,Xiaomei Mi,Gaoyuan Du,Qianyi Sun,Shiqi Wang,Jiaxuan Li,Wenhua Zhou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a Banach-Bregman framework for stochastic optimization, addressing non-Euclidean settings with faster convergence and better performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing stochastic optimization theories are limited to Hilbert spaces and fail to address important non-Euclidean frameworks like mirror descent and natural gradient methods.

Method: The authors introduce a Banach-Bregman framework leveraging Bregman geometry, which uses Bregman projections, Fejer monotonicity, super-relaxations, and convergence theorems to unify diverse stochastic techniques.

Result: Empirical studies show up to 20% faster convergence, reduced variance, and improved accuracy compared to classical methods across applications including machine learning, deep learning, reinforcement learning, and large language models.

Conclusion: The proposed framework positions Banach-Bregman geometry as foundational for modern optimization, enabling advancements in theory and practice across AI paradigms.

Abstract: Stochastic optimization powers the scalability of modern artificial
intelligence, spanning machine learning, deep learning, reinforcement learning,
and large language model training. Yet, existing theory remains largely
confined to Hilbert spaces, relying on inner-product frameworks and
orthogonality. This paradigm fails to capture non-Euclidean settings, such as
mirror descent on simplices, Bregman proximal methods for sparse learning,
natural gradient descent in information geometry, or
Kullback--Leibler-regularized language model training. Unlike Euclidean-based
Hilbert-space methods, this approach embraces general Banach spaces. This work
introduces a pioneering Banach--Bregman framework for stochastic iterations,
establishing Bregman geometry as a foundation for next-generation optimization.
It (i) provides a unified template via Bregman projections and Bregman--Fejer
monotonicity, encompassing stochastic approximation, mirror descent, natural
gradient, adaptive methods, and mirror-prox; (ii) establishes super-relaxations
($\lambda > 2$) in non-Hilbert settings, enabling flexible geometries and
elucidating their acceleration effect; and (iii) delivers convergence theorems
spanning almost-sure boundedness to geometric rates, validated on synthetic and
real-world tasks. Empirical studies across machine learning (UCI benchmarks),
deep learning (e.g., Transformer training), reinforcement learning
(actor--critic), and large language models (WikiText-2 with distilGPT-2) show
up to 20% faster convergence, reduced variance, and enhanced accuracy over
classical baselines. These results position Banach--Bregman geometry as a
cornerstone unifying optimization theory and practice across core AI paradigms.

*Jiaqi Yao,Lewis Mitchell,John Maclean,Hemanth Saratchandran*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces RKTV-INR, a novel framework combining implicit neural representations (INRs) with Runge-Kutta integration and total variation constraints for denoising noisy dynamical system trajectories, making them suitable for accurate system identification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Measurement noise often hinders the accurate modeling of nonlinear dynamical systems from data. The authors aim to provide a solution to suppress noise and improve the reliability of system identification.

Method: The proposed RKTV-INR method uses implicit neural representations (INRs) to fit noisy observations. Constraints like Runge-Kutta integration and total variation ensure the cleaned trajectory aligns with the dynamical system. The framework then applies Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy) to identify governing equations.

Result: Experiments validate the framework's ability to suppress noise effectively, deliver precise derivative estimations, and allow reliable identification of underlying dynamical systems.

Conclusion: RKTV-INR successfully mitigates measurement noise while improving trajectory reconstruction and system identification, showcasing its practicality in handling noisy datasets in nonlinear dynamical system modeling.

Abstract: Data-driven modeling of nonlinear dynamical systems is often hampered by
measurement noise. We propose a denoising framework, called Runge-Kutta and
Total Variation Based Implicit Neural Representation (RKTV-INR), that
represents the state trajectory with an implicit neural representation (INR)
fitted directly to noisy observations. Runge-Kutta integration and total
variation are imposed as constraints to ensure that the reconstructed state is
a trajectory of a dynamical system that remains close to the original data. The
trained INR yields a clean, continuous trajectory and provides accurate
first-order derivatives via automatic differentiation. These denoised states
and derivatives are then supplied to Sparse Identification of Nonlinear
Dynamics (SINDy) to recover the governing equations. Experiments demonstrate
effective noise suppression, precise derivative estimation, and reliable system
identification.

*Dmitrii Krasheninnikov,Richard E. Turner,David Krueger*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper demonstrates that language model activations linearly encode the temporal order of information acquisition during training, verified through a controlled experiment with sequential fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to investigate how language models encode knowledge over time, especially its implications for managing conflicting data and responding to updates.

Method: The study sequentially fine-tunes Llama-3.2-1B on six disjoint datasets about named entities and analyzes the average activations of test samples using 2D subspace projections and linear probes.

Result: Activations encode the training order, forming centroids in the 2D subspace. Linear probes differentiate temporal stages (~90% accuracy), and the model can predict unseen entities' training stages (~80% accuracy).

Conclusion: Language models inherently differentiate information by acquisition time. This finding carries implications for handling dynamic or conflicting data in model training.

Abstract: We show that language models' activations linearly encode when information
was learned during training. Our setup involves creating a model with a known
training order by sequentially fine-tuning Llama-3.2-1B on six disjoint but
otherwise similar datasets about named entities. We find that the average
activations of test samples for the six training datasets encode the training
order: when projected into a 2D subspace, these centroids are arranged exactly
in the order of training and lie on a straight line. Further, we show that
linear probes can accurately (~90%) distinguish "early" vs. "late" entities,
generalizing to entities unseen during the probes' own training. The model can
also be fine-tuned to explicitly report an unseen entity's training stage (~80%
accuracy). Interestingly, this temporal signal does not seem attributable to
simple differences in activation magnitudes, losses, or model confidence. Our
paper demonstrates that models are capable of differentiating information by
its acquisition time, and carries significant implications for how they might
manage conflicting data and respond to knowledge modifications.

*Mengting Ai,Tianxin Wei,Sirui Chen,Jingrui He*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NIRVANA is a structured pruning method for large language models (LLMs) that aims to maintain zero-shot accuracy while enabling effective fine-tuning, outperforming existing techniques under equivalent sparsity constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle the inefficiencies and performance degradation associated with structured pruning of LLMs, and to design a method that balances immediate accuracy preservation and fine-tuning capabilities.

Method: NIRVANA combines a first-order saliency criterion based on the Neural Tangent Kernel with an adaptive sparsity allocation mechanism and a KL divergence-based calibration data selection strategy for reliable and effective pruning.

Result: NIRVANA demonstrated superior performance compared to existing pruning methods on Llama3, Qwen, and T5 models by maintaining higher zero-shot accuracy and optimizing compression efficiently.

Conclusion: NIRVANA offers a theoretically grounded, practical solution for structured pruning of LLMs, addressing existing limitations and improving efficiency without sacrificing performance. Its code is publicly available for adoption.

Abstract: Structured pruning of large language models (LLMs) offers substantial
efficiency improvements by removing entire hidden units, yet current approaches
often suffer from significant performance degradation, particularly in
zero-shot settings, and necessitate costly recovery techniques such as
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or adapter insertion. To address these critical
shortcomings, we introduce NIRVANA, a novel pruning method explicitly designed
to balance immediate zero-shot accuracy preservation with robust fine-tuning
capability. Leveraging a first-order saliency criterion derived from the Neural
Tangent Kernel under Adam optimization dynamics, NIRVANA provides a
theoretically grounded pruning strategy that respects essential model training
behaviors. To further address the unique challenges posed by structured
pruning, NIRVANA incorporates an adaptive sparsity allocation mechanism across
layers and modules (attention vs. MLP), which adjusts pruning intensity between
modules in a globally balanced manner. Additionally, to mitigate the high
sensitivity of pruning decisions to calibration data quality, we propose a
simple yet effective KL divergence-based calibration data selection strategy,
ensuring more reliable and task-agnostic pruning outcomes. Comprehensive
experiments conducted on Llama3, Qwen, and T5 models demonstrate that NIRVANA
outperforms existing structured pruning methods under equivalent sparsity
constraints, providing a theoretically sound and practical approach to LLM
compression. The code is available at

*Dulhan Jayalath,Shashwat Goel,Thomas Foster,Parag Jain,Suchin Gururangan,Cheng Zhang,Anirudh Goyal,Alan Schelten*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: "Compute as Teacher (CaT)" uses a model's inference-time exploration to synthesize reference-free supervision, enhancing task performance in verifiable and non-verifiable tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the question of generating learning signals in the absence of ground truth during post-training.

Method: CaT synthesizes a reference signal from multiple rollouts using a frozen initial policy. Rewards are calculated based on programmatic equivalence or independent scoring by another LLM.

Result: CaT improves performance of models, achieving significant advancements in tasks like MATH-500 (+27% improvement) and HealthBench (+12%). Additional improvements (+33% and +30%) are noted with RL-based fine-tuning.

Conclusion: The proposed CaT framework turns extra compute into effective supervision, scaling with rollouts and even surpassing the initial teacher signal.

Abstract: Where do learning signals come from when there is no ground truth in
post-training? We propose turning exploration into supervision through Compute
as Teacher (CaT), which converts the model's own exploration at inference-time
into reference-free supervision by synthesizing a single reference from a group
of parallel rollouts and then optimizing toward it. Concretely, the current
policy produces a group of rollouts; a frozen anchor (the initial policy)
reconciles omissions and contradictions to estimate a reference, turning extra
inference-time compute into a teacher signal. We turn this into rewards in two
regimes: (i) verifiable tasks use programmatic equivalence on final answers;
(ii) non-verifiable tasks use self-proposed rubrics-binary, auditable criteria
scored by an independent LLM judge, with reward given by the fraction
satisfied. Unlike selection methods (best-of-N, majority, perplexity, or judge
scores), synthesis may disagree with the majority and be correct even when all
rollouts are wrong; performance scales with the number of rollouts. As a
test-time procedure, CaT improves Gemma 3 4B, Qwen 3 4B, and Llama 3.1 8B (up
to +27% on MATH-500; +12% on HealthBench). With reinforcement learning
(CaT-RL), we obtain further gains (up to +33% and +30%), with the trained
policy surpassing the initial teacher signal.

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: This paper proposes a bio-inspired algorithm (SHMS) to optimize the weight of steeped-transmission shafts under fatigue, bending, torsion loads, and Goodman criteria. MDSOLIDS software was used for modeling forces, while results were validated with ANSYS Workbench.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Steeped-transmission shafts are critical components subjected to complex loading conditions; optimizing their design is essential to improve efficiency and reduce material use.

Method: The bio-inspired Snail Homing and Mating Search (SHMS) algorithm is employed for weight optimization, using a penalty function approach to handle constraints. Force and bending diagrams are modeled mathematically, and results are validated using simulation tools like ANSYS Workbench.

Result: The SHMS algorithm produced optimal shaft designs with reasonable computational costs. Statistical results were generated for CAD models, and deflection comparisons between SHMS outcomes and ANSYS simulations show agreement.

Conclusion: The research successfully demonstrated the utility of SHMS for weight optimization in complex shaft designs, validating its effectiveness through computational simulations and CAD modeling.

Abstract: In this paper, the steeped-transmission shaft design problem is proposed for
weight optimization. The bio-inspired search-based Snail Homing and Mating
Search (SHMS) algorithm is utilized to solve the problem. It is inspired by the
social behaviour of snails and their inherent nature of finding better homes,
and mate. The proposed steeped-transmission shaft design problem is modelled
considering the fatigue loading, combined bending, torsion loads, and the
principle of Modified Goodman criteria. The forces diagram and the bending
moment diagrams are obtained using the MDSOLIDS software. The forces and
bending moment are then used to mathematical model the objective function and
constraints. The SHMS algorithm has yielded the desired solution with
reasonable computational cost. The constraints are handled using a static
penalty function approach. The statistical results obtained using SHMS
algorithm are further used for generating CAD model. The analysis is carried
out in ANSYS Workbench. Further, the deflection obtained from SHMS algorithm
and ANSYS Workbench are compared and results are discussed in details.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the need for ultra-low power, stand-alone computing for environmental monitoring in modern agriculture, particularly for optimal water usage.

Method: Developed a neuromorphic system using spiking neural networks, tested with real-world soil data on a mixed-signal neuromorphic processor to compare irrigation decisions against conventional methods.

Result: Validated the approach with soil moisture data from apple and kiwi orchards, showing that the neuromorphic system accurately matched conventional irrigation commands across soil depths.

Conclusion: Local neuromorphic inference is effective and energy-efficient for scalable, autonomous, and sustainable irrigation solutions.

Abstract: Sensory processing at the edge requires ultra-low power stand-alone computing
technologies. This is particularly true for modern agriculture and precision
irrigation systems which aim to optimize water usage by monitoring key
environmental observables continuously using distributed efficient embedded
processing elements. Neuromorphic processing systems are emerging as a
promising technology for extreme edge-computing applications that need to run
on resource-constrained hardware. As such, they are a very good candidate for
implementing efficient water management systems based on data measured from
soil and plants, across large fields. In this work, we present a fully
energy-efficient neuromorphic irrigation control system that operates
autonomously without any need for data transmission or remote processing.
Leveraging the properties of a biologically realistic spiking neural network,
our system performs computation, and decision-making locally. We validate this
approach using real-world soil moisture data from apple and kiwi orchards
applied to a mixed-signal neuromorphic processor, and show that the generated
irrigation commands closely match those derived from conventional methods
across different soil depths. Our results show that local neuromorphic
inference can maintain decision accuracy, paving the way for autonomous,
sustainable irrigation solutions at scale.

*Danila Valko,Rohan Paranjpe,Jorge Marx Gómez*

Main category: cs.PF

TL;DR: This paper evaluates the Bounded Multi-Source Shortest Path (BMSSP) algorithm, recently proposed as asymptotically faster than Dijkstra's algorithm, for routing in Payment Channel Networks like the Lightning Network. Empirical results suggest BMSSP does not significantly outperform Dijkstra's in practice.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess if the theoretically faster BMSSP algorithm can improve payment pathfinding in Payment Channel Networks over the widely used Dijkstra's algorithm.

Method: Implemented BMSSP in Rust and compared its performance with Dijkstra's using real-world Lightning Network topology data, conducting randomized trials and statistical tests for evaluation.

Result: Empirical evaluation reveals that BMSSP does not provide significant performance improvements over Dijkstra's in practice, with smaller-than-expected speedups, possibly due to implementation overheads.

Conclusion: Current BMSSP implementations are not practically advantageous over Dijkstra's for Payment Channel Networks, but the evaluation highlights potential for future algorithmic and implementation improvements.

Abstract: Efficient routing is critical for payment channel networks (PCNs) such as the
Lightning Network (LN), where most clients currently rely on Dijkstra-based
algorithms for payment pathfinding. While Dijkstra's algorithm has long been
regarded as optimal on sparse graphs, recent theoretical work challenges this
view. The new Bounded Multi-Source Shortest Path (BMSSP) algorithm by Duan et
al. theoretically achieves $O(m~log^{2/3}~n)$ runtime, which is asymptotically
faster than Dijkstra's $O(m + n~log~n)$ on sparse directed graphs. In this
paper, we implement BMSSP on Rust and compare its performance against
Dijkstra's using real LN topology data. Our evaluation, based on multiple
randomized trials and statistical tests, shows that current implementations of
BMSSP do not significantly outperform Dijkstra's in practice, and speedups are
smaller than what theory predicts, possibly due to implementation and constant
factor overheads. These results provide the first empirical evidence of BMSSP's
potential to accelerate LN routing and inform future optimizations of PCN
pathfinding algorithms.

### [217] [Catalpa: GC for a Low-Variance Software Stack](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13429)
*Anthony Arnold,Mark Marron*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Catalpa garbage collector designed for the Bosque programming language, aiming for low latency, bounded pauses, and fixed memory overheads.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Industrial developers prioritize tail-latencies (e.g., 95th and 99th percentiles) as a key factor for user experience over average response time.

Method: The Catalpa garbage collector leverages specific programming language features like immutability and reference-cycle freedom in Bosque to minimize latency, avoid synchronization barriers, and ensure memory-efficient collection pauses.

Result: The Catalpa garbage collector achieves bounded collection pauses, fixed-constant memory overheads, and eliminates synchronization barriers with application code.

Conclusion: The design successfully supports low-latency, reduced variability, and high throughput for modern applications prioritizing tail-latencies.

Abstract: The performance of an application/runtime is usually conceptualized as a
continuous function where, the lower the amount of memory/time used on a given
workload, then the better the compiler/runtime is. However, in practice, good
performance of an application is viewed as more of a binary function - either
the application responds in under, say 100 ms, and is fast enough for a user to
barely notice, or it takes a noticeable amount of time, leaving the user
waiting and potentially abandoning the task. Thus, performance really means how
often the application is fast enough to be usable, leading industrial
developers to focus on the 95th and 99th percentile tail-latencies as heavily,
or moreso, than average response time. Our vision is to create a software stack
that actively supports these needs via programming language and runtime system
design. In this paper we present a novel garbage-collector design, the Catalpa
collector, for the Bosque programming language and runtime. This allocator is
designed to minimize latency and variability while maintaining high-throughput
and incurring small memory overheads. To achieve these goals we leverage
various features of the Bosque language, including immutability and
reference-cycle freedom, to construct a collector that has bounded collection
pauses, incurs fixed-constant memory overheads, and does not require any
barriers or synchronization with application code.

*Chester J. F. Gould,William J. Bowman*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: The paper explores methods for comparing syntax-directed and type-directed equality in type-checking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate the performance and expressiveness trade-offs between syntax-directed and type-directed equality in dependent type-checking.

Method: Develop a comparative platform to analyze the performance gap of the two approaches.

Result: Quantifies the performance differences and identifies areas for improvement in type-directed equality.

Conclusion: Provides insights into optimizing type-directed equality checking to reduce its performance disadvantage.

Abstract: A key part of any dependent type-checker is the method for checking whether
two types are equal. A common claim is that syntax-directed equality is more
performant, although type-directed equality is more expressive. However, this
claim is difficult to make precise, since implementations choose only one or
the other approach, making a direct comparison impossible. We present some
work-in-progress developing a realistic platform for direct, apples-to-apples,
comparison of the two approaches, quantifying how much slower type-directed
equality checking is, and analyzing why and how it can be improved.

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: CLMTracing is a framework designed for user-level tracing in black-box code language models (code LMs). It improves watermark robustness and withstands removal attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind the study is to address intellectual property protection challenges posed by open-source code language models by enabling individual user tracing.

Method: The framework uses rule-based watermarks, utility-preserving injection methods, parameter selection algorithms sensitive to watermark robustness, and adversarial training.

Result: CLMTracing performs effectively across multiple SOTA code LMs, showing enhanced robustness and minimal impact on utility when compared with existing baselines.

Conclusion: The proposed framework significantly advances watermarking techniques, offering improved tracing capabilities and robustness against removal attacks, making it suitable for protecting code LM intellectual property.

Abstract: With the widespread adoption of open-source code language models (code LMs),
intellectual property (IP) protection has become an increasingly critical
concern. While current watermarking techniques have the potential to identify
the code LM to protect its IP, they have limitations when facing the more
practical and complex demand, i.e., offering the individual user-level tracing
in the black-box setting. This work presents CLMTracing, a black-box code LM
watermarking framework employing the rule-based watermarks and
utility-preserving injection method for user-level model tracing. CLMTracing
further incorporates a parameter selection algorithm sensitive to the robust
watermark and adversarial training to enhance the robustness against watermark
removal attacks. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate CLMTracing is effective
across multiple state-of-the-art (SOTA) code LMs, showing significant harmless
improvements compared to existing SOTA baselines and strong robustness against
various removal attacks.

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: The paper examines efficient and provably correct Sequential Monte Carlo inference for Probabilistic Programs, introducing new semantics and a vectorized Particle Filtering algorithm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the reliability and efficiency of probabilistic programming inference methods, especially for programs with complex structures like unbounded loops.

Method: Developed expectation-based semantics for probabilistic programs, proved a finite approximation theorem, and introduced a vectorized Particle Filtering algorithm called VPF.

Result: The vectorized Particle Filtering algorithm showed promising experimental outcomes compared to existing probabilistic programming inference tools.

Conclusion: The results suggest the approach enhances the consistency and efficiency of probabilistic programming inference methods without compromising theoretical correctness.

Abstract: We study provably correct and efficient instantiations of Sequential Monte
Carlo (SMC) inference in the context of formal operational semantics of
Probabilistic Programs (PPs). We focus on universal PPs featuring sampling from
arbitrary measures and conditioning/reweighting in unbounded loops. We first
equip Probabilistic Program Graphs (PPGs), an automata-theoretic description
format of PPs, with an expectation-based semantics over infinite execution
traces, which also incorporates trace weights. We then prove a finite
approximation theorem that provides bounds to this semantics based on
expectations taken over finite, fixed-length traces. This enables us to frame
our semantics within a Feynman-Kac (FK) model, and ensures the consistency of
the Particle Filtering (PF) algorithm, an instance of SMC, with respect to our
semantics. Building on these results, we introduce VPF, a vectorized version of
the PF algorithm tailored to PPGs and our semantics. Experiments conducted with
a proof-of-concept implementation of VPF show very promising results compared
to state-of-the-art PP inference tools.

Motivation: The study aims to address the challenges in UAV cellular communications operating beyond visual line of sight (BVLoS), focusing on enhancing connectivity and safe operation.

Method: The approach utilizes reinforcement learning by training an agent with a reward function based on the quality of communication links between UAVs and ground base stations.

Result: Simulation results confirm the RL agent's ability to effectively plan feasible UAV paths while ensuring maximum connectivity with base stations.

Conclusion: This method improves UAV cellular communications for BVLoS operations and can serve as an offline path-planning module for future ground control systems, supporting complex long-range applications.

Abstract: This paper presents a reinforcement learning (RL) based approach for path
planning of cellular connected unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) operating beyond
visual line of sight (BVLoS). The objective is to minimize travel distance
while maximizing the quality of cellular link connectivity by considering real
world aerial coverage constraints and employing an empirical aerial channel
model. The proposed solution employs RL techniques to train an agent, using the
quality of communication links between the UAV and base stations (BSs) as the
reward function. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed method in training the agent and generating feasible UAV path plans.
The proposed approach addresses the challenges due to limitations in UAV
cellular communications, highlighting the need for investigations and
considerations in this area. The RL algorithm efficiently identifies optimal
paths, ensuring maximum connectivity with ground BSs to ensure safe and
reliable BVLoS flight operation. Moreover, the solution can be deployed as an
offline path planning module that can be integrated into future ground control

Motivation: Improve robot localization accuracy and robustness to perceptual aliasing for indoor scenes based on RGB image data.

Method: The loss function is adjusted to better fuse positional and rotational errors, and a pose-labeled dataset from photogrammetry data is used for local model training.

Result: Localization performance improved with positional and rotational error reductions of up to 9.64% and 2.99%, achieving 0.11m and 0.89° accuracy in local environments.

Conclusion: Introduced a complete pipeline for robust robotic navigation in real indoor environments, validated by real-time testing on TurtleBot.

Abstract: In this work, an existing deep neural network approach for determining a
robot's pose from visual information (RGB images) is modified, improving its
localization performance without impacting its ease of training. Explicitly,
the network's loss function is extended in a manner which intuitively combines
the positional and rotational error in order to increase robustness to
perceptual aliasing. An improvement in the localization accuracy for indoor
scenes is observed: with decreases of up to 9.64% and 2.99% in the median
positional and rotational error respectively, when compared to the unmodified
network.
  Additionally, photogrammetry data is used to produce a pose-labelled dataset
which allows the above model to be trained on a local environment, resulting in
localization accuracies of 0.11m & 0.89 degrees. This trained model forms the
basis of a navigation algorithm, which is tested in real-time on a TurtleBot (a
wheeled robotic device). As such, this work introduces a full pipeline for
creating a robust navigational algorithm for any given real world indoor scene;

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the challenge of label inefficiency in training grasp joint-angle prediction models, particularly for robotics applications, by utilizing self-supervised pretraining.

Method: They employ a Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture (Point-JEPA) with pretrained encoders on ShapeNet to process tokenized point clouds and train a lightweight multi-hypothesis head using evaluation metrics like top-logit selection.

Result: Point-JEPA demonstrates up to a 26% reduction in root-mean-square error (RMSE) in low-label regimes compared to fully supervised methods, and performs equivalently in high-label scenarios.

Conclusion: JEPA-style pretraining is shown to be effective for data-efficient grasp learning, offering practical benefits for robotics tasks requiring joint-angle predictions.

Abstract: We investigate whether 3D self-supervised pretraining with a Joint-Embedding
Predictive Architecture (Point-JEPA) enables label-efficient grasp joint-angle
prediction. Using point clouds tokenized from meshes and a ShapeNet-pretrained
Point-JEPA encoder, we train a lightweight multi-hypothesis head with
winner-takes-all and evaluate by top-logit selection. On DLR-Hand II with
object-level splits, Point-JEPA reduces RMSE by up to 26% in low-label regimes
and reaches parity with full supervision. These results suggest JEPA-style
pretraining is a practical approach for data-efficient grasp learning.

Motivation: The current methods used in human-robot interaction lack the tools to adequately model social interactions and customer needs.

Method: Role-play was utilized to simulate pharmacy scenarios with pharmacists modeling robots, while Hierarchical Task Analysis structured and validated the robot behavior designs.

Result: These methods provided advantages, such as understanding customer needs, modeling correct robot behaviors, and facilitating co-design in development.

Conclusion: Role-play and Hierarchical Task Analysis offer substantial benefits in designing social robot behaviors, and future research should aim to adapt task analysis methods specifically for social contexts.

Abstract: We present the use of two methods we believe warrant more use than they
currently have in the field of human-robot interaction: role-play and
Hierarchical Task Analysis. Some of its potential is showcased through our use
of them in an ongoing research project which entails developing a robot
application meant to assist at a community pharmacy. The two methods have
provided us with several advantages. The role-playing provided a controlled and
adjustable environment for understanding the customers' needs where pharmacists
could act as models for the robot's behavior; and the Hierarchical Task
Analysis ensured the behavior displayed was modelled correctly and aided
development through facilitating co-design. Future research could focus on

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the integration of Large Language Model (LLM) agents with adaptive controllers for autonomous spacecraft operations, addressing the challenges of resource constraints and real-time decision-making.

Method: The paper introduces an asynchronous architecture combining a resource-constrained LLM agent with a reinforcement learning controller, tested through ground experiments and validated aboard the International Space Station (ISS).

Result: Ground experiments demonstrated improved thermal stability and reduced violations under LLM-guided supervision; however, on-orbit validation showed degradation due to inference latency mismatched with LEO satellite thermal cycles.

Conclusion: Agentic LLM-based systems show promise for autonomous spacecraft operations but require design modifications to address inference latency and environmental challenges in real flight settings.

Abstract: This paper presents ASTREA, the first agentic system deployed on
flight-heritage hardware (TRL 9) for autonomous spacecraft operations. Using
thermal control as a representative use case, we integrate a
resource-constrained Large Language Model (LLM) agent with a reinforcement
learning controller in an asynchronous architecture tailored for
space-qualified platforms. Ground experiments show that LLM-guided supervision
improves thermal stability and reduces violations, confirming the feasibility
of combining semantic reasoning with adaptive control under hardware
constraints. However, on-orbit validation aboard the International Space
Station (ISS) reveals performance degradation caused by inference latency
mismatched with the rapid thermal cycles characteristic of Low Earth Orbit
(LEO) satellites. These results highlight both the opportunities and current
limitations of agentic LLM-based systems in real flight environments, providing
practical design guidelines for future space autonomy.

TL;DR: The paper introduces an insect-inspired visual neural perception model, emulating fly escape behavior, for robots to achieve efficient collision detection and evasion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Developing agile and computationally efficient collision-detection mechanisms for robots, inspired by the visual intelligence of flies.

Method: Embedded a fly-inspired LPLC2 neural model in a micro robot's vision system, optimized memory usage, and implemented multi-attention mechanisms for selective responses.

Result: The proposed model achieved 96.1% collision detection success rate and demonstrated adaptive and elegant evasive maneuvers, comparable to state-of-the-art systems.

Conclusion: This work underscores the effectiveness of fly-inspired visuomotor control in robotic systems and its potential contribution to insect intelligence and collective behavior studies.

Abstract: Anyone who has tried to swat a fly has likely been frustrated by its
remarkable agility.This ability stems from its visual neural perception system,
particularly the collision-selective neurons within its small brain.For
autonomous robots operating in complex and unfamiliar environments, achieving
similar agility is highly desirable but often constrained by the trade-off
between computational cost and performance.In this context, insect-inspired
intelligence offers a parsimonious route to low-power, computationally
efficient frameworks.In this paper, we propose an attention-driven visuomotor
control strategy inspired by a specific class of fly visual projection
neurons-the lobula plate/lobula column type-2 (LPLC2)-and their associated
escape behaviors.To our knowledge, this represents the first embodiment of an
LPLC2 neural model in the embedded vision of a physical mobile robot, enabling
collision perception and reactive evasion.The model was simplified and
optimized at 70KB in memory to suit the computational constraints of a
vision-based micro robot, the Colias, while preserving key neural perception
mechanisms.We further incorporated multi-attention mechanisms to emulate the
distributed nature of LPLC2 responses, allowing the robot to detect and react
to approaching targets both rapidly and selectively.We systematically evaluated
the proposed method against a state-of-the-art locust-inspired collision
detection model.Results showed that the fly-inspired visuomotor model achieved
comparable robustness, at success rate of 96.1% in collision detection while
producing more adaptive and elegant evasive maneuvers.Beyond demonstrating an
effective collision-avoidance strategy, this work highlights the potential of
fly-inspired neural models for advancing research into collective behaviors in
insect intelligence.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to address the challenge of efficient collaboration among AUVs while minimizing exposure risks in hostile underwater environments.

Method: The framework employs a dual time-scale approach. A high-level component selects participants for the task based on a central AUV, while a low-level component optimizes power and trajectory control to reduce exposure probabilities.

Result: Simulation results demonstrate rapid convergence, superior performance compared to benchmark algorithms, and effective optimization of cooperative efficiency while maintaining covert operations.

Conclusion: The proposed H-MAPPO framework successfully ensures efficient collaboration among AUVs in adversarial scenarios while minimizing exposure risks, presenting a promising solution for underwater cooperative missions.

Abstract: Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) have shown great potential for
cooperative detection and reconnaissance. However, collaborative AUV
communications introduce risks of exposure. In adversarial environments,
achieving efficient collaboration while ensuring covert operations becomes a
key challenge for underwater cooperative missions. In this paper, we propose a
novel dual time-scale Hierarchical Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization

participating in the task based on a central AUV, while the low-level component
reduces exposure probabilities through power and trajectory control by the

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: VEGA is a software tool enabling electric vehicle navigation, combining physics-informed learning and reinforcement learning to optimize paths with efficient charging stops, all without requiring additional sensors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the demand for optimized navigation for software-defined electric vehicles by leveraging onboard computational power without relying on expensive sensors.

Method: The method involves two components: (1) a Physics-Informed Neural Operator (PINO) trained on vehicle speed and battery logs to model vehicle dynamics, and (2) a Reinforcement Learning agent to compute charge-aware routes optimizing stops and dwell times while considering battery state constraints.

Result: VEGA demonstrated functionality by closely matching Tesla Trip Planner's results during tests on long routes, maintaining conservative estimates due to real vehicle conditions. It also showed global generalizability in regions outside its training set.

Conclusion: VEGA highlights the feasibility of combining physics-informed AI and reinforcement learning for efficient electric vehicle navigation, showcasing potential cost reductions by relying purely on onboard computations.

Abstract: Demands for software-defined vehicles (SDV) are rising and electric vehicles
(EVs) are increasingly being equipped with powerful computers. This enables
onboard AI systems to optimize charge-aware path optimization customized to
reflect vehicle's current condition and environment. We present VEGA, a
charge-aware EV navigation agent that plans over a charger-annotated road graph
using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) with budgeted A* teacher-student
guidance under state-of-charge (SoC) feasibility. VEGA consists of two modules.
First, a physics-informed neural operator (PINO), trained on real vehicle speed
and battery-power logs, uses recent vehicle speed logs to estimate aerodynamic
drag, rolling resistance, mass, motor and regenerative-braking efficiencies,
and auxiliary load by learning a vehicle-custom dynamics. Second, a
Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent uses these dynamics to optimize a path with
optimal charging stops and dwell times under SoC constraints. VEGA requires no
additional sensors and uses only vehicle speed signals. It may serve as a
virtual sensor for power and efficiency to potentially reduce EV cost. In
evaluation on long routes like San Francisco to New York, VEGA's stops, dwell
times, SoC management, and total travel time closely track Tesla Trip Planner
while being slightly more conservative, presumably due to real vehicle
conditions such as vehicle parameter drift due to deterioration. Although
trained only in U.S. regions, VEGA was able to compute optimal charge-aware
paths in France and Japan, demonstrating generalizability. It achieves
practical integration of physics-informed learning and RL for EV eco-routing.

*Wei-Chen Li,Glen Chou*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper presents a computational simulator for frictional interactions between filaments and rigid bodies, offering a global optimality solution for complex manipulations, such as shoelace tying.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Simulating filament interactions with rigid bodies is computationally difficult due to their codimensional nature; existing methods lack accurate frictional modeling.

Method: The framework combines discrete elastic rod modeling, a pressure field patch contact model, and convex contact formulation to achieve precise frictional simulations.

Result: The framework achieved accurate frictional force modeling and demonstrated its utility in scenarios like a filament-based gripper and shoelace tying.

Conclusion: This work enables reliable simulation of complex filament and rigid body interactions, advancing fields like soft robotics and deformable object manipulation.

Abstract: We present a computational framework for simulating filaments interacting
with rigid bodies through contact. Filaments are challenging to simulate due to
their codimensionality, i.e., they are one-dimensional structures embedded in
three-dimensional space. Existing methods often assume that filaments remain
permanently attached to rigid bodies. Our framework unifies discrete elastic
rod (DER) modeling, a pressure field patch contact model, and a convex contact
formulation to accurately simulate frictional interactions between slender
filaments and rigid bodies - capabilities not previously achievable. Owing to
the convex formulation of contact, each time step can be solved to global
optimality, guaranteeing complementarity between contact velocity and impulse.
We validate the framework by assessing the accuracy of frictional forces and
comparing its physical fidelity against baseline methods. Finally, we
demonstrate its applicability in both soft robotics, such as a stochastic
filament-based gripper, and deformable object manipulation, such as shoelace
tying, providing a versatile simulator for systems involving complex
filament-filament and filament-rigid body interactions.

TL;DR: The paper presents an output-space control method for robotic systems to handle path interruptions safely and efficiently return to planned paths.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to enable robotic systems to handle interruptions caused by external factors (e.g., people or objects) while ensuring safety and maintaining motion plan adherence.

Method: The method involves offline reachability checks for speed/acceleration limits and an online quadratic program to track motion plans. A one-step reachability test ensures error correction with a KKT-inspired weight.

Result: The system efficiently handles safety stops and unplanned deviations, allowing the robot to resume planned paths without replanning. Improved performance is demonstrated over pure pursuit in simulations.

Conclusion: The proposed method enhances safety and efficiency in robotic motion planning, ensuring reliable return to planned paths after interruptions.

Abstract: Many robotic systems must follow planned paths yet pause safely and resume
when people or objects intervene. We present an output-space method for systems
whose tracked output can be feedback-linearized to a double integrator (e.g.,
manipulators). The approach has two parts. Offline, we perform a pre-run
reachability check to verify that the motion plan respects speed and
acceleration magnitude limits. Online, we apply a quadratic program to track
the motion plan under the same limits. We use a one-step reachability test to
bound the maximum disturbance the system is capable of rejecting. When the
state coincides with the reference path we recover perfect tracking in the
deterministic case, and we correct errors using a KKT-inspired weight. We
demonstrate that safety stops and unplanned deviations are handled efficiently,
and the system returns to the motion plan without replanning. We demonstrate
our system's improved performance over pure pursuit in simulation.

TL;DR: This paper focuses on a novel reinforcement learning framework for humanoid robots that combines human motion prior and neural signed distance field representation to achieve robust whole-body manipulation for bulky objects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional end-effector grasping methods for humanoid robots face limitations in scenarios involving bulky objects due to stability and payload constraints.

Method: The paper uses a reinforcement learning framework with a teacher-student architecture that integrates a human motion prior and a neural signed distance field. This enables kinematically natural, coordinated, and physically feasible whole-body motion for embracing tasks.

Result: The approach demonstrated improved adaptability to objects of varying shapes and sizes in simulations and real-world experiments, achieving successful sim-to-real transfer in tasks involving humanoid robots.

Conclusion: The proposed framework is an effective and practical solution for enabling stable, multi-contact, and long-horizon whole-body manipulation tasks in humanoid robots.

Abstract: Whole-body manipulation (WBM) for humanoid robots presents a promising
approach for executing embracing tasks involving bulky objects, where
traditional grasping relying on end-effectors only remains limited in such
scenarios due to inherent stability and payload constraints. This paper
introduces a reinforcement learning framework that integrates a pre-trained
human motion prior with a neural signed distance field (NSDF) representation to
achieve robust whole-body embracing. Our method leverages a teacher-student
architecture to distill large-scale human motion data, generating kinematically
natural and physically feasible whole-body motion patterns. This facilitates
coordinated control across the arms and torso, enabling stable multi-contact
interactions that enhance the robustness in manipulation and also the load
capacity. The embedded NSDF further provides accurate and continuous geometric
perception, improving contact awareness throughout long-horizon tasks. We
thoroughly evaluate the approach through comprehensive simulations and
real-world experiments. The results demonstrate improved adaptability to
diverse shapes and sizes of objects and also successful sim-to-real transfer.
These indicate that the proposed framework offers an effective and practical
solution for multi-contact and long-horizon WBM tasks of humanoid robots.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel pipeline that generates real-time, semantically informed 3D reconstructions of central airways using monocular endoscopic video. It combines a SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) method with a segmentation model for accurate and quick identification of obstructive tissues.


<details>

Motivation: Central Airway Obstruction (CAO) is a critical condition caused by tumors that carry severe risks when treated with traditional methods. The authors aim to address the shortcomings of current medical interventions by leveraging robotic automation and scene understanding.

Method: The proposed method integrates DROID-SLAM for real-time 3D reconstruction of the airway with a segmentation model designed to identify obstructive tissues. Together, these components annotate obstruction regions in the 3D geometry of the airway.

Result: The pipeline demonstrates high similarity between its 3D reconstructions and ground truth CT scans, achieving a 0.62 mm Chamfer distance. It is faster and more accurate compared to previous methods, producing real-time annotated 3D maps that are clinically relevant.

Conclusion: This work is pioneering in combining semantic segmentation with real-time SLAM for CAO scenarios using endoscopic video. It establishes a modular framework that generalizes across anatomical regions, signaling an advance toward autonomous robotic surgical interventions.

Abstract: Central airway obstruction (CAO) is a life-threatening condition with
increasing incidence, caused by tumors in and outside of the airway.
Traditional treatment methods such as bronchoscopy and electrocautery can be
used to remove the tumor completely; however, these methods carry a high risk
of complications. Recent advances allow robotic interventions with lesser risk.
The combination of robot interventions with scene understanding and mapping
also opens up the possibilities for automation. We present a novel pipeline
that enables real-time, semantically informed 3D reconstructions of the central
airway using monocular endoscopic video.
  Our approach combines DROID-SLAM with a segmentation model trained to
identify obstructive tissues. The SLAM module reconstructs the 3D geometry of
the airway in real time, while the segmentation masks guide the annotation of
obstruction regions within the reconstructed point cloud. To validate our
pipeline, we evaluate the reconstruction quality using ex vivo models.
  Qualitative and quantitative results show high similarity between ground
truth CT scans and the 3D reconstructions (0.62 mm Chamfer distance). By
integrating segmentation directly into the SLAM workflow, our system produces
annotated 3D maps that highlight clinically relevant regions in real time.
High-speed capabilities of the pipeline allows quicker reconstructions compared
to previous work, reflecting the surgical scene more accurately.
  To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to integrate semantic
segmentation with real-time monocular SLAM for endoscopic CAO scenarios. Our
framework is modular and can generalize to other anatomies or procedures with
minimal changes, offering a promising step toward autonomous robotic
interventions.

### [233] [Using Visual Language Models to Control Bionic Hands: Assessment of Object Perception and Grasp Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13572)
*Ozan Karaali,Hossam Farag,Strahinja Dosen,Cedomir Stefanovic*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper assesses the use of Vision Language Models (VLMs) for enhancing semi-autonomous prosthetic hands. It proposes a benchmark for integrated perception and grasp inference, tested across eight VLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to explore whether VLMs can replace complex pipelines in prosthetic applications by handling integrated tasks like object detection and grasp inference in a more streamlined way.

Method: Eight contemporary VLMs were tested with a dataset of 34 images. Each model had to identify object properties and infer grasp parameters from static images via structured JSON prompts. Performance metrics such as accuracy, numerical estimation errors, latency, and cost were evaluated.

Result: VLMs performed well in object identification and shape recognition, but showed mixed accuracy in dimension estimation and grasp parameter inference, specifically in hand rotation and aperture.

Conclusion: VLMs show significant potential for bionic applications but face limitations in precise grasp parameter computation, requiring further improvement for optimal prosthetic use.

Abstract: This study examines the potential of utilizing Vision Language Models (VLMs)
to improve the perceptual capabilities of semi-autonomous prosthetic hands. We
introduce a unified benchmark for end-to-end perception and grasp inference,
evaluating a single VLM to perform tasks that traditionally require complex
pipelines with separate modules for object detection, pose estimation, and
grasp planning. To establish the feasibility and current limitations of this
approach, we benchmark eight contemporary VLMs on their ability to perform a
unified task essential for bionic grasping. From a single static image, they
should (1) identify common objects and their key properties (name, shape,
orientation, and dimensions), and (2) infer appropriate grasp parameters (grasp
type, wrist rotation, hand aperture, and number of fingers). A corresponding
prompt requesting a structured JSON output was employed with a dataset of 34
snapshots of common objects. Key performance metrics, including accuracy for
categorical attributes (e.g., object name, shape) and errors in numerical
estimates (e.g., dimensions, hand aperture), along with latency and cost, were
analyzed. The results demonstrated that most models exhibited high performance
in object identification and shape recognition, while accuracy in estimating
dimensions and inferring optimal grasp parameters, particularly hand rotation
and aperture, varied more significantly. This work highlights the current
capabilities and limitations of VLMs as advanced perceptual modules for
semi-autonomous control of bionic limbs, demonstrating their potential for
effective prosthetic applications.

### [234] [Dense-Jump Flow Matching with Non-Uniform Time Scheduling for Robotic Policies: Mitigating Multi-Step Inference Degradation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13574)
*Zidong Chen,Zihao Guo,Peng Wang,ThankGod Itua Egbe,Yan Lyu,Chenghao Qian*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper addresses limitations in flow matching for robotics by proposing a novel policy that improves performance through time scheduling and one-step learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from recognizing performance degradation in flow matching due to oversampling late-time regions and instability in velocity fields.

Method: The authors introduce a policy with non-uniform temporal scheduling during training and a dense-jump integration method during inference.

Result: The proposed method achieves up to 23.7% performance improvement over state-of-the-art methods in diverse robotic tasks.

Conclusion: The research offers a solution to saturation and instability in flow matching, improving generalization and efficiency in robotic policy learning.

Abstract: Flow matching has emerged as a competitive framework for learning
high-quality generative policies in robotics; however, we find that
generalisation arises and saturates early along the flow trajectory, in
accordance with recent findings in the literature. We further observe that
increasing the number of Euler integration steps during inference
counter-intuitively and universally degrades policy performance. We attribute
this to (i) additional, uniformly spaced integration steps oversample the
late-time region, thereby constraining actions towards the training
trajectories and reducing generalisation; and (ii) the learned velocity field
becoming non-Lipschitz as integration time approaches 1, causing instability.
To address these issues, we propose a novel policy that utilises non-uniform
time scheduling (e.g., U-shaped) during training, which emphasises both early
and late temporal stages to regularise policy training, and a dense-jump
integration schedule at inference, which uses a single-step integration to
replace the multi-step integration beyond a jump point, to avoid unstable areas
around 1. Essentially, our policy is an efficient one-step learner that still
pushes forward performance through multi-step integration, yielding up to 23.7%
performance gains over state-of-the-art baselines across diverse robotic tasks.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: TreeIRL combines MCTS and IRL to achieve state-of-the-art autonomous driving performance in both simulation and real-world tests across diverse conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for a planner that balances safety, progress, comfort, and human-likeness in autonomous driving, especially under real-world conditions.

Method: TreeIRL integrates MCTS to generate safe trajectory candidates and uses a deep IRL scoring function to select the most human-like trajectory.

Result: TreeIRL outperforms classical and state-of-the-art planners in simulations and over 500+ miles of real-world driving in Las Vegas, handling dense urban traffic, adaptive cruise control, cut-ins, and traffic lights.

Conclusion: TreeIRL is a highly extensible planner that demonstrates the first MCTS-based planning on public roads and provides a strong framework for improving autonomous driving through hybrid learning-based approaches.

Abstract: We present TreeIRL, a novel planner for autonomous driving that combines
Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) and inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) to
achieve state-of-the-art performance in simulation and in real-world driving.
The core idea is to use MCTS to find a promising set of safe candidate
trajectories and a deep IRL scoring function to select the most human-like
among them. We evaluate TreeIRL against both classical and state-of-the-art
planners in large-scale simulations and on 500+ miles of real-world autonomous
driving in the Las Vegas metropolitan area. Test scenarios include dense urban
traffic, adaptive cruise control, cut-ins, and traffic lights. TreeIRL achieves
the best overall performance, striking a balance between safety, progress,
comfort, and human-likeness. To our knowledge, our work is the first
demonstration of MCTS-based planning on public roads and underscores the
importance of evaluating planners across a diverse set of metrics and in
real-world environments. TreeIRL is highly extensible and could be further
improved with reinforcement learning and imitation learning, providing a
framework for exploring different combinations of classical and learning-based
approaches to solve the planning bottleneck in autonomous driving.

*Amir-Hossein Shahidzadeh,Jiyue Zhu,Kezhou Chen,Sha Yi,Cornelia Fermüller,Yiannis Aloimonos,Xiaolong Wang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper proposes a bimanual robotic system that uses reinforcement learning to estimate object poses via sensorimotor exploration with tactile data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of robust object pose estimation in scenarios with limited visual data or adverse conditions like occlusions, lighting issues, or complex appearances.

Method: The authors employ a bimanual robotic setup where one hand holds the object steady while the other actively explores it using reinforcement learning to collect and refine tactile data into 3D point clouds for iterative pose and shape refinement.

Result: Their system successfully identifies critical object pose features without requiring prior knowledge of the object's geometry.

Conclusion: The proposed method demonstrates that active, tactile-based exploration is a viable approach to improve object pose estimation in robotic manipulation tasks where visual information is unreliable.

Abstract: Robust object pose estimation is essential for manipulation and interaction
tasks in robotics, particularly in scenarios where visual data is limited or
sensitive to lighting, occlusions, and appearances. Tactile sensors often offer
limited and local contact information, making it challenging to reconstruct the
pose from partial data. Our approach uses sensorimotor exploration to actively
control a robot hand to interact with the object. We train with Reinforcement
Learning (RL) to explore and collect tactile data. The collected 3D point
clouds are used to iteratively refine the object's shape and pose. In our
setup, one hand holds the object steady while the other performs active
exploration. We show that our method can actively explore an object's surface
to identify critical pose features without prior knowledge of the object's
geometry. Supplementary material and more demonstrations will be provided at

*Xiao Liu,Weijun Wang,Tianlun Huang,Zhiyong Wang,Wei Feng*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes a hierarchical optimization-based control framework for a hexapod curtain wall installation robot, enhancing efficiency and safety in construction tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Curtain wall installation in modern architecture faces challenges like difficult terrain, labor intensity, low efficiency, and safety risks in traditional methods.

Method: A hierarchical optimization-based whole-body control framework was designed to coordinate the robot's hexapod legs, folding arms, and serial-parallel manipulator for specific installation tasks.

Result: Experiments validated the control method, demonstrating the robot's ability to perform curtain wall installation tasks effectively.

Conclusion: The proposed framework proves effective in addressing construction site complexities, paving the way for broader applications of hexapod robots in such environments.

Abstract: With the acceleration of urbanization, the number of high-rise buildings and
large public facilities is increasing, making curtain walls an essential
component of modern architecture with widespread applications. Traditional
curtain wall installation methods face challenges such as variable on-site
terrain, high labor intensity, low construction efficiency, and significant
safety risks. Large panels often require multiple workers to complete
installation. To address these issues, based on a hexapod curtain wall
installation robot, we design a hierarchical optimization-based whole-body
control framework for coordinated arm-leg planning tailored to three key tasks:
wall installation, ceiling installation, and floor laying. This framework
integrates the motion of the hexapod legs with the operation of the folding arm
and the serial-parallel manipulator. We conduct experiments on the hexapod
curtain wall installation robot to validate the proposed control method,
demonstrating its capability in performing curtain wall installation tasks. Our
results confirm the effectiveness of the hierarchical optimization-based
arm-leg coordination framework for the hexapod robot, laying the foundation for
its further application in complex construction site environments.

*Méloné Nyoba Tchonkeu,Soulaimane Berkane,Tarek Hamel*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper presents a barometer-aided attitude estimation method for autonomous vehicles in GNSS-denied environments, combining a deterministic observer and complementary filter.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous vehicles face challenges in attitude estimation in GNSS-denied and dynamic environments where auxiliary sensors may be unavailable or unreliable.

Method: The paper employs a nonlinear observer on SO(3) integrating barometric altitude measurements, coupled with deterministic Riccati observer and complementary filter.

Result: The proposed method ensures Almost Global Asymptotic Stability (AGAS) and geometric consistency under uniform observability conditions.

Conclusion: Barometer-based attitude estimation is validated as an effective and lightweight complementary solution for scenarios with unreliable or absent auxiliary velocity sensors.

Abstract: Accurate and robust attitude estimation is a central challenge for autonomous
vehicles operating in GNSS-denied or highly dynamic environments. In such
cases, Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) alone are insufficient for reliable
tilt estimation due to the ambiguity between gravitational and inertial
accelerations. While auxiliary velocity sensors, such as GNSS, Pitot tubes,
Doppler radar, or visual odometry, are often used, they can be unavailable,
intermittent, or costly. This work introduces a barometer-aided attitude
estimation architecture that leverages barometric altitude measurements to
infer vertical velocity and attitude within a nonlinear observer on SO(3). The
design cascades a deterministic Riccati observer with a complementary filter,
ensuring Almost Global Asymptotic Stability (AGAS) under a uniform
observability condition while maintaining geometric consistency. The analysis
highlights barometer-aided estimation as a lightweight and effective
complementary modality.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces DREAM, a Vision Language Model-guided autonomy framework for underwater robots, allowing efficient environmental monitoring and exploration, with improved performance over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the environmental risk posed to temperature-sensitive shellfish, like oysters, due to ocean warming and acidification, and the high hazards and costs associated with long-term underwater monitoring conducted by humans.

Method: The authors developed DREAM, an autonomous framework using Vision Language Model (VLM) technology to enable underwater robots for habitat and object exploration without requiring human intervention.

Result: DREAM showed measurable improvements in tasks like oyster monitoring and shipwreck exploration by reducing time, steps, and errors, compared to baseline and vanilla VLM models.

Conclusion: The framework's successful validation demonstrates the potential of VLM-guided autonomy for safer, cost-effective, and efficient underwater monitoring applications.

Abstract: The ocean is warming and acidifying, increasing the risk of mass mortality
events for temperature-sensitive shellfish such as oysters. This motivates the
development of long-term monitoring systems. However, human labor is costly and
long-duration underwater work is highly hazardous, thus favoring robotic
solutions as a safer and more efficient option. To enable underwater robots to
make real-time, environment-aware decisions without human intervention, we must
equip them with an intelligent "brain." This highlights the need for
persistent,wide-area, and low-cost benthic monitoring. To this end, we present
DREAM, a Vision Language Model (VLM)-guided autonomy framework for long-term
underwater exploration and habitat monitoring. The results show that our
framework is highly efficient in finding and exploring target objects (e.g.,
oysters, shipwrecks) without prior location information. In the
oyster-monitoring task, our framework takes 31.5% less time than the previous
baseline with the same amount of oysters. Compared to the vanilla VLM, it uses
23% fewer steps while covering 8.88% more oysters. In shipwreck scenes, our
framework successfully explores and maps the wreck without collisions,
requiring 27.5% fewer steps than the vanilla model and achieving 100% coverage,
while the vanilla model achieves 60.23% average coverage in our shipwreck
environments.

*Songhao Huang,Yuwei Wu,Guangyao Shi,Gaurav S. Sukhatme,Vijay Kumar*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces SPAR, a framework for automatic generation of PDDL domains using large language models, focused on UAV tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual design of PDDL domains for UAV applications like surveillance and delivery is labor-intensive and error-prone, limiting adoption and real-world usage.

Method: Developed SPAR framework powered by LLMs to produce valid, diverse, and semantically accurate PDDL domains from natural language input, using a validated UAV planning dataset and a prompting framework.

Result: Validated the generated PDDL domains through syntax checking, executability, feasibility, and interpretability.

Conclusion: LLMs can significantly simplify the creation of complex planning domains, benefiting aerial robotics and automated planning research with a reproducible dataset and evaluation framework.

Abstract: We investigate the problem of automatic domain generation for the Planning
Domain Definition Language (PDDL) using Large Language Models (LLMs), with a
particular focus on unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) tasks. Although PDDL is a
widely adopted standard in robotic planning, manually designing domains for
diverse applications such as surveillance, delivery, and inspection is
labor-intensive and error-prone, which hinders adoption and real-world
deployment. To address these challenges, we propose SPAR, a framework that
leverages the generative capabilities of LLMs to automatically produce valid,
diverse, and semantically accurate PDDL domains from natural language input. To
this end, we first introduce a systematically formulated and validated UAV
planning dataset, consisting of ground-truth PDDL domains and associated
problems, each paired with detailed domain and action descriptions. Building on
this dataset, we design a prompting framework that generates high-quality PDDL
domains from language input. The generated domains are evaluated through syntax
validation, executability, feasibility, and interpretability. Overall, this
work demonstrates that LLMs can substantially accelerate the creation of
complex planning domains, providing a reproducible dataset and evaluation
pipeline that enables application experts without prior experience to leverage
it for practical tasks and advance future research in aerial robotics and
automated planning.

*Yadan Zeng,Jiadong Zhou,Xiaohan Li,I-Ming Chen*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: HGACNet is proposed for completing incomplete 3D object point clouds by using a combination of hierarchical geometric encoding and image-guided priors, achieving state-of-the-art results in experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Incomplete 3D point clouds caused by sensor limitations and occlusion hinder key robotic processes like object reconstruction and downstream tasks such as grasp planning and manipulation.

Method: HGACNet uses a Hierarchical Graph Attention encoder to hierarchically encode 3D features and aligns them with image information using a Multi-Scale Cross-Modal Fusion module. A new contrastive loss is introduced to align feature distributions across modalities.

Result: The framework demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in point cloud completion on benchmarks such as ShapeNet-ViPC and YCB-Complete, showing its effectiveness for robotic manipulation tasks.

Conclusion: HGACNet effectively addresses the challenges in point cloud completion by fusing geometric and image-guided features, offering a robust tool for robotic applications that improves fidelity and effectiveness.

Abstract: Point cloud completion is essential for robotic perception, object
reconstruction and supporting downstream tasks like grasp planning, obstacle
avoidance, and manipulation. However, incomplete geometry caused by
self-occlusion and sensor limitations can significantly degrade downstream
reasoning and interaction. To address these challenges, we propose HGACNet, a
novel framework that reconstructs complete point clouds of individual objects
by hierarchically encoding 3D geometric features and fusing them with
image-guided priors from a single-view RGB image. At the core of our approach,
the Hierarchical Graph Attention (HGA) encoder adaptively selects critical
local points through graph attention-based downsampling and progressively
refines hierarchical geometric features to better capture structural continuity
and spatial relationships. To strengthen cross-modal interaction, we further
design a Multi-Scale Cross-Modal Fusion (MSCF) module that performs
attention-based feature alignment between hierarchical geometric features and
structured visual representations, enabling fine-grained semantic guidance for
completion. In addition, we proposed the contrastive loss (C-Loss) to
explicitly align the feature distributions across modalities, improving
completion fidelity under modality discrepancy. Finally, extensive experiments
conducted on both the ShapeNet-ViPC benchmark and the YCB-Complete dataset
confirm the effectiveness of HGACNet, demonstrating state-of-the-art
performance as well as strong applicability in real-world robotic manipulation
tasks.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces a lightweight system for zero-shot object navigation (ZSON) in large-scale outdoor environments, addressing challenges like long-range targets and intermittent visibility. It achieves significant improvements in task success.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance zero-shot object navigation in outdoor scenarios where long-range visibility and occlusion are critical challenges.

Method: The paper proposes a hierarchical target-saliency fusion system that uses a multi-scale image tile hierarchy to provide visibility-aware heading maintenance without requiring whole-image rescaling.

Result: The system detects semantic targets beyond 150 meters, maintains correct headings with 82.6% probability during visibility changes, and improves task success by 17.5% compared to SOTA methods.

Conclusion: The system demonstrates robustness in navigating toward distant and intermittently visible targets, making advancements in large-scale outdoor ZSON tasks.

Abstract: Zero-shot object navigation (ZSON) in large-scale outdoor environments faces
many challenges; we specifically address a coupled one: long-range targets that
reduce to tiny projections and intermittent visibility due to partial or
complete occlusion. We present a unified, lightweight closed-loop system built
on an aligned multi-scale image tile hierarchy. Through hierarchical
target-saliency fusion, it summarizes localized semantic contrast into a stable
coarse-layer regional saliency that provides the target direction and indicates
target visibility. This regional saliency supports visibility-aware heading
maintenance through keyframe memory, saliency-weighted fusion of historical
headings, and active search during temporary invisibility. The system avoids
whole-image rescaling, enables deterministic bottom-up aggregation, supports
zero-shot navigation, and runs efficiently on a mobile robot. Across simulation
and real-world outdoor trials, the system detects semantic targets beyond 150m,
maintains a correct heading through visibility changes with 82.6% probability,
and improves overall task success by 17.5% compared with the SOTA methods,
demonstrating robust ZSON toward distant and intermittently observable targets.

*Jeongwoo Park,Seabin Lee,Changmin Park,Wonjong Lee,Changjoo Nam*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper addresses the challenge of submillimeter-precise insertion of flexible flat cables (FFCs) into industrial receptacles, using a reinforcement learning approach trained entirely in simulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automating the precise insertion of FFCs into receptacles is challenging due to the cables’ deformability and safety risks during training with fast industrial robots.

Method: The authors proposed training reinforcement learning entirely in simulation by using a foundation model-based real-to-sim approach, semantic segmentation, and the Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) with automated prompting via a Vision-Language Model (VLM).

Result: The proposed method achieved zero-shot capabilities, allowing for direct deployment in real-world environments without requiring fine-tuning.

Conclusion: The foundation model-based RL training approach successfully automates the high-precision insertion of FFCs, reducing risks, training time, and eliminating human intervention.

Abstract: The industrial insertion of flexible flat cables (FFCs) into receptacles
presents a significant challenge owing to the need for submillimeter precision
when handling the deformable cables. In manufacturing processes, FFC insertion
with robotic manipulators often requires laborious human-guided trajectory
generation. While Reinforcement Learning (RL) offers a solution to automate
this task without modeling complex properties of FFCs, the nondeterminism
caused by the deformability of FFCs requires significant efforts and time on
training. Moreover, training directly in a real environment is dangerous as
industrial robots move fast and possess no safety measure. We propose an RL
algorithm for FFC insertion that leverages a foundation model-based real-to-sim
approach to reduce the training time and eliminate the risk of physical damages
to robots and surroundings. Training is done entirely in simulation, allowing
for random exploration without the risk of physical damages. Sim-to-real
transfer is achieved through semantic segmentation masks which leave only those
visual features relevant to the insertion tasks such as the geometric and
spatial information of the cables and receptacles. To enhance generality, we
use a foundation model, Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2). To eleminate human
intervention, we employ a Vision-Language Model (VLM) to automate the initial
prompting of SAM2 to find segmentation masks. In the experiments, our method
exhibits zero-shot capabilities, which enable direct deployments to real
environments without fine-tuning.

TL;DR: FSR-VLN is a system for Visual-Language Navigation (VLN) that achieves high success rates and reduces response time compared to existing methods by using hierarchical reasoning and efficient candidate selection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this paper is the need for efficient and accurate VLN systems to enable robots to navigate real-world environments while overcoming limitations in long-range spatial reasoning and inference latency.

Method: The system combines a Hierarchical Multi-modal Scene Graph (HMSG) for map representation and Fast-to-Slow Navigation Reasoning (FSR) for efficient candidate selection followed by refined goal selection using Vision-Language Models (VLMs).

Result: FSR-VLN achieves state-of-the-art performance in four indoor datasets, improves the retrieval success rate (RSR), reduces response time by 82%, and was successfully integrated into a humanoid robot for real-time navigation and speech interaction.

Conclusion: FSR-VLN demonstrates significant improvements in navigation accuracy, speed, and real-world applicability, marking advancements in embodied robotic systems for VLN tasks.

Abstract: Visual-Language Navigation (VLN) is a fundamental challenge in robotic
systems, with broad applications for the deployment of embodied agents in
real-world environments. Despite recent advances, existing approaches are
limited in long-range spatial reasoning, often exhibiting low success rates and
high inference latency, particularly in long-range navigation tasks. To address
these limitations, we propose FSR-VLN, a vision-language navigation system that
combines a Hierarchical Multi-modal Scene Graph (HMSG) with Fast-to-Slow
Navigation Reasoning (FSR). The HMSG provides a multi-modal map representation
supporting progressive retrieval, from coarse room-level localization to
fine-grained goal view and object identification. Building on HMSG, FSR first
performs fast matching to efficiently select candidate rooms, views, and
objects, then applies VLM-driven refinement for final goal selection. We
evaluated FSR-VLN across four comprehensive indoor datasets collected by
humanoid robots, utilizing 87 instructions that encompass a diverse range of
object categories. FSR-VLN achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in all
datasets, measured by the retrieval success rate (RSR), while reducing the
response time by 82% compared to VLM-based methods on tour videos by activating
slow reasoning only when fast intuition fails. Furthermore, we integrate
FSR-VLN with speech interaction, planning, and control modules on a Unitree-G1
humanoid robot, enabling natural language interaction and real-time navigation.

*Muyuan Ma,Long Cheng,Lijun Han,Xiuze Xia,Houcheng Li*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces a meta-imitation learning approach to improve task generalization and personalization in wearable exoskeletons.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Developing personalized and generalizable assistance algorithms for wearable exoskeletons remains a challenge in enhancing human strength and reducing fatigue.

Method: The authors utilize a task-specific neural network within the MAML framework, trained on simulated elbow flexion data derived from video and motion-capture datasets, to adapt personalized exoskeleton assistance with minimal user-specific training.

Result: The exoskeleton using this framework reduced muscle activation and metabolic cost for untrained tasks and new users compared to non-assisted tasks.

Conclusion: The developed system effectively balances task generalization and user adaptability, enhancing the usability of wearable exoskeletons for diverse applications.

Abstract: Wearable exoskeletons can augment human strength and reduce muscle fatigue
during specific tasks. However, developing personalized and task-generalizable
assistance algorithms remains a critical challenge. To address this, a
meta-imitation learning approach is proposed. This approach leverages a
task-specific neural network to predict human elbow joint movements, enabling
effective assistance while enhancing generalization to new scenarios. To
accelerate data collection, full-body keypoint motions are extracted from
publicly available RGB video and motion-capture datasets across multiple tasks,
and subsequently retargeted in simulation. Elbow flexion trajectories generated
in simulation are then used to train the task-specific neural network within
the model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML) framework, which allows the network to
rapidly adapt to novel tasks and unseen users with only a few gradient updates.
The adapted network outputs personalized references tracked by a
gravity-compensated PD controller to ensure stable assistance. Experimental
results demonstrate that the exoskeleton significantly reduces both muscle
activation and metabolic cost for new users performing untrained tasks,
compared to performing without exoskeleton assistance. These findings suggest
that the proposed framework effectively improves task generalization and user
adaptability for wearable exoskeleton systems.

TL;DR: A novel RL framework for legged locomotion control is proposed, focusing on decoupled leg control, showing robust adaptability across various real-world challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RL struggles with performance in out-of-distribution environments and sim-to-real discrepancies, requiring a new approach to improve robustness.

Method: The authors propose a decoupled framework isolating stance-leg and swing-leg control to enable fast online adaptation and reduce sim-to-real issues.

Result: Experiments in both simulations and real-world scenarios demonstrate the method's effectiveness against environmental disturbances like uneven terrains and payload changes.

Conclusion: The decoupled control framework enhances the adaptability and robustness of legged locomotion in real and challenging conditions, outperforming traditional domain randomization methods.

Abstract: While Reinforcement Learning (RL) has achieved remarkable progress in legged
locomotion control, it often suffers from performance degradation in
out-of-distribution (OOD) conditions and discrepancies between the simulation
and the real environments. Instead of mainly relying on domain randomization
(DR) to best cover the real environments and thereby close the sim-to-real gap
and enhance robustness, this work proposes an emerging decoupled framework that
acquires fast online adaptation ability and mitigates the sim-to-real problems
in unfamiliar environments by isolating stance-leg control and swing-leg
control. Various simulation and real-world experiments demonstrate its
effectiveness against horizontal force disturbances, uneven terrains, heavy and
biased payloads, and sim-to-real gap.

### [247] [CDFlow: Generative Gradient Flows for Configuration Space Distance Fields via Neural ODEs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13771)
*Mengzhu Li,Yunyu Zhou,He Ying,F. Richard Yu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces CDFlow, a novel method for representing Configuration Space Distance Fields (CDF) in high-DoF robots, using Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CDF methods struggle with limitations like gradient ambiguity due to single-modal collision configurations and oversmoothed approximations caused by sparse boundary sampling, especially in high-dimensional spaces.

Method: CDFlow employs Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs) to learn a continuous flow that models the distribution of minimal-distance collision configurations. Additionally, it uses an adaptive refinement sampling strategy to generate precise training data.

Result: Experiments on high-DoF robots showcase substantial improvements in motion planning efficiency, trajectory quality, and robustness over traditional CDF approaches.

Conclusion: CDFlow overcomes the challenges of current CDF formulations, offering a more robust and efficient mechanism for collision-aware robot planning in complex environments.

Abstract: Signed Distance Fields (SDFs) are a fundamental representation in robot
motion planning. Their configuration-space counterpart, the Configuration Space
Distance Field (CDF), directly encodes distances in joint space, offering a
unified representation for optimization and control. However, existing CDF
formulations face two major challenges in high-degree-of-freedom (DoF) robots:
(1) they effectively return only a single nearest collision configuration,
neglecting the multi-modal nature of minimal-distance collision configurations
and leading to gradient ambiguity; and (2) they rely on sparse sampling of the
collision boundary, which often fails to identify the true closest
configurations, producing oversmoothed approximations and geometric distortion
in high-dimensional spaces. We propose CDFlow, a novel framework that addresses
these limitations by learning a continuous flow in configuration space via
Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs). We redefine the problem
from finding a single nearest point to modeling the distribution of
minimal-distance collision configurations. We also introduce an adaptive
refinement sampling strategy to generate high-fidelity training data for this
distribution. The resulting Neural ODE implicitly models this multi-modal
distribution and produces a smooth, consistent gradient field-derived as the
expected direction towards the distribution-that mitigates gradient ambiguity
and preserves sharp geometric features. Extensive experiments on high-DoF
motion planning tasks demonstrate that CDFlow significantly improves planning
efficiency, trajectory quality, and robustness compared to existing CDF-based
methods, enabling more robust and efficient planning for collision-aware robots
in complex environments.

*Piaopiao Jin,Qi Wang,Guokang Sun,Ziwen Cai,Pinjia He,Yangwei You*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a human-in-the-loop dual-actor fine-tuning framework using reinforcement learning to enhance vision-language-action models for robotic manipulation. It incorporates human feedback through a language-based scheme to generate new learning data, achieving high success rates in real-world tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhance the generalization of vision-language-action models in complex real-world robotic tasks, overcoming the limitations of supervised fine-tuning and leveraging reinforcement learning.

Method: A dual-actor framework with reinforcement learning where a primary actor ensures multi-task robustness and a refinement actor facilitates latent-space adaptation. The system integrates lightweight, semantically grounded human feedback to improve policy learning.

Result: Achieved 100% success in three tasks within 101 minutes, a 50% success rate over 12 long-horizon operations, and a 2x efficiency boost in multi-robot training.

Conclusion: The proposed framework significantly improves task performance, adaptability, and efficiency, demonstrating its scalability and effectiveness in both individual and multi-robot scenarios.

Abstract: Vision-language-action (VLA) models demonstrate strong generalization in
robotic manipulation but face challenges in complex, real-world tasks. While
supervised fine-tuning with demonstrations is constrained by data quality,
reinforcement learning (RL) offers a promising alternative. We propose a
human-in-the-loop dual-actor fine-tuning framework grounded in RL. The
framework integrates a primary actor for robust multi-task performance with a
refinement actor for latent-space adaptation. Beyond standard physical
interventions, we introduce a lightweight talk-and-tweak scheme that converts
human corrections into semantically grounded language commands, thereby
generating a new dataset for policy learning. In real-world multi-task
experiments, our approach achieves 100% success across three tasks within 101
minutes of online fine-tuning. For long-horizon tasks, it sustains a 50%
success rate over 12 consecutive operations. Furthermore, the framework scales
effectively to multi-robot training, achieving up to a 2 times improvement in
efficiency when using dual robots. The experiment videos are available at

### [249] [Behavior Foundation Model for Humanoid Robots](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13780)
*Weishuai Zeng,Shunlin Lu,Kangning Yin,Xiaojie Niu,Minyue Dai,Jingbo Wang,Jiangmiao Pang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Behavior Foundation Model (BFM) to improve humanoid robot control using a pretrained generative model for versatile and reusable behaviors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current whole-body control frameworks for humanoid robots are task-specific, require extensive reward engineering, and are limited in generalization across diverse tasks, restricting their real-world deployment.

Method: The authors propose BFM, a generative model built on a Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) with a masked online distillation framework, pretrained on large-scale behavioral datasets.

Result: Extensive experimentation shows that BFM generalizes across diverse whole-body control tasks and adapts efficiently to new behaviors on both simulated and physical humanoid platforms.

Conclusion: BFM is positioned as a foundation model for general-purpose humanoid control, enabling flexible, efficient, and versatile robot behavior generation.

Abstract: Whole-body control (WBC) of humanoid robots has witnessed remarkable progress
in skill versatility, enabling a wide range of applications such as locomotion,
teleoperation, and motion tracking. Despite these achievements, existing WBC
frameworks remain largely task-specific, relying heavily on labor-intensive
reward engineering and demonstrating limited generalization across tasks and
skills. These limitations hinder their response to arbitrary control modes and
restrict their deployment in complex, real-world scenarios. To address these
challenges, we revisit existing WBC systems and identify a shared objective
across diverse tasks: the generation of appropriate behaviors that guide the
robot toward desired goal states. Building on this insight, we propose the
Behavior Foundation Model (BFM), a generative model pretrained on large-scale
behavioral datasets to capture broad, reusable behavioral knowledge for
humanoid robots. BFM integrates a masked online distillation framework with a
Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) to model behavioral distributions,
thereby enabling flexible operation across diverse control modes and efficient
acquisition of novel behaviors without retraining from scratch. Extensive
experiments in both simulation and on a physical humanoid platform demonstrate
that BFM generalizes robustly across diverse WBC tasks while rapidly adapting
to new behaviors. These results establish BFM as a promising step toward a
foundation model for general-purpose humanoid control.

*Takuya Kiyokawa,Ryunosuke Takebayashi,Kensuke Harada*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The study proposes a soft, shell-type jig for robotic disassembly that adapts to diverse object shapes and reduces the need for precise tools and control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current robotic disassembly tools require precise equipment and planning, which limits flexibility and increases risks, like component damage.

Method: The authors develop a balloon-based soft jig that securely holds objects, adapts to various shapes, and reduces reliance on precise perception, trajectory, and grasping techniques.

Result: Experimental evaluations show the jig's practical feasibility, comparing it favorably against other holding mechanisms, though limitations were identified.

Conclusion: The proposed jig offers a versatile, damage-mitigating solution for robotic disassembly, providing robustness against common errors in recognition and control systems.

Abstract: This study addresses a flexible holding tool for robotic disassembly. We
propose a shell-type soft jig that securely and universally holds objects,
mitigating the risk of component damage and adapting to diverse shapes while
enabling soft fixation that is robust to recognition, planning, and control
errors. The balloon-based holding mechanism ensures proper alignment and stable
holding performance, thereby reducing the need for dedicated jig design, highly
accurate perception, precise grasping, and finely tuned trajectory planning
that are typically required with conventional fixtures. Our experimental
results demonstrate the practical feasibility of the proposed jig through
performance comparisons with a vise and a jamming-gripper-inspired soft jig.
Tests on ten different objects further showed representative successes and
failures, clarifying the jig's limitations and outlook.

### [251] [Soft Regrasping Tool Inspired by Jamming Gripper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13815)
*Takuya Kiyokawa,Zhengtao Hu,Weiwei Wan,Kensuke Harada*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a soft jig based on the jamming transition phenomenon to enable adaptable and precise robotic regrasping for assembly tasks, achieving high success rates across diverse object geometries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of conventional rigid fixtures, which require dedicated designs and lack adaptability, the authors aim to reduce pose uncertainty in robotic assembly using a versatile, deformable solution.

Method: A soft jig is developed, leveraging the jamming transition phenomenon. A triangular-pyramid-shaped tool creates a cavity in the jig by deforming its elastic membrane. The cavity’s size and depth are optimized for stable placement and gripper accessibility.

Result: Drop experiments conducted on ten mechanical parts demonstrated placement success rates above 80% for most objects and over 90% for cylindrical shapes. Failures were linked to geometric constraints and membrane properties.

Conclusion: The proposed soft jig offers a general-purpose, accurate, and repeatable regrasping alternative to rigid fixtures, though current limitations exist. It holds promise for enhancing robotic assembly automation.

Abstract: Regrasping on fixtures is a promising approach to reduce pose uncertainty in
robotic assembly, but conventional rigid fixtures lack adaptability and require
dedicated designs for each part. To overcome this limitation, we propose a soft
jig inspired by the jamming transition phenomenon, which can be continuously
deformed to accommodate diverse object geometries. By pressing a
triangular-pyramid-shaped tool into the membrane and evacuating the enclosed
air, a stable cavity is formed as a placement space. We further optimize the
stamping depth to balance placement stability and gripper accessibility. In
soft-jig-based regrasping, the key challenge lies in optimizing the cavity size
to achieve precise dropping; once the part is reliably placed, subsequent
grasping can be performed with reduced uncertainty. Accordingly, we conducted
drop experiments on ten mechanical parts of varying shapes, which achieved
placement success rates exceeding 80% for most objects and above 90% for
cylindrical ones, while failures were mainly caused by geometric constraints
and membrane properties. These results demonstrate that the proposed jig
enables general-purpose, accurate, and repeatable regrasping, while also
clarifying its current limitations and future potential as a practical
alternative to rigid fixtures in assembly automation.

### [252] [Agile in the Face of Delay: Asynchronous End-to-End Learning for Real-World Aerial Navigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13816)
*Yude Li,Zhexuan Zhou,Huizhe Li,Youmin Gong,Jie Mei*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes an asynchronous reinforcement learning framework for autonomous aerial vehicles (AAVs) to handle the mismatch between high-frequency control loops and low-frequency perception streams, ensuring agile navigation in complex environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the need to overcome the challenge posed by the mismatched frequencies of control loops and perception streams, which limits navigation efficiency in AAVs operating in complex environments.

Method: The authors introduce an asynchronous reinforcement learning framework that decouples perception and control tasks, employing a Temporal Encoding Module (TEM) to address data staleness and a two-stage curriculum for stable training.

Result: The proposed method achieved robust and agile navigation through a 100 Hz control rate, validated in simulations and successful zero-shot sim-to-real transfer in real-world tests.

Conclusion: The asynchronous framework effectively mitigates the perception-control mismatch, enabling real-world agile navigation for AAVs, with the source code being made publicly available for further research.

Abstract: Robust autonomous navigation for Autonomous Aerial Vehicles (AAVs) in complex
environments is a critical capability. However, modern end-to-end navigation
faces a key challenge: the high-frequency control loop needed for agile flight
conflicts with low-frequency perception streams, which are limited by sensor
update rates and significant computational cost. This mismatch forces
conventional synchronous models into undesirably low control rates. To resolve
this, we propose an asynchronous reinforcement learning framework that
decouples perception and control, enabling a high-frequency policy to act on
the latest IMU state for immediate reactivity, while incorporating perception
features asynchronously. To manage the resulting data staleness, we introduce a
theoretically-grounded Temporal Encoding Module (TEM) that explicitly
conditions the policy on perception delays, a strategy complemented by a
two-stage curriculum to ensure stable and efficient training. Validated in
extensive simulations, our method was successfully deployed in zero-shot
sim-to-real transfer on an onboard NUC, where it sustains a 100~Hz control rate
and demonstrates robust, agile navigation in cluttered real-world environments.
Our source code will be released for community reference.

*Teng Wang,Haojun Jiang,Yuxuan Wang,Zhenguo Sun,Xiangjie Yan,Xiang Li,Gao Huang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces UltraHiT, a Hierarchical Transformer-based decision architecture that automates carotid ultrasound for internal carotid artery (ICA) scanning. It achieves a 95% success rate on unseen individuals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation lies in addressing the complexity of scanning the ICA, which is deeply located, tortuous, and variable, making automation challenging.

Method: UltraHiT uses a Hierarchical Transformer-based architecture with a high-level variation assessment module and low-level action decision modules (adaptive corrector and standard executor). These are implemented using causal transformers trained on historical sequences.

Result: The model achieved a 95% success rate in locating ICA on unseen individuals, surpassing baseline methods. A large dataset of ICA scans was compiled to validate its generalizability.

Conclusion: The UltraHiT approach has demonstrated effectiveness in automating the complex ICA scanning process in carotid ultrasound, paving the way for broader applications in cerebrovascular health assessments.

Abstract: Carotid ultrasound is crucial for the assessment of cerebrovascular health,
particularly the internal carotid artery (ICA). While previous research has
explored automating carotid ultrasound, none has tackled the challenging ICA.
This is primarily due to its deep location, tortuous course, and significant
individual variations, which greatly increase scanning complexity. To address
this, we propose a Hierarchical Transformer-based decision architecture, namely
UltraHiT, that integrates high-level variation assessment with low-level action
decision. Our motivation stems from conceptualizing individual vascular
structures as morphological variations derived from a standard vascular model.
The high-level module identifies variation and switches between two low-level
modules: an adaptive corrector for variations, or a standard executor for
normal cases. Specifically, both the high-level module and the adaptive
corrector are implemented as causal transformers that generate predictions
based on the historical scanning sequence. To ensure generalizability, we
collected the first large-scale ICA scanning dataset comprising 164
trajectories and 72K samples from 28 subjects of both genders. Based on the
above innovations, our approach achieves a 95% success rate in locating the ICA
on unseen individuals, outperforming baselines and demonstrating its
effectiveness. Our code will be released after acceptance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to develop a motion tracker that can handle diverse dynamic, contact-rich motions and adapt effectively to real-world disturbances for practical applications.

Method: Proposes Any2Track, a two-stage reinforcement learning framework consisting of AnyTracker for general motion tracking and AnyAdapter for history-informed online dynamics adaptability, enabling zero-shot sim2real transfer.

Result: Any2Track is successfully deployed on Unitree G1 hardware, achieving exceptional performance in tracking various motions under multiple real-world disturbances.

Conclusion: Any2Track offers a robust and practical solution for humanoid motion tracking in challenging dynamic environments, bridging the sim2real gap effectively.

Abstract: A foundational humanoid motion tracker is expected to be able to track
diverse, highly dynamic, and contact-rich motions. More importantly, it needs
to operate stably in real-world scenarios against various dynamics
disturbances, including terrains, external forces, and physical property
changes for general practical use. To achieve this goal, we propose Any2Track
(Track Any motions under Any disturbances), a two-stage RL framework to track
various motions under multiple disturbances in the real world. Any2Track
reformulates dynamics adaptability as an additional capability on top of basic
action execution and consists of two key components: AnyTracker and AnyAdapter.
AnyTracker is a general motion tracker with a series of careful designs to
track various motions within a single policy. AnyAdapter is a history-informed
adaptation module that endows the tracker with online dynamics adaptability to
overcome the sim2real gap and multiple real-world disturbances. We deploy
Any2Track on Unitree G1 hardware and achieve a successful sim2real transfer in
a zero-shot manner. Any2Track performs exceptionally well in tracking various
motions under multiple real-world disturbances.

*Motonari Kambara,Komei Sugiura*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces a predictive model for object manipulation task success using an egocentric image and planned trajectory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve object manipulation efficiency by predicting success beforehand and avoiding reliance on hazards or failures.

Method: Proposes a Multi-Level Trajectory Fusion module combining a deep state-space model and a transformer encoder to predict alignment between input image, trajectory, and instruction.

Result: The proposed method outperformed existing approaches and foundation models in experimental evaluation.

Conclusion: The model offers a more efficient way to predict success and prevent hazards in open-vocabulary object manipulation tasks.

Abstract: In this work, we address the problem of predicting the future success of
open-vocabulary object manipulation tasks. Conventional approaches typically
determine success or failure after the action has been carried out. However,
they make it difficult to prevent potential hazards and rely on failures to
trigger replanning, thereby reducing the efficiency of object manipulation
sequences. To overcome these challenges, we propose a model, which predicts the
alignment between a pre-manipulation egocentric image with the planned
trajectory and a given natural language instruction. We introduce a Multi-Level
Trajectory Fusion module, which employs a state-of-the-art deep state-space
model and a transformer encoder in parallel to capture multi-level time-series
self-correlation within the end effector trajectory. Our experimental results
indicate that the proposed method outperformed existing methods, including
foundation models.

*Nguyen Hoang Khoi Tran,Julie Stephany Berrio,Mao Shan,Stewart Worrall*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This study introduces InterKey, a framework for vehicle localization using road intersections and OpenStreetMap (OSM) data instead of HD maps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of GNSS in urban environments and the high costs associated with HD map usage, exploring OSM's potential for localization.

Method: InterKey constructs binary descriptors using road and building imprints from point clouds and OSM, and applies strategies to mitigate cross-modal discrepancies for matching sensor data.

Result: Experiments with KITTI dataset show InterKey outperforms recent baselines, achieving high accuracy in global localization.

Conclusion: The method provides a scalable, cost-efficient localization solution and generalizes well to various sensors generating dense point clouds.

Abstract: Reliable global localization is critical for autonomous vehicles, especially
in environments where GNSS is degraded or unavailable, such as urban canyons
and tunnels. Although high-definition (HD) maps provide accurate priors, the
cost of data collection, map construction, and maintenance limits scalability.
OpenStreetMap (OSM) offers a free and globally available alternative, but its
coarse abstraction poses challenges for matching with sensor data. We propose
InterKey, a cross-modal framework that leverages road intersections as
distinctive landmarks for global localization. Our method constructs compact
binary descriptors by jointly encoding road and building imprints from point
clouds and OSM. To bridge modality gaps, we introduce discrepancy mitigation,
orientation determination, and area-equalized sampling strategies, enabling
robust cross-modal matching. Experiments on the KITTI dataset demonstrate that
InterKey achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, outperforming recent baselines by
a large margin. The framework generalizes to sensors that can produce dense
structural point clouds, offering a scalable and cost-effective solution for
robust vehicle localization.

TL;DR: The paper explores using Petri nets to model context for adaptive robot explanations in human-robot interactions, showcasing their robustness and flexibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhancing trust in human-robot interactions requires robots to adapt their communication naturally to contextual cues.

Method: The paper uses Petri nets to represent contextual information for robots, enabling adaptive and verified communication strategies.

Result: Demonstrated through a robot scenario, analyses confirm properties like deadlock-freeness and context-sensitive reachability, validating the use of Petri nets.

Conclusion: Petri nets are effective for modeling and verifying adaptive explanations in robot-human interactions, highlighting their dynamic capabilities.

Abstract: In human-robot interaction, robots must communicate in a natural and
transparent manner to foster trust, which requires adapting their communication
to the context. In this paper, we propose using Petri nets (PNs) to model
contextual information for adaptive robot explanations. PNs provide a formal,
graphical method for representing concurrent actions, causal dependencies, and
system states, making them suitable for analyzing dynamic interactions between
humans and robots. We demonstrate this approach through a scenario involving a
robot that provides explanations based on contextual cues such as user
attention and presence. Model analysis confirms key properties, including
deadlock-freeness, context-sensitive reachability, boundedness, and liveness,
showing the robustness and flexibility of PNs for designing and verifying
context-adaptive explanations in human-robot interactions.

*Junhwa Hong,Beomjoon Lee,Woojin Lee,Changjoo Nam*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes an enhanced Conflict-Based Search (CBS) method using repulsive trajectory modification for efficient, collision-free motion planning in multi-manipulator systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-manipulator systems have significant advantages but are computationally challenging to coordinate due to the high dimensionality of the configuration space and the shortcomings of existing methods like CBS.

Method: The method integrates a gradient descent-based Artificial Potential Field in the low-level CBS to generate repulsive forces, guiding manipulators’ trajectories to avoid conflicts. Additionally, a strategy attempts direct conflict-free solutions under specific conditions.

Result: The method reduces expanded nodes in the constraint tree, increases success rates, and provides faster solutions compared to Enhanced CBS and other state-of-the-art algorithms.

Conclusion: The proposed approach successfully addresses multi-manipulator motion planning challenges by improving CBS with gradient descent modifications, leading to efficiency and higher performance in finding collision-free trajectories.

Abstract: We propose an efficient motion planning method designed to efficiently find
collision-free trajectories for multiple manipulators. While multi-manipulator
systems offer significant advantages, coordinating their motions is
computationally challenging owing to the high dimensionality of their composite
configuration space. Conflict-Based Search (CBS) addresses this by decoupling
motion planning, but suffers from subsequent conflicts incurred by resolving
existing conflicts, leading to an exponentially growing constraint tree of CBS.
Our proposed method is based on repulsive trajectory modification within the
two-level structure of CBS. Unlike conventional CBS variants, the low-level
planner applies a gradient descent approach using an Artificial Potential
Field. This field generates repulsive forces that guide the trajectory of the
conflicting manipulator away from those of other robots. As a result,
subsequent conflicts are less likely to occur. Additionally, we develop a
strategy that, under a specific condition, directly attempts to find a
conflict-free solution in a single step without growing the constraint tree.
Through extensive tests including physical robot experiments, we demonstrate
that our method consistently reduces the number of expanded nodes in the
constraint tree, achieves a higher success rate, and finds a solution faster
compared to Enhanced CBS and other state-of-the-art algorithms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to improve robotic manipulation by integrating generative reasoning and execution corrections to handle complex tasks and recover from errors.

Method: PhysicalAgent uses iterative reasoning, diffusion-based video generation to envision trajectories, followed by closed-loop execution that adapts based on performance failures.

Result: Experiments show PhysicalAgent achieves higher success rates compared to state-of-the-art methods, reaching up to 80% effectiveness after iterative corrections.

Conclusion: PhysicalAgent demonstrates the utility of video-based generative models and iterative corrections, paving the way for scalable and robust robotic control systems.

Abstract: We introduce PhysicalAgent, an agentic framework for robotic manipulation
that integrates iterative reasoning, diffusion-based video generation, and
closed-loop execution. Given a textual instruction, our method generates short
video demonstrations of candidate trajectories, executes them on the robot, and
iteratively re-plans in response to failures. This approach enables robust
recovery from execution errors. We evaluate PhysicalAgent across multiple
perceptual modalities (egocentric, third-person, and simulated) and robotic
embodiments (bimanual UR3, Unitree G1 humanoid, simulated GR1), comparing
against state-of-the-art task-specific baselines. Experiments demonstrate that
our method consistently outperforms prior approaches, achieving up to 83%
success on human-familiar tasks. Physical trials reveal that first-attempt
success is limited (20-30%), yet iterative correction increases overall success
to 80% across platforms. These results highlight the potential of video-based
generative reasoning for general-purpose robotic manipulation and underscore
the importance of iterative execution for recovering from initial failures. Our
framework paves the way for scalable, adaptable, and robust robot control.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the underutilization of online mapping modules in enhancing trajectory planning in end-to-end autonomous driving systems.

Method: The MAP framework integrates segmentation-based map features and ego status using dedicated modules like Plan-enhancing Online Mapping, Ego-status-guided Planning, and Weight Adapter.

Result: MAP reduces L2 displacement error by 16.6%, off-road rate by 56.2%, and improves the overall score by 44.5% compared to a baseline. It ranks first in the V2X Cooperation Challenge, outperforming the second-best model by 39.5%.

Conclusion: Explicitly leveraging semantic map features can significantly enhance trajectory planning, and the presented MAP framework pushes the boundaries of end-to-end autonomous driving systems.

Abstract: In recent years, end-to-end autonomous driving has attracted increasing
attention for its ability to jointly model perception, prediction, and planning
within a unified framework. However, most existing approaches underutilize the
online mapping module, leaving its potential to enhance trajectory planning
largely untapped. This paper proposes MAP (Map-Assisted Planning), a novel
map-assisted end-to-end trajectory planning framework. MAP explicitly
integrates segmentation-based map features and the current ego status through a
Plan-enhancing Online Mapping module, an Ego-status-guided Planning module, and
a Weight Adapter based on current ego status. Experiments conducted on the
DAIR-V2X-seq-SPD dataset demonstrate that the proposed method achieves a 16.6%
reduction in L2 displacement error, a 56.2% reduction in off-road rate, and a
44.5% improvement in overall score compared to the UniV2X baseline, even
without post-processing. Furthermore, it achieves top ranking in Track 2 of the
End-to-End Autonomous Driving through V2X Cooperation Challenge of MEIS
Workshop @CVPR2025, outperforming the second-best model by 39.5% in terms of
overall score. These results highlight the effectiveness of explicitly

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop UAVs with autonomous navigation capabilities for tasks requiring reliability and autonomy, such as inspections and deliveries.

Method: A reinforcement learning approach trains a drone to navigate by interacting in a Gym-compatible simulation, using a reward system that encourages efficiency and penalizes unsafe actions, and later tests the learned policies on real UAVs.

Result: The UAV successfully performs autonomous navigation between points with minimal human intervention, validating the RL-based approach for real scenarios.

Conclusion: This approach highlights the potential and effectiveness of reinforcement learning for enabling real-world UAV autonomy in practical navigation tasks.

Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly used in automated
inspection, delivery, and navigation tasks that require reliable autonomy. This
project develops a reinforcement learning (RL) approach to enable a single UAV
to autonomously navigate between predefined points without manual intervention.
The drone learns navigation policies through trial-and-error interaction, using
a custom reward function that encourages goal-reaching efficiency while
penalizing collisions and unsafe behavior. The control system integrates ROS
with a Gym-compatible training environment, enabling flexible deployment and
testing. After training, the learned policy is deployed on a real UAV platform
and evaluated under practical conditions. Results show that the UAV can
successfully perform autonomous navigation with minimal human oversight,
demonstrating the viability of RL-based control for point-to-point drone

### [262] [The Influence of Facial Features on the Perceived Trustworthiness of a Social Robot](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13948)
*Benedict Barrow,Roger K. Moore*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper investigates how a robot's facial features influence trust, revealing that eye shape and size significantly affect perceived trustworthiness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore factors that shape human trust in robots, particularly the impact of a robot's facial features on trustworthiness.

Method: Conducted a study using a Furhat robot with manipulated back-projected facial features, focusing on the influence of ‘babyface’ traits such as eye shape and size.

Result: The study found that robots with larger, more rounded eyes are perceived as more trustworthy, supporting the hypothesis that 'babyface' features foster trust.

Conclusion: Designing social robots with specific facial features, particularly those resembling ‘babyface’, can enhance trust and effectiveness in human-robot interaction.

Abstract: Trust and the perception of trustworthiness play an important role in
decision-making and our behaviour towards others, and this is true not only of
human-human interactions but also of human-robot interactions. While
significant advances have been made in recent years in the field of social
robotics, there is still some way to go before we fully understand the factors
that influence human trust in robots. This paper presents the results of a
study into the first impressions created by a social robot's facial features,
based on the hypothesis that a `babyface' engenders trust. By manipulating the
back-projected face of a Furhat robot, the study confirms that eye shape and
size have a significant impact on the perception of trustworthiness. The work
thus contributes to an understanding of the design choices that need to be made
when developing social robots so as to optimise the effectiveness of
human-robot interaction.

*Jannick Stranghöner,Philipp Hartmann,Marco Braun,Sebastian Wrede,Klaus Neumann*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces SHaRe-RL, a reinforcement learning framework that combines multiple knowledge sources to enable safe and efficient learning for complex industrial assembly tasks in HMLV applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The difficulty in adapting robotic systems to high-mix low-volume industrial settings due to their inflexibility, inefficiency, and lack of safety in handling contact-rich tasks.

Method: SHaRe-RL structures skills into manipulation primitives, relies on human demonstrations and online corrections, and bounds interaction forces with per-axis compliance to ensure safe and effective learning.

Result: Experiments on Harting connector module assembly with minimal clearance (0.2-0.4 mm) showed reliable performance achieved within practical time limits.

Conclusion: SHaRe-RL facilitates safer and economically viable deployment of reinforcement learning in industrial assembly by integrating process expertise without requiring robotics or RL-specific knowledge.

Abstract: High-mix low-volume (HMLV) industrial assembly, common in small and
medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), requires the same precision, safety, and
reliability as high-volume automation while remaining flexible to product
variation and environmental uncertainty. Current robotic systems struggle to
meet these demands. Manual programming is brittle and costly to adapt, while
learning-based methods suffer from poor sample efficiency and unsafe
exploration in contact-rich tasks. To address this, we present SHaRe-RL, a
reinforcement learning framework that leverages multiple sources of prior
knowledge. By (i) structuring skills into manipulation primitives, (ii)
incorporating human demonstrations and online corrections, and (iii) bounding
interaction forces with per-axis compliance, SHaRe-RL enables efficient and
safe online learning for long-horizon, contact-rich industrial assembly tasks.
Experiments on the insertion of industrial Harting connector modules with
0.2-0.4 mm clearance demonstrate that SHaRe-RL achieves reliable performance
within practical time budgets. Our results show that process expertise, without
requiring robotics or RL knowledge, can meaningfully contribute to learning,
enabling safer, more robust, and more economically viable deployment of RL for
industrial assembly.

*Zewei Yang,Zengqi Peng,Jun Ma*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces SEG-Parking, an end-to-end offline reinforcement learning framework designed for interaction-aware autonomous parking in complex and dynamic environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous parking in urban settings faces difficulties due to unstructured environments and dynamic interactions, necessitating advanced solutions for safe and efficient operation.

Method: The framework employs a specialized parking dataset, a pretrained goal-conditioned state encoder for mapping fused perception data into latent space, and an offline RL policy trained with a conservative regularizer to prevent out-of-distribution actions.

Result: Experiments in the CARLA simulator show that SEG-Parking achieves superior success rates and generalizes well to out-of-distribution parking scenarios.

Conclusion: SEG-Parking offers a promising solution for handling challenging autonomous parking scenarios, with plans to release the associated dataset and code for further research use.

Abstract: Autonomous parking is a critical component for achieving safe and efficient
urban autonomous driving. However, unstructured environments and dynamic
interactions pose significant challenges to autonomous parking tasks. To
address this problem, we propose SEG-Parking, a novel end-to-end offline
reinforcement learning (RL) framework to achieve interaction-aware autonomous
parking. Notably, a specialized parking dataset is constructed for parking
scenarios, which include those without interference from the opposite vehicle
(OV) and complex ones involving interactions with the OV. Based on this
dataset, a goal-conditioned state encoder is pretrained to map the fused
perception information into the latent space. Then, an offline RL policy is
optimized with a conservative regularizer that penalizes out-of-distribution
actions. Extensive closed-loop experiments are conducted in the high-fidelity
CARLA simulator. Comparative results demonstrate the superior performance of
our framework with the highest success rate and robust generalization to
out-of-distribution parking scenarios. The related dataset and source code will
be made publicly available after the paper is accepted.

### [265] [MetricNet: Recovering Metric Scale in Generative Navigation Policies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13965)
*Abhijeet Nayak,Débora N. P. Oliveira,Samiran Gode,Cordelia Schmid,Wolfram Burgard*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces MetricNet, a tool to improve generative navigation policies by adding metric grounding to trajectories, avoiding unsafe robot movements and enhancing navigation and exploration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generative navigation policies face issues with unscaled trajectory spaces and short-sighted waypoint-based control, leading to unsafe robotic movements.

Method: MetricNet predicts the metric distance between waypoints, integrating real-world coordinates into navigation. MetricNav incorporates MetricNet into navigation policies to guide robots safely.

Result: Experiments in both simulations and the real world demonstrate that MetricNet significantly improves navigation and exploration performance.

Conclusion: Incorporating metric grounding via MetricNet improves generative navigation policies' safety, efficiency, and utility in real-world and simulated environments.

Abstract: Generative navigation policies have made rapid progress in improving
end-to-end learned navigation. Despite their promising results, this paradigm
has two structural problems. First, the sampled trajectories exist in an
abstract, unscaled space without metric grounding. Second, the control strategy
discards the full path, instead moving directly towards a single waypoint. This
leads to short-sighted and unsafe actions, moving the robot towards obstacles
that a complete and correctly scaled path would circumvent. To address these
issues, we propose MetricNet, an effective add-on for generative navigation
that predicts the metric distance between waypoints, grounding policy outputs
in real-world coordinates. We evaluate our method in simulation with a new
benchmarking framework and show that executing MetricNet-scaled waypoints
significantly improves both navigation and exploration performance. Beyond
simulation, we further validate our approach in real-world experiments.
Finally, we propose MetricNav, which integrates MetricNet into a navigation
policy to guide the robot away from obstacles while still moving towards the
goal.

### [266] [BIM Informed Visual SLAM for Construction Monitoring](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13972)
*Asier Bikandi,Miguel Fernandez-Cortizas,Muhammad Shaheer,Ali Tourani,Holger Voos,Jose Luis Sanchez-Lopez*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces a real-time RGB-D SLAM system that integrates Building Information Models (BIM) as structural priors to enhance SLAM accuracy in challenging construction environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Monitoring construction sites effectively requires precise as-built vs. as-planned alignment, but traditional SLAM tools either rely on large LiDAR setups or face challenges like occlusions and repetitive layouts with visual-only methods.

Method: The proposed RGB-D SLAM system integrates BIM constraints into the mapping process, using detected wall correspondences and introducing them as back-end optimization constraints.

Result: The method demonstrated a 23.71% reduction in trajectory error and a 7.14% reduction in map RMSE compared to visual SLAM baselines in real construction site tests.

Conclusion: Incorporating BIM constraints improves the reliability and alignment of SLAM systems in construction environments, enabling better as-planned vs. as-built alignment even in incomplete structures.

Abstract: Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) is a key tool for monitoring
construction sites, where aligning the evolving as-built state with the
as-planned design enables early error detection and reduces costly rework.
LiDAR-based SLAM achieves high geometric precision, but its sensors are
typically large and power-demanding, limiting their use on portable platforms.
Visual SLAM offers a practical alternative with lightweight cameras already
embedded in most mobile devices. however, visually mapping construction
environments remains challenging: repetitive layouts, occlusions, and
incomplete or low-texture structures often cause drift in the trajectory map.
To mitigate this, we propose an RGB-D SLAM system that incorporates the
Building Information Model (BIM) as structural prior knowledge. Instead of
relying solely on visual cues, our system continuously establishes
correspondences between detected wall and their BIM counterparts, which are
then introduced as constraints in the back-end optimization. The proposed
method operates in real time and has been validated on real construction sites,
reducing trajectory error by an average of 23.71% and map RMSE by 7.14%
compared to visual SLAM baselines. These results demonstrate that BIM
constraints enable reliable alignment of the digital plan with the as-built
scene, even under partially constructed conditions.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel distributed manipulator system (DMS) design with origami-inspired robotic tiles connected by a compliant surface layer, enabling continuous manipulation and reduced actuator density.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Object manipulation remains a fundamental robotics challenge, requiring systems to balance between capabilities, complexity, and throughput.

Method: The approach combines origami-inspired 3-DoF robotic tiles interconnected by a compliant layer to create a flexible manipulation surface. Motion primitives and workspace analysis for the system are included.

Result: The design reduces actuator density and expands manipulation area by 1.84 times without additional actuators.

Conclusion: This lower-cost design provides an alternative to high-density actuator arrays, introducing flexible manipulation strategies leveraging interconnected surfaces.

Abstract: Object manipulation is a fundamental challenge in robotics, where systems
must balance trade-offs among manipulation capabilities, system complexity, and
throughput. Distributed manipulator systems (DMS) use the coordinated motion of
actuator arrays to perform complex object manipulation tasks, seeing widespread
exploration within the literature and in industry. However, existing DMS
designs typically rely on high actuator densities and impose constraints on
object-to-actuator scale ratios, limiting their adaptability. We present a
novel DMS design utilizing an array of 3-DoF, origami-inspired robotic tiles
interconnected by a compliant surface layer. Unlike conventional DMS, our
approach enables manipulation not only at the actuator end effectors but also
across a flexible surface connecting all actuators; creating a continuous,
controllable manipulation surface. We analyse the combined workspace of such a
system, derive simple motion primitives, and demonstrate its capabilities to
translate simple geometric objects across an array of tiles. By leveraging the
inter-tile connective material, our approach significantly reduces actuator
density, increasing the area over which an object can be manipulated by x1.84
without an increase in the number of actuators. This design offers a lower cost
and complexity alternative to traditional high-density arrays, and introduces
new opportunities for manipulation strategies that leverage the flexibility of
the interconnected surface.

TL;DR: This paper discusses the design and whole-body motion control of an omnidirectional wheel-legged quadrupedal robot that includes a dexterous manipulator, addressing challenges with a unified and optimized control framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the challenges in controlling wheel-legged robots with manipulators, such as redundancy in degrees of freedom, complex wheel-ground dynamics, and the coordination between locomotion and manipulation, for applications in logistics, industrial automation, and service robotics.

Method: The researchers utilized a contact-aware whole-body dynamic optimization framework integrating point-contact modeling for manipulation and line-contact modeling for wheel-ground interaction. They also employed a warm-start strategy for real-time optimization and developed a unified kinematic model for seamless control.

Result: The platform was validated through simulations and experiments, showing agility in terrain traversal, omnidirectional mobility, and precise manipulation, demonstrating its potential across various use cases in semi-structured environments.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively enhances locomotion and manipulation in wheel-legged robots, showcasing its applicability in factory automation, urban logistics, and service robotics.

Abstract: Wheel-legged robots with integrated manipulators hold great promise for
mobile manipulation in logistics, industrial automation, and human-robot
collaboration. However, unified control of such systems remains challenging due
to the redundancy in degrees of freedom, complex wheel-ground contact dynamics,
and the need for seamless coordination between locomotion and manipulation. In
this work, we present the design and whole-body motion control of an
omnidirectional wheel-legged quadrupedal robot equipped with a dexterous
manipulator. The proposed platform incorporates independently actuated steering
modules and hub-driven wheels, enabling agile omnidirectional locomotion with
high maneuverability in structured environments. To address the challenges of
contact-rich interaction, we develop a contact-aware whole-body dynamic
optimization framework that integrates point-contact modeling for manipulation
with line-contact modeling for wheel-ground interactions. A warm-start strategy
is introduced to accelerate online optimization, ensuring real-time feasibility
for high-dimensional control. Furthermore, a unified kinematic model tailored
for the robot's 4WIS-4WID actuation scheme eliminates the need for mode
switching across different locomotion strategies, improving control consistency
and robustness. Simulation and experimental results validate the effectiveness
of the proposed framework, demonstrating agile terrain traversal, high-speed
omnidirectional mobility, and precise manipulation under diverse scenarios,
underscoring the system's potential for factory automation, urban logistics,
and service robotics in semi-structured environments.

*Rui Huang,Zhiyu Gao,Siyu Tang,Jialin Zhang,Lei He,Ziqian Zhang,Lin Zhao*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces TransforMARS, a framework for reconfiguring modular aerial robots to handle multiple faults while maintaining stable flight.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations of previous systems that focused only on simple faults and specific shapes, providing a more general solution for fault-tolerant reconfigurations in modular aerial robots.

Method: Developed algorithms for identifying controllable assemblies, planning disassembly-assembly sequences, and enabling fault-tolerant reconfigurations in arbitrarily shaped MARS.

Result: Demonstrated improvements in handling diverse configurations and fault tolerances, validated with challenging tests and practical scenarios.

Conclusion: TransforMARS extends fault-tolerance capability and reconfiguration flexibility in MARS, improving reliability and versatility over prior methods.

Abstract: Modular Aerial Robot Systems (MARS) consist of multiple drone modules that
are physically bound together to form a single structure for flight. Exploiting
structural redundancy, MARS can be reconfigured into different formations to
mitigate unit or rotor failures and maintain stable flight. Prior work on MARS
self-reconfiguration has solely focused on maximizing controllability margins
to tolerate a single rotor or unit fault for rectangular-shaped MARS. We
propose TransforMARS, a general fault-tolerant reconfiguration framework that
transforms arbitrarily shaped MARS under multiple rotor and unit faults while
ensuring continuous in-air stability. Specifically, we develop algorithms to
first identify and construct minimum controllable assemblies containing faulty
units. We then plan feasible disassembly-assembly sequences to transport MARS
units or subassemblies to form target configuration. Our approach enables more
flexible and practical feasible reconfiguration. We validate TransforMARS in
challenging arbitrarily shaped MARS configurations, demonstrating substantial
improvements over prior works in both the capacity of handling diverse
configurations and the number of faults tolerated. The videos and source code

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current robot learning methods require large datasets and struggle with coordinate transformations, limiting efficiency and generalization.

Method: The authors propose a geometry-invariant Gaussian process framework (GeoGP) coupled with a dataset-construction strategy that ensures invariance to translation, rotation, and scaling.

Result: Simulations and real-world robotic experiments show that Prompt2Auto generalizes well across tasks, reduces the need for extensive demonstrations, and supports multi-step/multi-skill autonomy.

Conclusion: Prompt2Auto effectively addresses the challenges of robot learning by reducing data requirements and ensuring geometric invariance, enhancing its practical applicability.

Abstract: Learning from demonstration allows robots to acquire complex skills from
human demonstrations, but conventional approaches often require large datasets
and fail to generalize across coordinate transformations. In this paper, we
propose Prompt2Auto, a geometry-invariant one-shot Gaussian process (GeoGP)
learning framework that enables robots to perform human-guided automated
control from a single motion prompt. A dataset-construction strategy based on
coordinate transformations is introduced that enforces invariance to
translation, rotation, and scaling, while supporting multi-step predictions.
Moreover, GeoGP is robust to variations in the user's motion prompt and
supports multi-skill autonomy. We validate the proposed approach through
numerical simulations with the designed user graphical interface and two
real-world robotic experiments, which demonstrate that the proposed method is
effective, generalizes across tasks, and significantly reduces the
demonstration burden. Project page is available at:

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework for autonomous aircraft that integrates natural language understanding with spatial reasoning for improved goal prediction and decision-making in untowered airspaces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enable autonomous aircraft to safely operate in untowered airspace by predicting pilot intent and goal locations through multimodal approaches.

Method: The framework uses automatic speech recognition, large language models to process pilot communication, labels intents, and combines them with observed trajectories via a temporal convolutional network and Gaussian mixture model to predict aircraft goals probabilistically.

Result: The approach significantly reduced goal prediction error compared to motion-history based methods and demonstrated superior prediction accuracy.

Conclusion: Language-conditioned prediction enhances autonomous decision-making in airspaces, providing socially-aware robotic planning validated through real-world data.

Abstract: Autonomous aircraft must safely operate in untowered airspace, where
coordination relies on voice-based communication among human pilots. Safe
operation requires an aircraft to predict the intent, and corresponding goal
location, of other aircraft. This paper introduces a multimodal framework for
aircraft goal prediction that integrates natural language understanding with
spatial reasoning to improve autonomous decision-making in such environments.
We leverage automatic speech recognition and large language models to
transcribe and interpret pilot radio calls, identify aircraft, and extract
discrete intent labels. These intent labels are fused with observed
trajectories to condition a temporal convolutional network and Gaussian mixture
model for probabilistic goal prediction. Our method significantly reduces goal
prediction error compared to baselines that rely solely on motion history,
demonstrating that language-conditioned prediction increases prediction
accuracy. Experiments on a real-world dataset from an untowered airport
validate the approach and highlight its potential to enable socially aware,
language-conditioned robotic motion planning.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper proposes a new torque controller to ensure precise robotic tool manipulation in minimally invasive surgeries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Achieving reliable and dynamic satisfaction of the remote center of motion (RCM) constraint in robotic-assisted surgery remains a challenge.

Method: A constraint-consistent torque controller is developed using a projection-based inverse-dynamics framework, embedding the RCM as a rheonomic holonomic constraint.

Result: The controller demonstrated improved RCM satisfaction, reduced torque requirements, and robust torque behavior during simulations and real-world tests.

Conclusion: This approach enhances safety and reliability in robotic-assisted surgical operations by ensuring consistent constraint satisfaction.

Abstract: Robotic-assisted minimally invasive surgery (RAMIS) requires precise
enforcement of the remote center of motion (RCM) constraint to ensure safe tool
manipulation through a trocar. Achieving this constraint under dynamic and
interactive conditions remains challenging, as existing control methods either
lack robustness at the torque level or do not guarantee consistent RCM
constraint satisfaction. This paper proposes a constraint-consistent torque
controller that treats the RCM as a rheonomic holonomic constraint and embeds
it into a projection-based inverse-dynamics framework. The method unifies
task-level and kinematic formulations, enabling accurate tool-tip tracking
while maintaining smooth and efficient torque behavior. The controller is
validated both in simulation and on a RAMIS training platform, and is
benchmarked against state-of-the-art approaches. Results show improved RCM
constraint satisfaction, reduced required torque, and robust performance by
improving joint torque smoothness through the consistency formulation under
clinically relevant scenarios, including spiral trajectories, variable
insertion depths, moving trocars, and human interaction. These findings
demonstrate the potential of constraint-consistent torque control to enhance
safety and reliability in surgical robotics. The project page is available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide an efficient and scalable method for training autonomous drones using FPV videos while reducing the reliance on costly real-world data.

Method: A diffusion model generates realistic FPV video sequences and action spaces, enabling both direct policy learning and the creation of large-scale synthetic training datasets.

Result: Generated drone trajectories are highly feasible and improve training effectiveness. Experiments show strong sim-to-real transfer with no significant performance gap between simulated and real-world environments.

Conclusion: FlightDiffusion successfully merges navigation, action reasoning, and data synthesis into a cohesive framework, advancing autonomous drone training and research capabilities.

Abstract: We present FlightDiffusion, a diffusion-model-based framework for training
autonomous drones from first-person view (FPV) video. Our model generates
realistic video sequences from a single frame, enriched with corresponding
action spaces to enable reasoning-driven navigation in dynamic environments.
Beyond direct policy learning, FlightDiffusion leverages its generative
capabilities to synthesize diverse FPV trajectories and state-action pairs,
facilitating the creation of large-scale training datasets without the high
cost of real-world data collection. Our evaluation demonstrates that the
generated trajectories are physically plausible and executable, with a mean
position error of 0.25 m (RMSE 0.28 m) and a mean orientation error of 0.19 rad
(RMSE 0.24 rad). This approach enables improved policy learning and dataset
scalability, leading to superior performance in downstream navigation tasks.
Results in simulated environments highlight enhanced robustness, smoother
trajectory planning, and adaptability to unseen conditions. An ANOVA revealed
no statistically significant difference between performance in simulation and
reality (F(1, 16) = 0.394, p = 0.541), with success rates of M = 0.628 (SD =
0.162) and M = 0.617 (SD = 0.177), respectively, indicating strong sim-to-real
transfer. The generated datasets provide a valuable resource for future UAV

TL;DR: GeoAware-VLA enhances Vision-Language-Action models by integrating robust 3D geometric priors, enabling better generalization to novel camera viewpoints in simulation and real-world scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the limitation of VLA models struggling to generalize to new camera angles due to weak 3D geometric reasoning.

Method: Utilizes a frozen, pretrained geometric vision model as a feature extractor, coupled with a trainable projection layer for policy adaptation.

Result: GeoAware-VLA significantly boosts zero-shot generalization, achieving over 2x success rates in simulation and notable gains in real-world robot tasks from unseen viewpoints.

Conclusion: Integrating strong geometric grounding dramatically improves viewpoint invariance in robotic agents across diverse settings and action spaces.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models often fail to generalize to novel camera
viewpoints, a limitation stemming from their difficulty in inferring robust 3D
geometry from 2D images. We introduce GeoAware-VLA, a simple yet effective
approach that enhances viewpoint invariance by integrating strong geometric
priors into the vision backbone. Instead of training a visual encoder or
relying on explicit 3D data, we leverage a frozen, pretrained geometric vision
model as a feature extractor. A trainable projection layer then adapts these
geometrically-rich features for the policy decoder, relieving it of the burden
of learning 3D consistency from scratch. Through extensive evaluations on
LIBERO benchmark subsets, we show GeoAware-VLA achieves substantial
improvements in zero-shot generalization to novel camera poses, boosting
success rates by over 2x in simulation. Crucially, these benefits translate to
the physical world; our model shows a significant performance gain on a real
robot, especially when evaluated from unseen camera angles. Our approach proves
effective across both continuous and discrete action spaces, highlighting that
robust geometric grounding is a key component for creating more generalizable
robotic agents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the challenges of coordinating multiple UAVs for cable-suspended payload transport, specifically addressing disturbances and slack-taut cable mode transitions.

Method: They develop the CrazyMARL framework using decentralized Reinforcement Learning and test its effectiveness through simulations compared to classical controllers.

Result: CrazyMARL achieves an 80% recovery rate in simulations under harsh conditions, significantly outperforming a baseline method's 44% recovery rate.

Conclusion: CrazyMARL demonstrates high robustness to disturbances and enables successful sim-to-real transfer, advancing autonomous UAV team operations for complex payload missions in unstructured environments.

Abstract: Collaborative transportation of cable-suspended payloads by teams of Unmanned
Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) has the potential to enhance payload capacity, adapt to
different payload shapes, and provide built-in compliance, making it attractive
for applications ranging from disaster relief to precision logistics. However,
multi-UAV coordination under disturbances, nonlinear payload dynamics, and
slack--taut cable modes remains a challenging control problem. To our
knowledge, no prior work has addressed these cable mode transitions in the
multi-UAV context, instead relying on simplifying rigid-link assumptions. We
propose CrazyMARL, a decentralized Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework for
multi-UAV cable-suspended payload transport. Simulation results demonstrate
that the learned policies can outperform classical decentralized controllers in
terms of disturbance rejection and tracking precision, achieving an 80%
recovery rate from harsh conditions compared to 44% for the baseline method. We
also achieve successful zero-shot sim-to-real transfer and demonstrate that our
policies are highly robust under harsh conditions, including wind, random
external disturbances, and transitions between slack and taut cable dynamics.
This work paves the way for autonomous, resilient UAV teams capable of
executing complex payload missions in unstructured environments.

Motivation: To address the inefficiencies in multi-robot delivery systems that rely solely on direct source-to-destination transport, especially under limited robot capacity constraints.

Method: Developed VCST-RCP, a framework using Voronoi-Constrained Steiner Tree optimization to construct efficient relay trunks and robot-level schedules.

Result: Performance improved up to 34% over conventional methods, demonstrating enhanced energy efficiency and scalability in multi-robot delivery systems.

Conclusion: VCST-RCP offers a scalable and energy-efficient solution for multi-robot logistics by leveraging relays for better coordination.

Abstract: We consider the problem of delivering multiple packages from a single pickup
depot to distinct goal locations using a homogeneous fleet of robots with
limited carrying capacity. We propose VCST-RCP, a Voronoi-Constrained Steiner
Tree Relay Coordination Planning framework that constructs sparse relay trunks
using Steiner tree optimization and then synthesizes robot-level pickup, relay,
and delivery schedules. This framework reframes relays from incidental
byproducts into central elements of coordination, offering a contrast with
traditional delivery methods that rely on direct source-to-destination
transport. Extensive experiments show consistent improvements of up to 34%
compared to conventional baselines, underscoring the benefits of incorporating
relays into the delivery process. These improvements translate directly to
enhanced energy efficiency in multi-robot delivery under capacity constraints,

Motivation: Existing VLA models for robotic manipulation, like $\pi_0$, lack mechanisms to detect subtask completion in long-horizon tasks, leading to downstream failures.

Method: SeqVLA extends $\pi_0$ by adding a detection head for subtask completion. Four finetuning strategies are explored, combining joint/sequential optimization and backbone freezing/unfreezing.

Result: SeqVLA demonstrates significant performance improvements over $\pi_0$ and other baselines in multi-stage tasks like salad packing and candy packing. Joint finetuning with unfrozen backbone provides the best results.

Conclusion: Coupling action generation with subtask-aware detection is key for robust sequential manipulation in robotic tasks, as illustrated by SeqVLA's success.

Abstract: Long-horizon robotic manipulation tasks require executing multiple
interdependent subtasks in strict sequence, where errors in detecting subtask
completion can cascade into downstream failures. Existing
Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models such as $\pi_0$ excel at continuous
low-level control but lack an internal signal for identifying when a subtask
has finished, making them brittle in sequential settings. We propose SeqVLA, a
completion-aware extension of $\pi_0$ that augments the base architecture with
a lightweight detection head perceiving whether the current subtask is
complete. This dual-head design enables SeqVLA not only to generate
manipulation actions but also to autonomously trigger transitions between
subtasks. We investigate four finetuning strategies that vary in how the action
and detection heads are optimized (joint vs. sequential finetuning) and how
pretrained knowledge is preserved (full finetuning vs. frozen backbone).
Experiments are performed on two multi-stage tasks: salad packing with seven
distinct subtasks and candy packing with four distinct subtasks. Results show
that SeqVLA significantly outperforms the baseline $\pi_0$ and other strong
baselines in overall success rate. In particular, joint finetuning with an
unfrozen backbone yields the most decisive and statistically reliable
completion predictions, eliminating sequence-related failures and enabling
robust long-horizon execution. Our results highlight the importance of coupling
action generation with subtask-aware detection for scalable sequential
manipulation.

### [278] [CLAW: A Vision-Language-Action Framework for Weight-Aware Robotic Grasping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14143)
*Zijian An,Ran Yang,Yiming Feng,Lifeng Zhou*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces CLAW, a model combining symbolic reasoning and visuomotor control for robotic tasks demanding precise weight-based constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vision-language-action models struggle with precise condition monitoring when tasked with numeric constraints, creating a need to improve robotic control accuracy.

Method: CLAW uses a fine-tuned CLIP model as a prompt generator for symbolic reasoning and integrates these prompts into a flow-based visuomotor control policy.

Result: Experiments across tasks like single-object grasping and dual-arm manipulation show CLAW executing weight-aware behaviors better than existing models.

Conclusion: CLAW successfully achieves precise task constraints by decoupling condition evaluation from action generation and blending symbolic reasoning with visuomotor control.

Abstract: Vision-language-action (VLA) models have recently emerged as a promising
paradigm for robotic control, enabling end-to-end policies that ground natural
language instructions into visuomotor actions. However, current VLAs often
struggle to satisfy precise task constraints, such as stopping based on numeric
thresholds, since their observation-to-action mappings are implicitly shaped by
training data and lack explicit mechanisms for condition monitoring. In this
work, we propose CLAW (CLIP-Language-Action for Weight), a framework that
decouples condition evaluation from action generation. CLAW leverages a
fine-tuned CLIP model as a lightweight prompt generator, which continuously
monitors the digital readout of a scale and produces discrete directives based
on task-specific weight thresholds. These prompts are then consumed by $\pi_0$,
a flow-based VLA policy, which integrates the prompts with multi-view camera
observations to produce continuous robot actions. This design enables CLAW to
combine symbolic weight reasoning with high-frequency visuomotor control. We
validate CLAW on three experimental setups: single-object grasping and
mixed-object tasks requiring dual-arm manipulation. Across all conditions, CLAW
reliably executes weight-aware behaviors and outperforms both raw-$\pi_0$ and
fine-tuned $\pi_0$ models. We have uploaded the videos as supplementary
materials.

*Fanxing Li,Shengyang Wang,Fangyu Sun,Shuyu Wu,Dexin Zuo,Wenxian Yu,Danping Zou*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: StableTracker is a learning-based control policy for FPV object tracking, outperforming traditional methods in precision and stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address problems with hardware overload and cumulative errors in traditional FPV object tracking, especially for fast-moving targets.

Method: Develop a control policy using backpropagation-through-time and differentiable simulation, enabling robust quadrotor tracking of moving targets.

Result: Simulation showed superior performance in accuracy, stability, and generalization. Real-world tests validated the approach.

Conclusion: StableTracker provides an effective solution for autonomous tracking, functioning as a reliable aerial camera even in diverse conditions.

Abstract: FPV object tracking methods heavily rely on handcraft modular designs,
resulting in hardware overload and cumulative error, which seriously degrades
the tracking performance, especially for rapidly accelerating or decelerating
targets. To address these challenges, we present \textbf{StableTracker}, a
learning-based control policy that enables quadrotors to robustly follow the
moving target from arbitrary perspectives. The policy is trained using
backpropagation-through-time via differentiable simulation, allowing the
quadrotor to maintain the target at the center of the visual field in both
horizontal and vertical directions, while keeping a fixed relative distance,
thereby functioning as an autonomous aerial camera. We compare StableTracker
against both state-of-the-art traditional algorithms and learning baselines.
Simulation experiments demonstrate that our policy achieves superior accuracy,
stability and generalization across varying safe distances, trajectories, and
target velocities. Furthermore, a real-world experiment on a quadrotor with an
onboard computer validated practicality of the proposed approach.

### [280] [MIMIC-D: Multi-modal Imitation for MultI-agent Coordination with Decentralized Diffusion Policies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14159)
*Dayi Dong,Maulik Bhatt,Seoyeon Choi,Negar Mehr*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Researchers propose MIMIC-D, combining centralized training with decentralized execution for multi-modal multi-agent imitation learning, enabling robots to coordinate effectively without direct communication.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robots increasingly need to coordinate on multi-modal tasks involving diverse strategies and independent operation, especially in scenarios with limited direct communication between agents (e.g., robots and humans).

Method: This paper introduces MIMIC-D, leveraging diffusion models for imitation learning. Training is centralized with full information, but execution is decentralized, relying only on local data for implicit agent coordination.

Result: The proposed method, MIMIC-D, achieved multi-modal coordination among agents in both simulations and hardware experiments, outperforming state-of-the-art approaches.

Conclusion: MIMIC-D successfully handles multi-modal strategies in multi-agent systems with decentralized execution, contributing to improved coordination and robustness in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: As robots become more integrated in society, their ability to coordinate with
other robots and humans on multi-modal tasks (those with multiple valid
solutions) is crucial. We propose to learn such behaviors from expert
demonstrations via imitation learning (IL). However, when expert demonstrations
are multi-modal, standard IL approaches can struggle to capture the diverse
strategies, hindering effective coordination. Diffusion models are known to be
effective at handling complex multi-modal trajectory distributions in
single-agent systems. Diffusion models have also excelled in multi-agent
scenarios where multi-modality is more common and crucial to learning
coordinated behaviors. Typically, diffusion-based approaches require a
centralized planner or explicit communication among agents, but this assumption
can fail in real-world scenarios where robots must operate independently or
with agents like humans that they cannot directly communicate with. Therefore,
we propose MIMIC-D, a Centralized Training, Decentralized Execution (CTDE)
paradigm for multi-modal multi-agent imitation learning using diffusion
policies. Agents are trained jointly with full information, but execute
policies using only local information to achieve implicit coordination. We
demonstrate in both simulation and hardware experiments that our method
recovers multi-modal coordination behavior among agents in a variety of tasks
and environments, while improving upon state-of-the-art baselines.

*Kai Ye,Yuhang Wu,Shuyuan Hu,Junliang Li,Meng Liu,Yongquan Chen,Rui Huang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to derive robotic grasping skills from generated videos rather than costly human demonstrations, achieving high success rates and real-world application.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robotic dexterous manipulation faces challenges due to limited availability of human demonstrations, prompting the need for alternative ways to train robots.

Method: The approach leverages video generation, pose and depth estimation, trajectory optimization with a physics-aware model, and anchors residual PPO learning to create robotic grasping skills based purely on generated videos.

Result: The method achieved a 77.3% success rate in simulation grasping tasks and effectively executed these tasks on a real robot.

Conclusion: The proposed system showcases flexibility and robustness by generalizing skills from imagined videos to real-world tasks, enabling task specification using natural language.

Abstract: Dexterous manipulation remains a challenging robotics problem, largely due to
the difficulty of collecting extensive human demonstrations for learning. In
this paper, we introduce \textsc{Gen2Real}, which replaces costly human demos
with one generated video and drives robot skill from it: it combines
demonstration generation that leverages video generation with pose and depth
estimation to yield hand-object trajectories, trajectory optimization that uses
Physics-aware Interaction Optimization Model (PIOM) to impose physics
consistency, and demonstration learning that retargets human motions to a robot
hand and stabilizes control with an anchor-based residual Proximal Policy
Optimization (PPO) policy. Using only generated videos, the learned policy
achieves a 77.3\% success rate on grasping tasks in simulation and demonstrates
coherent executions on a real robot. We also conduct ablation studies to
validate the contribution of each component and demonstrate the ability to
directly specify tasks using natural language, highlighting the flexibility and
robustness of \textsc{Gen2Real} in generalizing grasping skills from imagined
videos to real-world execution.

*Zhihao Cao,Hanyu Wu,Li Wa Tang,Zizhou Luo,Zihan Zhu,Wei Zhang,Marc Pollefeys,Martin R. Oswald*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces MCGS-SLAM, the first RGB-based multi-camera SLAM system built on 3D Gaussian Splatting, achieving robust, large-scale mapping and photorealistic reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Monocular SLAM systems often lack robustness and geometric coverage. The aim is to create a system leveraging multi-camera RGB input for enhanced 3D mapping.

Method: MCGS-SLAM fuses dense RGB inputs from multiple cameras into a continuously optimized Gaussian map, incorporates multi-camera bundle adjustment (MCBA) for pose refinement, and uses a scale consistency module for metric alignment.

Result: Experiments demonstrate accurate trajectories, photorealistic reconstruction, and improved coverage compared to monocular systems, specifically in side-view regions.

Conclusion: MCGS-SLAM offers high-fidelity mapping for robotics and autonomous driving, addressing gaps in existing monocular SLAM systems.

Abstract: Recent progress in dense SLAM has primarily targeted monocular setups, often
at the expense of robustness and geometric coverage. We present MCGS-SLAM, the
first purely RGB-based multi-camera SLAM system built on 3D Gaussian Splatting
(3DGS). Unlike prior methods relying on sparse maps or inertial data, MCGS-SLAM
fuses dense RGB inputs from multiple viewpoints into a unified, continuously
optimized Gaussian map. A multi-camera bundle adjustment (MCBA) jointly refines
poses and depths via dense photometric and geometric residuals, while a scale
consistency module enforces metric alignment across views using low-rank
priors. The system supports RGB input and maintains real-time performance at
large scale. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show that
MCGS-SLAM consistently yields accurate trajectories and photorealistic
reconstructions, usually outperforming monocular baselines. Notably, the wide
field of view from multi-camera input enables reconstruction of side-view
regions that monocular setups miss, critical for safe autonomous operation.
These results highlight the promise of multi-camera Gaussian Splatting SLAM for
high-fidelity mapping in robotics and autonomous driving.

*Seth Farrell,Chenghao Li,Hongzhan Yu,Hesam Mojtahedi,Sicun Gao,Henrik I. Christensen*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces GLIDE, a collaborative system involving UAVs and a UGV for efficient search-and-rescue operations in unfamiliar environments, emphasizing victim detection and obstacle-aware navigation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve speed and safety in search-and-rescue missions by leveraging cooperative UAV and UGV systems for victim localization and obstacle navigation.

Method: The framework uses two UAVs for real-time victim detection/georeferencing and terrain scouting, paired with a UGV for A* planning that incorporates aerial and local sensing. It was tested in hardware and simulations.

Result: Results showed better reach time and enhanced navigation safety due to explicit roles for UAVs and the integration of mid-level terrain scouting and guided planning.

Conclusion: Explicit UAV role separation and cooperative planning greatly enhance the efficiency and safety of SAR missions.

Abstract: We present a cooperative aerial-ground search-and-rescue (SAR) framework that
pairs two unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with an unmanned ground vehicle (UGV)
to achieve rapid victim localization and obstacle-aware navigation in unknown
environments. We dub this framework Guided Long-horizon Integrated Drone Escort
(GLIDE), highlighting the UGV's reliance on UAV guidance for long-horizon
planning. In our framework, a goal-searching UAV executes real-time onboard
victim detection and georeferencing to nominate goals for the ground platform,
while a terrain-scouting UAV flies ahead of the UGV's planned route to provide
mid-level traversability updates. The UGV fuses aerial cues with local sensing
to perform time-efficient A* planning and continuous replanning as information
arrives. Additionally, we present a hardware demonstration (using a GEM e6 golf
cart as the UGV and two X500 UAVs) to evaluate end-to-end SAR mission
performance and include simulation ablations to assess the planning stack in
isolation from detection. Empirical results demonstrate that explicit role
separation across UAVs, coupled with terrain scouting and guided planning,
improves reach time and navigation safety in time-critical SAR missions.

*Benjamin Shaffer,Victoria Edwards,Brooks Kinch,Nathaniel Trask,M. Ani Hsieh*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework where robots use machine-learned models to optimize information gathering while localizing sources in complex flow environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for efficient robot teams to localize chemical leaks or track dispersion in environments with chaotic flows and limited onboard computation.

Method: Each robot employs a machine-learned finite element model to optimize sampling via a mutual information-based infotaxis control strategy.

Result: This approach enables quicker error reduction and more accurate source localization compared to baseline methods.

Conclusion: Machine-learned models integrated with infotaxis sampling strategies significantly enhance the ability of robots to localize sources in challenging environments.

Abstract: Source localization in a complex flow poses a significant challenge for
multi-robot teams tasked with localizing the source of chemical leaks or
tracking the dispersion of an oil spill. The flow dynamics can be time-varying
and chaotic, resulting in sporadic and intermittent sensor readings, and
complex environmental geometries further complicate a team's ability to model
and predict the dispersion. To accurately account for the physical processes
that drive the dispersion dynamics, robots must have access to computationally
intensive numerical models, which can be difficult when onboard computation is
limited. We present a distributed mobile sensing framework for source
localization in which each robot carries a machine-learned, finite element
model of its environment to guide information-based sampling. The models are
used to evaluate an approximate mutual information criterion to drive an
infotaxis control strategy, which selects sensing regions that are expected to
maximize informativeness for the source localization objective. Our approach
achieves faster error reduction compared to baseline sensing strategies and
results in more accurate source localization compared to baseline machine
learning approaches.

*Evan Eisinger,Michael A. Heroux*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper explores whether Research Software Science (RSS), which studies the development and use of research software, should be classified as a form of metascience and highlights the implications for recognition, funding, and research improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the growing reliance on computational methods in research and examine how improving research software quality can align with metascience for reliable scientific findings.

Method: The paper defines and compares Research Software Science (RSS) and metascience, analyzes their principles and objectives, and evaluates overlaps and distinctions to determine RSS's classification.

Result: The analysis reveals that RSS aligns closely with metascience goals in areas like computational reproducibility and bridges technical, social, and cognitive aspects of science. Its classification depends on the definition of metascience adopted.

Conclusion: RSS is best understood as an interdisciplinary domain that is compatible with metascience and can strengthen science reliability, justify funding, and encourage research institutions to prioritize software quality.

Abstract: As research increasingly relies on computational methods, the reliability of
scientific results depends on the quality, reproducibility, and transparency of
research software. Ensuring these qualities is critical for scientific
integrity and discovery. This paper asks whether Research Software Science
(RSS)--the empirical study of how research software is developed and
used--should be considered a form of metascience, the science of science.
Classification matters because it could affect recognition, funding, and
integration of RSS into research improvement. We define metascience and RSS,
compare their principles and objectives, and examine their overlaps. Arguments
for classification highlight shared commitments to reproducibility,
transparency, and empirical study of research processes. Arguments against
portraying RSS as a specialized domain focused on a tool rather than the
broader scientific enterprise. Our analysis finds RSS advances core goals of
metascience, especially in computational reproducibility, and bridges
technical, social, and cognitive aspects of research. Its classification
depends on whether one adopts a broad definition of metascience--any empirical
effort to improve science--or a narrow one focused on systemic and
epistemological structures. We argue RSS is best understood as a distinct
interdisciplinary domain that aligns with, and in some definitions fits within,
metascience. Recognizing it as such can strengthen its role in improving
reliability, justify funding, and elevate software development in research
institutions. Regardless of classification, applying scientific rigor to
research software ensures the tools of discovery meet the standards of the
discoveries themselves.

*Sina Gogani-Khiabani,Ashutosh Trivedi,Diptikalyan Saha,Saeid Tizpaz-Niari*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The study explores using large language models (LLMs) for translating legal texts into executable code, focusing on U.S. tax law. An agentic method enables automated test generation and code synthesis, improving reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of creating reliable software for legally critical applications, particularly overcoming ambiguity and hallucinations in LLM translations of legal texts.

Method: The research uses a multi-agent system powered by LLMs to automate testing and code synthesis. It incorporates higher-order metamorphic testing to generate cases that interpret legal texts based on structured shifts.

Result: When tested on complex tax-code tasks, the approach achieved a worst-case pass rate of 45% using GPT-4o-mini, outperforming leading LLMs like GPT-4o and Claude 3.5, which scored 9-15%.

Conclusion: Agentic LLM methods show promise in developing trustworthy software from natural-language legal specifications, offering improved accuracy in legally critical applications.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show promise for translating natural-language
statutes into executable logic, but reliability in legally critical settings
remains challenging due to ambiguity and hallucinations. We present an agentic
approach for developing legal-critical software, using U.S. federal tax
preparation as a case study. The key challenge is test-case generation under
the oracle problem, where correct outputs require interpreting law. Building on
metamorphic testing, we introduce higher-order metamorphic relations that
compare system outputs across structured shifts among similar individuals.
Because authoring such relations is tedious and error-prone, we use an
LLM-driven, role-based framework to automate test generation and code
synthesis. We implement a multi-agent system that translates tax code into
executable software and incorporates a metamorphic-testing agent that searches
for counterexamples. In experiments, our framework using a smaller model
(GPT-4o-mini) achieves a worst-case pass rate of 45%, outperforming frontier
models (GPT-4o and Claude 3.5, 9-15%) on complex tax-code tasks. These results
support agentic LLM methodologies as a path to robust, trustworthy
legal-critical software from natural-language specifications.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Prompt2DAG converts natural language descriptions into Apache Airflow DAGs. A Hybrid approach proved optimal, achieving high success rates and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Streamlining data pipeline development through automation to minimize reliance on extensive engineering expertise.

Method: Evaluation of four DAG generation strategies using 13 LLMs and a penalized scoring framework across 260 experiments and 5 case studies.

Result: The Hybrid approach achieved 78.5% success rate, outperforming others in reliability, structural integrity, and cost-effectiveness.

Conclusion: A structured Hybrid approach is critical for balancing automation's reliability and flexibility, paving the way for accessible pipeline development.

Abstract: Developing reliable data enrichment pipelines demands significant engineering
expertise. We present Prompt2DAG, a methodology that transforms natural
language descriptions into executable Apache Airflow DAGs. We evaluate four
generation approaches -- Direct, LLM-only, Hybrid, and Template-based -- across
260 experiments using thirteen LLMs and five case studies to identify optimal
strategies for production-grade automation. Performance is measured using a
penalized scoring framework that combines reliability with code quality (SAT),
structural integrity (DST), and executability (PCT). The Hybrid approach
emerges as the optimal generative method, achieving a 78.5% success rate with
robust quality scores (SAT: 6.79, DST: 7.67, PCT: 7.76). This significantly
outperforms the LLM-only (66.2% success) and Direct (29.2% success) methods.
Our findings show that reliability, not intrinsic code quality, is the primary
differentiator. Cost-effectiveness analysis reveals the Hybrid method is over
twice as efficient as Direct prompting per successful DAG. We conclude that a
structured, hybrid approach is essential for balancing flexibility and
reliability in automated workflow generation, offering a viable path to
democratize data pipeline development.

*S M Farah Al Fahim,Md Nakhla Rafi,Zeyang Ma,Dong Jae Kim,Tse-Hsun,Chen*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper investigates enhancing crash reports with fault locations, root-cause explanations, and repair suggestions using LLMs, improving debugging effectiveness significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Crash reports often lack sufficient diagnostic detail for efficient debugging, creating a need for more actionable insights.

Method: The study uses two strategies: Direct-LLM, which directly uses stack-trace context, and Agentic-LLM, which iteratively explores repository code for additional evidence.

Result: Enhancements improve problem-localization accuracy from 10.6% to around 40.2-43.1%, and suggested fixes achieve a CodeBLEU score of ~56-57%. Agentic-LLM also provides superior root-cause explanations and repair guidance compared to Direct-LLM.

Conclusion: Enhanced crash reports produced by LLMs, with integrated stack traces and repository exploration, substantially aid in understanding and resolving software crashes, especially in repair guidance.

Abstract: Crash reports are central to software maintenance, yet many lack the
diagnostic detail developers need to debug efficiently. We examine whether
large language models can enhance crash reports by adding fault locations,
root-cause explanations, and repair suggestions. We study two enhancement
strategies: Direct-LLM, a single-shot approach that uses stack-trace context,
and Agentic-LLM, an iterative approach that explores the repository for
additional evidence. On a dataset of 492 real-world crash reports, LLM-enhanced
reports improve Top-1 problem-localization accuracy from 10.6% (original
reports) to 40.2-43.1%, and produce suggested fixes that closely resemble
developer patches (CodeBLEU around 56-57%). Both our manual evaluations and
LLM-as-a-judge assessment show that Agentic-LLM delivers stronger root-cause
explanations and more actionable repair guidance. A user study with 16
participants further confirms that enhanced reports make crashes easier to
understand and resolve, with the largest improvement in repair guidance. These
results indicate that supplying LLMs with stack traces and repository code
yields enhanced crash reports that are substantially more useful for debugging.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper evaluates GitHub Copilot's new code review feature and finds it ineffective at spotting critical security vulnerabilities, emphasizing the need for dedicated security tools and manual oversight.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ensure AI-powered tools can effectively support secure software development practices.

Method: Analyzed GitHub Copilot's ability to detect security flaws by using labeled vulnerable code samples from diverse programming languages and application domains.

Result: Copilot predominantly fails to detect critical vulnerabilities like SQL injection and XSS, instead focusing on minor issues like coding style.

Conclusion: AI-assisted code review tools like Copilot cannot replace human oversight or dedicated security tools for achieving robust software security.

Abstract: As software development practices increasingly adopt AI-powered tools,
ensuring that such tools can support secure coding has become critical. This
study evaluates the effectiveness of GitHub Copilot's recently introduced code
review feature in detecting security vulnerabilities. Using a curated set of
labeled vulnerable code samples drawn from diverse open-source projects
spanning multiple programming languages and application domains, we
systematically assessed Copilot's ability to identify and provide feedback on
common security flaws. Contrary to expectations, our results reveal that
Copilot's code review frequently fails to detect critical vulnerabilities such
as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and insecure deserialization.
Instead, its feedback primarily addresses low-severity issues, such as coding
style and typographical errors. These findings expose a significant gap between
the perceived capabilities of AI-assisted code review and its actual
effectiveness in supporting secure development practices. Our results highlight
the continued necessity of dedicated security tools and manual code audits to
ensure robust software security.

*Yingao Elaine Yao,Vedant Nimje,Varun Viswanath,Saikat Dutta*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: NBTest introduces a regression testing framework for ML notebooks, enabling cell-level assertions and integration with pytest and CI pipelines to catch subtle bugs effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the lack of robust testing facilities in notebooks used for prototyping ML pipelines, which often leads to unnoticed silent errors and performance regressions.

Method: NBTest includes a library of assertion APIs, a JupyterLab plugin for executing assertions, and automated cell-level assertion generation for ML notebook components such as data processing and model evaluation.

Result: On 592 Kaggle notebooks, NBTest generated an average of 35.75 assertions per notebook, achieved a mutation score of 0.57, and successfully identified regression bugs. Flakiness was minimized using statistical techniques, and it was adopted in the CI of a popular ML library.

Conclusion: NBTest enhances the reliability and usability of ML notebooks by incorporating effective regression testing tools, with positive feedback from users and adoption by a major ML library.

Abstract: Notebooks have become the de-facto choice for data scientists and machine
learning engineers for prototyping and experimenting with machine learning (ML)
pipelines. Notebooks provide an interactive interface for code, data, and
visualization. However, notebooks provide very limited support for testing.
Thus, during continuous development, many subtle bugs that do not lead to
crashes often go unnoticed and cause silent errors that manifest as performance
regressions.
  To address this, we introduce NBTest - the first regression testing framework
that allows developers to write cell-level assertions in notebooks and run such
notebooks in pytest or in continuous integration (CI) pipelines. NBTest offers
a library of assertion APIs, and a JupyterLab plugin that enables executing
assertions. We also develop the first automated approach for generating
cell-level assertions for key components in ML notebooks, such as data
processing, model building, and model evaluation. NBTest aims to improve the
reliability and maintainability of ML notebooks without adding developer
burden.
  We evaluate NBTest on 592 Kaggle notebooks. Overall, NBTest generates 21163
assertions (35.75 on average per notebook). The generated assertions obtain a
mutation score of 0.57 in killing ML-specific mutations. NBTest can catch
regression bugs in previous versions of the Kaggle notebooks using assertions
generated for the latest versions. Because ML pipelines involve non
deterministic computations, the assertions can be flaky. Hence, we also show
how NBTest leverages statistical techniques to minimize flakiness while
retaining high fault-detection effectiveness. NBTest has been adopted in the CI
of a popular ML library. Further, we perform a user study with 17 participants
that shows that notebook users find NBTest intuitive (Rating 4.3/5) and useful
in writing assertions and testing notebooks (Rating 4.24/5).

### [291] [Prompt Stability in Code LLMs: Measuring Sensitivity across Emotion- and Personality-Driven Variations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13680)
*Wei Ma,Yixiao Yang,Jingquan Ge,Xiaofei Xie,Lingxiao Jiang*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces PromptSE, a framework for evaluating code generation models' sensitivity to prompt phrasing by creating semantic variants and assessing stability. It reveals insights on model robustness and offers tools for performance stability analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Code generation models are prone to instability based on how prompts are phrased, but this sensitivity has not been adequately studied, especially in terms of emotion and communication style variations.

Method: The authors developed the PromptSE framework, which generates semantically equivalent prompt variants using emotion/personality templates, assesses stability via scoring methods, and summarizes results with a new metric (AUC-E).

Result: Testing PromptSE across models from different families showed that performance and stability are largely unrelated optimization objectives, revealing patterns tied to architecture and scale and challenging assumptions about robustness.

Conclusion: PromptSE enables performance stability analysis for deployment and model selection, complementing evaluative dimensions like fairness and reliability, and thereby enhancing trustworthiness in AI-assisted software tools.

Abstract: Code generation models are widely used in software development, yet their
sensitivity to prompt phrasing remains under-examined. Identical requirements
expressed with different emotions or communication styles can yield divergent
outputs, while most benchmarks emphasize only peak performance. We present
PromptSE (Prompt Sensitivity Evaluation), a framework that creates semantically
equivalent prompt variants with emotion and personality templates, and that
evaluates stability using probability aware continuous scoring or using binary
pass rates when logits are unavailable. The results are aggregated into a
proposed area under curve metric (AUC-E) for cross model comparison. Across 14
models from three families (Llama, Qwen, and DeepSeek), our study shows that
performance and stability behave as largely decoupled optimization objectives,
and it reveals architectural and scale related patterns that challenge common
assumptions about model robustness. The framework supports rapid screening for
closed-source models as well as detailed stability analysis in research
settings. PromptSE enables practitioners to quantify performance stability
trade offs for deployment and model selection, positioning prompt stability as
a complementary evaluation dimension alongside performance and fairness, and
contributing to more trustworthy AI-assisted software development tools.

### [292] [Scrub It Out! Erasing Sensitive Memorization in Code Language Models via Machine Unlearning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13755)
*Zhaoyang Chu,Yao Wan,Zhikun Zhang,Di Wang,Zhou Yang,Hongyu Zhang,Pan Zhou,Xuanhua Shi,Hai Jin,David Lo*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper addresses privacy risks in Code Language Models by using machine unlearning techniques to efficiently erase sensitive memorized data without full-model retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Code Language Models memorize sensitive training data, risking privacy breaches, and current resolution methods require costly retraining.

Method: They use machine unlearning, specifically gradient ascent-based methods and introduce CodeEraser, to remove sensitive information without disturbing other code segments.

Result: Experiments show CodeEraser effectively removes sensitive data from three CLMs—CodeParrot, CodeGen-Mono, and Qwen2.5-Coder—while preserving the models' functionality.

Conclusion: CodeEraser provides a practical solution for mitigating privacy risks in CLMs without sacrificing computational efficiency or model performance.

Abstract: While Code Language Models (CLMs) have demonstrated superior performance in
software engineering tasks such as code generation and summarization, recent
empirical studies reveal a critical privacy vulnerability: these models exhibit
unintended memorization of sensitive training data, enabling verbatim
reproduction of confidential information when specifically prompted. To address
this issue, several approaches, including training data de-duplication and
differential privacy augmentation, have been proposed. However, these methods
require full-model retraining for deployed CLMs, which incurs substantial
computational costs. In this paper, we aim to answer the following research
question: Can sensitive information memorized by CLMs be erased effectively and
efficiently?
  We conduct a pioneering investigation into erasing sensitive memorization in
CLMs through machine unlearning - a post-hoc modification method that removes
specific information from trained models without requiring full retraining.
Specifically, we first quantify the memorization risks of sensitive data within
CLM training datasets and curate a high-risk dataset of 50,000 sensitive
memorized samples as unlearning targets. We study two widely used gradient
ascent-based unlearning approaches: the vanilla and constraint-based methods,
and introduce CodeEraser, an advanced variant that selectively unlearns
sensitive memorized segments in code while preserving the structural integrity
and functional correctness of the surrounding code. Extensive experiments on
three families of CLMs, i.e., CodeParrot, CodeGen-Mono, and Qwen2.5-Coder,
validate the effectiveness and efficiency of CodeEraser in erasing targeted
sensitive memorization while maintaining model utility.

*Kevin Halim,Sin G. Teo,Ruitao Feng,Zhenpeng Chen,Yang Gu,Chong Wang,Yang Liu*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper investigates reasoning behaviors in large reasoning models (LRMs) during code generation, presenting a taxonomy and analyzing their patterns, model differences, and relationships with code correctness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore and systematically analyze the reasoning patterns exhibited by LRMs in code generation and their impact on generated code.

Method: The authors use state-of-the-art LRMs, prompt them with code tasks, apply open coding for manual reasoning trace annotation, and derive a taxonomy encompassing 15 actions across four reasoning phases.

Result: The study identifies reasoning patterns like scaffolding and flaw detection, compares reasoning styles among models, links certain reasoning actions to code correctness, and tests prompting strategies informed by their findings.

Conclusion: Insights from the taxonomy and annotations offer practical implications for improving LRM-focused code generation through tailored prompts and understanding reasoning behaviors.

Abstract: Currently, many large language models (LLMs) are utilized for software
engineering tasks such as code generation. The emergence of more advanced
models known as large reasoning models (LRMs), such as OpenAI's o3, DeepSeek
R1, and Qwen3. They have demonstrated the capability of performing multi-step
reasoning. Despite the advancement in LRMs, little attention has been paid to
systematically analyzing the reasoning patterns these models exhibit and how
such patterns influence the generated code. This paper presents a comprehensive
study aimed at investigating and uncovering the reasoning behavior of LRMs
during code generation. We prompted several state-of-the-art LRMs of varying
sizes with code generation tasks and applied open coding to manually annotate
the reasoning traces. From this analysis, we derive a taxonomy of LRM reasoning
behaviors, encompassing 15 reasoning actions across four phases.
  Our empirical study based on the taxonomy reveals a series of findings.
First, we identify common reasoning patterns, showing that LRMs generally
follow a human-like coding workflow, with more complex tasks eliciting
additional actions such as scaffolding, flaw detection, and style checks.
Second, we compare reasoning across models, finding that Qwen3 exhibits
iterative reasoning while DeepSeek-R1-7B follows a more linear, waterfall-like
approach. Third, we analyze the relationship between reasoning and code
correctness, showing that actions such as unit test creation and scaffold
generation strongly support functional outcomes, with LRMs adapting strategies
based on task context. Finally, we evaluate lightweight prompting strategies
informed by these findings, demonstrating the potential of context- and
reasoning-oriented prompts to improve LRM-generated code. Our results offer
insights and practical implications for advancing automatic code generation.

*Yu Ge,Linna Xie,Zhong Li,Yu Pei,Tian Zhang*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces FAMAS, the first spectrum-based failure attribution method for Multi-Agent Systems (MASs), significantly improving debugging by systematically identifying responsible agent actions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of failure attribution in Multi-Agent Systems (MASs), which makes debugging labor-intensive and hampers system improvement.

Method: FAMAS uses systematic trajectory replay and abstraction combined with spectrum analysis. A novel suspiciousness formula based on agent and action activation patterns assesses likely failure causes.

Result: FAMAS outperforms 12 benchmark methods in failure attribution accuracy, showing superior reliability and effectiveness.

Conclusion: FAMAS provides a systematic and efficient way to debug MASs, enabling improvements by reliably identifying failure-causing agent actions.

Abstract: Large Language Model Powered Multi-Agent Systems (MASs) are increasingly
employed to automate complex real-world problems, such as programming and
scientific discovery. Despite their promising, MASs are not without their
flaws. However, failure attribution in MASs - pinpointing the specific agent
actions responsible for failures - remains underexplored and labor-intensive,
posing significant challenges for debugging and system improvement. To bridge
this gap, we propose FAMAS, the first spectrum-based failure attribution
approach for MASs, which operates through systematic trajectory replay and
abstraction, followed by spectrum analysis.The core idea of FAMAS is to
estimate, from variations across repeated MAS executions, the likelihood that
each agent action is responsible for the failure. In particular, we propose a
novel suspiciousness formula tailored to MASs, which integrates two key factor
groups, namely the agent behavior group and the action behavior group, to
account for the agent activation patterns and the action activation patterns
within the execution trajectories of MASs. Through expensive evaluations
against 12 baselines on the Who and When benchmark, FAMAS demonstrates superior
performance by outperforming all the methods in comparison.

### [295] [Trace Sampling 2.0: Code Knowledge Enhanced Span-level Sampling for Distributed Tracing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13852)
*Yulun Wu,Guangba Yu,Zhihan Jiang,Yichen Li,Michael R. Lyu*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Distributed tracing in microservices generates extensive data, and traditional sampling methods discard valuable information. Trace Sampling 2.0, through the Autoscope framework, reduces storage needs while preserving critical diagnostic data effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Distributed tracing in microservices leads to an overwhelming volume of data, making storage and analysis inefficient. Current sampling methods often discard useful information such as normal traces necessary for comparison.

Method: The paper introduces Autoscope, a span-level trace sampling mechanism based on static analysis. Autoscope extracts execution logic and ensures critical spans are preserved while reducing storage overhead and retaining trace structure.

Result: Autoscope reduces trace size by 81.2% while maintaining 98.1% coverage of faulty spans. It outperforms traditional trace-level sampling methods and improves root cause analysis accuracy by an average of 8.3%.

Conclusion: Autoscope significantly improves observability and storage efficiency in microservice systems while maintaining diagnostic integrity, offering a better framework for performance monitoring.

Abstract: Distributed tracing is an essential diagnostic tool in microservice systems,
but the sheer volume of traces places a significant burden on backend storage.
A common approach to mitigating this issue is trace sampling, which selectively
retains traces based on specific criteria, often preserving only anomalous
ones. However, this method frequently discards valuable information, including
normal traces that are essential for comparative analysis. To address this
limitation, we introduce Trace Sampling 2.0, which operates at the span level
while maintaining trace structure consistency. This approach allows for the
retention of all traces while significantly reducing storage overhead. Based on
this concept, we design and implement Autoscope, a span-level sampling method
that leverages static analysis to extract execution logic, ensuring that
critical spans are preserved without compromising structural integrity. We
evaluated Autoscope on two open-source microservices. Our results show that it
reduces trace size by 81.2% while maintaining 98.1% faulty span coverage,
outperforming existing trace-level sampling methods. Furthermore, we
demonstrate its effectiveness in root cause analysis, achieving an average
improvement of 8.3%. These findings indicate that Autoscope can significantly
enhance observability and storage efficiency in microservices, offering a
robust solution for performance monitoring.

### [296] [Are Prompts All You Need? Evaluating Prompt-Based Large Language Models (LLM)s for Software Requirements Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13868)
*Manal Binkhonain,Reem Alfayaz*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper explores the use of prompt-based large language models (LLMs) for classifying natural language software requirements and compares them to supervised learning models. The study shows that LLMs, especially with few-shot prompting, can achieve performance comparable to fine-tuned transformers while requiring fewer annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current supervised learning models for requirements classification rely on extensive labeled data, which is expensive, time-consuming to create, and lacks generalizability across tasks.

Method: The study benchmarks several prompt-based LLMs and styles (zero-shot, few-shot, persona, chain-of-thought) on classification tasks using the PROMISE and SecReq datasets. Results are compared with fine-tuned transformer baselines.

Result: Prompt-based LLMs, especially those using few-shot prompts, match or exceed fine-tuned transformer baselines. Incorporating personas or combining with chain-of-thought further boosts performance.

Conclusion: Prompt-based LLMs present a scalable and effective alternative to traditional supervised methods, reducing the need for extensive labeled data and improving generalizability across tasks.

Abstract: Requirements classification assigns natural language requirements to
predefined classes, such as functional and non functional. Accurate
classification reduces risk and improves software quality. Most existing models
rely on supervised learning, which needs large labeled data that are costly,
slow to create, and domain dependent; they also generalize poorly and often
require retraining for each task. This study tests whether prompt based large
language models can reduce data needs. We benchmark several models and
prompting styles (zero shot, few shot, persona, and chain of thought) across
multiple tasks on two English datasets, PROMISE and SecReq. For each task we
compare model prompt configurations and then compare the best LLM setups with a
strong fine tuned transformer baseline. Results show that prompt based LLMs,
especially with few shot prompts, can match or exceed the baseline. Adding a
persona, or persona plus chain of thought, can yield further gains. We conclude
that prompt based LLMs are a practical and scalable option that reduces
dependence on large annotations and can improve generalizability across tasks.

*Shalini Chakraborty,Lola Burgueño,Nathalie Moreno,Javier Troya,Paula Muñoz*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper highlights the lack of research on ethical considerations of Generative AI in software modeling education and analyzes three relevant studies from a systematic review.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the growing use of Generative AI in software modeling education and the notable absence of ethical oversight or structured guidelines.

Method: The researchers conducted a systematic literature review across six major computer science digital libraries, focusing on ethical aspects like fairness and transparency.

Result: Out of 1,386 papers reviewed, only three explicitly discussed ethical considerations related to GenAI in software modeling education, indicating a critical gap.

Conclusion: There is an urgent need for structured ethical frameworks to ensure responsible integration of Generative AI into educational curricula and address ethical challenges.

Abstract: Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) is rapidly gaining momentum in
software modeling education, embraced by both students and educators. As GenAI
assists with interpreting requirements, formalizing models, and translating
students' mental models into structured notations, it increasingly shapes core
learning outcomes such as domain comprehension, diagrammatic thinking, and
modeling fluency without clear ethical oversight or pedagogical guidelines.
Yet, the ethical implications of this integration remain underexplored.
  In this paper, we conduct a systematic literature review across six major
digital libraries in computer science (ACM Digital Library, IEEE Xplore,
Scopus, ScienceDirect, SpringerLink, and Web of Science). Our aim is to
identify studies discussing the ethical aspects of GenAI in software modeling
education, including responsibility, fairness, transparency, diversity, and
inclusion among others.
  Out of 1,386 unique papers initially retrieved, only three explicitly
addressed ethical considerations. This scarcity highlights the critical absence
of ethical discourse surrounding GenAI in modeling education and raises urgent
questions about the responsible integration of AI in modeling curricula, as
well as it evinces the pressing need for structured ethical frameworks in this
emerging educational landscape. We examine these three studies and explore the
emerging research opportunities as well as the challenges that have arisen in
this field.

### [298] [An Empirical Study on Failures in Automated Issue Solving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13941)
*Simiao Liu,Fang Liu,Liehao Li,Xin Tan,Yinghao Zhu,Xiaoli Lian,Li Zhang*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper identifies key failure modes in automated issue solving using state-of-the-art tools on the SWE-Bench benchmark and proposes a new collaborative Expert-Executor framework to improve task success rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automated issue solving faces significant challenges including high failure rates and limited diagnostic understanding of issues. Current evaluations are insufficient to pinpoint model weaknesses or guide improvements.

Method: The study analyzed task performance characteristics, manually categorized 150 failure instances into a taxonomy, and proposed a collaborative Expert-Executor framework to address model setbacks.

Result: The taxonomy revealed distinct failure patterns depending on architectural paradigms, and the Expert-Executor framework showed a 22.2% improvement on previously unsolvable tasks.

Conclusion: Diagnostic evaluations combined with collaborative frameworks can significantly enhance the robustness and success rates of automated issue-solving tools.

Abstract: Automated issue solving seeks to autonomously identify and repair defective
code snippets across an entire codebase. SWE-Bench has emerged as the most
widely adopted benchmark for evaluating progress in this area. While LLM-based
agentic tools show great promise, they still fail on a substantial portion of
tasks. Moreover, current evaluations primarily report aggregate issue-solving
rates, which obscure the underlying causes of success and failure, making it
challenging to diagnose model weaknesses or guide targeted improvements. To
bridge this gap, we first analyze the performance and efficiency of three SOTA
tools, spanning both pipeline-based and agentic architectures, in automated
issue solving tasks of SWE-Bench-Verified under varying task characteristics.
Furthermore, to move from high-level performance metrics to underlying cause
analysis, we conducted a systematic manual analysis of 150 failed instances.
From this analysis, we developed a comprehensive taxonomy of failure modes
comprising 3 primary phases, 9 main categories, and 25 fine-grained
subcategories. Then we systematically analyze the distribution of the
identified failure modes, the results reveal distinct failure fingerprints
between the two architectural paradigms, with the majority of agentic failures
stemming from flawed reasoning and cognitive deadlocks. Motivated by these
insights, we propose a collaborative Expert-Executor framework. It introduces a
supervisory Expert agent tasked with providing strategic oversight and
course-correction for a primary Executor agent. This architecture is designed
to correct flawed reasoning and break the cognitive deadlocks that frequently
lead to failure. Experiments show that our framework solves 22.2% of previously
intractable issues for a leading single agent. These findings pave the way for
building more robust agents through diagnostic evaluation and collaborative
design.

*Duc Minh Ha,Phu Trac Kien,Tho Quan,Anh Nguyen-Duc*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper explores adapting traditional software processes (Waterfall, V-Model, Agile) for coordinating Large Language Model (LLM)-based multi-agent systems, studying their impact on code quality, cost, and productivity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study is motivated by the innovative use of LLM-based multi-agent systems in software development, seeking to adapt classical coordination models for these agents to optimize outcomes.

Method: 11 software projects were executed via 3 process models and 4 GPT variants, totaling 132 runs, with standardized measurements for file size, cost, and code quality.

Result: Results showed Waterfall was most efficient, V-Model generated verbose code, and Agile produced the highest quality but at a higher computational cost.

Conclusion: Classical software processes are adaptable for LLM-based MAS with trade-offs in efficiency, quality, and cost; process choice should align with project objectives.

Abstract: [Background] Large Language Model (LLM)-based multi-agent systems (MAS) are
transforming software development by enabling autonomous collaboration.
Classical software processes such asWaterfall, V-Model, and Agile offer
structured coordination patterns that can be repurposed to guide these agent
interactions. [Aims] This study explores how traditional software development
processes can be adapted as coordination scaffolds for LLM based MAS and
examines their impact on code quality, cost, and productivity. [Method] We
executed 11 diverse software projects under three process models and four GPT
variants, totaling 132 runs. Each output was evaluated using standardized
metrics for size (files, LOC), cost (execution time, token usage), and quality
(code smells, AI- and human detected bugs). [Results] Both process model and
LLM choice significantly affected system performance. Waterfall was most
efficient, V-Model produced the most verbose code, and Agile achieved the
highest code quality, albeit at higher computational cost. [Conclusions]
Classical software processes can be effectively instantiated in LLM-based MAS,
but each entails trade-offs across quality, cost, and adaptability. Process
selection should reflect project goals, whether prioritizing efficiency,
robustness, or structured validation.

*Kerui Huang,Shuhan Liu,Xing Hu,Tongtong Xu,Lingfeng Bao,Xin Xia*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Chain-of-Thought reasoning improves LLM performance but leads to computational inefficiencies. SEER framework addresses these challenges by shortening reasoning while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the computational inefficiencies of Chain-of-Thought reasoning, particularly in scenarios requiring concise and deterministic outputs like software engineering.

Method: SEER framework is proposed featuring Best-of-N sampling and adaptive filtering, dynamically adjusting thresholds to reduce verbosity while preserving accuracy.

Result: Empirical evaluations show SEER reduces reasoning length by 42.1%, mitigates truncation issues, eliminates infinite loops, and improves task accuracy across various benchmarks.

Conclusion: SEER enhances efficiency and reliability of CoT-enhanced LLMs, making them more practical for resource-constrained tasks.

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning enhances Large Language Models (LLMs) by
prompting intermediate steps, improving accuracy and robustness in arithmetic,
logic, and commonsense tasks. However, this benefit comes with high
computational costs: longer outputs increase latency, memory usage, and
KV-cache demands. These issues are especially critical in software engineering
tasks where concise and deterministic outputs are required. To investigate
these trade-offs, we conduct an empirical study based on code generation
benchmarks. The results reveal that longer CoT does not always help. Excessive
reasoning often causes truncation, accuracy drops, and latency up to five times
higher, with failed outputs consistently longer than successful ones. These
findings challenge the assumption that longer reasoning is inherently better
and highlight the need for adaptive CoT control. Motivated by this, we propose
SEER (Self-Enhancing Efficient Reasoning), an adaptive framework that
compresses CoT while preserving accuracy. SEER combines Best-of-N sampling with
task-aware adaptive filtering, dynamically adjusting thresholds based on
pre-inference outputs to reduce verbosity and computational overhead. We then
evaluate SEER on three software engineering tasks and one math task. On
average, SEER shortens CoT by 42.1%, improves accuracy by reducing truncation,
and eliminates most infinite loops. These results demonstrate SEER as a
practical method to make CoT-enhanced LLMs more efficient and robust, even
under resource constraints.

*Arna Ghosh,Zahraa Chorghay,Shahab Bakhtiari,Blake A. Richards*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: The paper analyzes how biological and artificial systems balance efficiency and robustness via representation geometry using insights from human visual cortex and artificial neural networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how systems handle the efficiency-robustness tradeoff in signal encoding, focusing on hierarchical systems like the brain and ANNs.

Method: Population geometry framework applied to human visual cortex data and self-supervised learning ANNs.

Result: Human visual areas mostly exhibited power-law eigenspectrums, but this was not universal; similarly, ANNs showed scale-free geometry only before task fine-tuning.

Conclusion: Representation geometry is task-dependent, not universally uniform across systems.

Abstract: Biological and artificial intelligence systems navigate the fundamental
efficiency-robustness tradeoff for optimal encoding, i.e., they must
efficiently encode numerous attributes of the input space while also being
robust to noise. This challenge is particularly evident in hierarchical
processing systems like the human brain. With a view towards understanding how
systems navigate the efficiency-robustness tradeoff, we turned to a population
geometry framework for analyzing representations in the human visual cortex
alongside artificial neural networks (ANNs). In the ventral visual stream, we
found general-purpose, scale-free representations characterized by a power
law-decaying eigenspectrum in most areas. However, in certain higher-order
visual areas did not have scale-free representations, indicating that
scale-free geometry is not a universal property of the brain. In parallel, ANNs
trained with a self-supervised learning objective also exhibited free-free
geometry, but not after fine-tune on a specific task. Based on these empirical
results and our analytical insights, we posit that a system's representation
geometry is not a universal property and instead depends upon the computational
objective.

*Sir-Lord Wiafe,Najme Soleimani,Masoud Seraji,Bradley Baker,Robyn Miller,Ashkan Faghiri,Vince D. Calhoun*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel framework, Complex-Valued Phase Synchrony (CVPS), to accurately measure directionality and timing in phase synchronization, overcoming limitations of existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to better capture directionality and timing in phase synchronization, particularly in analyzing complex systems like the brain, which current methods fail to adequately address.

Method: The proposed CVPS uses an adaptive Gabor wavelet to estimate phase while preserving cosine and sine components, offering improvements over Hilbert-based methods. Simulations and pharmacological tests were conducted to validate its accuracy.

Result: CVPS successfully recovered true phase offsets and tracked non-stationary dynamics, outperforming traditional methods. It also demonstrated neuro-hemodynamic effects consistent with known pharmacological receptor actions.

Conclusion: CVPS provides a reliable and effective framework to detect directional coupling and timing intricacies in complex systems, with applications in neuroscience and beyond.

Abstract: Understanding interactions in complex systems requires capturing the
directionality of coupling, not only its strength. Phase synchronization
captures this timing, yet most methods either reduce phase to its cosine or
collapse it into scaler indices such as phase-locking value, discarding
directionality. We propose a complex-valued phase synchrony (CVPS) framework
that estimates phase with an adaptive Gabor wavelet and preserves both cosine
and sine components. Simulations confirm that CVPS recovers true phase offsets
and tracks non-stationary dynamics more faithfully than Hilbert-based methods.
Because antipsychotics are known to modulate the timing of cortical
interactions, they provide a rigorous context to evaluate whether CVPS can
capture such pharmacological effects. CVPS further reveals cortical
neuro-hemodynamic drivers, with occipital-to-parietal and
prefrontal-to-striatal lead-lag flows consistent with known receptor targets,
confirming its ability to capture pharmacological timing. CVPS, therefore,
offers a robust and generalizable framework for detecting directional coupling
in complex systems such as the brain.

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: This study introduces Rest2Visual, a model that uses resting-state fMRI and visual stimuli to predict visually evoked brain activation, addressing the gap between task-free and task-based fMRI.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to overcome limitations in functional brain imaging by leveraging abundant resting-state fMRI data to infer stimulus-driven neural activations, which traditionally require costly and time-intensive methods.

Method: The researchers created a conditional generative model with a volumetric encoder-decoder design, leveraging multiscale 3D rs-fMRI features and stimulus embeddings for activation synthesis. They also developed a triplet dataset aligning rs-fMRI data with visual stimuli and activation maps from the Natural Scenes Dataset (NSD).

Result: The generated activation maps were closely matched with ground truth, supported downstream decoding tasks, and preserved individualized subject-specific features, showcasing the model's accuracy and functional utility.

Conclusion: Rest2Visual demonstrates that resting-state neural activity can be transformed into individualized, visually evoked activation maps, offering a scalable, task-free approach to brain modeling.

Abstract: Understanding how spontaneous brain activity relates to stimulus-driven
neural responses is a fundamental challenge in cognitive neuroscience. While
task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) captures localized
stimulus-evoked brain activation, its acquisition is costly, time-consuming,
and difficult to scale across populations. In contrast, resting-state fMRI
(rs-fMRI) is task-free and abundant, but lacks direct interpretability. We
introduce Rest2Visual, a conditional generative model that predicts visually
evoked fMRI (ve-fMRI) from resting-state input and 2D visual stimuli. It
follows a volumetric encoder--decoder design, where multiscale 3D features from
rs-fMRI are modulated by image embeddings via adaptive normalization, enabling
spatially accurate, stimulus-specific activation synthesis. To enable model
training, we construct a large-scale triplet dataset from the Natural Scenes
Dataset (NSD), aligning each rs-fMRI volume with stimulus images and their
corresponding ve-fMRI activation maps. Quantitative evaluation shows that the
predicted activations closely match ground truth across standard similarity and
representational metrics, and support successful image reconstruction in
downstream decoding. Notably, the predicted maps preserve subject-specific
structure, demonstrating the model's capacity to generate individualized
functional surrogates. Our results provide compelling evidence that
individualized spontaneous neural activity can be transformed into
stimulus-aligned representations, opening new avenues for scalable, task-free
functional brain modeling.

*N. B. Maimon,Ganit Baruchin,Itamar Grotto,Nathan Intrator,Talya Zeimer,Ofir Chibotero,Efrat Danino*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: The paper identifies two single-channel hdrEEG biomarkers, ST4 and T2, as indicators of stress regulation and explores their correlation with physiological and subjective stress measures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Stress is a critical factor in cognitive decline and other health issues. Existing biomarkers like cortisol and HRV offer limited understanding of neural mechanisms behind stress, necessitating more accurate and personalized tools.

Method: The study uses hdrEEG and physiological/subjective measurements across two groups (N=101 and N=82) in various cognitive, emotional, and stress-inducing tasks to examine the validity of ST4 and T2 as biomarkers.

Result: ST4 correlates with physiological arousal indicators like cortisol and subjective stress, while T2 connects with emotional-regulatory processes and resilience. Both biomarkers collectively provide insights into different dimensions of stress responses.

Conclusion: ST4 and T2 biomarkers could serve as effective tools for individualized stress monitoring, offering a novel way to integrate neural, physiological, and psychological insights into stress assessment.

Abstract: Chronic stress is a major risk factor for cognitive decline,
neurodegenerative disease, and systemic health burden, underscoring the need
for reliable individual-level biomarkers of stress reactivity. While cortisol,
heart rate variability (HRV), and self-report measures are widely used, they
provide limited insight into neural mechanisms. Here, we tested whether two
single-channel hdrEEG biomarkers, ST4 and T2, serve as personalized indices of
stress regulation by linking neural activity to validated physiological and
subjective measures. We conducted two studies. Study 1 included 101 healthy
adults (22-82 years) who completed questionnaires on resilience, burnout, and
perceived stress, provided salivary cortisol, and underwent hdrEEG during
resting, detection, n-back, lexical, emotional music, and startle tasks. Study
2 included 82 adults (19-42 years) who completed the State-Trait Anxiety
Inventory, were monitored for HRV, and performed auditory, stress-inducing (job
interview, arithmetic), and emotional tasks during hdrEEG recording. Across
studies, ST4 reflected physiological arousal and cognitive strain, correlating
positively with cortisol, subjective stress, and pulse pressure, and negatively
with resilience and HRV indices. T2 showed a complementary profile, linking
emotional and autonomic processes. T2 activity correlated with cortisol, heart
rate, HRV measures, resilience, and trait anxiety, especially during lexical
and emotional tasks. Together, ST4 and T2 capture distinct facets of the stress
response: physiological arousal versus emotional-regulatory sensitivity. These
findings highlight portable hdrEEG as a promising tool for personalized stress
assessment, bridging neural, physiological, and subjective domains with
implications for clinical and occupational monitoring.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to understand the Gaussian approximation rate for online linear regression and its dependency on problem dimensions and design matrix properties.

Method: The authors derive convergence rates under a constant learning rate and analyze the impact of dimensions and design matrix on the results.

Result: The study finds normal approximation rates of \(\sqrt{\log{n}/n}\), conditioned on a sufficiently large sample size.

Abstract: In this paper, we consider the problem of Gaussian approximation for the
online linear regression task. We derive the corresponding rates for the
setting of a constant learning rate and study the explicit dependence of the
convergence rate upon the problem dimension $d$ and quantities related to the
design matrix. When the number of iterations $n$ is known in advance, our
results yield the rate of normal approximation of order $\sqrt{\log{n}/n}$,
provided that the sample size $n$ is large enough.

TL;DR: This study introduces DeepGGL, an AI model using geometric graph learning for improved binding affinity prediction in drug design tasks, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of accurately predicting binding affinity in structure-based drug design, leveraging advancements in deep learning.

Method: DeepGGL uses a deep convolutional neural network with residual connections and attention, structured within a geometric graph learning framework, to model protein-ligand interactions across multiple scales.

Result: DeepGGL achieved state-of-the-art performance on benchmarking datasets like CASF-2013, CASF-2016, CSAR-NRC-HiQ, and PDBbind v2019, showing significant accuracy improvements.

Conclusion: DeepGGL demonstrates robust performance and generalization capabilities, making it a reliable tool for binding affinity prediction in drug discovery applications.

Abstract: In structure-based drug design, accurately estimating the binding affinity
between a candidate ligand and its protein receptor is a central challenge.
Recent advances in artificial intelligence, particularly deep learning, have
demonstrated superior performance over traditional empirical and physics-based
methods for this task, enabled by the growing availability of structural and
experimental affinity data. In this work, we introduce DeepGGL, a deep
convolutional neural network that integrates residual connections and an
attention mechanism within a geometric graph learning framework. By leveraging
multiscale weighted colored bipartite subgraphs, DeepGGL effectively captures
fine-grained atom-level interactions in protein-ligand complexes across
multiple scales. We benchmarked DeepGGL against established models on CASF-2013
and CASF-2016, where it achieved state-of-the-art performance with significant
improvements across diverse evaluation metrics. To further assess robustness
and generalization, we tested the model on the CSAR-NRC-HiQ dataset and the
PDBbind v2019 holdout set. DeepGGL consistently maintained high predictive
accuracy, highlighting its adaptability and reliability for binding affinity
prediction in structure-based drug discovery.

TL;DR: The paper explores the feasibility, challenges, and implications of using AI to autonomously report normal chest X-rays (CXRs) to reduce radiology workloads.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the issue of delays in CXR reporting caused by radiologist shortages, and the potential of AI to identify normal CXRs autonomously as a solution.

Method: The article examines considerations such as defining what qualifies as a normal CXR, ensuring AI's generalizability, legal/regulatory challenges, and impacts on radiologists and patient perspectives.

Result: Key challenges and benefits are identified, emphasizing the potential to reduce workloads while highlighting legal, ethical, and operational concerns.

Conclusion: Although promising, the adoption of AI in CXR reporting must proceed with caution due to regulatory, safety, and professional implications.

Abstract: Chest X-rays (CXRs) are the most commonly performed imaging investigation. In
the UK, many centres experience reporting delays due to radiologist workforce
shortages. Artificial intelligence (AI) tools capable of distinguishing normal
from abnormal CXRs have emerged as a potential solution. If normal CXRs could
be safely identified and reported without human input, a substantial portion of
radiology workload could be reduced.
  This article examines the feasibility and implications of autonomous AI
reporting of normal CXRs. Key issues include defining normal, ensuring
generalisability across populations, and managing the sensitivity-specificity
trade-off. It also addresses legal and regulatory challenges, such as
compliance with IR(ME)R and GDPR, and the lack accountability frameworks for
errors. Further considerations include the impact on radiologists practice, the
need for robust post-market surveillance, and incorporation of patient
perspectives. While the benefits are clear, adoption must be cautious.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel framework for adaptive spatial audio enhancement using a mixture of experts technique in binaural signal processing to focus on sound sources dynamically.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations of traditional methods in spatial audio enhancement that struggle with real-time tracking and emphasize dynamic and personalized playback.

Method: It employs implicit localization and a mixture of binaural filters in an online manner for real-time adaptive spatial audio rendering.

Result: Dynamic spatial audio rendering enhances user experience by focusing or suppressing sounds while maintaining natural binaural cues in applications like AR/VR.

Conclusion: The proposed method is a flexible, geometry-agnostic solution for improving spatial audio in consumer devices, enabling dynamic, personalized audio playback.

Abstract: We propose a novel mixture of experts framework for field-of-view enhancement
in binaural signal matching. Our approach enables dynamic spatial audio
rendering that adapts to continuous talker motion, allowing users to emphasize
or suppress sounds from selected directions while preserving natural binaural
cues. Unlike traditional methods that rely on explicit direction-of-arrival
estimation or operate in the Ambisonics domain, our signal-dependent framework
combines multiple binaural filters in an online manner using implicit
localization. This allows for real-time tracking and enhancement of moving
sound sources, supporting applications such as speech focus, noise reduction,
and world-locked audio in augmented and virtual reality. The method is agnostic
to array geometry offering a flexible solution for spatial audio capture and
personalized playback in next-generation consumer audio devices.

*Deepti Kunte,Bram Cornelis,Claudio Colangeli,Karl Janssens,Brecht Van Baelen,Konstantinos Gryllias*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper focuses on detecting anomalies in automotive cabin sounds using an unsupervised approach, proposing a novel model selection method based on domain knowledge and proxy-anomalies for validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve vehicle quality and passenger comfort by detecting sound anomalies in automotive cabins, especially in scenarios where labeled faulty data is scarce or unavailable.

Method: Proposes using structured perturbations of healthy spectrograms (proxy-anomalies) to guide model selection in an unsupervised learning framework, replacing unreliable metrics like validation reconstruction error.

Result: The methodology was tested on an electric vehicle dataset with five fault types, achieving superior performance in model selection compared to traditional approaches.

Conclusion: The domain-knowledge-informed model selection approach reliably selects optimal models for anomaly detection, even in the absence of labeled faulty data, and advances the understanding of anomaly detection in automotive acoustics.

Abstract: The detection of anomalies in automotive cabin sounds is critical for
ensuring vehicle quality and maintaining passenger comfort. In many real-world
settings, this task is more appropriately framed as an unsupervised learning
problem rather than the supervised case due to the scarcity or complete absence
of labeled faulty data. In such an unsupervised setting, the model is trained
exclusively on healthy samples and detects anomalies as deviations from normal
behavior. However, in the absence of labeled faulty samples for validation and
the limited reliability of commonly used metrics, such as validation
reconstruction error, effective model selection remains a significant
challenge. To overcome these limitations, a domain-knowledge-informed approach
for model selection is proposed, in which proxy-anomalies engineered through
structured perturbations of healthy spectrograms are used in the validation set
to support model selection. The proposed methodology is evaluated on a
high-fidelity electric vehicle dataset comprising healthy and faulty cabin
sounds across five representative fault types viz., Imbalance, Modulation,
Whine, Wind, and Pulse Width Modulation. This dataset, generated using advanced
sound synthesis techniques, and validated via expert jury assessments, has been
made publicly available to facilitate further research. Experimental
evaluations on the five fault cases demonstrate the selection of optimal models
using proxy-anomalies, significantly outperform conventional model selection
strategies.

TL;DR: This paper improves unsupervised anomalous sound detection by introducing a novel training technique called one-stage supervised contrastive learning (OS-SCL) and a new feature representation, achieving significant performance improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issue of frequent false alarms in anomalous sound detection, particularly for samples of the same type from different machines.

Method: The authors propose a training method called OS-SCL, which perturbs features in the embedding space and applies noisy supervised contrastive learning. Additionally, a new time-frequency feature, TFgram, is introduced to enhance data representation.

Result: The OS-SCL method showed notable performance on the DCASE 2020 Challenge Task 2, with AUC scores of 94.64% (Log-Mel features) and 95.71% (TFgram), as well as improvements in pAUC and mAUC metrics.

Conclusion: The OS-SCL method and TFgram feature representation significantly enhance the detection of anomalous sounds, providing a robust solution to the false alarm issue in unsupervised settings.

Abstract: Unsupervised anomalous sound detection aims to detect unknown anomalous
sounds by training a model using only normal audio data. Despite advancements
in self-supervised methods, the issue of frequent false alarms when handling
samples of the same type from different machines remains unresolved. This paper
introduces a novel training technique called one-stage supervised contrastive
learning (OS-SCL), which significantly addresses this problem by perturbing
features in the embedding space and employing a one-stage noisy supervised
contrastive learning approach. On the DCASE 2020 Challenge Task 2, it achieved
94.64\% AUC, 88.42\% pAUC, and 89.24\% mAUC using only Log-Mel features.
Additionally, a time-frequency feature named TFgram is proposed, which is
extracted from raw audio. This feature effectively captures critical
information for anomalous sound detection, ultimately achieving 95.71\% AUC,
90.23\% pAUC, and 91.23\% mAUC. The source code is available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance text-guided audio editing by resolving the limitations of existing methods that struggle with complex modifications or lack practicality.

Method: The paper introduces an end-to-end efficient rectified flow matching-based diffusion framework and a new dataset tailored for training and benchmarking in multi-event audio scenarios.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that the proposed model achieves accurate semantic alignment as per text prompts and delivers high-quality audio editing competitively across multiple metrics.

Conclusion: The approach presents effective advancements in audio editing, eliminating the need for auxiliary captions or masks while ensuring faithful and localized editing.

Abstract: Diffusion models have shown remarkable progress in text-to-audio generation.
However, text-guided audio editing remains in its early stages. This task
focuses on modifying the target content within an audio signal while preserving
the rest, thus demanding precise localization and faithful editing according to
the text prompt. Existing training-based and zero-shot methods that rely on
full-caption or costly optimization often struggle with complex editing or lack
practicality. In this work, we propose a novel end-to-end efficient rectified
flow matching-based diffusion framework for audio editing, and construct a
dataset featuring overlapping multi-event audio to support training and
benchmarking in complex scenarios. Experiments show that our model achieves
faithful semantic alignment without requiring auxiliary captions or masks,
while maintaining competitive editing quality across metrics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address challenges in deploying high-performing CNN-based audio tagging models on resource-constrained devices like the Raspberry Pi.

Method: Multiple CNN architectures, including PANNs, ConvNeXt, and MobileNetV3, were evaluated in ONNX format during 24-hour continuous inference sessions to analyze performance, efficiency, and thermal behavior.

Result: The research demonstrates that careful model selection and optimization can ensure stable inference performance and effective thermal management during extended operational periods.

Conclusion: The findings highlight the potential for deploying CNN audio tagging models efficiently on edge devices, providing insights for practical real-world applications.

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have demonstrated exceptional
performance in audio tagging tasks. However, deploying these models on
resource-constrained devices like the Raspberry Pi poses challenges related to
computational efficiency and thermal management. In this paper, a comprehensive
evaluation of multiple convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures for
audio tagging on the Raspberry Pi is conducted, encompassing all 1D and 2D
models from the Pretrained Audio Neural Networks (PANNs) framework, a
ConvNeXt-based model adapted for audio classification, as well as MobileNetV3
architectures. In addition, two PANNs-derived networks, CNN9 and CNN13,
recently proposed, are also evaluated. To enhance deployment efficiency and
portability across diverse hardware platforms, all models are converted to the
Open Neural Network Exchange (ONNX) format. Unlike previous works that focus on
a single model, our analysis encompasses a broader range of architectures and
involves continuous 24-hour inference sessions to assess performance stability.
Our experiments reveal that, with appropriate model selection and optimization,
it is possible to maintain consistent inference latency and manage thermal
behavior effectively over extended periods. These findings provide valuable
insights for deploying audio tagging models in real-world edge computing
scenarios.

### [313] [Enhancing Time Awareness in Generative Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13957)
*Sunkyung Lee,Seongmin Park,Jonghyo Kim,Mincheol Yoon,Jongwuk Lee*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: This paper introduces GRUT, a time-aware generative recommender model that incorporates temporal dynamics to improve recommendation quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current generative recommender systems fail to effectively capture temporal dynamics, missing the evolving preferences of users.

Method: The authors propose GRUT, which features Time-aware Prompting (user-level contextual modeling and item-level transition patterns) and Trend-aware Inference (training-free ranking enhancement using item trend information).

Result: GRUT outperforms state-of-the-art models, showing improvements of up to 15.4% in Recall@5 and 14.3% in NDCG@5 across four benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: GRUT effectively captures hidden user preferences through temporal signals and sets a new performance standard in generative recommendation systems.

Abstract: Generative recommendation has emerged as a promising paradigm that formulates
the recommendations into a text-to-text generation task, harnessing the vast
knowledge of large language models. However, existing studies focus on
considering the sequential order of items and neglect to handle the temporal
dynamics across items, which can imply evolving user preferences. To address
this limitation, we propose a novel model, Generative Recommender Using Time
awareness (GRUT), effectively capturing hidden user preferences via various
temporal signals. We first introduce Time-aware Prompting, consisting of two
key contexts. The user-level temporal context models personalized temporal
patterns across timestamps and time intervals, while the item-level transition
context provides transition patterns across users. We also devise Trend-aware
Inference, a training-free method that enhances rankings by incorporating trend
information about items with generation likelihood. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that GRUT outperforms state-of-the-art models, with gains of up to
15.4% and 14.3% in Recall@5 and NDCG@5 across four benchmark datasets. The

TL;DR: The paper presents a modernized Facebook Group Scoped Search incorporating both traditional keyword search and embedding-based retrieval (EBR) to enhance relevance and diversity in search results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve search relevance and diversity in Facebook Groups by integrating traditional keyword-based and advanced embedding-based retrieval methods.

Method: Develop a blended retrieval system combining keyword search with embedding-based retrieval, supported by a novel evaluation framework using LLMs for offline assessments.

Result: The blended system leads to significant user engagement improvement and higher search quality, validated through online metrics and LLM-based evaluation.

Conclusion: Blending keyword and embedding-based retrieval enhances search experiences in large-scale social platforms, offering practical deployment and evaluation insights.

Abstract: Beyond general web-scale search, social network search uniquely enables users
to retrieve information and discover potential connections within their social
context. We introduce a framework of modernized Facebook Group Scoped Search by
blending traditional keyword-based retrieval with embedding-based retrieval
(EBR) to improve the search relevance and diversity of search results. Our
system integrates semantic retrieval into the existing keyword search pipeline,
enabling users to discover more contextually relevant group posts. To
rigorously assess the impact of this blended approach, we introduce a novel
evaluation framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to perform
offline relevance assessments, providing scalable and consistent quality
benchmarks. Our results demonstrate that the blended retrieval system
significantly enhances user engagement and search quality, as validated by both
online metrics and LLM-based evaluation. This work offers practical insights
for deploying and evaluating advanced retrieval systems in large-scale,
real-world social platforms.

*Silan Hu,Shiqi Zhang,Yimin Shi,Xiaokui Xiao*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper introduces GEM-Bench, a benchmark for ad-injected responses in Generative Engine Marketing (GEM).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generative engines struggle to balance user satisfaction and engagement when incorporating advertisements into their responses.

Method: They proposed GEM-Bench, which includes curated datasets, metric ontology for user engagement, and baseline solutions within a multi-agent framework.

Result: Findings suggest that prompt-based methods lower user satisfaction, while pre-generated ad-free responses improve it but add overhead.

Conclusion: The study emphasizes the need for more effective and efficient methods to integrate ads in generative engines without compromising user experience.

Abstract: Generative Engine Marketing (GEM) is an emerging ecosystem for monetizing
generative engines, such as LLM-based chatbots, by seamlessly integrating
relevant advertisements into their responses. At the core of GEM lies the
generation and evaluation of ad-injected responses. However, existing
benchmarks are not specifically designed for this purpose, which limits future
research. To address this gap, we propose GEM-Bench, the first comprehensive
benchmark for ad-injected response generation in GEM. GEM-Bench includes three
curated datasets covering both chatbot and search scenarios, a metric ontology
that captures multiple dimensions of user satisfaction and engagement, and
several baseline solutions implemented within an extensible multi-agent
framework. Our preliminary results indicate that, while simple prompt-based
methods achieve reasonable engagement such as click-through rate, they often
reduce user satisfaction. In contrast, approaches that insert ads based on
pre-generated ad-free responses help mitigate this issue but introduce
additional overhead. These findings highlight the need for future research on
designing more effective and efficient solutions for generating ad-injected
responses in GEM.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper introduces an AI-based method for enhancing mental health information corpora by targeting underrepresented topics, significantly optimizing retrieval performance with reduced resource demands compared to random expansions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the mismatch between expanding mental health knowledge bases and user needs, especially for informal or contextualized language queries, to improve retrieval systems.

Method: The paper presents a gap-informed corpus augmentation framework that uses naturalistic user data to identify underrepresented topics and prioritizes expansions based on their relevance and usefulness.

Result: Directed (gap-informed) augmentation required significantly smaller expansions to achieve near-optimal performance (~95%) compared to Non-Directed augmentation, which needed substantially larger and impractical expansions.

Conclusion: Strategic and targeted corpus augmentation enhances retrieval system performance while minimizing effort, providing a scalable solution for trusted information repositories and AI applications in critical areas like mental health.

Abstract: Access to reliable mental health information is vital for early help-seeking,
yet expanding knowledge bases is resource-intensive and often misaligned with
user needs. This results in poor performance of retrieval systems when
presented concerns are not covered or expressed in informal or contextualized
language. We present an AI-based gap-informed framework for corpus augmentation
that authentically identifies underrepresented topics (gaps) by overlaying
naturalistic user data such as forum posts in order to prioritize expansions
based on coverage and usefulness. In a case study, we compare Directed
(gap-informed augmentations) with Non-Directed augmentation (random additions),
evaluating the relevance and usefulness of retrieved information across four
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines. Directed augmentation achieved
near-optimal performance with modest expansions--requiring only a 42% increase
for Query Transformation, 74% for Reranking and Hierarchical, and 318% for
Baseline--to reach ~95% of the performance of an exhaustive reference corpus.
In contrast, Non-Directed augmentation required substantially larger and thus
practically infeasible expansions to achieve comparable performance (232%,
318%, 403%, and 763%, respectively). These results show that strategically
targeted corpus growth can reduce content creation demands while sustaining
high retrieval and provision quality, offering a scalable approach for building
trusted health information repositories and supporting generative AI
applications in high-stakes domains.

Main category: cs.MS

TL;DR: The paper investigates implementing nonblocking execution in GraphBLAS using Julia for PageRank operations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GraphBLAS methods provide opportunities for optimized execution via nonblocking mechanisms, but existing implementations use these techniques in a restricted way, urging the need for broader support.

Method: Utilized features of the Julia programming language to implement and demonstrate nonblocking execution for GraphBLAS methods, focusing on PageRank cases.

Result: Implemented a prototype supporting nonblocking execution for GraphBLAS in Julia, showing potential for DAG-preserving optimizations.

Conclusion: The proposed approach simplifies implementing aggressive nonblocking execution for GraphBLAS and demonstrates potential for optimization, despite the implementation being a work-in-progress targeted at specific methods.

Abstract: From the beginning, the GraphBLAS were designed for ``nonblocking
execution''; i.e., calls to GraphBLAS methods return as soon as the arguments
to the methods are validated and define a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of
GraphBLAS operations. This lets GraphBLAS implementations fuse functions, elide
unneeded objects, exploit parallelism, plus any additional DAG-preserving
transformations. GraphBLAS implementations exist that utilize nonblocking
execution but with limited scope. In this paper, we describe our work to
implement GraphBLAS with support for aggressive nonblocking execution. We show
how features of the Julia programming language greatly simplify implementation
of nonblocking execution. This is \emph{work-in-progress} sufficient to show
the potential for nonblocking execution and is limited to GraphBLAS methods
required to support PageRank.

*Lamia Lamrani,Benoît Collins,Jean-Philippe Bouchaud*

Main category: q-fin.ST

TL;DR: This paper investigates the theoretical and practical behavior of cross-validation errors in large covariance matrix estimation using the holdout method, assessing different approximations for splitting data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation lies in understanding the theoretical behavior of cross-validation approaches, specifically the holdout method, in the context of covariance matrix estimation for non-Gaussian data distributions.

Method: The authors use Weingarten calculus and the Ledoit-Péché formula for deriving eigenvalues in high-dimensional limits, further approximating holdout errors under linear and quadratic shrinkage techniques. They also conduct Monte Carlo simulations.

Result: They find an optimal train-test split ratio proportional to the square root of matrix dimensions and demonstrate that quadratic shrinkage significantly improves holdout error near the optimal split ratio, especially for higher fourth-order noise moments.

Conclusion: The findings emphasize the practical and theoretical importance of selecting an appropriate train-test split ratio and the improvements offered by quadratic approximations for covariance matrix estimation errors.

Abstract: Cross-validation is one of the most widely used methods for model selection
and evaluation; its efficiency for large covariance matrix estimation appears
robust in practice, but little is known about the theoretical behavior of its
error. In this paper, we derive the expected Frobenius error of the holdout
method, a particular cross-validation procedure that involves a single train
and test split, for a generic rotationally invariant multiplicative noise
model, therefore extending previous results to non-Gaussian data distributions.
Our approach involves using the Weingarten calculus and the Ledoit-P\'ech\'e
formula to derive the oracle eigenvalues in the high-dimensional limit. When
the population covariance matrix follows an inverse Wishart distribution, we
approximate the expected holdout error, first with a linear shrinkage, then
with a quadratic shrinkage to approximate the oracle eigenvalues. Under the
linear approximation, we find that the optimal train-test split ratio is
proportional to the square root of the matrix dimension. Then we compute Monte
Carlo simulations of the holdout error for different distributions of the norm
of the noise, such as the Gaussian, Student, and Laplace distributions and
observe that the quadratic approximation yields a substantial improvement,
especially around the optimal train-test split ratio. We also observe that a
higher fourth-order moment of the Euclidean norm of the noise vector sharpens
the holdout error curve near the optimal split and lowers the ideal train-test
ratio, making the choice of the train-test ratio more important when performing
the holdout method.

TL;DR: The paper introduces DSpAST, a novel audio encoder for spatial audio reasoning, improving performance over existing models with minimal additional parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current spatial audio encoders struggle to harmonize the detection of sound events with determining their direction and distance, leading to suboptimal performance.

Method: The authors designed DSpAST, an advanced version of SpatialAST, focusing on disentangled spatial audio representation learning with only a 0.2% increase in parameters.

Result: Experiments with SpatialSoundQA and BAT show DSpAST yields significantly better results than SpatialAST.

Conclusion: DSpAST successfully addresses limitations in spatial audio reasoning, proving to be more efficient and accurate in its representations compared to the baseline model.

Abstract: Reasoning about spatial audio with large language models requires a spatial
audio encoder as an acoustic front-end to obtain audio embeddings for further
processing. Such an encoder needs to capture all information required to detect
the type of sound events, as well as the direction and distance of their
corresponding sources. Accomplishing this with a single audio encoder is
demanding as the information required for each of these tasks is mostly
independent of each other. As a result, the performance obtained with a single
encoder is often worse than when using task-specific audio encoders. In this
work, we present DSpAST, a novel audio encoder based on SpatialAST that learns
disentangled representations of spatial audio while having only 0.2% additional
parameters. Experiments on SpatialSoundQA with the spatial audio reasoning
system BAT demonstrate that DSpAST significantly outperforms SpatialAST.

Method: The authors integrate multiple low-rank adapters (LoRA) into the model's attention layers, combined with a routing mechanism that activates specialized experts to handle evolving deepfake attacks.

Result: The proposed MoE-LoRA method outperforms standard fine-tuning approaches in both in-domain and out-of-domain tasks, achieving a significant reduction in equal error rates, with the best model lowering out-of-domain EER from 8.55% to 6.08%.

Conclusion: The MoE-LoRA method enhances adaptability and generalization in audio deepfake detection, marking an advancement over existing fine-tuning techniques.

Abstract: Foundation models such as Wav2Vec2 excel at representation learning in speech
tasks, including audio deepfake detection. However, after being fine-tuned on a
fixed set of bonafide and spoofed audio clips, they often fail to generalize to
novel deepfake methods not represented in training. To address this, we propose
a mixture-of-LoRA-experts approach that integrates multiple low-rank adapters
(LoRA) into the model's attention layers. A routing mechanism selectively
activates specialized experts, enhancing adaptability to evolving deepfake
attacks. Experimental results show that our method outperforms standard
fine-tuning in both in-domain and out-of-domain scenarios, reducing equal error
rates relative to baseline models. Notably, our best MoE-LoRA model lowers the
average out-of-domain EER from 8.55\% to 6.08\%, demonstrating its
effectiveness in achieving generalizable audio deepfake detection.

### [323] [Dual Actor DDPG for Airborne STAR-RIS Assisted Communications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13328)
*Danish Rizvi,David Boyle*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: This paper investigates a UAV-mounted STAR-RIS system with a coupled TRC phase shift model. It creates a novel optimization algorithm to enhance communication efficiency and evaluate UAV energy constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation lies in addressing the assumption of independent transmission/reflection coefficients in STAR-RIS systems. The study explores their coupling to improve multi-user communication systems.

Method: The authors develop a Dual Actor Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DA-DDPG) algorithm for joint optimization of UAV trajectory, active beamforming at the base station, and passive RIS TRC in a combined action space. A harmonic mean index reward function is also proposed to ensure user fairness.

Result: The DA-DDPG algorithm surpasses traditional algorithms by 24%-97% in reward metrics and improves communication efficiency by 28% with 3D trajectory optimization. Its reward function reduces QoS denial by 41%, achieving better fairness and UAV performance under realistic energy limitations.

Conclusion: The proposed method demonstrates the Aerial-STAR system’s advantages and validates the DA-DDPG algorithm’s role in maximizing fairness, communication efficiency, and UAV energy utilization in modern systems.

Abstract: This study departs from the prevailing assumption of independent Transmission
and Reflection Coefficients (TRC) in Airborne Simultaneous Transmit and Reflect
Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (STAR-RIS) research. Instead, we explore a
novel multi-user downlink communication system that leverages a UAV-mounted
STAR-RIS (Aerial-STAR) incorporating a coupled TRC phase shift model. Our key
contributions include the joint optimization of UAV trajectory, active
beamforming vectors at the base station, and passive RIS TRCs to enhance
communication efficiency, while considering UAV energy constraints. We design
the TRC as a combination of discrete and continuous actions, and propose a
novel Dual Actor Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DA-DDPG) algorithm. The
algorithm relies on two separate actor networks for high-dimensional hybrid
action space. We also propose a novel harmonic mean index (HFI)-based reward
function to ensure communication fairness amongst users. For comprehensive
analysis, we study the impact of RIS size on UAV aerodynamics showing that it
increases drag and energy demand. Simulation results demonstrate that the
proposed DA-DDPG algorithm outperforms conventional DDPG and DQN-based
solutions by 24% and 97%, respectively, in accumulated reward.
Three-dimensional UAV trajectory optimization achieves 28% higher communication
efficiency compared to two-dimensional and altitude optimization. The HFI based
reward function provides 41% lower QoS denial rates as compared to other
benchmarks. The mobile Aerial-STAR system shows superior performance over fixed
deployed counterparts, with the coupled phase STAR-RIS outperforming dual
Transmit/Reflect RIS and conventional RIS setups. These findings highlight the
potential of Aerial-STAR systems and the effectiveness of our proposed DA-DDPG
approach in optimizing their performance.

*Wei Shao,Ruoyu Zhang,Zequan Liang,Ehsan Kourkchi,Setareh Rafatirad,Houman Homayoun*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: The paper introduces a fully unsupervised signal-quality assessment pipeline for wearable photoplethysmography (PPG) signals to address issues like motion artifacts and ambient light interference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The aim is to assess and ensure the quality of PPG signals for reliable cardiometric analytics, overcoming the limitations of brittle heuristics and data-hungry supervised models.

Method: The approach combines self-supervised learning (contrastive 1-D ResNet-18) to create invariant embeddings and topological data analysis (persistent homology and HDBSCAN clustering) to classify signal quality.

Result: The proposed pipeline achieves robust clustering performance with high evaluation scores (Silhouette: 0.72, Davies-Bouldin: 0.34, and Calinski-Harabasz: 6173) on diverse PPG signal datasets.

Conclusion: This hybrid SSL-TDA framework is scalable, cross-device adaptable, and serves as a practical solution for automated PPG signal quality assessment.

Abstract: Wearable photoplethysmography (PPG) is embedded in billions of devices, yet
its optical waveform is easily corrupted by motion, perfusion loss, and ambient
light, jeopardizing downstream cardiometric analytics. Existing signal-quality
assessment (SQA) methods rely either on brittle heuristics or on data-hungry
supervised models. We introduce the first fully unsupervised SQA pipeline for
wrist PPG. Stage 1 trains a contrastive 1-D ResNet-18 on 276 h of raw,
unlabeled data from heterogeneous sources (varying in device and sampling
frequency), yielding optical-emitter- and motion-invariant embeddings (i.e.,
the learned representation is stable across differences in LED wavelength,
drive intensity, and device optics, as well as wrist motion). Stage 2 converts
each 512-D encoder embedding into a 4-D topological signature via persistent
homology (PH) and clusters these signatures with HDBSCAN. To produce a binary
signal-quality index (SQI), the acceptable PPG signals are represented by the
densest cluster while the remaining clusters are assumed to mainly contain
poor-quality PPG signals. Without re-tuning, the SQI attains Silhouette,
Davies-Bouldin, and Calinski-Harabasz scores of 0.72, 0.34, and 6173,
respectively, on a stratified sample of 10,000 windows. In this study, we
propose a hybrid self-supervised-learning--topological-data-analysis (SSL--TDA)
framework that offers a drop-in, scalable, cross-device quality gate for PPG
signals.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to enhance classification accuracy in streaming data settings where each sample is linked to a latent class and classified by multiple classifiers, often with varying accuracy.

Method: The paper introduces a state-space model and develops a filter optimized for real-time application to fuse classifiers’ outputs effectively while utilizing temporal signal dynamics.

Result: The proposed filter showed improved classification accuracy, demonstrated on an activity classification task using IMU data from wearable devices.

Conclusion: Fusing classifiers' outputs while leveraging temporal information using a state-space model is effective in real-time activity classification scenarios.

Abstract: We consider a streaming signal in which each sample is linked to a latent
class. We assume that multiple classifiers are available, each providing class
probabilities with varying degrees of accuracy. These classifiers are employed
following a straightforward and fixed policy. In this setting, we consider the
problem of fusing the output of the classifiers while incorporating the
temporal aspect to improve classification accuracy. We propose a state-space
model and develop a filter tailored for realtime execution. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed filter in an activity classification application
based on inertial measurement unit (IMU) data from a wearable device.

### [326] [Machines are more productive than humans until they aren't, and vice versa](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14057)
*Riccardo Zanardelli*

Main category: econ.GN

TL;DR: Monte Carlo-based simulations show that combining human and machine skills can be the most effective strategy for complex tasks, but only if true augmentation occurs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Organizations face the challenge of optimizing skill policies in the growing realm of artificial and human capabilities.

Method: The paper utilizes an in-silico framework of Monte Carlo simulations, grounded in empirical realism, to analyze the economic impact of human and machine skills.

Result: Automation excels economically in low-to-medium difficulty tasks but falters in complex tasks without augmentation; synergy between human and machine skills offers optimal performance but incurs significant costs if augmentation fails.

Conclusion: A human-machine skill policy demands deliberate augmentation, as a lack of synergy leads to failure despite advances in machine skills' cost-effectiveness.

Abstract: With the growth of artificial skills, organizations may increasingly confront
with the problem of optimizing skill policy decisions guided by economic
principles. This paper addresses the underlying complexity of this challenge by
developing an in-silico framework based on Monte Carlo simulations grounded in
empirical realism to analyze the economic impact of human and machine skills,
individually or jointly deployed, in the execution of tasks presenting varying
levels of complexity. Our results provide quantitative support for the
established notions that automation tends to be the most economically-effective
strategy for tasks characterized by low-to-medium generalization difficulty,
while automation struggles to match the economic utility of human skills in
more complex scenarios. Critically, our simulations highlight that combining
human and machine skills can be the most effective strategy when a high level
of generalization is required, but only if genuine augmentation is achieved. In
contrast, when failing to realize this synergy, the human-machine policy is
severely penalized by the inherent costs of its dual skill structure, causing
it to destroy value and becoming the worst choice from an economic perspective.
The takeaway for decision-makers is unambiguous: simply allocating human and
machine skills to a task is insufficient, and a human-machine skill policy is
neither a silver-bullet solution nor a low-risk compromise. Rather, it is a
critical opportunity to boost competitiveness that demands a strong
organizational commitment to enabling augmentation. Also, our findings show
that improving the cost-effectiveness of machine skills over time, while
useful, does not replace the fundamental need to focus on achieving
augmentation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for a systematic evaluation framework to compare dimensionality reduction techniques for spatial transcriptomics data beyond standard approaches like PCA.

Method: The study systematically benchmarks six dimensionality reduction methods on a spatial transcriptomics dataset, varying latent dimensions and clustering resolutions, and evaluates them using multiple complementary metrics, including two novel biologically-motivated measures.

Result: Different dimensionality reduction methods exhibit distinct strengths: PCA is fast; NMF excels in marker enrichment; VAE balances reconstruction and interpretability; and autoencoders perform moderately. MER-guided reassignment improves biological fidelity, increasing CMC scores by an average of 12%.

Conclusion: The proposed framework facilitates the principled selection of dimensionality reduction methods optimized for specific needs in spatial transcriptomics analyses.

Abstract: We introduce a unified framework for evaluating dimensionality reduction
techniques in spatial transcriptomics beyond standard PCA approaches. We
benchmark six methods PCA, NMF, autoencoder, VAE, and two hybrid embeddings on
a cholangiocarcinoma Xenium dataset, systematically varying latent dimensions
($k$=5-40) and clustering resolutions ($\rho$=0.1-1.2). Each configuration is
evaluated using complementary metrics including reconstruction error, explained
variance, cluster cohesion, and two novel biologically-motivated measures:
Cluster Marker Coherence (CMC) and Marker Exclusion Rate (MER). Our results
demonstrate distinct performance profiles: PCA provides a fast baseline, NMF
maximizes marker enrichment, VAE balances reconstruction and interpretability,
while autoencoders occupy a middle ground. We provide systematic hyperparameter
selection using Pareto optimal analysis and demonstrate how MER-guided
reassignment improves biological fidelity across all methods, with CMC scores
improving by up to 12\% on average. This framework enables principled selection
of dimensionality reduction methods tailored to specific spatial
transcriptomics analyses.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to improve the understanding of disease similarity to advance areas such as diagnostics, drug discovery, and personalized medicine.

Method: PhenoGnet incorporates gene and phenotype data through graph-based embeddings (GCNs, GATs) and a shared weight MLP for alignment via contrastive learning. A cosine similarity measure is used for disease comparisons.

Result: On a benchmark dataset, PhenoGnet achieved excellent predictive performance—AUCPR of 0.9012 and AUROC of 0.8764—surpassing existing methods.

Conclusion: PhenoGnet successfully predicts disease similarity, supports rare disease research, and has great potential for use in precision medicine, thanks to its scalability and interpretability.

Abstract: Understanding disease similarity is critical for advancing diagnostics, drug
discovery, and personalized treatment strategies. We present PhenoGnet, a novel
graph-based contrastive learning framework designed to predict disease
similarity by integrating gene functional interaction networks with the Human
Phenotype Ontology (HPO). PhenoGnet comprises two key components: an intra-view
model that separately encodes gene and phenotype graphs using Graph
Convolutional Networks (GCNs) and Graph Attention Networks (GATs), and a cross
view model implemented as a shared weight multilayer perceptron (MLP) that
aligns gene and phenotype embeddings through contrastive learning. The model is
trained using known gene phenotype associations as positive pairs and randomly
sampled unrelated pairs as negatives. Diseases are represented by the mean
embeddings of their associated genes and/or phenotypes, and pairwise similarity
is computed via cosine similarity. Evaluation on a curated benchmark of 1,100
similar and 866 dissimilar disease pairs demonstrates strong performance, with
gene based embeddings achieving an AUCPR of 0.9012 and AUROC of 0.8764,
outperforming existing state of the art methods. Notably, PhenoGnet captures
latent biological relationships beyond direct overlap, offering a scalable and
interpretable solution for disease similarity prediction. These results
underscore its potential for enabling downstream applications in rare disease
research and precision medicine.

Conclusion: This approach provides a scalable and resource-efficient solution for simulating quantum circuits, improving the practicality of large-scale quantum computations on HPC systems.

Abstract: Simulating quantum circuits (QC) on high-performance computing (HPC) systems
has become an essential method to benchmark algorithms and probe the potential

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Geometrically Local Quantum Kernel (GLQK), a scalable machine learning framework to efficiently analyze quantum many-body experimental data, leveraging correlations' exponential decay to improve data efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current quantum experiments create complex many-body datasets that are crucial to understanding quantum physics but are difficult to analyze due to classical limitations and resource constraints in near-term quantum devices.

Method: The proposed GLQK framework uses local quantum information at the correlation length scale, optimizing learning quantum expectation value polynomials by substantially reducing the sample complexity compared to the shadow kernel approach, especially for translationally symmetric data.

Result: GLQK reduces sample complexity and demonstrates constant sample requirements for translationally symmetric data regardless of the system size, showcasing high scalability in numerical experiments on quantum many-body phenomena.

Conclusion: GLQK paves the way for scalable data-driven approaches in quantum many-body physics, substantially improving data efficiency and opening new opportunities for experimental quantum research.

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) holds great promise for extracting insights from
complex quantum many-body data obtained in quantum experiments. This approach
can efficiently solve certain quantum problems that are classically
intractable, suggesting potential advantages of harnessing quantum data.
However, addressing large-scale problems still requires significant amounts of
data beyond the limited computational resources of near-term quantum devices.
We propose a scalable ML framework called Geometrically Local Quantum Kernel
(GLQK), designed to efficiently learn quantum many-body experimental data by
leveraging the exponential decay of correlations, a phenomenon prevalent in
noncritical systems. In the task of learning an unknown polynomial of quantum
expectation values, we rigorously prove that GLQK substantially improves
polynomial sample complexity in the number of qubits $n$, compared to the
existing shadow kernel, by constructing a feature space from local quantum
information at the correlation length scale. This improvement is particularly
notable when each term of the target polynomial involves few local subsystems.
Remarkably, for translationally symmetric data, GLQK achieves constant sample
complexity, independent of $n$. We numerically demonstrate its high scalability
in two learning tasks on quantum many-body phenomena. These results establish
new avenues for utilizing experimental data to advance the understanding of
quantum many-body physics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address challenges in extracting physical insights from experimental quantum data, which is often hindered by noise, limited observables, and incomplete microscopic models.

Method: A variational autoencoder (VAE) is trained in an unsupervised manner on interference measurements of one-dimensional Bose gases. The VAE learns a latent representation that captures key system parameters and is applied to equilibrium and non-equilibrium protocols.

Result: The VAE successfully identifies the equilibrium control parameter, reveals frozen-in solitons after rapid cooling, and uncovers anomalous post-quench dynamics not captured by traditional correlation-based approaches.

Conclusion: Generative models like VAEs can provide interpretable insights directly from noisy quantum experimental data, extending understanding in equilibrium and non-equilibrium physics and complementing traditional field-theoretical methods.

Abstract: Analog quantum simulators provide access to many-body dynamics beyond the
reach of classical computation. However, extracting physical insights from
experimental data is often hindered by measurement noise, limited observables,
and incomplete knowledge of the underlying microscopic model. Here, we develop
a machine learning approach based on a variational autoencoder (VAE) to analyze
interference measurements of tunnel-coupled one-dimensional Bose gases, which
realize the sine-Gordon quantum field theory. Trained in an unsupervised
manner, the VAE learns a minimal latent representation that strongly correlates
with the equilibrium control parameter of the system. Applied to
non-equilibrium protocols, the latent space uncovers signatures of frozen-in
solitons following rapid cooling, and reveals anomalous post-quench dynamics
not captured by conventional correlation-based methods. These results
demonstrate that generative models can extract physically interpretable
variables directly from noisy and sparse experimental data, providing
complementary probes of equilibrium and non-equilibrium physics in quantum

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To combine advances in quantum machine learning (via variational quantum circuits) and learnable activation functions (via Kolmogorov-Arnold networks) for better performance and scalability in machine learning models.

Method: Introduce DARUAN circuits as quantum variational activation functions embedded into QKANs. Two techniques—layer extension and hybrid QKANs—are developed for scalability and efficiency in large-scale tasks.

Result: Theoretical and experimental analyses show QKANs achieve improved parameter efficiency, expressivity, and generalization in tasks like regression, image classification, and language modeling.

Conclusion: QKANs, with DARUAN circuits, present a promising approach for enhancing quantum machine learning capabilities on both NISQ quantum hardware and classical simulators.

Abstract: Variational quantum circuits (VQCs) are central to quantum machine learning,
while recent progress in Kolmogorov-Arnold networks (KANs) highlights the power
of learnable activation functions. We unify these directions by introducing
quantum variational activation functions (QVAFs), realized through single-qubit
data re-uploading circuits called DatA Re-Uploading ActivatioNs (DARUANs). We
show that DARUAN with trainable weights in data pre-processing possesses an
exponentially growing frequency spectrum with data repetitions, enabling an
exponential reduction in parameter size compared with Fourier-based activations
without loss of expressivity. Embedding DARUAN into KANs yields
quantum-inspired KANs (QKANs), which retain the interpretability of KANs while
improving their parameter efficiency, expressivity, and generalization. We
further introduce two novel techniques to enhance scalability, feasibility and
computational efficiency, such as layer extension and hybrid QKANs (HQKANs) as
drop-in replacements of multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) for feed-forward
networks in large-scale models. We provide theoretical analysis and extensive
experiments on function regression, image classification, and autoregressive
generative language modeling, demonstrating the efficiency and scalability of
QKANs. DARUANs and QKANs offer a promising direction for advancing quantum
machine learning on both noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) hardware and

TL;DR: This paper proposes a quantum reinforcement learning (QRL) approach to dynamically adjust classifier-free guidance (CFG) in diffusion models, showing improvements in perceptual quality and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion models often rely on static or heuristic CFG schedules, which fail to adapt to varying timesteps and noise conditions, limiting their performance.

Method: The paper uses a hybrid quantum-classical actor-critic architecture. A shallow variational quantum circuit (VQC) generates policy features, while a multilayer perceptron (MLP) maps these features into actions for $\\Delta$CFG. The policy is optimized using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) with Generalized Advantage Estimation (GAE), and a reward system balances confidence, visual quality, and action efficiency.

Result: Experiments on the CIFAR-10 dataset demonstrate that the proposed QRL approach improves perceptual metrics like LPIPS, PSNR, and SSIM while reducing parameter count when compared to classical RL approaches or static CFG schedules.

Conclusion: The QRL-based CFG scheduling approach enhances the adaptability and perceptual quality of diffusion models, demonstrating robust performance under varying conditions and offering trade-offs between accuracy and efficiency when adjusting quantum circuit configurations.

Abstract: Diffusion models typically employ static or heuristic classifier-free
guidance (CFG) schedules, which often fail to adapt across timesteps and noise
conditions. In this work, we introduce a quantum reinforcement learning (QRL)
controller that dynamically adjusts CFG at each denoising step. The controller
adopts a hybrid quantum--classical actor--critic architecture: a shallow
variational quantum circuit (VQC) with ring entanglement generates policy
features, which are mapped by a compact multilayer perceptron (MLP) into
Gaussian actions over $\Delta$CFG, while a classical critic estimates value
functions. The policy is optimized using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)
with Generalized Advantage Estimation (GAE), guided by a reward that balances
classification confidence, perceptual improvement, and action regularization.
Experiments on CIFAR-10 demonstrate that our QRL policy improves perceptual
quality (LPIPS, PSNR, SSIM) while reducing parameter count compared to
classical RL actors and fixed schedules. Ablation studies on qubit number and
circuit depth reveal trade-offs between accuracy and efficiency, and extended
evaluations confirm robust generation under long diffusion schedules.

Motivation: To tackle computational and inferential challenges in high-dimensional PDEs due to the curse of dimensionality and limitations of traditional numerical methods.

Method: The framework consists of two stages: (1) physics-based deep kernel learning (DKL) to train a surrogate model and initially estimate PDE parameters, and (2) Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) to sample the joint posterior distribution for uncertainty quantification.

Result: Numerical experiments validate the framework’s accuracy in parameter estimation and uncertainty quantification, effectively addressing data sparsity and model complexity.

Conclusion: This robust and scalable method facilitates parameter inference and uncertainty quantification for high-dimensional PDEs, with applications in scientific and engineering domains.

Abstract: Inferring parameters of high-dimensional partial differential equations
(PDEs) poses significant computational and inferential challenges, primarily
due to the curse of dimensionality and the inherent limitations of traditional
numerical methods. This paper introduces a novel two-stage Bayesian framework
that synergistically integrates training, physics-based deep kernel learning
(DKL) with Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) to robustly infer unknown PDE
parameters and quantify their uncertainties from sparse, exact observations.
The first stage leverages physics-based DKL to train a surrogate model, which
jointly yields an optimized neural network feature extractor and robust initial
estimates for the PDE parameters. In the second stage, with the neural network
weights fixed, HMC is employed within a full Bayesian framework to efficiently
sample the joint posterior distribution of the kernel hyperparameters and the
PDE parameters. Numerical experiments on canonical and high-dimensional inverse
PDE problems demonstrate that our framework accurately estimates parameters,
provides reliable uncertainty estimates, and effectively addresses challenges
of data sparsity and model complexity, offering a robust and scalable tool for

Abstract: Purpose: Artificial intelligence (AI) techniques have been extensively
utilized for diagnosing and prognosis of several diseases in recent years. This
study identifies, appraises and synthesizes published studies on the use of AI
for the prognosis of COVID-19. Method: Electronic search was performed using
Medline, Google Scholar, Scopus, Embase, Cochrane and ProQuest. Studies that
examined machine learning or deep learning methods to determine the prognosis
of COVID-19 using CT or chest X-ray images were included. Polled sensitivity,
specificity area under the curve and diagnostic odds ratio were calculated.
Result: A total of 36 articles were included; various prognosis-related issues,

Based on the included articles, machine learning and deep learning methods used
for the prognosis of COVID-19 patients using radiomic features from CT or CXR
images can help clinicians manage patients and allocate resources more
effectively. These studies also demonstrate that combining patient demographic,
clinical data, laboratory tests and radiomic features improves model
performances.

*James Jincheng,Youcheng Cai,Ligang Liu*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: CraftMesh leverages 2D and 3D generative models for high-fidelity mesh editing, outperforming existing methods in complex tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mesh editing with high fidelity and control in 3D content creation is challenging, as current methods struggle with intricate geometries and fail in detailed renders.

Method: CraftMesh decomposes the editing process into modifying a 2D reference image, generating specific 3D mesh regions, and fusing them seamlessly. It uses Poisson Geometric Fusion and Texture Harmonization techniques.

Result: CraftMesh achieves enhanced geometric integration and texture blending, yielding better consistency and detail compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: CraftMesh effectively addresses the limitations in high-fidelity mesh editing, enabling superior performance in complex tasks with seamless integration of geometric and texture updates.

Abstract: Controllable, high-fidelity mesh editing remains a significant challenge in
3D content creation. Existing generative methods often struggle with complex
geometries and fail to produce detailed results. We propose CraftMesh, a novel
framework for high-fidelity generative mesh manipulation via Poisson Seamless
Fusion. Our key insight is to decompose mesh editing into a pipeline that
leverages the strengths of 2D and 3D generative models: we edit a 2D reference
image, then generate a region-specific 3D mesh, and seamlessly fuse it into the
original model. We introduce two core techniques: Poisson Geometric Fusion,
which utilizes a hybrid SDF/Mesh representation with normal blending to achieve
harmonious geometric integration, and Poisson Texture Harmonization for
visually consistent texture blending. Experimental results demonstrate that
CraftMesh outperforms state-of-the-art methods, delivering superior global
consistency and local detail in complex editing tasks.

*Julia Jurkowska,Joanna Dreszer,Monika Lewandowska,Krzysztof Tołpa,Tomasz Piotrowski*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: The paper presents a refined multi-source EEG/MEG localization framework addressing source cancellation, offering analytical completeness and practical implementation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome challenges in accurate EEG/MEG source localization due to ill-posed inverse problems and source cancellation in correlated source scenarios.

Method: Derives a rigorous analytical framework for multi-source neural activity indices and spatial filters with automated parameter selection, complemented by implementation extending MNE-Python.

Result: Provides a complete, practical multi-source approach for EEG/MEG localization and demonstrates its effectiveness using real EEG experimental data.

Conclusion: Multi-source spatial filtering using the proposed framework improves source localization and is accessible for broader adoption through implementation and tutorials.

Abstract: Accurate EEG/MEG source localization is essential for understanding brain
function, yet remains challenging because the inverse problem is inherently
ill-posed. In spatial filtering (beamforming) approaches, single-source LCMV
spatial filters, though widely used, suffer from source cancellation when
sources are correlated - a common experimental scenario. Multi-source
frameworks, such as the multi-source minimum-variance pseudo-unbiased
reduced-rank (MV-PURE) method, offer improved reconstruction and robust neural
activity indices, yet their adoption has been limited by incomplete theory and
lack of accessible implementations. In this paper, we present a rigorous
derivation of multi-source neural activity indices and spatial filters,
establishing a complete analytical framework with automated parameter
selection. The resulting compact algebraic forms enable straightforward
implementation. To facilitate adoption, we provide a full implementation
extending MNE-Python, along with an accompanying tutorial, and demonstrate its
utility on EEG experimental data, highlighting the practical advantages of
multi-source spatial filtering for source localization and reconstruction.

### [338] [Complexity Bounds for Smooth Convex Multiobjective Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13550)
*Phillipe R. Sampaio*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: The paper investigates oracle complexity in smooth multiobjective optimization and derives bounds on finding Pareto stationary points while revealing gaps between upper and lower convergence rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the complexity of solving multiobjective optimization problems by analyzing how quickly an algorithm can reach Pareto stationary points under different conditions, and to address gaps between theoretical bounds and practical performance.

Method: The study uses mathematical analysis and derives lower and upper bounds for convergence rates using span methods, convex and strongly convex conditions, and distinguishes between oblivious and adaptive scalarization techniques.

Result: Four major results include: linear convergence bounds dependent on the condition number for strongly convex problems, $1/T$ bounds for oblivious one-step convex methods, $1/T$ performance of accelerated gradient descent, and a universal $1/T^2$ lower bound for adaptive scalarization convex span methods.

Conclusion: The derived lower bounds reveal fundamental limitations on convergence rates for various methods and demonstrate gaps between theoretical and achievable performance in multiobjective optimization, guiding algorithmic design and analysis.

Abstract: We study the oracle complexity of finding $\varepsilon$-Pareto stationary
points in smooth multiobjective optimization with $m$ objectives. The progress
metric is the Pareto stationarity gap $\mathcal{G}(x)$ (the norm of an optimal
convex combination of gradients). Our contributions are fourfold. (i) For
strongly convex objectives, any span first-order method (iterates lie in the
span of past gradients) exhibits linear convergence no faster than
$\exp(-\Theta(T/\sqrt{\kappa}))$ after $T$ oracle calls, where $\kappa$ is the
condition number, implying $\Theta(\sqrt{\kappa}\log(1/\varepsilon))$
iterations; this matches classical accelerated upper bounds. (ii) For convex
problems and oblivious one-step methods (a fixed scalarization with
pre-scheduled step sizes), we prove a lower bound of order $1/T$ on the best
gradient norm among the first $T$ iterates. (iii) Although accelerated gradient
descent is outside this restricted class, it is an oblivious span method and
attains the same $1/T$ upper rate on a fixed scalarization. (iv) For convex
problems and general span methods with adaptive scalarizations, we establish a
universal lower bound of order $1/T^{2}$ on the gradient norm of the final
iterate after $T$ steps, highlighting a gap between known upper bounds and
worst-case guarantees. All bounds hold on non-degenerate instances with
distinct objectives and non-singleton Pareto fronts; rates are stated up to
universal constants and natural problem scaling.

### [339] [Accelerated Gradient Methods with Biased Gradient Estimates: Risk Sensitivity, High-Probability Guarantees, and Large Deviation Bounds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13628)
*Mert Gürbüzbalaban,Yasa Syed,Necdet Serhat Aybat*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: This paper investigates the trade-offs between convergence rate and robustness to stochastic gradient errors in generalized momentum methods (GMMs), providing both theoretical guarantees and numerical experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to understand how to balance efficient convergence (speed) and robustness to errors in gradient computations within first-order optimization methods.

Method: They utilize robust control theory concepts, specifically the risk-sensitive index (RSI), to analyze stochastic gradient errors. Theoretical tools like Riccati equations, $H_{\infty}$-norms, and large-deviation principles are employed for various function scenarios (e.g., quadratic and smooth strongly convex functions).

Result: Closed-form expressions reveal a Pareto frontier between RSI and convergence rate for Gaussian noise. Non-asymptotic bounds, finite-time guarantees, and large-deviation bounds are derived under biased sub-Gaussian errors. A connection is established between worst-case robustness ($H_{\infty}$-norm) and tail probability decay.

Conclusion: The study provides the first non-asymptotic analysis and risk-sensitive guarantees for GMMs with biased gradients, advancing their understanding and offering practical insights, as seen in numerical experiments on robust regression.

Abstract: We study trade-offs between convergence rate and robustness to gradient
errors in first-order methods. Our focus is on generalized momentum methods
(GMMs), a class that includes Nesterov's accelerated gradient, heavy-ball, and
gradient descent. We allow stochastic gradient errors that may be adversarial
and biased, and quantify robustness via the risk-sensitive index (RSI) from
robust control theory. For quadratic objectives with i.i.d. Gaussian noise, we
give closed-form expressions for RSI using 2x2 Riccati equations, revealing a
Pareto frontier between RSI and convergence rate over stepsize and momentum
choices. We prove a large-deviation principle for time-averaged suboptimality
and show that the rate function is, up to scaling, the convex conjugate of the
RSI. We further connect RSI to the $H_{\infty}$-norm, showing that stronger
worst-case robustness (smaller $H_{\infty}$ norm) yields sharper decay of tail
probabilities. Beyond quadratics, under biased sub-Gaussian gradient errors, we
derive non-asymptotic bounds on a finite-time analogue of the RSI, giving
finite-time high-probability guarantees and large-deviation bounds. We also
observe an analogous trade-off between RSI and convergence-rate bounds for
smooth strongly convex functions. To our knowledge, these are the first
non-asymptotic guarantees and risk-sensitive analysis of GMMs with biased
gradients. Numerical experiments on robust regression illustrate the results.

### [340] [Bellman Optimality of Average-Reward Robust Markov Decision Processes with a Constant Gain](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14203)
*Shengbo Wang,Nian Si*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: The paper explores average-reward robust Markov decision processes (MDPs), focusing on the constant-gain setting and solving related Bellman equations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing work on robust MDPs has largely ignored the average-reward framework despite its relevance in operations research and management.

Method: The study analyzes the robust Bellman equation in the constant-gain setting to determine solutions' existence and their relation to optimal average reward and policies.

Result: The paper identifies conditions under which robust Bellman equations provide optimal solutions and stationary policies, expanding the theory for average-reward robust MDPs.

Conclusion: Findings deepen understanding of robust dynamic programming under long-run average criteria and provide theoretical groundwork for applications in operational environments.

Abstract: Learning and optimal control under robust Markov decision processes (MDPs)
have received increasing attention, yet most existing theory, algorithms, and
applications focus on finite-horizon or discounted models. The average-reward
formulation, while natural in many operations research and management contexts,
remains underexplored. This is primarily because the dynamic programming
foundations are technically challenging and only partially understood, with
several fundamental questions remaining open. This paper steps toward a general
framework for average-reward robust MDPs by analyzing the constant-gain
setting. We study the average-reward robust control problem with possible
information asymmetries between the controller and an S-rectangular adversary.
Our analysis centers on the constant-gain robust Bellman equation, examining
both the existence of solutions and their relationship to the optimal average
reward. Specifically, we identify when solutions to the robust Bellman equation
characterize the optimal average reward and stationary policies, and we provide
sufficient conditions ensuring solutions' existence. These findings expand the
dynamic programming theory for average-reward robust MDPs and lay a foundation
for robust dynamic decision making under long-run average criteria in
operational environments.

TL;DR: The paper connects resistor-diode networks to deep ReLU neural networks, enabling analog hardware implementations and hardware-based training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge resistor-diode circuits and neural network models, enabling their functionality directly in analog hardware and exploring training methods in hardware.

Method: It analyzes resistor-diode networks and connects them to infinite-depth ReLU networks. It proposes hardware linearization for gradient computation and training, simulates circuits, and explores non-linear elements for varied activation functions.

Result: Resistor-diode networks correspond to ReLU neural networks. Hardware training using gradient computation is feasible. Cascade circuits can implement advanced network structures. Non-ideal diodes induce novel activation functions like diode ReLU.

Conclusion: Resistor-diode networks provide a pathway to analog ReLU neural network implementations, hardware training methods, and novel activation function designs, with potential for advanced network structures.

Abstract: It is shown that the port behavior of a resistor-diode network corresponds to
the solution of a ReLU monotone operator equilibrium network (a neural network
in the limit of infinite depth), giving a parsimonious construction of a neural
network in analog hardware. We furthermore show that the gradient of such a
circuit can be computed directly in hardware, using a procedure we call
hardware linearization. This allows the network to be trained in hardware,
which we demonstrate with a device-level circuit simulation. We extend the
results to cascades of resistor-diode networks, which can be used to implement
feedforward and other asymmetric networks. We finally show that different
nonlinear elements give rise to different activation functions, and introduce
the novel diode ReLU which is induced by a non-ideal diode model.

*Xuyuan Kang,Xiao Wang,Jingjing An,Da Yan*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: The paper develops a new prediction and control strategy for ice-based thermal energy storage (TES) in buildings, enhancing cooling performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: TES systems are typically operated on fixed schedules that limit their potential for load shifting, necessitating optimized control strategies for better efficiency.

Method: The study created a cooling load prediction model with a mid-day modification mechanism and introduced a rule-based control strategy linked to time-of-use tariffs.

Result: The approach achieved a mean absolute error (MAE) of 389 kW, a coefficient of variance of MAE of 12.5%, and an energy cost saving rate of 9.9%. It was successfully implemented in a building in Beijing.

Conclusion: The proposed strategy improves the efficiency, automation, and cost-effectiveness of TES cooling systems in real-world applications.

Abstract: Thermal energy storage (TES) is an effective method for load shifting and
demand response in buildings. Optimal TES control and management are essential
to improve the performance of the cooling system. Most existing TES systems
operate on a fixed schedule, which cannot take full advantage of its load
shifting capability, and requires extensive investigation and optimization.
This study proposed a novel integrated load prediction and optimized control
approach for ice-based TES in commercial buildings. A cooling load prediction
model was developed and a mid-day modification mechanism was introduced into
the prediction model to improve the accuracy. Based on the predictions, a
rule-based control strategy was proposed according to the time-of-use tariff;
the mid-day control adjustment mechanism was introduced in accordance with the
mid-day prediction modifications. The proposed approach was applied in the
ice-based TES system of a commercial complex in Beijing, and achieved a mean
absolute error (MAE) of 389 kW and coefficient of variance of MAE of 12.5%. The
integrated prediction-based control strategy achieved an energy cost saving
rate of 9.9%. The proposed model was deployed in the realistic building
automation system of the case building and significantly improved the
efficiency and automation of the cooling system.

*Arman Pourghorban,Dipankar Maity*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: The paper addresses a target defense problem in a planar conical environment, devising equilibrium strategies for a defender to maximize capture against strategically moving attackers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to develop optimal strategies for a defender against a sequence of attackers aiming to breach a target in a constrained environment, accounting for both current and future engagements.

Method: The problem is analyzed using game theory and equilibrium strategies, leveraging the concept of capture distribution. Numerical examples based on Monte Carlo simulations validate the theoretical results.

Result: Equilibrium strategies are derived for the defender and attackers to optimize the capture percentage, considering attackers’ constrained sensor ranges and strategic movements.

Conclusion: The proposed equilibrium strategies are effective in addressing the dynamic and strategic nature of the target defense scenarios, confirmed by numerical simulations.

Abstract: We consider a variant of the target defense problem in a planar conical
environment where a single defender is tasked to capture a sequence of incoming
attackers. The attackers' objective is to breach the target boundary without
being captured by the defender. As soon as the current attacker breaches the
target or gets captured by the defender, the next attacker appears at the
boundary of the environment and moves radially toward the target with maximum
speed. Therefore, the defender's final location at the end of the current game
becomes its initial location for the next game. The attackers pick strategies
that are advantageous for the current as well as for future engagements between
the defender and the remaining attackers. The attackers have their own sensors
with limited range, using which they can perfectly detect if the defender is
within their sensing range. We derive equilibrium strategies for all the
players to optimize the capture percentage using the notions of capture
distribution. Finally, the theoretical results are verified through numerical
examples using Monte Carlo type random trials of experiments.

*Zhixion Chen,Jiangzhou Wang,and Hyundong Shin,Arumugam Nallanathan*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: This paper addresses UAV trajectory planning and resource allocation challenges using an innovative hybrid approach combining large language models (LLMs) and decision transformers (DTs), achieving notable energy efficiency improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the limitations of UAVs in data collection operations for IoT applications, specifically focusing on their limited endurance and communication range. Reinforcement learning is considered but suffers from real-world feasibility issues, while offline RL has its vulnerabilities. The motivation lies in formulating an efficient strategy for UAV trajectory planning and resource allocation to enhance energy efficiency while overcoming these constraints.

Method: The authors solve the resource allocation subproblem via an equivalent linear programming formulation with polynomial complexity. They propose the LLM-CRDT framework, which integrates LLMs into a critic-regularized decision transformer for policy learning from suboptimal datasets. Critic networks provide regularization, while a pre-trained LLM and LoRA fine-tuning minimize data requirements and computational costs.

Result: Simulations show that the proposed LLM-CRDT framework surpasses competing online and offline reinforcement learning methods, achieving up to 36.7% greater energy efficiency over state-of-the-art DT solutions.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that the LLM-CRDT framework effectively leverages LLMs and critics within a decision-transformer model, offering a robust method for energy-efficient UAV control. It demonstrates substantial improvements compared to existing techniques for UAV trajectory planning and resource allocation, particularly in the context of limited datasets.

Abstract: The deployment of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for reliable and
energy-efficient data collection from spatially distributed devices holds great
promise in supporting diverse Internet of Things (IoT) applications.
Nevertheless, the limited endurance and communication range of UAVs necessitate
intelligent trajectory planning. While reinforcement learning (RL) has been
extensively explored for UAV trajectory optimization, its interactive nature
entails high costs and risks in real-world environments. Offline RL mitigates
these issues but remains susceptible to unstable training and heavily rely on
expert-quality datasets. To address these challenges, we formulate a joint UAV
trajectory planning and resource allocation problem to maximize energy
efficiency of data collection. The resource allocation subproblem is first
transformed into an equivalent linear programming formulation and solved
optimally with polynomial-time complexity. Then, we propose a large language
model (LLM)-empowered critic-regularized decision transformer (DT) framework,
termed LLM-CRDT, to learn effective UAV control policies. In LLM-CRDT, we
incorporate critic networks to regularize the DT model training, thereby
integrating the sequence modeling capabilities of DT with critic-based value
guidance to enable learning effective policies from suboptimal datasets.
Furthermore, to mitigate the data-hungry nature of transformer models, we
employ a pre-trained LLM as the transformer backbone of the DT model and adopt
a parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategy, i.e., LoRA, enabling rapid
adaptation to UAV control tasks with small-scale dataset and low computational
overhead. Extensive simulations demonstrate that LLM-CRDT outperforms benchmark
online and offline RL methods, achieving up to 36.7\% higher energy efficiency
than the current state-of-the-art DT approaches.

### [345] [Valuation of Exotic Options and Counterparty Games Based on Conditional Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13374)
*Helin Zhao,Junchi Shen*

Main category: q-fin.PR

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel pricing model for exotic financial products using Diffusion-Conditional Probability Model (DDPM) to improve price path realism and profitability over traditional models while highlighting its limitations in extreme market scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional models fail to handle real-world market phenomena like fat-tailed distributions and volatility clustering, necessitating enhanced approaches to price exotic options and structured products.

Method: The paper proposes DDPM, incorporating a composite loss function with financial-specific features and a P-Q dynamic game framework for adversarial backtesting to evaluate economic value.

Result: The P-model accurately matches market mean and volatility in static validation, outperforms traditional Monte Carlo methods in profitability for European and Asian options, but struggles with products sensitive to extreme events due to underestimation of tail risks.

Conclusion: Diffusion models show significant promise for more accurate pricing of structured products but require further refinement to effectively account for extreme market risks.

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenges of pricing exotic options and structured
products, which traditional models often fail to handle due to their inability
to capture real-world market phenomena like fat-tailed distributions and
volatility clustering. We introduce a Diffusion-Conditional Probability Model
(DDPM) to generate more realistic price paths. Our method incorporates a
composite loss function with financial-specific features, and we propose a P-Q
dynamic game framework for evaluating the model's economic value through
adversarial backtesting. Static validation shows our P-model effectively
matches market mean and volatility. In dynamic games, it demonstrates
significantly higher profitability than a traditional Monte Carlo-based model
for European and Asian options. However, the model shows limitations in pricing
products highly sensitive to extreme events, such as snowballs and
accumulators, because it tends to underestimate tail risks. The study concludes
that diffusion models hold significant potential for enhancing pricing
accuracy, though further research is needed to improve their ability to model
extreme market risks.

TL;DR: The paper presents a parallelization approach to trace abstraction in software model checking, achieving faster results compared to sequential methods and outperforming recent parallel techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Software model checking is hindered by time-consuming processes, limiting its practical application, especially in scenarios like continuous integration.

Method: The method involves parallelizing trace abstraction by analyzing different traces that may violate safety properties simultaneously.

Result: Evaluation of the parallelized version in Ultimate Automizer shows it is faster on time-consuming tasks and more effective than DSS.

Conclusion: Parallelized trace abstraction enhances performance, making software model checking more practical and efficient.

Abstract: Automatic software verification is a valuable means for software quality
assurance. However, automatic verification and in particular software model
checking can be time-consuming, which hinders their practical applicability
e.g., the use in continuous integration. One solution to address the issue is
to reduce the response time of the verification procedure by leveraging today's
multi-core CPUs.
  In this paper, we propose a solution to parallelize trace abstraction, an
abstraction-based approach to software model checking. The underlying idea of
our approach is to parallelize the abstraction refinement. More concretely, our
approach analyzes different traces (syntactic program paths) that could violate
the safety property in parallel. We realize our parallelized version of trace
abstraction in the verification tool Ulti mate Automizer and perform a thorough
evaluation. Our evaluation shows that our parallelization is more effective
than sequential trace abstraction and can provide results significantly faster
on many time-consuming tasks. Also, our approach is more effective than DSS, a
recent parallel approach to abstraction-based software model checking.

### [347] [Accuracy Paradox in Large Language Models: Regulating Hallucination Risks in Generative AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13345)
*Zihao Li,Weiwei Yi,Jiahong Chen*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: This paper critiques the focus on accuracy as the primary metric for addressing hallucinations in large language models, exposing its limitations and proposing a broader, context-aware approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the growing epistemic and societal risks of hallucinations in large language models, especially given their role in everyday decision-making.

Method: The authors develop a taxonomy of hallucination types and analyze the limitations of accuracy as a singular metric across three dimensions—outputs, individuals, and societal impacts. They also examine current regulations like the EU AI Act, GDPR, and DSA.

Result: The analysis shows that an overemphasis on accuracy can lead to superficial trust in outputs, fail to detect nuanced harms, and obscure broader societal consequences of AI hallucinations.

Conclusion: The paper advocates for transitioning to a pluralistic, context-aware, and manipulation-resilient framework for AI governance to address epistemic, relational, and systemic risks.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) permeate everyday decision-making, their
epistemic and societal risks demand urgent scrutiny. Hallucinations, the
generation of fabricated, misleading, oversimplified or untrustworthy outputs,
has emerged as imperative challenges. While regulatory, academic, and technical
discourse position accuracy as the principal benchmark for mitigating such
harms, this article contends that overreliance on accuracy misdiagnoses the
problem and has counterproductive effect: the accuracy paradox. Drawing on
interdisciplinary literatures, this article develops a taxonomy of
hallucination types and shows the paradox along three intertwining dimensions:
outputs, individuals and society. First, accuracy functions as a superficial
proxy for reliability, incentivising the optimisation of rhetorical fluency and
surface-level correctness over epistemic trustworthiness. This encourages
passive user trust in outputs that appear accurate but epistemically untenable.
Second, accuracy as a singular metric fails to detect harms that are not
factually false but are nonetheless misleading, value-laden, or socially
distorting, including consensus illusions, sycophantic alignment, and subtle
manipulation. Third, regulatory overemphasis on accuracy obscures the wider
societal consequences of hallucination, including social sorting, privacy
violations, equity harms, epistemic convergence that marginalises dissent,
reduces pluralism, and causes social deskilling. By examining the EU AI Act,
GDPR, and DSA, the article argues that current regulations are not yet
structurally equipped to address these epistemic, relational, and systemic
harms and exacerbated by the overreliance on accuracy. By exposing such
conceptual and practical challenges, this article calls for a fundamental shift
towards pluralistic, context-aware, and manipulation-resilient approaches to AI
trustworthy governance.

### [348] [Synthetic Data and the Shifting Ground of Truth](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13355)
*Dietmar Offenhuber*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: The paper explores how synthetic data, which lacks relatable real-world references, is being used in AI as ground truth, despite challenges to conventional assumptions about data fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the paradoxical reliance on synthetic data, which lacks real-world representational ties, in creating ground truth and its impact on AI model training and performance.

Method: Analyzing the practices and strategies employed by researchers and practitioners to utilize synthetic data as a substitute for traditional, representation-based ground truth in AI contexts.

Result: The investigation finds that synthetic data, despite being unrealistic, can enhance model performance by addressing biases, preventing overfitting, and improving robustness to outliers.

Conclusion: This shift challenges traditional data fidelity principles, redefines ground truth, and raises broader implications about data not needing direct real-world reference to achieve significant utility in AI systems.

Abstract: The emergence of synthetic data for privacy protection, training data
generation, or simply convenient access to quasi-realistic data in any shape or
volume complicates the concept of ground truth. Synthetic data mimic real-world
observations, but do not refer to external features. This lack of a
representational relationship, however, not prevent researchers from using
synthetic data as training data for AI models and ground truth repositories. It
is claimed that the lack of data realism is not merely an acceptable tradeoff,
but often leads to better model performance than realistic data: compensate for
known biases, prevent overfitting and support generalization, and make the
models more robust in dealing with unexpected outliers. Indeed, injecting noisy
and outright implausible data into training sets can be beneficial for the
model. This greatly complicates usual assumptions based on which
representational accuracy determines data fidelity (garbage in - garbage out).
Furthermore, ground truth becomes a self-referential affair, in which the
labels used as a ground truth repository are themselves synthetic products of a
generative model and as such not connected to real-world observations. My paper
examines how ML researchers and practitioners bootstrap ground truth under such
paradoxical circumstances without relying on the stable ground of
representation and real-world reference. It will also reflect on the broader
implications of a shift from a representational to what could be described as a
mimetic or iconic concept of data.

Motivation: The motivation stems from the transformative impact of GenAI tools like ChatGPT on education, especially on traditional assessment practices in the context of evolving university examination settings.

Method: An empirical approach involving the generation, transcription, and blind marking of GenAI-generated submissions for eight undergraduate math exams, covering a full first-year curriculum at a Russell Group university, was used. GenAI solutions were evaluated independently by question and also at modular and curriculum levels.

Result: GenAI performed at a first-class degree level with remarkable consistency across the curriculum, outperforming the variability observed in student performance during invigilated exams.

Conclusion: The study concludes the necessity of redesigning mathematics assessments to maintain pedagogical value, as current standards are less effective in the context of GenAI's capabilities in unsupervised testing scenarios.

Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) tools such as OpenAI's ChatGPT are
transforming the educational landscape, prompting reconsideration of
traditional assessment practices. In parallel, universities are exploring
alternatives to in-person, closed-book examinations, raising concerns about
academic integrity and pedagogical alignment in uninvigilated settings. This
study investigates whether traditional closed-book mathematics examinations
retain their pedagogical relevance when hypothetically administered in
uninvigilated, open-book settings with GenAI access. Adopting an empirical
approach, we generate, transcribe, and blind-mark GenAI submissions to eight
undergraduate mathematics examinations at a Russel Group university, spanning
the entirety of the first-year curriculum. By combining independent GenAI
responses to individual questions, we enable a meaningful evaluation of GenAI
performance, both at the level of modules and across the first-year curriculum.
We find that GenAI attainment is at the level of a first-class degree, though
current performance can vary between modules. Further, we find that GenAI
performance is remarkably consistent when viewed across the entire curriculum,
significantly more so than that of students in invigilated examinations. Our
findings evidence the need for redesigning assessments in mathematics for
unsupervised settings, and highlight the potential reduction in pedagogical
value of current standards in the era of generative artificial intelligence.

### [350] [The Provenance Problem: LLMs and the Breakdown of Citation Norms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13365)
*Brian D. Earp,Haotian Yuan,Julian Koplin,Sebastian Porsdam Mann*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: This paper highlights the challenges posed by generative AI in scientific writing, focusing on issues of intellectual credit and provocation without intent.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the rising ethical and attribution challenges posed by generative AI, specifically its impact on the recognition of intellectual contributions in academic works.

Method: The authors analyze conceptual frameworks to address the 'provenance problem,' critique current ethical norms, and propose strategies for scholarly integrity in an AI-dominated context.

Result: The paper identifies a novel category of attributional harm and outlines specific risks to scholarly credit and epistemic justice.

Conclusion: It argues that current ethical frameworks are inadequate for preventing uncredited intellectual contributions, proposing strategic interventions to maintain fairness in scientific communication.

Abstract: The increasing use of generative AI in scientific writing raises urgent
questions about attribution and intellectual credit. When a researcher employs
ChatGPT to draft a manuscript, the resulting text may echo ideas from sources
the author has never encountered. If an AI system reproduces insights from, for
example, an obscure 1975 paper without citation, does this constitute
plagiarism? We argue that such cases exemplify the 'provenance problem': a
systematic breakdown in the chain of scholarly credit. Unlike conventional
plagiarism, this phenomenon does not involve intent to deceive (researchers may
disclose AI use and act in good faith) yet still benefit from the uncredited
intellectual contributions of others. This dynamic creates a novel category of
attributional harm that current ethical and professional frameworks fail to
address. As generative AI becomes embedded across disciplines, the risk that
significant ideas will circulate without recognition threatens both the
reputational economy of science and the demands of epistemic justice. This
Perspective analyzes how AI challenges established norms of authorship,
introduces conceptual tools for understanding the provenance problem, and
proposes strategies to preserve integrity and fairness in scholarly
communication.

### [351] [An AI-Powered Framework for Analyzing Collective Idea Evolution in Deliberative Assemblies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12577)
*Elinor Poole-Dayan,Deb Roy,Jad Kabbara*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: The paper explores how large language models (LLMs) can be used to analyze and track the progression of ideas and delegate perspectives in deliberative assemblies to better understand their role in policymaking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study is motivated by the need to address societal issues like political polarization, fragmentation, and erosion of trust in institutions, and the lack of empirical evidence on how ideas evolve and are shaped in deliberative assemblies.

Method: The authors developed LLM-based methodologies to analyze transcripts from a tech-enhanced in-person deliberative assembly, focusing on identifying, visualizing expressed suggestions, and reconstructing delegates' evolving perspectives.

Result: The proposed framework offers empirical insights into the evolution and prioritization of policy ideas and the dynamics of delegate perspectives during deliberative processes.

Conclusion: LLMs provide a valuable tool for high-resolution analysis of deliberative processes, enabling a deeper understanding of idea evolution and delegate perspectives within assemblies and contributing to policymaking advancements.

Abstract: In an era of increasing societal fragmentation, political polarization, and
erosion of public trust in institutions, representative deliberative assemblies
are emerging as a promising democratic forum for developing effective policy
outcomes on complex global issues. Despite theoretical attention, there remains
limited empirical work that systematically traces how specific ideas evolve,
are prioritized, or are discarded during deliberation to form policy
recommendations. Addressing these gaps, this work poses two central questions:
(1) How might we trace the evolution and distillation of ideas into concrete
recommendations within deliberative assemblies? (2) How does the deliberative
process shape delegate perspectives and influence voting dynamics over the
course of the assembly? To address these questions, we develop LLM-based
methodologies for empirically analyzing transcripts from a tech-enhanced
in-person deliberative assembly. The framework identifies and visualizes the
space of expressed suggestions. We also empirically reconstruct each delegate's
evolving perspective throughout the assembly. Our methods contribute novel
empirical insights into deliberative processes and demonstrate how LLMs can
surface high-resolution dynamics otherwise invisible in traditional assembly
outputs.

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: The paper analyzes EU's fragmented AI governance, focusing on key documents like the AI Act and HLEG Guidelines using qualitative and quantitative approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to clarify the fragmented landscape of AI governance within the EU and provide insights into how its policies and guidelines have evolved.

Method: The study combines qualitative thematic analysis and quantitative topic modeling with BERTopic on EU AI-related documents from post-2018.

Result: The research uncovers prevalent themes in AI governance and tracks the evolution of EU's policy priorities.

Conclusion: The paper offers a nuanced understanding of AI governance in the EU, highlighting a shift in scope, emphasis, and normativity across its policies and guidelines.

Abstract: The upsurge of policies and guidelines that aim to ensure Artificial
Intelligence (AI) systems are safe and trustworthy has led to a fragmented
landscape of AI governance. The European Union (EU) is a key actor in the
development of such policies and guidelines. Its High-Level Expert Group (HLEG)
issued an influential set of guidelines for trustworthy AI, followed in 2024 by
the adoption of the EU AI Act. While the EU policies and guidelines are
expected to be aligned, they may differ in their scope, areas of emphasis,
degrees of normativity, and priorities in relation to AI. To gain a broad
understanding of AI governance from the EU perspective, we leverage qualitative
thematic analysis approaches to uncover prevalent themes in key EU documents,
including the AI Act and the HLEG Ethics Guidelines. We further employ
quantitative topic modelling approaches, specifically through the use of the
BERTopic model, to enhance the results and increase the document sample to
include EU AI policy documents published post-2018. We present a novel
perspective on EU policies, tracking the evolution of its approach to
addressing AI governance.

*Sandrine R. Schiller,Camilo Miguel Signorelli,Filippos Stamatiou*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: This paper examines how generative AI might transform human-technology interactions and our relationships with ourselves, focusing on its ability to fulfill tasks and predict human behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors are motivated by the urgent need to understand how generative AI systems might not only assist but also anticipate human actions, raising existential and relational concerns.

Method: The authors analyze generative AI's impact across three spheres: externalized output, contextual interactions, and self-relating processes, using theoretical frameworks for relational selves.

Result: Generative AI is increasingly capable of intercepting human initiatives across various spheres, leading to potential changes in human autonomy and self-perception.

Conclusion: Generative AI might redefine human autonomy and self-identity, prompting philosophical reconsiderations about the nature of human-technology relations.

Abstract: Generative AI is changing our way of interacting with technology, others, and
ourselves. Systems such as Microsoft copilot, Gemini and the expected Apple
intelligence still awaits our prompt for action. Yet, it is likely that AI
assistant systems will only become better at predicting our behaviour and
acting on our behalf. Imagine new generations of generative and predictive AI
deciding what you might like best at a new restaurant, picking an outfit that
increases your chances on your date with a partner also chosen by the same or a
similar system. Far from a science fiction scenario, the goal of several
research programs is to build systems capable of assisting us in exactly this
manner. The prospect urges us to rethink human-technology relations, but it
also invites us to question how such systems might change the way we relate to
ourselves. Building on our conception of the relational self, we question the
possible effects of generative AI with respect to what we call the sphere of
externalised output, the contextual sphere and the sphere of self-relating. In
this paper, we attempt to deepen the existential considerations accompanying
the AI revolution by outlining how generative AI enables the fulfilment of
tasks and also increasingly anticipates, i.e. intercepts, our initiatives in
these different spheres.

*Hasin Jawad Ali,Ilhamul Azam,Ajwad Abrar,Md. Kamrul Hasan,Hasan Mahmud*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: This paper introduces CogniAlign, a multi-agent deliberation framework for AI alignment based on moral realism, showcasing transparent and empirically grounded judgments that outperform GPT-4o in moral reasoning tests.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the persistent challenge of aligning artificial intelligence with human moral values, which are abstract, conflicting, and difficult to operationalize.

Method: CogniAlign utilizes a multi-agent deliberation framework involving discipline-specific scientist agents (from neuroscience, psychology, sociology, etc.) to engage in structured discussions. An arbiter synthesizes their arguments into transparent, empirically grounded moral judgments.

Result: CogniAlign consistently outperforms GPT-4o on over sixty moral questions, achieving notable improvements in analytic quality (+16.2 points), breadth (+14.3 points), and depth of explanation (+28.4 points).

Conclusion: Interdisciplinary deliberation via CogniAlign offers a scalable approach for safe and transparent AI alignment, reducing black-box reasoning and deceptive alignment challenges.

Abstract: The challenge of aligning artificial intelligence (AI) with human values
persists due to the abstract and often conflicting nature of moral principles
and the opacity of existing approaches. This paper introduces CogniAlign, a
multi-agent deliberation framework based on naturalistic moral realism, that
grounds moral reasoning in survivability, defined across individual and
collective dimensions, and operationalizes it through structured deliberations
among discipline-specific scientist agents. Each agent, representing
neuroscience, psychology, sociology, and evolutionary biology, provides
arguments and rebuttals that are synthesized by an arbiter into transparent and
empirically anchored judgments. We evaluate CogniAlign on classic and novel
moral questions and compare its outputs against GPT-4o using a five-part
ethical audit framework. Results show that CogniAlign consistently outperforms
the baseline across more than sixty moral questions, with average performance
gains of 16.2 points in analytic quality, 14.3 points in breadth, and 28.4
points in depth of explanation. In the Heinz dilemma, for example, CogniAlign
achieved an overall score of 89.2 compared to GPT-4o's 69.2, demonstrating a
decisive advantage in handling moral reasoning. By reducing black-box reasoning
and avoiding deceptive alignment, CogniAlign highlights the potential of
interdisciplinary deliberation as a scalable pathway for safe and transparent
AI alignment.

*Jamie Cummins*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: The paper discusses the use of synthetic datasets created by large language models for human subjects research, highlighting the impact of analytic choices on sample quality and the lack of a universal configuration for optimal results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The author aims to address the growing use of large language models to generate synthetic datasets ('silicon samples') and investigate the analytic choices influencing their quality, given the potential of these samples to transform human subject research.

Method: The paper maps out analytic choices and tests 252 configurations of silicon samples to evaluate their ability to estimate rank ordering, response distributions, and between-scale correlations.

Result: Findings reveal significant variability across configurations in their performance and inconsistency in quality, with certain configurations excelling in one aspect while underperforming in others.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that there is no single optimal configuration for generating accurate silicon samples and calls for more attention to the risks posed by analytic flexibility in utilizing these synthetic datasets.

Abstract: Social scientists are now using large language models to create "silicon
samples" - synthetic datasets intended to stand in for human respondents, aimed
at revolutionising human subjects research. However, there are many analytic
choices which must be made to produce these samples. Though many of these
choices are defensible, their impact on sample quality is poorly understood. I
map out these analytic choices and demonstrate how a very small number of
decisions can dramatically change the correspondence between silicon samples
and human data. Configurations (N = 252) varied substantially in their capacity
to estimate (i) rank ordering of participants, (ii) response distributions, and
(iii) between-scale correlations. Most critically, configurations were not
consistent in quality: those that performed well on one dimension often
performed poorly on another, implying that there is no "one-size-fits-all"
configuration that optimises the accuracy of these samples. I call for greater
attention to the threat of analytic flexibility in using silicon samples.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the critical concerns about fairness and reliability in LLM-generated peer reviews as these models increasingly assist or automate the review process.

Method: Conducted controlled experiments focusing on sensitive metadata like author affiliation and gender to analyze biases in LLM-generated peer reviews.

Result: Revealed affiliation bias favoring prestigious institutions and subtle gender preferences. Also uncovered implicit biases that are prominent with token-based soft ratings.

Conclusion: LLM-generated peer reviews exhibit biases that may impact fairness and reliability, indicating the need for addressing these issues to maintain equitable academic evaluation.

Abstract: The adoption of large language models (LLMs) is transforming the peer review
process, from assisting reviewers in writing more detailed evaluations to
generating entire reviews automatically. While these capabilities offer
exciting opportunities, they also raise critical concerns about fairness and
reliability. In this paper, we investigate bias in LLM-generated peer reviews
by conducting controlled experiments on sensitive metadata, including author
affiliation and gender. Our analysis consistently shows affiliation bias
favoring institutions highly ranked on common academic rankings. Additionally,
we find some gender preferences, which, even though subtle in magnitude, have
the potential to compound over time. Notably, we uncover implicit biases that
become more evident with token-based soft ratings.

Result: The workflow tackles key reproducibility challenges across different stages of online AI algorithm development.

Conclusion: This approach ensures reproducibility, facilitates scientific discovery, and enables trustworthy algorithm refinement over iterative deployments.

Abstract: Online artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms are an important component of
digital health interventions. These online algorithms are designed to
continually learn and improve their performance as streaming data is collected
on individuals. Deploying online AI presents a key challenge: balancing
adaptability of online AI with reproducibility. Online AI in digital
interventions is a rapidly evolving area, driven by advances in algorithms,
sensors, software, and devices. Digital health intervention development and
deployment is a continuous process, where implementation - including the AI
decision-making algorithm - is interspersed with cycles of re-development and
optimization. Each deployment informs the next, making iterative deployment a
defining characteristic of this field. This iterative nature underscores the
importance of reproducibility: data collected across deployments must be
accurately stored to have scientific utility, algorithm behavior must be
auditable, and results must be comparable over time to facilitate scientific
discovery and trustworthy refinement. This paper proposes a reproducible
scientific workflow for developing, deploying, and analyzing online AI
decision-making algorithms in digital health interventions. Grounded in
practical experience from multiple real-world deployments, this workflow
addresses key challenges to reproducibility across all phases of the online AI
algorithm development life-cycle.

Motivation: To improve understanding and provide a more precise definition of 'value alignment' in AI research.

Method: The paper uses thematic analysis on 172 research articles concerning value alignment in artificial intelligence.

Result: Six themes emerge: drivers & approaches, challenges, values in alignment, cognitive processes, human-agent teaming, designing value-aligned systems.

Conclusion: The paper defines value alignment as an ongoing process between humans and AI, addressing abstract values, cognitive limits, and conflicting ethical/political demands, and highlights future research opportunities.

Abstract: Background: Value alignment in computer science research is often used to
refer to the process of aligning artificial intelligence with humans, but the
way the phrase is used often lacks precision. Objectives: In this paper, we
conduct a systematic literature review to advance the understanding of value
alignment in artificial intelligence by characterising the topic in the context
of its research literature. We use this to suggest a more precise definition of
the term. Methods: We analyse 172 value alignment research articles that have
been published in recent years and synthesise their content using thematic
analyses. Results: Our analysis leads to six themes: value alignment drivers &
approaches; challenges in value alignment; values in value alignment; cognitive
processes in humans and AI; human-agent teaming; and designing and developing
value-aligned systems. Conclusions: By analysing these themes in the context of
the literature we define value alignment as an ongoing process between humans
and autonomous agents that aims to express and implement abstract values in
diverse contexts, while managing the cognitive limits of both humans and AI
agents and also balancing the conflicting ethical and political demands
generated by the values in different groups. Our analysis gives rise to a set
of research challenges and opportunities in the field of value alignment for

### [359] [Efficient Last-Iterate Convergence in Regret Minimization via Adaptive Reward Transformation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13653)
*Hang Ren,Yulin Wu,Shuhan Qi,Jiajia Zhang,Xiaozhen Sun,Tianzi Ma,Xuan Wang*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: This paper proposes adaptive techniques to improve convergence speed and reliability in regret minimization methods used in game theory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for regret minimization rely heavily on average strategy computation, which is resource-intensive and error-prone. Reward Transformation frameworks, although promising, require manual tuning, making them impractical.

Method: The authors introduce adaptive methods that dynamically adjust parameters, enhancing exploration-exploitation balance and improving regret accumulation during Reward Transformation.

Result: The adaptive techniques led to faster convergence and better performance compared to state-of-the-art algorithms in solving Normal-Form and Extensive-Form Games.

Conclusion: Adaptive methods improve theoretical consistency and practical applicability of reward transformations in regret minimization, achieving enhanced last-iterate and linear convergence.

Abstract: Regret minimization is a powerful method for finding Nash equilibria in
Normal-Form Games (NFGs) and Extensive-Form Games (EFGs), but it typically
guarantees convergence only for the average strategy. However, computing the
average strategy requires significant computational resources or introduces
additional errors, limiting its practical applicability. The Reward
Transformation (RT) framework was introduced to regret minimization to achieve
last-iterate convergence through reward function regularization. However, it
faces practical challenges: its performance is highly sensitive to manually
tuned parameters, which often deviate from theoretical convergence conditions,
leading to slow convergence, oscillations, or stagnation in local optima.
  Inspired by previous work, we propose an adaptive technique to address these
issues, ensuring better consistency between theoretical guarantees and
practical performance for RT Regret Matching (RTRM), RT Counterfactual Regret
Minimization (RTCFR), and their variants in solving NFGs and EFGs more
effectively. Our adaptive methods dynamically adjust parameters, balancing
exploration and exploitation while improving regret accumulation, ultimately
enhancing asymptotic last-iterate convergence and achieving linear convergence.
Experimental results demonstrate that our methods significantly accelerate
convergence, outperforming state-of-the-art algorithms.

*Philip Jordan,Maryam Kamgarpour*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: The paper investigates Nash equilibria in continuous static games with shared coupling constraints, establishing their existence and proposing a computational method using gradient ascent with adaptive stepsizes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior results on Nash equilibria were limited by strong assumptions like joint convexity of the feasible set. The paper seeks to address games with playerwise concave utilities and constraints under weaker conditions.

Method: Topological fixed point theory was used to prove the existence of equilibria. Computationally, log barrier regularized gradient ascent is employed to find approximate Nash equilibria under potential function assumptions.

Result: The method converges to an $
\epsilon$-approximate constrained Nash equilibrium within $
\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-3})$ iterations, accounting for nonconvex feasible sets.

Conclusion: The work expands the scope of Nash equilibria studies to games with weaker structural assumptions, while offering computational techniques with provable convergence rates.

Abstract: We study the existence and computation of Nash equilibria in continuous
static games where the players' admissible strategies are subject to shared
coupling constraints, i.e., constraints that depend on their \emph{joint}
strategies. Specifically, we focus on a class of games characterized by
playerwise concave utilities and playerwise concave constraints. Prior results
on the existence of Nash equilibria are not applicable to this class, as they
rely on strong assumptions such as joint convexity of the feasible set. By
leveraging topological fixed point theory and novel structural insights into
the contractibility of feasible sets under playerwise concave constraints, we
give an existence proof for Nash equilibria under weaker conditions. Having
established existence, we then focus on the computation of Nash equilibria via
independent gradient methods under the additional assumption that the utilities
admit a potential function. To account for the possibly nonconvex feasible
region, we employ a log barrier regularized gradient ascent with adaptive
stepsizes. Starting from an initial feasible strategy profile and under exact
gradient feedback, the proposed method converges to an $\epsilon$-approximate
constrained Nash equilibrium within $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-3})$ iterations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To resolve challenges in selecting regularization parameters for fused lasso and establish robust inference methods for identifying change-points.

Method: The authors extend the Spacing Test framework to fused lasso and analyze its solution path using a LARS-type algorithm. They derive conditional $p$-values for change-points and carry out comparisons via numerical experiments.

Result: The proposed method controls type I error effectively and shows high detection power, outperforming approaches like AIC, BIC, and cross-validation.

Conclusion: This study provides a sound and computationally efficient solution for structured signal estimation, enhancing change-point detection capabilities in fused lasso applications.

Abstract: This study addresses the unresolved problem of selecting the regularization
parameter in the fused lasso. In particular, we extend the framework of the
Spacing Test proposed by Tibshirani et al. to the fused lasso, providing a
theoretical foundation for post-selection inference by characterizing the
selection event as a polyhedral constraint. Based on the analysis of the
solution path of the fused lasso using a LARS-type algorithm, we derive exact
conditional $p$-values for the selected change-points. Our method broadens the
applicability of the Spacing Test from the standard lasso to fused penalty
structures. Furthermore, through numerical experiments comparing the proposed
method with sequential versions of AIC and BIC as well as cross-validation, we
demonstrate that the proposed approach properly controls the type I error while
achieving high detection power. This work offers a theoretically sound and
computationally practical solution for parameter selection and post-selection
inference in structured signal estimation problems. Keywords: Fused Lasso,

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: The paper introduces IPI, a novel framework to address blockwise missing data, improving efficiency and validity compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for handling blockwise missingness have limitations like bias, inefficiency, or lack of inferential guarantees.

Method: IPI combines blackbox imputation with bias correction using fully observed data, leveraging prediction-powered and semiparametric inference techniques.

Result: Simulation studies and a clinical application showed that IPI enhances subpopulation efficiency and maintains statistical validity better than alternative methods.

Conclusion: IPI offers an efficient, valid solution to blockwise missing data challenges, outperforming both doubly robust estimators and naive imputation approaches.

Abstract: Modern multi-modal and multi-site data frequently suffer from blockwise
missingness, where subsets of features are missing for groups of individuals,
creating complex patterns that challenge standard inference methods. Existing
approaches have critical limitations: complete-case analysis discards
informative data and is potentially biased; doubly robust estimators for
non-monotone missingness-where the missingness patterns are not nested subsets
of one another-can be theoretically efficient but lack closed-form solutions
and often fail to scale; and blackbox imputation can leverage partially
observed data to improve efficiency but provides no inferential guarantees when
misspecified. To address the limitations of these existing methods, we propose
imputation-powered inference (IPI), a model-lean framework that combines the
flexibility of blackbox imputation with bias correction using fully observed
data, drawing on ideas from prediction-powered inference and semiparametric
inference. IPI enables valid and efficient M-estimation under missing
completely at random (MCAR) blockwise missingness and improves subpopulation
inference under a weaker assumption we formalize as first-moment MCAR, for
which we also provide practical diagnostics. Simulation studies and a clinical
application demonstrate that IPI may substantially improve subpopulation
efficiency relative to complete-case analysis, while maintaining statistical
validity in settings where both doubly robust estimators and naive imputation
fail to achieve nominal coverage.

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: This paper addresses the challenge of valid inference when working with adaptively collected data, proposing a method compatible with potentially misspecified models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical statistical methods often fail in adaptively collected data scenarios, and most solutions assume the correctness of the model specification.

Method: The authors introduce an inference method using M-estimators with variance stabilization through machine learning to handle adaptively collected and potentially misspecified data.

Result: The proposed method ensures valid confidence sets and maintains type I error control, even in unstable adaptive scenarios, outperforming existing methods in misspecified cases.

Conclusion: The method is robust for inference in adaptive data collection settings, providing valid outcomes even under model misspecification or unstable adaptive policies.

Abstract: When data are collected adaptively, such as in bandit algorithms, classical
statistical approaches such as ordinary least squares and $M$-estimation will
often fail to achieve asymptotic normality. Although recent lines of work have
modified the classical approaches to ensure valid inference on adaptively
collected data, most of these works assume that the model is correctly
specified. We propose a method that provides valid inference for M-estimators
that use adaptively collected bandit data with a (possibly) misspecified
working model. A key ingredient in our approach is the use of flexible machine
learning approaches to stabilize the variance induced by adaptive data
collection. A major novelty is that our procedure enables the construction of
valid confidence sets even in settings where treatment policies are unstable
and non-converging, such as when there is no unique optimal arm and standard
bandit algorithms are used. Empirical results on semi-synthetic datasets
constructed from the Osteoarthritis Initiative demonstrate that the method
maintains type I error control, while existing methods for inference in
adaptive settings do not cover in the misspecified case.

*Giacomo Barzon,Daniel M. Busiello,Giorgio Nicoletti*

Main category: cond-mat.stat-mech

TL;DR: Neural circuits achieve computational flexibility by leveraging timescale-dependent plasticity modulation for optimized information encoding and sequence discrimination.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how diverse behaviors emerge from limited biological mechanisms in neural circuits.

Method: Developed an information-theoretic framework with a stochastic model incorporating dynamic plasticity and time-varying stimuli.

Result: Long-term plasticity optimizes information encoding, while short-term plasticity aids sequence discrimination; optimal variability exists for sequence discrimination.

Conclusion: Plasticity modulation timescales fundamentally shape neural activity representations and computational properties, offering insights into complex neural computations.

Abstract: Neural circuits exhibit remarkable computational flexibility, enabling
adaptive responses to noisy and ever-changing environmental cues. A fundamental
question in neuroscience concerns how a wide range of behaviors can emerge from
a relatively limited set of underlying biological mechanisms. In particular,
the interaction between activities of neuronal populations and plasticity
modulation of synaptic connections may endow neural circuits with a variety of
functional responses when coordinated over different characteristic timescales.
Here, we develop an information-theoretic framework to quantitatively explore
this idea. We consider a stochastic model for neural activities that
incorporates the presence of a coupled dynamic plasticity and time-varying
stimuli. We show that long-term plasticity modulations play the functional role
of steering neural activities towards a regime of optimal information encoding.
By constructing the associated phase diagram, we demonstrate that either
Hebbian or anti-Hebbian plasticity may become optimal strategies depending on
how the external input is projected to the target neural populations.
Conversely, short-term plasticity enables the discrimination of temporal
ordering in sequences of inputs by navigating the emergent multistable
attractor landscape. By allowing a degree of variability in external stimuli,
we also highlight the existence of an optimal variability for sequence
discrimination at a given plasticity strength. In summary, the timescale of
plasticity modulation shapes how inputs are represented in neural activities,
thereby fundamentally altering the computational properties of the system. Our
approach offers a unifying information-theoretic perspective of the role of
plasticity, paving the way for a quantitative understanding of the emergence of
complex computations in coupled neuronal-synaptic dynamics.

TL;DR: This paper compares low-code platforms and custom-coded solutions for developing educational course chatbots, evaluating them based on ease of use, customization, data privacy, and scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of developing effective course chatbots in education by evaluating different approaches in light of the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs).

Method: The study uses technical frameworks like Prompt engineering, Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and personalization techniques to develop and analyze chatbot performance, scalability, and user experience.

Result: Low-code platforms simplify prototyping but lack customization and scalability, while custom-coded solutions provide higher control but demand technical expertise. Both approaches meet key principles like adaptive feedback loops.

Conclusion: A framework is provided to guide the selection between development strategies, emphasizing institutional goals. Hybrid solutions combining accessibility and modular customization are suggested for future research.

Abstract: This full research-to-practice paper explores approaches for developing
course chatbots by comparing low-code platforms and custom-coded solutions in
educational contexts. With the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4
and LLaMA, LLM-based chatbots are being integrated into teaching workflows to
automate tasks, provide assistance, and offer scalable support. However,
selecting the optimal development strategy requires balancing ease of use,
customization, data privacy, and scalability. This study compares two
development approaches: low-code platforms like AnythingLLM and Botpress, with
custom-coded solutions using LangChain, FAISS, and FastAPI. The research uses
Prompt engineering, Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and personalization
to evaluate chatbot prototypes across technical performance, scalability, and
user experience. Findings indicate that while low-code platforms enable rapid
prototyping, they face limitations in customization and scaling, while
custom-coded systems offer more control but require significant technical
expertise. Both approaches successfully implement key research principles such
as adaptive feedback loops and conversational continuity. The study provides a
framework for selecting the appropriate development strategy based on
institutional goals and resources. Future work will focus on hybrid solutions
that combine low-code accessibility with modular customization and incorporate
multimodal input for intelligent tutoring systems.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: This paper integrates large language models into virtual reality to simulate psychologically plausible virtual patients, aiming to improve complex interpersonal skills training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need to enhance VR's capability in training complex interpersonal skills, particularly in medical education, where communication is essential.

Method: A modular framework was introduced to create virtual patients with coherent personalities and clinical data, and evaluated with licensed physicians through simulated consultations in a mixed-method study.

Result: The system was deemed feasible and perceived as a rewarding and effective training tool by physicians.

Conclusion: The framework is validated and provides principles like the realism-verbosity paradox for advancing socially intelligent VR training environments.

Abstract: While virtual reality (VR) excels at simulating physical environments, its
effectiveness for training complex interpersonal skills is limited by a lack of
psychologically plausible virtual humans. This is a critical gap in high-stakes
domains like medical education, where communication is a core competency. This
paper introduces a framework that integrates large language models (LLMs) into
immersive VR to create medically coherent virtual patients with distinct,
consistent personalities, built on a modular architecture that decouples
personality from clinical data. We evaluated our system in a mixed-method,
within-subjects study with licensed physicians who engaged in simulated
consultations. Results demonstrate that the approach is not only feasible but
is also perceived by physicians as a highly rewarding and effective training
enhancement. Furthermore, our analysis uncovers critical design principles,
including a ``realism-verbosity paradox" where less communicative agents can
seem more artificial, and the need for challenges to be perceived as authentic
to be instructive. This work provides a validated framework and key insights
for developing the next generation of socially intelligent VR training
environments.

TL;DR: The paper explores using large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT to generate synthetic smartphone usage datasets, comparing prompt strategies to ensure quality while addressing challenges like diversity and fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world smartphone usage data collection faces challenges such as high costs, privacy concerns, skewed samples, and biases, necessitating alternative methods for data generation.

Method: The study conducted a case study comparing four prompt strategies for synthetic data generation, leveraging prompt detail (user persona description and results characteristics) and inclusion of seed data.

Result: Detailed prompts showed the most promising results for generating structured and behaviorally plausible smartphone usage data, though challenges remain in capturing human behavioral nuances and balancing fidelity with diversity.

Conclusion: LLMs offer a feasible alternative for generating synthetic smartphone datasets for specific use cases, but limitations in data diversity and the need for use-case-specific evaluation metrics highlight the potential for improvement through future research and diverse seed data.

Abstract: Smartphone usage data can provide valuable insights for understanding
interaction with technology and human behavior. However, collecting
large-scale, in-the-wild smartphone usage logs is challenging due to high
costs, privacy concerns, under representative user samples and biases like
non-response that can skew results. These challenges call for exploring
alternative approaches to obtain smartphone usage datasets. In this context,
large language models (LLMs) such as Open AI's ChatGPT present a novel approach
for synthetic smartphone usage data generation, addressing limitations of
real-world data collection. We describe a case study on how four prompt
strategies influenced the quality of generated smartphone usage data. We
contribute with insights on prompt design and measures of data quality,
reporting a prompting strategy comparison combining two factors, prompt level
of detail (describing a user persona, describing the expected results
characteristics) and seed data inclusion (with versus without an initial real
usage example). Our findings suggest that using LLMs to generate structured and
behaviorally plausible smartphone use datasets is feasible for some use cases,
especially when using detailed prompts. Challenges remain in capturing diverse
nuances of human behavioral patterns in a single synthetic dataset, and
evaluating tradeoffs between data fidelity and diversity, suggesting the need
for use-case-specific evaluation metrics and future research with more diverse
seed data and different LLM models.

### [368] [Artificial neural networks ensemble methodology to predict significant wave height](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14020)
*Felipe Crivellaro Minuzzi,Leandro Farina*

Main category: physics.ao-ph

TL;DR: The paper proposes a machine learning-based ensemble system for forecasting significant wave heights along the Brazilian coast using various neural network architectures. The method yields forecasts with up to 88% accuracy and improves error metrics compared to NOAA models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the chaotic nature of ocean wave modeling by leveraging machine learning to enhance the accuracy and computational efficiency of significant wave height predictions.

Method: The methodology involves creating an ensemble of various neural network architectures (MLP, RNN, LSTM, CNN, and CNN-LSTM) trained on NOAA's reforecast data to predict the residual between observed data and numerical model outputs. A novel approach for training and target data creation is also introduced.

Result: The machine learning framework achieved an average forecast accuracy of 80%, peaking at 88% in the best scenario, with a 5% reduction in error metrics compared to NOAA's numerical models, alongside lower computational costs.

Conclusion: The proposed ensemble strategy combining multiple neural networks effectively enhances ocean wave forecasting accuracy and reduces computational demands, showcasing its practical efficacy over traditional methods.

Abstract: The forecast of wave variables are important for several applications that
depend on a better description of the ocean state. Due to the chaotic behaviour
of the differential equations which model this problem, a well know strategy to
overcome the difficulties is basically to run several simulations, by for
instance, varying the initial condition, and averaging the result of each of
these, creating an ensemble. Moreover, in the last few years, considering the
amount of available data and the computational power increase, machine learning
algorithms have been applied as surrogate to traditional numerical models,
yielding comparative or better results. In this work, we present a methodology
to create an ensemble of different artificial neural networks architectures,
namely, MLP, RNN, LSTM, CNN and a hybrid CNN-LSTM, which aims to predict
significant wave height on six different locations in the Brazilian coast. The
networks are trained using NOAA's numerical reforecast data and target the
residual between observational data and the numerical model output. A new
strategy to create the training and target datasets is demonstrated. Results
show that our framework is capable of producing high efficient forecast, with
an average accuracy of $80\%$, that can achieve up to $88\%$ in the best case
scenario, which means $5\%$ reduction in error metrics if compared to NOAA's
numerical model, and a increasingly reduction of computational cost.

*Jeongjin,Park,Grant Bruer,Huseyin Tuna Erdinc,Abhinav Prakash Gahlot,Felix J. Herrmann*

Main category: physics.comp-ph

TL;DR: The paper proposes DeFINO, a reduced-order training framework for neural operators, which improves gradient accuracy in fluid-flow simulations using Fisher Information Matrix-guided sensitivity analysis, offering computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the computational challenges of incorporating explicit Jacobians for surrogate models in tasks like optimization and Bayesian inference, where gradient accuracy is critical.

Method: DeFINO combines Fourier Neural Operators with a derivative-informed training strategy that projects Jacobian information onto dominant eigen-directions determined by the Fisher Information Matrix, reducing computation costs.

Result: Through synthetic experiments in subsurface multi-phase fluid-flow, DeFINO demonstrated improved gradient accuracy and scalable solutions for inversion problems, maintaining reliable fluid dynamic predictions with less computation.

Conclusion: DeFINO effectively balances gradient accuracy and computational efficiency, making it a practical tool for real-world, computationally intensive fluid-flow inversion problems.

Abstract: Neural operators have emerged as cost-effective surrogates for expensive
fluid-flow simulators, particularly in computationally intensive tasks such as
permeability inversion from time-lapse seismic data, and uncertainty
quantification. In these applications, the fidelity of the surrogate's
gradients with respect to system parameters is crucial, as the accuracy of
downstream tasks, such as optimization and Bayesian inference, relies directly
on the quality of the derivative information. Recent advances in
physics-informed methods have leveraged derivative information to improve
surrogate accuracy. However, incorporating explicit Jacobians can become
computationally prohibitive, as the complexity typically scales quadratically
with the number of input parameters. To address this limitation, we propose
DeFINO (Derivative-based Fisher-score Informed Neural Operator), a
reduced-order, derivative-informed training framework. DeFINO integrates
Fourier neural operators (FNOs) with a novel derivative-based training strategy
guided by the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM). By projecting Jacobians onto
dominant eigen-directions identified by the FIM, DeFINO captures critical
sensitivity information directly informed by observational data, significantly
reducing computational expense. We validate DeFINO through synthetic
experiments in the context of subsurface multi-phase fluid-flow, demonstrating
improvements in gradient accuracy while maintaining robust forward predictions
of underlying fluid dynamics. These results highlight DeFINO's potential to
offer practical, scalable solutions for inversion problems in complex
real-world scenarios, all at substantially reduced computational cost.

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: The paper integrates AI and supervisory control for optimizing the precise formation of spacecraft in the VTXO mission, showcasing reduced energy consumption and improved accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the precision and efficiency of spacecraft formation for the VTXO mission, aimed at advanced X-ray observation.

Method: Utilizes supervisory adaptive control, deep neural networks, timed automata, and Monte Carlo simulations for planning, optimizing, and ensuring robust mission criteria.

Result: Achieved lower energy consumption and higher mission accuracy, addressing uncertainties and disturbances in spacecraft formation.

Conclusion: AI-driven approaches effectively ensure precision in spacecraft formation, optimize resource use, and justify real-time mission decisions.

Abstract: We use artificial intelligence (AI) and supervisory adaptive control systems
to plan and optimize the mission of precise spacecraft formation. Machine
learning and robust control enhance the efficiency of spacecraft precision
formation of the Virtual Telescope for X-ray Observation (VTXO) space mission.
VTXO is a precise formation of two separate spacecraft making a virtual
telescope with a one-kilometer focal length. One spacecraft carries the lens
and the other spacecraft holds the camera to observe high-energy space objects
in the X-ray domain with 55 milli-arcsecond angular resolution accuracy. Timed
automata for supervisory control, Monte Carlo simulations for stability and
robustness evaluation, and integration of deep neural networks for optimal
estimation of mission parameters, satisfy the high precision mission criteria.
We integrate deep neural networks with a constrained, non-convex dynamic
optimization pipeline to predict optimal mission parameters, ensuring precision
mission criteria are met. AI framework provides explainability by predicting
the resulting energy consumption and mission error for a given set of mission
parameters. It allows for transparent, justifiable, and real-time trade-offs, a
capability not present in traditional adaptive controllers. The results show
reductions in energy consumption and improved mission accuracy, demonstrating
the capability of the system to address dynamic uncertainties and disturbances.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the sensitivity of gravitational wave observatories at low frequencies, enabling the study of intermediate-mass black holes, binary black hole eccentricity, and early warnings for multi-messenger observations.

Method: The researchers used Deep Loop Shaping, a reinforcement learning approach that optimizes frequency domain rewards, to reduce noise caused by mirror stabilization control systems.

Result: Their controller reduced control noise in the critical 10–30Hz frequency band by over 30x and up to 100x in certain sub-bands, exceeding design goals.

Conclusion: Deep Loop Shaping demonstrates significant potential to improve gravitational wave observatory sensitivity, as well as broader applications in instrumentation and control systems.

Abstract: Improved low-frequency sensitivity of gravitational wave observatories would
unlock study of intermediate-mass black hole mergers, binary black hole
eccentricity, and provide early warnings for multi-messenger observations of
binary neutron star mergers. Today's mirror stabilization control injects
harmful noise, constituting a major obstacle to sensitivity improvements. We
eliminated this noise through Deep Loop Shaping, a reinforcement learning
method using frequency domain rewards. We proved our methodology on the LIGO
Livingston Observatory (LLO). Our controller reduced control noise in the
10--30Hz band by over 30x, and up to 100x in sub-bands surpassing the design
goal motivated by the quantum limit. These results highlight the potential of
Deep Loop Shaping to improve current and future GW observatories, and more
broadly instrumentation and control systems.

### [373] [Agentic JWT: A Secure Delegation Protocol for Autonomous AI Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13597)
*Abhishek Goswami*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces Agentic JWT (A-JWT), a secure token framework for agent-based LLM applications, addressing vulnerabilities like privilege expansion and impersonation in agent orchestration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: OAuth 2.0's assumptions of deterministic clients fail in stochastic, autonomous LLM agents, leading to potential vulnerabilities such as unauthorized privilege expansion or impersonation.

Method: The authors propose Agentic JWT (A-JWT), which issues verifiable intent tokens binding actions to user intent and workflow steps. It leverages a hash-based identity system for agents and includes a client library for runtime verification, token management, and preventing impersonation.

Result: Implemented a Python proof-of-concept showing effective blocking of replay attacks, impersonation, and scope violations with minimal computational overhead.

Conclusion: The proposed A-JWT framework strengthens security for agentic LLM applications, offering a feasible, zero-trust solution aligning with OAuth agent discussions. A formal performance and security analysis will be provided in future work.

Abstract: Autonomous LLM agents can issue thousands of API calls per hour without human
oversight. OAuth 2.0 assumes deterministic clients, but in agentic settings
stochastic reasoning, prompt injection, or multi-agent orchestration can
silently expand privileges.
  We introduce Agentic JWT (A-JWT), a dual-faceted intent token that binds each
agent's action to verifiable user intent and, optionally, to a specific
workflow step. A-JWT carries an agent's identity as a one-way checksum hash
derived from its prompt, tools and configuration, and a chained delegation
assertion to prove which downstream agent may execute a given task, and
per-agent proof-of-possession keys to prevent replay and in-process
impersonation. We define a new authorization mechanism and add a lightweight
client shim library that self-verifies code at run time, mints intent tokens,
tracks workflow steps and derives keys, thus enabling secure agent identity and
separation even within a single process.
  We illustrate a comprehensive threat model for agentic applications,
implement a Python proof-of-concept and show functional blocking of
scope-violating requests, replay, impersonation, and prompt-injection pathways
with sub-millisecond overhead on commodity hardware. The design aligns with
ongoing OAuth agent discussions and offers a drop-in path toward zero-trust
guarantees for agentic applications. A comprehensive performance and security
evaluation with experimental results will appear in our forthcoming journal
publication

TL;DR: RAGOrigin introduces a black-box framework to identify deceptive texts in RAG systems, excelling in various datasets and dynamic attack scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve defenses for RAG systems against poisoning attacks by pinpointing the sources of misinformation.

Method: Develop a black-box responsibility attribution framework evaluating retrieval ranking, semantic relevance, and response influence, coupled with unsupervised clustering.

Result: Evaluated across seven datasets and fifteen attack scenarios, RAGOrigin outperformed baselines in identifying poisoned content under noisy conditions.

Conclusion: RAGOrigin provides a reliable solution for tracing misleading knowledge origins in RAG systems, enhancing security and detection efforts.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) integrates external knowledge into large
language models to improve response quality. However, recent work has shown
that RAG systems are highly vulnerable to poisoning attacks, where malicious
texts are inserted into the knowledge database to influence model outputs.
While several defenses have been proposed, they are often circumvented by more
adaptive or sophisticated attacks.
  This paper presents RAGOrigin, a black-box responsibility attribution
framework designed to identify which texts in the knowledge database are
responsible for misleading or incorrect generations. Our method constructs a
focused attribution scope tailored to each misgeneration event and assigns a
responsibility score to each candidate text by evaluating its retrieval
ranking, semantic relevance, and influence on the generated response. The
system then isolates poisoned texts using an unsupervised clustering method. We
evaluate RAGOrigin across seven datasets and fifteen poisoning attacks,
including newly developed adaptive poisoning strategies and multi-attacker
scenarios. Our approach outperforms existing baselines in identifying poisoned
content and remains robust under dynamic and noisy conditions. These results
suggest that RAGOrigin provides a practical and effective solution for tracing
the origins of corrupted knowledge in RAG systems.

*Ozer Ozturk,Busra Buyuktanir,Gozde Karatas Baydogmus,Kazim Yildiz*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper examines privacy concerns in federated learning while using differential privacy to mitigate inference attack risks, analyzing the trade-off between privacy and model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Federated learning raises privacy and security concerns because attackers can exploit trained models to infer sensitive training data.

Method: The study uses federated learning with the duCBA aggregation method and employs differential privacy with the Randomized Response technique to protect data.

Result: Lower epsilon values increase privacy but reduce accuracy and introduce class prediction imbalances, highlighting a fundamental trade-off between privacy and performance.

Conclusion: An optimal balance between privacy and performance must be found for federated learning frameworks, as higher privacy may compromise practical outcomes like accuracy.

Abstract: Machine learning models used for distributed architectures consisting of
servers and clients require large amounts of data to achieve high accuracy.
Data obtained from clients are collected on a central server for model
training. However, storing data on a central server raises concerns about
security and privacy. To address this issue, a federated learning architecture
has been proposed. In federated learning, each client trains a local model
using its own data. The trained models are periodically transmitted to the
central server. The server then combines the received models using federated
aggregation algorithms to obtain a global model. This global model is
distributed back to the clients, and the process continues in a cyclical
manner. Although preventing data from leaving the clients enhances security,
certain concerns still remain. Attackers can perform inference attacks on the
obtained models to approximate the training dataset, potentially causing data
leakage. In this study, differential privacy was applied to address the
aforementioned security vulnerability, and a performance analysis was
conducted. The Data-Unaware Classification Based on Association (duCBA)
algorithm was used as the federated aggregation method. Differential privacy
was implemented on the data using the Randomized Response technique, and the
trade-off between security and performance was examined under different epsilon
values. As the epsilon value decreased, the model accuracy declined, and class
prediction imbalances were observed. This indicates that higher levels of
privacy do not always lead to practical outcomes and that the balance between
security and performance must be carefully considered.

### [376] [Generative AI Pipeline for Interactive Prompt-driven 2D-to-3D Vascular Reconstruction for Fontan Geometries from Contrast-Enhanced X-Ray Fluoroscopy Imaging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13372)
*Prahlad G Menon*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper develops an AI pipeline to process angiograms into 3D-suitable geometries for computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and surgical planning in Fontan palliation cases, leveraging large transformer-based models to enhance imaging and provide hemodynamic insights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fontan palliation cases, dealing with univentricular congenital heart disease, often lack adequate imaging techniques to capture complex flow patterns and geometries needed for CFD and surgical planning. Conventional 2D imaging, like fluoroscopic angiography, falls short in providing this essential 3D information.

Method: A multi-step AI pipeline using Google's Gemini 2.5 and Tencent's Hunyuan3D-2mini neural architectures was developed. This process involved image preprocessing, vascular segmentation, contrast enhancement, artifact removal, and flow visualization to generate stereolithography-compatible 3D files.

Result: The AI pipeline successfully created anatomically accurate 2D projections refined over 16 iterative steps and transformed these into enhanced 3D geometries. The analysis identified key hemodynamic patterns, such as stagnation zones, in under 15 minutes of processing time.

Conclusion: The study showcases the clinical potential of using AI to derive CFD-suitable 3D geometries and preliminary flow visualizations from routine 2D imaging data. This could democratize advanced hemodynamic planning, although iterative refinements remain necessary for accuracy.

Abstract: Fontan palliation for univentricular congenital heart disease progresses to
hemodynamic failure with complex flow patterns poorly characterized by
conventional 2D imaging. Current assessment relies on fluoroscopic angiography,
providing limited 3D geometric information essential for computational fluid
dynamics (CFD) analysis and surgical planning.
  A multi-step AI pipeline was developed utilizing Google's Gemini 2.5 Flash
(2.5B parameters) for systematic, iterative processing of fluoroscopic
angiograms through transformer-based neural architecture. The pipeline
encompasses medical image preprocessing, vascular segmentation, contrast
enhancement, artifact removal, and virtual hemodynamic flow visualization
within 2D projections. Final views were processed through Tencent's
Hunyuan3D-2mini (384M parameters) for stereolithography file generation.
  The pipeline successfully generated geometrically optimized 2D projections
from single-view angiograms after 16 processing steps using a custom web
interface. Initial iterations contained hallucinated vascular features
requiring iterative refinement to achieve anatomically faithful
representations. Final projections demonstrated accurate preservation of
complex Fontan geometry with enhanced contrast suitable for 3D conversion.
AI-generated virtual flow visualization identified stagnation zones in central
connections and flow patterns in branch arteries. Complete processing required
under 15 minutes with second-level API response times.
  This approach demonstrates clinical feasibility of generating CFD-suitable
geometries from routine angiographic data, enabling 3D generation and rapid
virtual flow visualization for cursory insights prior to full CFD simulation.
While requiring refinement cycles for accuracy, this establishes foundation for
democratizing advanced geometric and hemodynamic analysis using readily
available imaging data.

TL;DR: This paper introduces PREDICT-GBM, a comprehensive dataset and pipeline designed to enhance the development and evaluation of computational glioblastoma growth models for personalized radiation therapy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the gap in patient-specific radiation treatment due to conventional therapy's failure to account for unique anatomical and biological tumor migration patterns.

Method: The authors developed PREDICT-GBM, which integrates an expert-curated dataset of 255 subjects and facilitates systematic benchmarking of glioblastoma growth models.

Result: Personalized radiation plans based on tumor growth predictions performed better in covering recurrences than conventional uniform margin approaches in two evaluated models.

Conclusion: PREDICT-GBM provides a robust platform to advance and validate glioblastoma tumor growth modeling, aiming to improve clinical adoption and patient outcomes.

Abstract: Glioblastoma is the most prevalent primary brain malignancy, distinguished by
its highly invasive behavior and exceptionally high rates of recurrence.
Conventional radiation therapy, which employs uniform treatment margins, fails
to account for patient-specific anatomical and biological factors that
critically influence tumor cell migration. To address this limitation, numerous
computational models of glioblastoma growth have been developed, enabling
generation of tumor cell distribution maps extending beyond radiographically
visible regions and thus informing more precise treatment strategies. However,
despite encouraging preliminary findings, the clinical adoption of these growth
models remains limited. To bridge this translational gap and accelerate both
model development and clinical validation, we introduce PREDICT-GBM, a
comprehensive integrated pipeline and dataset for modeling and evaluation. This
platform enables systematic benchmarking of state-of-the-art tumor growth
models using an expert-curated clinical dataset comprising 255 subjects with
complete tumor segmentations and tissue characterization maps. Our analysis
demonstrates that personalized radiation treatment plans derived from tumor
growth predictions achieved superior recurrence coverage compared to
conventional uniform margin approaches for two of the evaluated models. This
work establishes a robust platform for advancing and systematically evaluating
cutting-edge tumor growth modeling approaches, with the ultimate goal of
facilitating clinical translation and improving patient outcomes.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper presents a framework for reconstructing 3D vessel trees from biplanar X-ray images using image segmentation, motion phase matching, and a geometric reconstruction algorithm, achieving improved accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance visualization in cardiac interventions by providing accurate 3D reconstruction of coronary vessels from X-ray images, addressing limitations in traditional methods.

Method: The framework employs automatic video segmentation for semantic classification, motion phase matching to align respiratory and cardiac phases, and a novel geometric reconstruction algorithm using intersection of 3D surfaces.

Result: Segmentation accuracy of 0.703 and reprojection errors of 0.62mm +/- 0.38mm were achieved on the test sets, validating the method's effectiveness.

Conclusion: The proposed approach simplifies the 3D reconstruction workflow, improves accuracy, and shows promise for aiding cardiac interventions through better visualization of vessel anatomy.

Abstract: X-ray angiography is widely used in cardiac interventions to visualize
coronary vessels, assess integrity, detect stenoses and guide treatment. We
propose a framework for reconstructing 3D vessel trees from biplanar X-ray
images which are extracted from two X-ray videos captured at different C-arm
angles. The proposed framework consists of three main components: image
segmentation, motion phase matching, and 3D reconstruction. An automatic video
segmentation method for X-ray angiography to enable semantic segmentation for
image segmentation and motion phase matching. The goal of the motion phase
matching is to identify a pair of X-ray images that correspond to a similar
respiratory and cardiac motion phase to reduce errors in 3D reconstruction.
This is achieved by tracking a stationary object such as a catheter or lead
within the X-ray video. The semantic segmentation approach assigns different
labels to different object classes enabling accurate differentiation between
blood vessels, balloons, and catheters. Once a suitable image pair is selected,
key anatomical landmarks (vessel branching points and endpoints) are matched
between the two views using a heuristic method that minimizes reconstruction
errors. This is followed by a novel geometric reconstruction algorithm to
generate the 3D vessel tree. The algorithm computes the 3D vessel centrelines
by determining the intersection of two 3D surfaces. Compared to traditional
methods based on epipolar constraints, the proposed approach simplifies there
construction workflow and improves overall accuracy. We trained and validated
our segmentation method on 62 X-ray angiography video sequences. On the test
set, our method achieved a segmentation accuracy of 0.703. The 3D
reconstruction framework was validated by measuring the reconstruction error of
key anatomical landmarks, achieving a reprojection errors of 0.62mm +/- 0.38mm.

Motivation: Clinical use of Sparse-View CT is hindered by artifacts and performance degradation in out-of-distribution scenarios caused by scanner, protocol, or anatomical variations.

Method: The CDPIR framework integrates diffusion priors derived from a Scalable Interpolant Transformer (SiT) with iterative reconstruction methods. SiT, based on Diffusion Transformer architecture, is trained using Classifier-Free Guidance to learn both domain-specific and domain-invariant priors, enhancing generalizability.

Result: The proposed CDPIR model achieves state-of-the-art performance in sparse-view CT reconstructions, with superior detail preservation and robustness, particularly under out-of-distribution conditions.

Conclusion: CDPIR demonstrates significant advancements in sparse-view CT reconstruction for challenging scenarios, underscoring its clinical potential due to its robustness and generalizability.

Abstract: Sparse-View CT (SVCT) reconstruction enhances temporal resolution and reduces
radiation dose, yet its clinical use is hindered by artifacts due to view
reduction and domain shifts from scanner, protocol, or anatomical variations,
leading to performance degradation in out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. In
this work, we propose a Cross-Distribution Diffusion Priors-Driven Iterative
Reconstruction (CDPIR) framework to tackle the OOD problem in SVCT. CDPIR
integrates cross-distribution diffusion priors, derived from a Scalable
Interpolant Transformer (SiT), with model-based iterative reconstruction
methods. Specifically, we train a SiT backbone, an extension of the Diffusion
Transformer (DiT) architecture, to establish a unified stochastic interpolant
framework, leveraging Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) across multiple datasets.
By randomly dropping the conditioning with a null embedding during training,
the model learns both domain-specific and domain-invariant priors, enhancing
generalizability. During sampling, the globally sensitive transformer-based
diffusion model exploits the cross-distribution prior within the unified
stochastic interpolant framework, enabling flexible and stable control over
multi-distribution-to-noise interpolation paths and decoupled sampling
strategies, thereby improving adaptation to OOD reconstruction. By alternating
between data fidelity and sampling updates, our model achieves state-of-the-art
performance with superior detail preservation in SVCT reconstructions.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that CDPIR significantly outperforms existing
approaches, particularly under OOD conditions, highlighting its robustness and
potential clinical value in challenging imaging scenarios.
