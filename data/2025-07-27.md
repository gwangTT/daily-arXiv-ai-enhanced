### [1] [ASP-Assisted Symbolic Regression: Uncovering Hidden Physics in Fluid Mechanics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17777)
*Theofanis Aravanis,Grigorios Chrimatopoulos,Mohammad Ferdows,Michalis Xenos,Efstratios Em Tzirtzilakis*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper explores Symbolic Regression (SR) for deriving simplified, interpretable equations for 3D incompressible fluid flow dynamics, and introduces a hybrid integration of SR and Answer Set Programming (ASP) for physically plausible modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding and modeling fluid mechanics require interpretable mathematical relationships, balancing prediction accuracy with physical plausibility.

Method: The PySR library is used for symbolic regression on numerical simulation data. A hybrid framework combining SR with Answer Set Programming (ASP) is proposed.

Result: SR derived symbolic equations match both observed numerical results and analytical solutions from the literature. The hybrid SR/ASP framework ensures domain-consistent and interpretable outcomes.

Conclusion: SR can simplify complex physical systems into concise models, and integrating it with ASP enhances alignment with physical principles, offering insights for applications needing explainable and real-time analysis.

Abstract: Unlike conventional Machine-Learning (ML) approaches, often criticized as
"black boxes", Symbolic Regression (SR) stands out as a powerful tool for
revealing interpretable mathematical relationships in complex physical systems,
requiring no a priori assumptions about models' structures. Motivated by the
recognition that, in fluid mechanics, an understanding of the underlying flow
physics is as crucial as accurate prediction, this study applies SR to model a
fundamental three-dimensional (3D) incompressible flow in a rectangular
channel, focusing on the (axial) velocity and pressure fields under laminar
conditions. By employing the PySR library, compact symbolic equations were
derived directly from numerical simulation data, revealing key characteristics
of the flow dynamics. These equations not only approximate the parabolic
velocity profile and pressure drop observed in the studied fluid flow, but also
perfectly coincide with analytical solutions from the literature. Furthermore,
we propose an innovative approach that integrates SR with the
knowledge-representation framework of Answer Set Programming (ASP), combining
the generative power of SR with the declarative reasoning strengths of ASP. The
proposed hybrid SR/ASP framework ensures that the SR-generated symbolic
expressions are not only statistically accurate, but also physically plausible,
adhering to domain-specific principles. Overall, the study highlights two key
contributions: SR's ability to simplify complex flow behaviours into concise,
interpretable equations, and the potential of knowledge-representation
approaches to improve the reliability and alignment of data-driven SR models
with domain principles. Insights from the examined 3D channel flow pave the way
for integrating such hybrid approaches into efficient frameworks, [...] where
explainable predictions and real-time data analysis are crucial.

### [2] [I2I-STRADA -- Information to Insights via Structured Reasoning Agent for Data Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17874)
*SaiBarath Sundar,Pranav Satheesan,Udayaadithya Avadhanam*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper presents I2I-STRADA, an agentic architecture for improving structured reasoning in data analysis via modularized cognitive workflows, outperforming prior systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current agentic systems for data analysis often miss the structured reasoning underpinning analytical thinking, despite advancements in multi-agent frameworks and orchestration techniques.

Method: The authors propose I2I-STRADA, a framework that models analytical reasoning processes through modular sub-tasks, emphasizing structured workflows: interpreting goals, contextual grounding, planning, and adaptive execution.

Result: I2I-STRADA demonstrated superior performance in planning coherence and insight generation on DABstep and DABench benchmarks compared to previous systems.

Conclusion: Structured cognitive workflows are essential in agent design for data analysis, as demonstrated by I2I-STRADA's enhanced performance metrics and alignment with analytical reasoning processes.

Abstract: Recent advances in agentic systems for data analysis have emphasized
automation of insight generation through multi-agent frameworks, and
orchestration layers. While these systems effectively manage tasks like query
translation, data transformation, and visualization, they often overlook the
structured reasoning process underlying analytical thinking. Reasoning large
language models (LLMs) used for multi-step problem solving are trained as
general-purpose problem solvers. As a result, their reasoning or thinking steps
do not adhere to fixed processes for specific tasks. Real-world data analysis
requires a consistent cognitive workflow: interpreting vague goals, grounding
them in contextual knowledge, constructing abstract plans, and adapting
execution based on intermediate outcomes. We introduce I2I-STRADA
(Information-to-Insight via Structured Reasoning Agent for Data Analysis), an
agentic architecture designed to formalize this reasoning process. I2I-STRADA
focuses on modeling how analysis unfolds via modular sub-tasks that reflect the
cognitive steps of analytical reasoning. Evaluations on the DABstep and DABench
benchmarks show that I2I-STRADA outperforms prior systems in planning coherence
and insight alignment, highlighting the importance of structured cognitive
workflows in agent design for data analysis.

### [3] [SMARTAPS: Tool-augmented LLMs for Operations Management](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17927)
*Timothy Tin Long Yu,Mahdi Mostajabdaveh,Jabo Serge Byusa,Rindra Ramamonjison,Giuseppe Carenini,Kun Mao,Zirui Zhou,Yong Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces SmartAPS, a conversational system based on a tool-augmented large language model (LLM), designed to provide accessible advanced planning capabilities through a natural language chat interface.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Advanced planning systems are expensive, limiting access for many supply chain planners who require customizable and operational support tools.

Method: The authors propose SmartAPS, a conversational system leveraging tool-augmented LLMs to simplify user interaction, enable natural language queries, and integrate key planning functionalities.

Result: SmartAPS allows users to perform advanced tasks such as querying, counterfactual reasoning, receiving recommendations, and conducting scenario analysis, demonstrated through an online video.

Conclusion: SmartAPS provides an accessible and user-friendly alternative to traditional advanced planning systems, utilizing LLMs to democratize sophisticated operational planning capabilities.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) present intriguing opportunities to enhance user
interaction with traditional algorithms and tools in real-world applications.
An advanced planning system (APS) is a sophisticated software that leverages
optimization to help operations planners create, interpret, and modify an
operational plan. While highly beneficial, many customers are priced out of
using an APS due to the ongoing costs of consultants responsible for
customization and maintenance. To address the need for a more accessible APS
expressed by supply chain planners, we present SmartAPS, a conversational
system built on a tool-augmented LLM. Our system provides operations planners
with an intuitive natural language chat interface, allowing them to query
information, perform counterfactual reasoning, receive recommendations, and
execute scenario analysis to better manage their operation. A short video
demonstrating the system has been released: https://youtu.be/KtIrJjlDbyw

### [4] [Synthesis of timeline-based planning strategies avoiding determinization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17988)
*Dario Della Monica,Angelo Montanari,Pietro Sala*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper presents an approach to synthesize strategies for qualitative timeline-based planning using deterministic finite automata.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to address the costly determinization step required when using nondeterministic automata for synthesizing planning strategies in timeline-based planning problems.

Method: It identifies a deterministic fragment of qualitative timeline-based planning and links its plan-existence problem directly to deterministic finite automata. Additionally, it determines the maximal subset of Allen's relations that is compatible with this deterministic fragment.

Result: The study successfully maps the qualitative timeline-based planning problem into deterministic finite automata, enabling practical synthesis of planning strategies without determinization.

Conclusion: The work simplifies the synthesis of strategies in timeline-based planning using deterministic automata and provides insights into compatible subsets of Allen's relations.

Abstract: Qualitative timeline-based planning models domains as sets of independent,
but
  interacting, components whose behaviors over time, the timelines, are
governed
  by sets of qualitative temporal constraints (ordering relations), called
  synchronization rules.
  Its plan-existence problem has been shown to be PSPACE-complete; in
  particular, PSPACE-membership has been proved via reduction to the
  nonemptiness problem for nondeterministic finite automata.
  However, nondeterministic automata cannot be directly used to synthesize
  planning strategies as a costly determinization step is needed.
  In this paper, we identify a fragment of qualitative timeline-based planning
  whose plan-existence problem can be directly mapped into the nonemptiness
  problem of deterministic finite automata, which can then
  synthesize strategies.
  In addition, we identify a maximal subset of Allen's relations that fits into
  such a deterministic fragment.

### [5] [E.A.R.T.H.: Structuring Creative Evolution through Model Error in Generative AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18004)
*Yusen Peng,Shuhua Mao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces the E.A.R.T.H. framework, a method to transform AI-generated errors into creative assets through structured stages. Results show significant improvement in creativity, novelty, and relevance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how AI can evolve beyond simple imitation to achieve genuine creativity, using model-generated errors as a resource for innovation.

Method: The E.A.R.T.H. framework deploys a five-stage generative pipeline: Error generation, Amplification, Refine selection, Transform, and Harness feedback. It incorporates a composite reward function (novelty, surprise, relevance) and tools like LLaMA-2-7B, SBERT, BERTScore, CLIP, BLIP-2, and Stable Diffusion.

Result: Creativity scores improved by 70.4% (from 1.179 to 2.010). Refined outputs are shorter and more novel, maintaining high relevance. Cross-modal tasks demonstrated strong performance, and human evaluators rated 60% of outputs highly.

Conclusion: Error-focused, feedback-driven generation significantly enhances creative outputs in AI, paving the way for scalable, human-aligned creative systems.

Abstract: How can AI move beyond imitation toward genuine creativity? This paper
proposes the E.A.R.T.H. framework, a five-stage generative pipeline that
transforms model-generated errors into creative assets through Error
generation, Amplification, Refine selection, Transform, and Harness feedback.
Drawing on cognitive science and generative modeling, we posit that "creative
potential hides in failure" and operationalize this via structured prompts,
semantic scoring, and human-in-the-loop evaluation. Implemented using
LLaMA-2-7B-Chat, SBERT, BERTScore, CLIP, BLIP-2, and Stable Diffusion, the
pipeline employs a composite reward function based on novelty, surprise, and
relevance. At the Refine stage, creativity scores increase by 52.5% (1.179 to
1.898, t = -5.56, p < 0.001), with final outputs reaching 2.010 - a 70.4%
improvement. Refined slogans are 48.4% shorter, 40.7% more novel, with only a
4.0% drop in relevance. Cross-modal tests show strong slogan-to-image alignment
(CLIPScore: 0.249; BERTScore F1: 0.816). In human evaluations, 60% of outputs
scored >= 4.0, with metaphorical slogans (avg. 4.09) outperforming literal ones
(3.99). Feedback highlights stylistic precision and emotional resonance. These
results demonstrate that error-centered, feedback-driven generation enhances
creativity, offering a scalable path toward self-evolving, human-aligned
creative AI.

### [6] [Does visualization help AI understand data?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18022)
*Victoria R. Li,Johnathan Sun,Martin Wattenberg*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The study investigates how AI systems like GPT 4.1 and Claude 3.5 perform when data is visualized, showing improved accuracy with scatterplots.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore whether AI systems can utilize data visualizations (like scatterplots) in a manner similar to humans for enhanced analysis.

Method: The researchers conducted experiments using GPT 4.1 and Claude 3.5 to analyze synthetic datasets, comparing performance on tasks with scatterplots versus blank or mismatched charts.

Result: AI models described datasets more accurately and precisely when scatterplots were provided, especially as dataset complexity increased.

Conclusion: AI systems can benefit from visualizations during data analysis, much like humans do, suggesting charts aid in improving their interpretative capabilities.

Abstract: Charts and graphs help people analyze data, but can they also be useful to AI
systems? To investigate this question, we perform a series of experiments with
two commercial vision-language models: GPT 4.1 and Claude 3.5. Across three
representative analysis tasks, the two systems describe synthetic datasets more
precisely and accurately when raw data is accompanied by a scatterplot,
especially as datasets grow in complexity. Comparison with two baselines --
providing a blank chart and a chart with mismatched data -- shows that the
improved performance is due to the content of the charts. Our results are
initial evidence that AI systems, like humans, can benefit from visualization.

### [7] [Multi-Agent Guided Policy Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18059)
*Yueheng Li,Guangming Xie,Zongqing Lu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper presents MAGPO, a framework enhancing centralized training and decentralized execution for multi-agent reinforcement learning, outperforming existing methods across diverse tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Centralized Training with Decentralized Execution (CTDE) techniques are limited by underutilizing centralized training and lacking theoretical guarantees, prompting the need for a more robust approach.

Method: The authors propose MAGPO, which integrates centralized guidance for coordinated exploration with decentralized policy alignment to ensure usability under partial observability. It uses an auto-regressive joint policy and provides theoretical guarantees.

Result: MAGPO achieves superior performance compared to strong CTDE baselines and equals or surpasses fully centralized methods across 43 tasks in 6 environments.

Conclusion: MAGPO demonstrates a principled and practical approach to decentralized multi-agent learning, offering theoretical benefits and consistent empirical advantages.

Abstract: Due to practical constraints such as partial observability and limited
communication, Centralized Training with Decentralized Execution (CTDE) has
become the dominant paradigm in cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning
(MARL). However, existing CTDE methods often underutilize centralized training
or lack theoretical guarantees. We propose Multi-Agent Guided Policy
Optimization (MAGPO), a novel framework that better leverages centralized
training by integrating centralized guidance with decentralized execution.
MAGPO uses an auto-regressive joint policy for scalable, coordinated
exploration and explicitly aligns it with decentralized policies to ensure
deployability under partial observability. We provide theoretical guarantees of
monotonic policy improvement and empirically evaluate MAGPO on 43 tasks across
6 diverse environments. Results show that MAGPO consistently outperforms strong
CTDE baselines and matches or surpasses fully centralized approaches, offering
a principled and practical solution for decentralized multi-agent learning. Our
code and experimental data can be found in https://github.com/liyheng/MAGPO.

*Yixiu Liu,Yang Nan,Weixian Xu,Xiangkun Hu,Lyumanshan Ye,Zhen Qin,Pengfei Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ASI-Arch is an AI system that autonomously discovers novel neural architectures, conducting end-to-end research over 1,773 experiments and 20,000 GPU hours, producing state-of-the-art results surpassing human designs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI research progress is constrained by human cognitive limitations, impeding innovation and scalability. The paper seeks to overcome this bottleneck by enabling AI systems to autonomously innovate neural architectures.

Method: ASI-Arch employs autonomous processes to hypothesize, implement, train, and validate neural architectures using empirical experimentation, bypassing traditional human-defined optimization constraints.

Result: The system discovered 106 state-of-the-art linear attention architectures, revealing emergent design principles that outperform human-created baselines.

Conclusion: ASI-Arch demonstrates that computational scalability can replace human limitations in AI-driven neural architecture innovation, setting a framework for self-accelerating research systems.

Abstract: While AI systems demonstrate exponentially improving capabilities, the pace
of AI research itself remains linearly bounded by human cognitive capacity,
creating an increasingly severe development bottleneck. We present ASI-Arch,
the first demonstration of Artificial Superintelligence for AI research
(ASI4AI) in the critical domain of neural architecture discovery--a fully
autonomous system that shatters this fundamental constraint by enabling AI to
conduct its own architectural innovation. Moving beyond traditional Neural
Architecture Search (NAS), which is fundamentally limited to exploring
human-defined spaces, we introduce a paradigm shift from automated optimization
to automated innovation. ASI-Arch can conduct end-to-end scientific research in
the domain of architecture discovery, autonomously hypothesizing novel
architectural concepts, implementing them as executable code, training and
empirically validating their performance through rigorous experimentation and
past experience. ASI-Arch conducted 1,773 autonomous experiments over 20,000
GPU hours, culminating in the discovery of 106 innovative, state-of-the-art
(SOTA) linear attention architectures. Like AlphaGo's Move 37 that revealed
unexpected strategic insights invisible to human players, our AI-discovered
architectures demonstrate emergent design principles that systematically
surpass human-designed baselines and illuminate previously unknown pathways for
architectural innovation. Crucially, we establish the first empirical scaling
law for scientific discovery itself--demonstrating that architectural
breakthroughs can be scaled computationally, transforming research progress
from a human-limited to a computation-scalable process. We provide
comprehensive analysis of the emergent design patterns and autonomous research
capabilities that enabled these breakthroughs, establishing a blueprint for
self-accelerating AI systems.

### [9] [Agentic AI framework for End-to-End Medical Data Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18115)
*Soorya Ram Shimgekar,Shayan Vassef,Abhay Goyal,Navin Kumar,Koustuv Saha*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces an automated machine learning (ML) pipeline for healthcare that addresses challenges in data preprocessing, model compatibility, and privacy constraints by using modular, task-specific agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deploying ML in healthcare is hindered by manual and fragmented processes, complex model compatibility issues, and strict data privacy requirements.

Method: The paper proposes the Agentic AI framework, which uses modular agents to automate data preprocessing, model selection, feature extraction, privacy compliance, and model inference.

Result: The framework was tested on datasets from geriatrics, palliative care, and colonoscopy imaging, proving its effectiveness in automating high-friction ML pipeline stages.

Conclusion: The framework significantly reduces expert intervention, making AI implementation in clinical environments scalable and cost-efficient.

Abstract: Building and deploying machine learning solutions in healthcare remains
expensive and labor-intensive due to fragmented preprocessing workflows, model
compatibility issues, and stringent data privacy constraints. In this work, we
introduce an Agentic AI framework that automates the entire clinical data
pipeline, from ingestion to inference, through a system of modular,
task-specific agents. These agents handle both structured and unstructured
data, enabling automatic feature selection, model selection, and preprocessing
recommendation without manual intervention. We evaluate the system on publicly
available datasets from geriatrics, palliative care, and colonoscopy imaging.
For example, in the case of structured data (anxiety data) and unstructured
data (colonoscopy polyps data), the pipeline begins with file-type detection by
the Ingestion Identifier Agent, followed by the Data Anonymizer Agent ensuring
privacy compliance, where we first identify the data type and then anonymize
it. The Feature Extraction Agent identifies features using an embedding-based
approach for tabular data, extracting all column names, and a multi-stage
MedGemma-based approach for image data, which infers modality and disease name.
These features guide the Model-Data Feature Matcher Agent in selecting the
best-fit model from a curated repository. The Preprocessing Recommender Agent
and Preprocessing Implementor Agent then apply tailored preprocessing based on
data type and model requirements. Finally, the ``Model Inference Agent" runs
the selected model on the uploaded data and generates interpretable outputs
using tools like SHAP, LIME, and DETR attention maps. By automating these
high-friction stages of the ML lifecycle, the proposed framework reduces the
need for repeated expert intervention, offering a scalable, cost-efficient
pathway for operationalizing AI in clinical environments.

### [10] [Actively evaluating and learning the distinctions that matter: Vaccine safety signal detection from emergency triage notes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18123)
*Sedigh Khademi,Christopher Palmer,Muhammad Javed,Hazel Clothier,Jim Buttery,Gerardo Luis Dimaguila,Jim Black*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper presents a method to enhance vaccine safety monitoring using NLP and active learning in emergency department notes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limited window for safety data collection in clinical trials and improve post-licensure surveillance systems for vaccines.

Method: Natural Language Processing (NLP), Active Learning, and data augmentation techniques are utilized to develop an efficient classifier for detecting vaccine safety issues in ED triage notes.

Result: The classifier enhances vaccine safety signal surveillance by leveraging succinct expert input from ED notes, overcoming the challenges of traditional keyword-based classification.

Conclusion: Combining NLP and active learning facilitates timely and accurate vaccine safety monitoring, particularly from scarce and unstructured medical data sources.

Abstract: The rapid development of COVID-19 vaccines has showcased the global
communitys ability to combat infectious diseases. However, the need for
post-licensure surveillance systems has grown due to the limited window for
safety data collection in clinical trials and early widespread implementation.
This study aims to employ Natural Language Processing techniques and Active
Learning to rapidly develop a classifier that detects potential vaccine safety
issues from emergency department notes. ED triage notes, containing expert,
succinct vital patient information at the point of entry to health systems, can
significantly contribute to timely vaccine safety signal surveillance. While
keyword-based classification can be effective, it may yield false positives and
demand extensive keyword modifications. This is exacerbated by the infrequency
of vaccination-related ED presentations and their similarity to other reasons
for ED visits. NLP offers a more accurate and efficient alternative, albeit
requiring annotated data, which is often scarce in the medical field. Active
learning optimizes the annotation process and the quality of annotated data,
which can result in faster model implementation and improved model performance.
This work combines active learning, data augmentation, and active learning and
evaluation techniques to create a classifier that is used to enhance vaccine
safety surveillance from ED triage notes.

### [11] [Logical Characterizations of GNNs with Mean Aggregation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18145)
*Moritz Schönherr,Carsten Lutz*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper studies the expressive power of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with mean aggregation and compares it to modal logic frameworks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the theoretical expressive power of GNNs with different aggregation functions and reveal insights into their capabilities relative to logical frameworks.

Method: Analyzing GNNs using the concepts of ratio modal logic, graded modal logic, and alternation-free modal logic, while considering continuous combination functions and threshold classification functions.

Result: Mean GNNs' expressive power surpasses max aggregation but is lower than sum aggregation in non-uniform settings. In uniform settings, they are comparable to alternation-free modal logic and less expressive than sum/max GNNs.

Conclusion: Mean GNNs have a nuanced expressive power that depends on aggregation settings and assumptions, showcasing a balance between logic frameworks but falling behind sum GNNs in uniform settings.

Abstract: We study the expressive power of graph neural networks (GNNs) with mean as
the aggregation function. In the non-uniform setting, we show that such GNNs
have exactly the same expressive power as ratio modal logic, which has modal
operators expressing that at least a certain ratio of the successors of a
vertex satisfies a specified property. The non-uniform expressive power of mean
GNNs is thus higher than that of GNNs with max aggregation, but lower than for
sum aggregation--the latter are characterized by modal logic and graded modal
logic, respectively. In the uniform setting, we show that the expressive power
relative to MSO is exactly that of alternation-free modal logic, under the
natural assumptions that combination functions are continuous and
classification functions are thresholds. This implies that, relative to MSO and
in the uniform setting, mean GNNs are strictly less expressive than sum GNNs
and max GNNs. When any of the assumptions is dropped, the expressive power
increases.

### [12] [Decoupling Knowledge and Reasoning in LLMs: An Exploration Using Cognitive Dual-System Theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18178)
*Mutian Yang,Jiandong Gao,Ji Wu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper presents a framework to distinguish between knowledge and reasoning in large language models (LLMs), inspired by dual-system cognitive theory, by decoupling their cognitive processes into knowledge retrieval and reasoning adjustment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enhance model analysis, interpretability, and development by understanding how LLMs use knowledge and reasoning during inference.

Method: A cognition attribution framework is introduced, where the cognition of LLMs is decoupled into two phases: knowledge retrieval and reasoning adjustment. LLMs are assessed under fast and slow thinking modes to quantify the contributions of knowledge and reasoning, applied to 15 LLMs across 3 datasets.

Result: Findings reveal that reasoning adjustment is more beneficial in reasoning-intensive domains but could impair knowledge-intensive ones. Parameter scaling improves both knowledge and reasoning, with knowledge improving more prominently. Knowledge is concentrated in lower network layers, while reasoning operates in higher ones.

Conclusion: The framework provides a method to analyze LLMs from a decoupling perspective, offering insights into scaling laws, hierarchical knowledge editing, and the reasoning limitations of smaller models.

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) leverage both knowledge and reasoning
during inference, the capacity to distinguish between them plays a pivotal role
in model analysis, interpretability, and development. Inspired by dual-system
cognitive theory, we propose a cognition attribution framework to decouple the
contribution of knowledge and reasoning. In particular, the cognition of LLMs
is decomposed into two distinct yet complementary phases: knowledge retrieval
(Phase 1) and reasoning adjustment (Phase 2). To separate these phases, LLMs
are prompted to generate answers under two different cognitive modes, fast
thinking and slow thinking, respectively. The performance under different
cognitive modes is analyzed to quantify the contribution of knowledge and
reasoning. This architecture is employed to 15 LLMs across 3 datasets. Results
reveal: (1) reasoning adjustment is domain-specific, benefiting
reasoning-intensive domains (e.g., mathematics, physics, and chemistry) and
potentially imparing knowledge-intensive domains. (2) Parameter scaling
improves both knowledge and reasoning, with knowledge improvements being more
pronounced. Additionally, parameter scaling make LLMs reasoning significantly
more prudent, while moderately more intelligent. (3) Knowledge primarily
resides in lower network layers, while reasoning operates in higher layers. Our
framework not only helps understand LLMs from a "decoupling" perspective, but
also provides new insights into existing research, including scaling laws,
hierarchical knowledge editing, and limitations of small-model reasoning.

### [13] [Comparing Non-minimal Semantics for Disjunction in Answer Set Programming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18198)
*Felicidad Aguado,Pedro Cabalar,Brais Muñiz,Gilberto Pérez,Concepción Vidal*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper evaluates and compares four alternative semantics for disjunction in Answer Set Programming, showing overlaps and distinctions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore and compare alternative semantics for disjunction in Answer Set Programming that depart from stable model minimality.

Method: Analyzed four approaches: Justified Models, Strongly Supported Models, Forks, and Determining Inference semantics, proving equivalences and contrasts.

Result: Three approaches (Forks, Justified Models, and a relaxed DI semantics) were found equivalent, providing a superset of stable models, while Strongly Supported Models followed classical logic.

Conclusion: Unified semantics exist among several approaches; the alternatives expand beyond stable model theory, enhancing representational flexibility.

Abstract: In this paper, we compare four different semantics for disjunction in Answer
Set Programming that, unlike stable models, do not adhere to the principle of
model minimality. Two of these approaches, Cabalar and Mu\~niz' \emph{Justified
Models} and Doherty and Szalas' \emph{Strongly Supported Models}, directly
provide an alternative non-minimal semantics for disjunction. The other two,
Aguado et al's \emph{Forks} and Shen and Eiter's \emph{Determining Inference}
(DI) semantics, actually introduce a new disjunction connective, but are
compared here as if they constituted new semantics for the standard disjunction
operator. We are able to prove that three of these approaches (Forks, Justified
Models and a reasonable relaxation of the DI semantics) actually coincide,
constituting a common single approach under different definitions. Moreover,
this common semantics always provides a superset of the stable models of a
program (in fact, modulo any context) and is strictly stronger than the fourth
approach (Strongly Supported Models), that actually treats disjunctions as in

### [14] [Foundations for Risk Assessment of AI in Protecting Fundamental Rights](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18290)
*Antonino Rotolo,Beatrice Ferrigno,Jose Miguel Angel Garcia Godinez,Claudio Novelli,Giovanni Sartor*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces a framework for assessing AI risks using proportionality and dynamic reasoning tailored to EU AI Act compliance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenges of AI compliance with legal standards and its impact on fundamental rights.

Method: The approach integrates proportionality analysis for resolving conflicts and defeasible reasoning for adapting decisions dynamically.

Result: A conceptual framework blending legal principles and philosophical foundations to analyze AI deployment scenarios and rights impact.

Conclusion: The framework offers tools for assessing risks in AI systems and plans future work to create formal models and algorithms for practical applications.

Abstract: This chapter introduces a conceptual framework for qualitative risk
assessment of AI, particularly in the context of the EU AI Act. The framework
addresses the complexities of legal compliance and fundamental rights
protection by itegrating definitional balancing and defeasible reasoning.
Definitional balancing employs proportionality analysis to resolve conflicts
between competing rights, while defeasible reasoning accommodates the dynamic
nature of legal decision-making. Our approach stresses the need for an analysis
of AI deployment scenarios and for identifying potential legal violations and
multi-layered impacts on fundamental rights. On the basis of this analysis, we
provide philosophical foundations for a logical account of AI risk analysis. In
particular, we consider the basic building blocks for conceptually grasping the
interaction between AI deployment scenarios and fundamental rights,
incorporating in defeasible reasoning definitional balancing and arguments
about the contextual promotion or demotion of rights. This layered approach
allows for more operative models of assessment of both high-risk AI systems and
General Purpose AI (GPAI) systems, emphasizing the broader applicability of the
latter. Future work aims to develop a formal model and effective algorithms to
enhance AI risk assessment, bridging theoretical insights with practical
applications to support responsible AI governance.

### [15] [The AlphaPhysics Term Rewriting System for Marking Algebraic Expressions in Physics Exams](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18337)
*Peter Baumgartner,Lachlan McGinness*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper outlines an automated system for marking Physics exams using a combination of computational techniques, including computer algebra, SMT solvers, term rewriting, and large language models, to evaluate student answers for correctness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the need to efficiently and accurately assess typed student answers in Physics exams against predefined solutions, overcoming challenges of formalization and evaluation.

Method: The method integrates a computer algebra system, an SMT solver, a term rewriting system, and a Large Language Model to interpret, formalize, and assess the correctness of student responses. Automated theorem proving techniques, including SMT solving and physics-tailored term rewriting, are utilized.

Result: The system was tested and evaluated on over 1500 student responses from the 2023 Australian Physics Olympiad, demonstrating its capability to effectively mark Physics exam answers.

Conclusion: Automated reasoning and language models can dramatically improve exam assessment processes, offering accurate and theoretically rigorous evaluation of student solutions to complex Physics problems.

Abstract: We present our method for automatically marking Physics exams. The marking
problem consists in assessing typed student answers for correctness with
respect to a ground truth solution. This is a challenging problem that we seek
to tackle using a combination of a computer algebra system, an SMT solver and a
term rewriting system. A Large Language Model is used to interpret and remove
errors from student responses and rewrite these in a machine readable format.
Once formalized and language-aligned, the next step then consists in applying
automated reasoning techniques for assessing student solution correctness. We
consider two methods of automated theorem proving: off-the-shelf SMT solving
and term rewriting systems tailored for physics problems involving
trigonometric expressions. The development of the term rewrite system and
establishing termination and confluence properties was not trivial, and we
describe it in some detail in the paper. We evaluate our system on a rich pool
of over 1500 real-world student exam responses from the 2023 Australian Physics
Olympiad.

TL;DR: This paper introduces ConDiFi, a benchmark for evaluating both divergent and convergent thinking in LLMs applied to financial tasks, showcasing significant differences among 14 leading models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing reasoning benchmarks for LLMs focus on factual precision and logical accuracy but overlook creative and strategic reasoning necessary for finance applications.

Method: The authors designed ConDiFi, consisting of 607 prompts for divergent reasoning and 990 multi-hop adversarial multiple-choice questions for convergent reasoning in financial contexts.

Result: Evaluation of 14 top models revealed substantial differences, with GPT-4o lacking in Novelty and Actionability compared to DeepSeek-R1 and Cohere Command R+, which excelled in actionable investment insights.

Conclusion: ConDiFi serves as a robust tool to assess reasoning capabilities required for safe and effective utilization of LLMs in financial decision-making processes.

Abstract: Most reasoning benchmarks for LLMs emphasize factual accuracy or step-by-step
logic. In finance, however, professionals must not only converge on optimal
decisions but also generate creative, plausible futures under uncertainty. We
introduce ConDiFi, a benchmark that jointly evaluates divergent and convergent
thinking in LLMs for financial tasks.
  ConDiFi features 607 macro-financial prompts for divergent reasoning and 990
multi-hop adversarial MCQs for convergent reasoning. Using this benchmark, we
evaluated 14 leading models and uncovered striking differences. Despite high
fluency, GPT-4o underperforms on Novelty and Actionability. In contrast, models
like DeepSeek-R1 and Cohere Command R+ rank among the top for generating
actionable, insights suitable for investment decisions. ConDiFi provides a new
perspective to assess reasoning capabilities essential to safe and strategic
deployment of LLMs in finance.

### [17] [Revisiting LLM Reasoning via Information Bottleneck](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18391)
*Shiye Lei,Zhihao Cheng,Kai Jia,Dacheng Tao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces IB-aware reasoning optimization (IBRO), a theoretical framework to enhance reasoning by leveraging the information bottleneck principle, offering lightweight regularization for LLMs with improved performance in reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards has shown success in improving LLM reasoning, existing methods heavily rely on heuristic and intuition-driven approaches, limiting principled advancements in the field.

Method: The authors propose IBRO, which encourages reasoning trajectories to balance informativeness and generalizability by using the information bottleneck principle. They derive a token-level surrogate objective and design an efficient IB regularization that integrates easily into existing RL-based frameworks.

Result: Experiments validate the IB regularization method across multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks, demonstrating consistent improvements in reasoning performance for LLMs.

Conclusion: The IBRO framework provides a principled, computationally efficient, and easy-to-integrate approach to enhance LLM reasoning capabilities, bridging theoretical characterization with practical effectiveness.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated remarkable progress
in reasoning capabilities through reinforcement learning with verifiable
rewards (RLVR). By leveraging simple rule-based rewards, RL effectively
incentivizes LLMs to produce extended chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning
trajectories, progressively guiding them toward correct answers. However,
existing approaches remain largely heuristic and intuition-driven, limiting the
development of principled methodologies. In this paper, we present a
theoretical characterization of LLM reasoning grounded in information
bottleneck (IB) principle, introducing IB-aware reasoning optimization (IBRO),
a framework that encourages reasoning trajectories to be both informative about
the final correct answer and generalizable across diverse prompts. We derive a
practical token-level surrogate objective and propose an efficient
approximation, resulting in the lightweight IB regularization method. This
technique integrates seamlessly into existing RL-based post-training frameworks
without additional computational overhead, requiring only a one-line code
modification. Empirically, we validate IB regularization across multiple
mathematical reasoning benchmarks and RL algorithms, demonstrating consistent
improvements in LLM reasoning performance.

*Kwong Ho Li,Wathsala Karunarathne*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This study applies and compares model-based and model-free reinforcement learning methods for optimizing call routing in call centres.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address inefficiencies in call centres, specifically client waiting time and staff idle time, using advanced reinforcement learning techniques.

Method: The paper employs two approaches: a model-based Value Iteration using known system dynamics and a model-free Proximal Policy Optimization trained via a hybrid simulation model combining Discrete Event Simulation with OpenAI Gym.

Result: PPO outperforms Value Iteration in terms of rewards, client waiting times, and staff idle times after 1,000 test episodes, though at the cost of longer training time.

Conclusion: Model-free reinforcement learning with PPO demonstrates superior performance for optimizing call routing in call centres compared to model-based approaches.

Abstract: This paper investigates the application of Reinforcement Learning (RL) to
optimise call routing in call centres to minimise client waiting time and staff
idle time. Two methods are compared: a model-based approach using Value
Iteration (VI) under known system dynamics, and a model-free approach using
Proximal Policy Optimisation (PPO) that learns from experience. For the
model-based approach, a theoretical model is used, while a simulation model
combining Discrete Event Simulation (DES) with the OpenAI Gym environment is
developed for model-free learning. Both models frame the problem as a Markov
Decision Process (MDP) within a Skills-Based Routing (SBR) framework, with
Poisson client arrivals and exponentially distributed service and abandonment
times. For policy evaluation, random, VI, and PPO policies are evaluated using
the simulation model. After 1,000 test episodes, PPO consistently achives the
highest rewards, along with the lowest client waiting time and staff idle time,
despite requiring longer training time.

*Enrico Santi,Fabio Tardivo,Agostino Dovier,Andrea Formisano*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper enhances the Compact-Table (CT) algorithm used for table constraints in constraint programming by leveraging GPU computational power for handling large-scale table constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Table constraints are versatile and widely studied due to their ability to simulate any finite domain constraint, but current CPU-based approaches struggle with handling large-scale table constraints effectively.

Method: The authors design and implement a GPU-accelerated version of the Compact-Table (CT) algorithm and integrate it into an existing constraint solver. They conduct experimental validation using a meaningful set of instances.

Result: The paper demonstrates how leveraging GPUs can efficiently handle large-scale table constraints, improving the effectiveness of the CT algorithm.

Conclusion: GPU acceleration for the CT algorithm significantly enhances its capability, making it suitable for solving real-world problems that involve large or complex table constraints.

Abstract: Constraint Programming developed within Logic Programming in the Eighties;
nowadays all Prolog systems encompass modules capable of handling constraint
programming on finite domains demanding their solution to a constraint solver.
This work focuses on a specific form of constraint, the so-called table
constraint, used to specify conditions on the values of variables as an
enumeration of alternative options. Since every condition on a set of finite
domain variables can be ultimately expressed as a finite set of cases, Table
can, in principle, simulate any other constraint. These characteristics make
Table one of the most studied constraints ever, leading to a series of
increasingly efficient propagation algorithms. Despite this, it is not uncommon
to encounter real-world problems with hundreds or thousands of valid cases that
are simply too many to be handled effectively with standard CPU-based
approaches. In this paper, we deal with the Compact-Table (CT) algorithm, the
state-of-the-art propagation algorithms for Table. We describe how CT can be
enhanced by exploiting the massive computational power offered by modern GPUs
to handle large Table constraints. In particular, we report on the design and
implementation of GPU-accelerated CT, on its integration into an existing
constraint solver, and on an experimental validation performed on a significant
set of instances.

*Manuel de Sousa Ribeiro,Afonso Leote,João Leite*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores concept probing for interpreting artificial neural networks by focusing on the impact of the data used to train probing models in image classification tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of focus on the data utilized to train probing models in the concept probing field for artificial neural network interpretation.

Method: The paper investigates the influence of data employed in training probing models in image classification tasks by analyzing performance and providing concept labels for two datasets.

Result: Finds that the choice of data substantially impacts the outcome of concept probing models and offers concept labels for two widely used datasets.

Conclusion: Highlighting the importance of data selection in concept probing tasks and contributing new resources for further research in model interpretation.

Abstract: Concept probing has recently garnered increasing interest as a way to help
interpret artificial neural networks, dealing both with their typically large
size and their subsymbolic nature, which ultimately renders them unfeasible for
direct human interpretation. Concept probing works by training additional
classifiers to map the internal representations of a model into human-defined
concepts of interest, thus allowing humans to peek inside artificial neural
networks. Research on concept probing has mainly focused on the model being
probed or the probing model itself, paying limited attention to the data
required to train such probing models. In this paper, we address this gap.
Focusing on concept probing in the context of image classification tasks, we
investigate the effect of the data used to train probing models on their
performance. We also make available concept labels for two widely used
datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for developing AI systems that balance advanced problem-solving capabilities with intrinsic safety reasoning and self-reflection abilities.

Method: SafeWork-R1 is developed using the SafeLadder framework, which integrates progressive safety-oriented reinforcement learning post-training with multi-principled verifiers.

Result: SafeWork-R1 improves safety benchmark scores by 46.54% over its base model, surpasses state-of-the-art proprietary models, and maintains its general capabilities.

Conclusion: The study highlights the feasibility of synergistically co-evolving safety and capabilities in AI models, demonstrating the generalizability and reliability of the SafeLadder framework.

Abstract: We introduce SafeWork-R1, a cutting-edge multimodal reasoning model that
demonstrates the coevolution of capabilities and safety. It is developed by our
proposed SafeLadder framework, which incorporates large-scale, progressive,
safety-oriented reinforcement learning post-training, supported by a suite of
multi-principled verifiers. Unlike previous alignment methods such as RLHF that
simply learn human preferences, SafeLadder enables SafeWork-R1 to develop
intrinsic safety reasoning and self-reflection abilities, giving rise to safety
`aha' moments. Notably, SafeWork-R1 achieves an average improvement of
$46.54\%$ over its base model Qwen2.5-VL-72B on safety-related benchmarks
without compromising general capabilities, and delivers state-of-the-art safety
performance compared to leading proprietary models such as GPT-4.1 and Claude
Opus 4. To further bolster its reliability, we implement two distinct
inference-time intervention methods and a deliberative search mechanism,
enforcing step-level verification. Finally, we further develop
SafeWork-R1-InternVL3-78B, SafeWork-R1-DeepSeek-70B, and
SafeWork-R1-Qwen2.5VL-7B. All resulting models demonstrate that safety and
capability can co-evolve synergistically, highlighting the generalizability of
our framework in building robust, reliable, and trustworthy general-purpose AI.

*Harsh Sharma,Janardhan Rao Doppa,Umit Y. Ogras,Partha Pratim Pande*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework to address warpage challenges in glass interposer multi-chiplet systems, achieving better performance and power efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Glass interposers provide electrical and energy efficiency benefits for multi-chiplet systems but face warpage challenges as system size increases, threatening reliability.

Method: A design framework is proposed that co-optimizes architecture and packaging by balancing embedded and surface chiplet layout for optimal trade-offs.

Result: The framework leads to a 64.7% performance improvement and 40% power reduction, alongside lower fabrication costs, for deep neural network workloads.

Conclusion: The proposed co-optimization framework offers a scalable solution for addressing glass interposer warpage, balancing performance and reliability with reduced costs.

Abstract: Multi-chiplet architectures enabled by glass interposer offer superior
electrical performance, enable higher bus widths due to reduced crosstalk, and
have lower capacitance in the redistribution layer than current silicon
interposer-based systems. These advantages result in lower energy per bit,
higher communication frequencies, and extended interconnect range. However,
deformation of the package (warpage) in glass interposer-based systems becomes
a critical challenge as system size increases, leading to severe mechanical
stress and reliability concerns. Beyond a certain size, conventional packaging
techniques fail to manage warpage effectively, necessitating new approaches to
mitigate warpage induced bending with scalable performance for glass interposer
based multi-chiplet systems. To address these inter-twined challenges, we
propose a thermal-, warpage-, and performance-aware design framework that
employs architecture and packaging co-optimization. The proposed framework
disintegrates the surface and embedded chiplets to balance conflicting design
objectives, ensuring optimal trade-offs between performance, power, and
structural reliability. Our experiments demonstrate that optimized
multi-chiplet architectures from our design framework achieve up to 64.7%
performance improvement and 40% power reduction compared to traditional 2.5D
systems to execute deep neural network workloads with lower fabrication costs.

*Juntao Zhao,Jiuru Li,Chuan Wu*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: This paper introduces 'Sandwich', a CPU-based serving engine for large language models (LLMs) that optimizes inference phases (prefill and decode) separately. It achieves significant throughput improvements, latency reduction, and kernel efficiency compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to improve CPU-based serving for LLMs, addressing limitations in current approaches that don't differentiate between workload characteristics of the prefill and decode phases, resulting in suboptimal performance.

Method: The authors propose Sandwich, a hardware-centric serving engine that optimizes execution plans specifically for the prefill and decode phases. The system leverages heterogeneous CPU platforms and generates optimized GEMM kernels for LLM inference.

Result: Sandwich shows an average 2.01x throughput improvement, achieves satisfactory latencies in TTFT/TPOT for single-sequence serving, and offers significant Goodput improvement in continuous-batching serving. Additionally, its GEMM kernels outperform vendor and dynamic-shape alternatives.

Conclusion: Sandwich provides a resource-efficient and high-performance solution for serving LLMs on CPUs, overcoming limitations of static models and libraries, and operates effectively across various hardware platforms.

Abstract: Utilizing CPUs to serve large language models (LLMs) is a resource-friendly
alternative to GPU serving. Existing CPU-based solutions ignore workload
differences between the prefill and the decode phases of LLM inference,
applying a static per-NUMA (Non-Uniform Memory Access) node model partition and
utilizing vendor libraries for operator-level execution, which is suboptimal.
We propose Sandwich, a hardware-centric CPU-based LLM serving engine that uses
different execution plans for the prefill and decode phases and optimizes them
separately.
  We evaluate Sandwich across diverse baselines and datasets on five CPU
platforms, including x86 with AVX-2 and AVX-512, as well as ARM with NEON.
Sandwich achieves an average 2.01x throughput improvement and 90% satisfactory
time-to-first-token (TTFT) and time-per-output-token (TPOT) latencies with up
to 3.40x lower requirements in single sequence serving, and significant
improvement in Goodput in continuous-batching serving. The GEMM kernels
generated by Sandwich outperform representative vendor kernels and other
dynamic shape solutions, achieving performance comparable to static compilers
with three orders of magnitude less kernel tuning costs.

*Ravan Nazaraliyev,Saber Ganjisaffar,Nurlan Nazaraliyev,Nael Abu-Ghazaleh*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: The paper proposes PRACtical, an optimized solution for DDR5's Rowhammer mitigation techniques that enhances performance and energy efficiency without compromising security.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As DRAM density rises, Rowhammer-induced bit flips become more frequent, requiring robust yet efficient mitigation techniques in DDR5 systems.

Method: PRACtical introduces a centralized increment circuit to reduce counter update latency and employs bank-level granularity for recovery refreshes using DRAM-resident registers.

Result: PRACtical achieves an average performance improvement of 8% (up to 20%), reduces energy consumption by 19%, and limits performance degradation from attacks to less than 6%, all while maintaining Rowhammer security.

Conclusion: PRACtical provides a significant optimization over existing DDR5 Rowhammer countermeasures, improving performance and energy usage while possessing strong security guarantees.

Abstract: As DRAM density increases, Rowhammer becomes more severe due to heightened
charge leakage, reducing the number of activations needed to induce bit flips.
The DDR5 standard addresses this threat with in-DRAM per-row activation
counters (PRAC) and the Alert Back-Off (ABO) signal to trigger mitigation.
However, PRAC adds performance overhead by incrementing counters during the
precharge phase, and recovery refreshes stalls the entire memory channel, even
if only one bank is under attack.
  We propose PRACtical, a performance-optimized approach to PRAC+ABO that
maintains the same security guarantees. First, we reduce counter update latency
by introducing a centralized increment circuit, enabling overlap between
counter updates and subsequent row activations in other subarrays. Second, we
enhance the $RFM_{ab}$ mitigation by enabling bank-level granularity: instead
of stalling the entire channel, only affected banks are paused. This is
achieved through a DRAM-resident register that identifies attacked banks.
  PRACtical improves performance by 8% on average (up to 20%) over the
state-of-the-art, reduces energy by 19%, and limits performance degradation
from aggressive performance attacks to less than 6%, all while preserving
Rowhammer protection.

(HDC) along with low-cost Kronecker HD Encoder and weight clustering feature
extraction (WCFE) to optimize accuracy and efficiency. Clo-HDnn adopts

TL;DR: Shop-R1 introduces an RL framework to improve LLMs' reasoning and action prediction for simulating human behavior in online shopping environments, showing over 65% improvement compared to baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of prior methods in using LLM-synthesized rationales for reasoning and action prediction in simulating human-like behavior.

Method: Shop-R1 decomposes the task into rationale generation and action prediction, guided by distinct reward mechanisms like model signals and a hierarchical, difficulty-aware reward structure.

Result: The framework significantly enhances reasoning and prediction abilities, achieving over 65% improvement over baseline methods in experimental evaluations.

Conclusion: Shop-R1 successfully improves the simulation of human-like behavior through better reasoning and action prediction, validating the novel two-stage approach with specialized reward designs.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated strong potential in
generating 'believable human-like' behavior in web environments. Prior work has
explored augmenting training data with LLM-synthesized rationales and applying
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to enhance reasoning ability, which in turn can
improve downstream action prediction. However, the performance of such
approaches remains inherently bounded by the reasoning capabilities of the
model used to generate the rationales. In this paper, we introduce Shop-R1, a
novel reinforcement learning (RL) framework aimed at enhancing the reasoning
ability of LLMs for simulation of real human behavior in online shopping
environments Specifically, Shop-R1 decomposes the human behavior simulation
task into two stages: rationale generation and action prediction, each guided
by distinct reward signals. For rationale generation, we leverage internal
model signals (e.g., logit distributions) to guide the reasoning process in a
self-supervised manner. For action prediction, we propose a hierarchical reward
structure with difficulty-aware scaling to prevent reward hacking and enable
fine-grained reward assignment. This design evaluates both high-level action
types and the correctness of fine-grained sub-action details (attributes and
values), rewarding outputs proportionally to their difficulty. Experimental
results show that our method achieves a relative improvement of over 65%
compared to the baseline.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to improve reward models for LLMs, as current approaches struggle with cross-domain generalization and ignore meaningful textual guidance.

Method: Introduce DG-PRM utilizing reward trees for fine-grained criteria and Pareto dominance for multifaceted reward discrimination.

Result: DG-PRM significantly boosts LLM performance on various benchmarks and adapts well in out-of-distribution scenarios.

Conclusion: DG-PRM offers a robust solution for improving LLM supervision, leading to better generalization and adaptability in complex tasks.

Abstract: Process Reward Models (PRMs) are crucial for guiding Large Language Models
(LLMs) in complex scenarios by providing dense reward signals. However,
existing PRMs primarily rely on heuristic approaches, which struggle with
cross-domain generalization. While LLM-as-judge has been proposed to provide
generalized rewards, current research has focused mainly on feedback results,
overlooking the meaningful guidance embedded within the text. Additionally,
static and coarse-grained evaluation criteria struggle to adapt to complex
process supervision. To tackle these challenges, we propose Dynamic and
Generalizable Process Reward Modeling (DG-PRM), which features a reward tree to
capture and store fine-grained, multi-dimensional reward criteria. DG-PRM
dynamically selects reward signals for step-wise reward scoring. To handle
multifaceted reward signals, we pioneeringly adopt Pareto dominance estimation
to identify discriminative positive and negative pairs. Experimental results
show that DG-PRM achieves stunning performance on prevailing benchmarks,
significantly boosting model performance across tasks with dense rewards.
Further analysis reveals that DG-PRM adapts well to out-of-distribution
scenarios, demonstrating exceptional generalizability.

Motivation: To address the lack of tools tackling cognitive biases in analytical questions during data analysis by non-experts.

Method: The authors develop VeriMinder with three core innovations: a contextual semantic mapping for bias, an analytical framework based on the Hard-to-Vary principle, and an optimized system using advanced LLM techniques for prompt generation.

Result: User testing demonstrates 82.5% positive impact on analysis quality. VeriMinder surpasses alternative approaches by over 20% in concreteness, comprehensiveness, and accuracy.

Conclusion: VeriMinder provides a robust system for bias-free data analysis, is implemented as a web application, and is open-sourced for further adoption and research.

Abstract: Application systems using natural language interfaces to databases (NLIDBs)
have democratized data analysis. This positive development has also brought
forth an urgent challenge to help users who might use these systems without a
background in statistical analysis to formulate bias-free analytical questions.
Although significant research has focused on text-to-SQL generation accuracy,
addressing cognitive biases in analytical questions remains underexplored. We
present VeriMinder, https://veriminder.ai, an interactive system for detecting
and mitigating such analytical vulnerabilities. Our approach introduces three
key innovations: (1) a contextual semantic mapping framework for biases
relevant to specific analysis contexts (2) an analytical framework that
operationalizes the Hard-to-Vary principle and guides users in systematic data
analysis (3) an optimized LLM-powered system that generates high-quality,
task-specific prompts using a structured process involving multiple candidates,
critic feedback, and self-reflection.
  User testing confirms the merits of our approach. In direct user experience
evaluation, 82.5% participants reported positively impacting the quality of the
analysis. In comparative evaluation, VeriMinder scored significantly higher
than alternative approaches, at least 20% better when considered for metrics of
the analysis's concreteness, comprehensiveness, and accuracy. Our system,
implemented as a web application, is set to help users avoid "wrong question"
vulnerability during data analysis. VeriMinder code base with prompts,
https://reproducibility.link/veriminder, is available as an MIT-licensed
open-source software to facilitate further research and adoption within the
community.

*Nhan Phan,Anusha Porwal,Yaroslav Getman,Ekaterina Voskoboinik,Tamás Grósz,Mikko Kurimo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces an efficient model for Automatic Speaking Assessment (ASA) that uses a single encoder to evaluate multi-part spoken tests and delivers better performance with faster inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to enhance large-scale Computer-Assisted Language Learning systems by developing a more practical and efficient approach for speech assessment, addressing challenges like transcription dependence and slow inference times.

Method: The authors propose an end-to-end model that processes all four spoken responses using one Whisper-small encoder combined with a lightweight aggregator to predict a final score. They also introduce a data sampling strategy to handle data imbalances.

Result: The system achieved an RMSE of 0.384, outperforming the baseline's 0.44 RMSE while using fewer model parameters. Additionally, it maintained strong performance with reduced training data (44.8% of speakers).

Conclusion: The study demonstrates a scalable, efficient, and high-performing approach for holistic ASA, making it viable for widespread use in Computer-Assisted Language Learning systems.

Abstract: We present an efficient end-to-end approach for holistic Automatic Speaking
Assessment (ASA) of multi-part second-language tests, developed for the 2025
Speak & Improve Challenge. Our system's main novelty is the ability to process
all four spoken responses with a single Whisper-small encoder, combine all
information via a lightweight aggregator, and predict the final score. This
architecture removes the need for transcription and per-part models, cuts
inference time, and makes ASA practical for large-scale Computer-Assisted
Language Learning systems.
  Our system achieved a Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 0.384, outperforming
the text-based baseline (0.44) while using at most 168M parameters (about 70%
of Whisper-small). Furthermore, we propose a data sampling strategy, allowing
the model to train on only 44.8% of the speakers in the corpus and still reach
0.383 RMSE, demonstrating improved performance on imbalanced classes and strong
data efficiency.

### [30] [Evaluating the Performance of AI Text Detectors, Few-Shot and Chain-of-Thought Prompting Using DeepSeek Generated Text](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17944)
*Hulayyil Alshammari,Praveen Rao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study evaluates the robustness of six AI detection tools against adversarial attacks on text generated by the LLM DeepSeek. The performance of these tools is significantly impaired by humanization, with accuracy dropping for all detectors, while few-shot techniques showed high classification accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: A gap exists in research on the detection of AI-generated text from the recently introduced LLM, DeepSeek. Investigating this can help improve detector robustness and better understand vulnerabilities to adversarial attacks.

Method: The study tested six AI detection tools and DeepSeek's own detection capability on text generated by DeepSeek. Adversarial techniques (paraphrasing and humanizing) were applied, and few-shot prompting with chain-of-thought reasoning was employed for classification.

Result: QuillBot and Copyleaks performed well on non-humanized attacks but suffered from reduced accuracy against humanization (71% and 58% respectively). Few-shot prompting and CoT reasoning with DeepSeek achieved high accuracy, misclassifying only one sample with five-shot prompting.

Conclusion: Despite advancements in AI detection tools, humanized adversarial attacks remain highly effective at deceiving detectors. However, few-shot prompting with reasoning shows promise for mitigating these challenges in AI and human-text classification.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have rapidly transformed the creation of written
materials. LLMs have led to questions about writing integrity, thereby driving
the creation of artificial intelligence (AI) detection technologies.
Adversarial attacks, such as standard and humanized paraphrasing, inhibit
detectors' ability to detect machine-generated text. Previous studies have
mainly focused on ChatGPT and other well-known LLMs and have shown varying
accuracy across detectors. However, there is a clear gap in the literature
about DeepSeek, a recently published LLM. Therefore, in this work, we
investigate whether six generally accessible AI detection tools -- AI Text
Classifier, Content Detector AI, Copyleaks, QuillBot, GPT-2, and GPTZero -- can
consistently recognize text generated by DeepSeek. The detectors were exposed
to the aforementioned adversarial attacks. We also considered DeepSeek as a
detector by performing few-shot prompting and chain-of-thought reasoning (CoT)
for classifying AI and human-written text. We collected 49 human-authored
question-answer pairs from before the LLM era and generated matching responses
using DeepSeek-v3, producing 49 AI-generated samples. Then, we applied
adversarial techniques such as paraphrasing and humanizing to add 196 more
samples. These were used to challenge detector robustness and assess accuracy
impact. While QuillBot and Copyleaks showed near-perfect performance on
original and paraphrased DeepSeek text, others -- particularly AI Text
Classifier and GPT-2 -- showed inconsistent results. The most effective attack
was humanization, reducing accuracy to 71% for Copyleaks, 58% for QuillBot, and
52% for GPTZero. Few-shot and CoT prompting showed high accuracy, with the best
five-shot result misclassifying only one of 49 samples (AI recall 96%, human
recall 100%).

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study investigates whether larger pre-trained language models align more closely with Bayesian principles when processing evidence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to understand if and how the cognitive abilities of large language models scale with size, sophistication, and training data, specifically in the context of Bayesian reasoning.

Method: The authors developed the Bayesian Coherence Coefficient (BCC) metric and constructed a dataset to evaluate the alignment of language model beliefs with Bayes' theorem. They compared different model families, parameter sizes, and benchmarks.

Result: Larger and more capable pre-trained language models demonstrated credences that were more consistent with Bayes' theorem.

Conclusion: The findings suggest that model scale correlates with Bayesian coherence, offering insights for better understanding and managing large language models.

Abstract: Do larger and more capable language models learn to update their "beliefs"
about propositions more consistently with Bayes' theorem when presented with
evidence in-context? To test this, we formulate a Bayesian Coherence
Coefficient (BCC) metric and generate a dataset with which to measure the BCC.
We measure BCC for multiple pre-trained-only language models across five model
families, comparing against the number of model parameters, the amount of
training data, and model scores on common benchmarks. Our results provide
evidence for our hypothesis that larger and more capable pre-trained language
models assign credences that are more coherent with Bayes' theorem. These
results have important implications for our understanding and governance of
LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TeleChat2, TeleChat2.5, and T1 models offer major performance improvements over TeleChat through enhanced training techniques, with T1 excelling in reasoning tasks and TeleChat2.5 optimized for speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create more capable language models for reasoning, coding, and general tasks, addressing performance and application-specific needs.

Method: Improved training strategies, including extensive pretraining, supervised fine-tuning, domain-specific continual pretraining, reinforcement learning, and optimization for reasoning.

Result: The upgraded models demonstrate better performance in mathematics, coding, and reasoning tasks, with T1 surpassing models like OpenAI's o1-mini and GPT-4o.

Conclusion: The released models provide state-of-the-art capabilities, encouraging wide adoption by developers and researchers for a variety of applications.

Abstract: We introduce the latest series of TeleChat models: \textbf{TeleChat2},
\textbf{TeleChat2.5}, and \textbf{T1}, offering a significant upgrade over
their predecessor, TeleChat. Despite minimal changes to the model architecture,
the new series achieves substantial performance gains through enhanced training
strategies in both pre-training and post-training stages. The series begins
with \textbf{TeleChat2}, which undergoes pretraining on 10 trillion
high-quality and diverse tokens. This is followed by Supervised Fine-Tuning
(SFT) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to further enhance its
capabilities. \textbf{TeleChat2.5} and \textbf{T1} expand the pipeline by
incorporating a continual pretraining phase with domain-specific datasets,
combined with reinforcement learning (RL) to improve performance in code
generation and mathematical reasoning tasks. The \textbf{T1} variant is
designed for complex reasoning, supporting long Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
reasoning and demonstrating substantial improvements in mathematics and coding.
In contrast, \textbf{TeleChat2.5} prioritizes speed, delivering rapid
inference. Both flagship models of \textbf{T1} and \textbf{TeleChat2.5} are
dense Transformer-based architectures with 115B parameters, showcasing
significant advancements in reasoning and general task performance compared to
the original TeleChat. Notably, \textbf{T1-115B} outperform proprietary models
such as OpenAI's o1-mini and GPT-4o. We publicly release \textbf{TeleChat2},
\textbf{TeleChat2.5} and \textbf{T1}, including post-trained versions with 35B

### [34] [NeuralDB: Scaling Knowledge Editing in LLMs to 100,000 Facts with Neural KV Database](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18028)
*Weizhi Fei,Hao Shi,Jing Xu,Jingchen Peng,Jiazheng Li,Jingzhao Zhang,Bo Bai,Wei Han,Zhenyuan Chen,Xueyan Niu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: NeuralDB is a new method for editing facts in large language models without compromising their general capabilities or scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to edit and update knowledge in large language models without degrading their general abilities or being limited by scalability challenges.

Method: NeuralDB utilizes a neural Key-Value database framework with a non-linear gated retrieval mechanism to ensure general capabilities preservation and efficient fact updates.

Result: NeuralDB outperformed others in editing effectiveness, generalization, specificity, fluency, and consistency while preserving general abilities across six tasks. It scales up to editing 100,000 facts.

Conclusion: NeuralDB offers a scalable and efficient solution for editing a large number of facts in LLMs without sacrificing their overall capabilities or performance.

Abstract: Efficiently editing knowledge stored in large language models (LLMs) enables
model updates without large-scale training. One possible solution is
Locate-and-Edit (L\&E), allowing simultaneous modifications of a massive number
of facts. However, such editing may compromise the general abilities of LLMs
and even result in forgetting edited facts when scaling up to thousands of
edits. In this paper, we model existing linear L\&E methods as querying a
Key-Value (KV) database. From this perspective, we then propose NeuralDB, an
editing framework that explicitly represents the edited facts as a neural KV
database equipped with a non-linear gated retrieval module, % In particular,
our gated module only operates when inference involves the edited facts,
effectively preserving the general abilities of LLMs. Comprehensive experiments
involving the editing of 10,000 facts were conducted on the ZsRE and
CounterFacts datasets, using GPT2-XL, GPT-J (6B) and Llama-3 (8B). The results
demonstrate that NeuralDB not only excels in editing efficacy, generalization,
specificity, fluency, and consistency, but also preserves overall performance
across six representative text understanding and generation tasks. Further
experiments indicate that NeuralDB maintains its effectiveness even when scaled
to 100,000 facts (\textbf{50x} more than in prior work).

### [35] [GrAInS: Gradient-based Attribution for Inference-Time Steering of LLMs and VLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18043)
*Duy Nguyen,Archiki Prasad,Elias Stengel-Eskin,Mohit Bansal*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GrAInS introduces an inference-time technique to steer LLMs and VLMs by utilizing gradient-based attribution for token-level control, outperforming existing methods without model retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current inference-time steering methods overlook individual token influence and fail to leverage key gradients from logits, especially in multimodal settings.

Method: GrAInS uses Integrated Gradients for token attribution and constructs steering vectors to adjust transformer activations during inference, enabling semantic steering based on token-level insights.

Result: GrAInS boosts accuracy on TruthfulQA (13.22%), reduces hallucination on MMHal-Bench (0.624 to 0.514), and improves alignment win rates on SPA-VL (8.11%), maintaining fluency and general capabilities.

Conclusion: The approach enables fine-grained and interpretable control over model behavior at inference-time without requiring model retraining or extra supervision.

Abstract: Inference-time steering methods offer a lightweight alternative to
fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs) by
modifying internal activations at test time without updating model weights.
However, most existing approaches rely on fixed, global intervention vectors,
overlook the causal influence of individual input tokens, and fail to leverage
informative gradients from the model's logits, particularly in multimodal
settings where visual and textual inputs contribute unevenly. To address these
limitations, we introduce GrAInS, an inference-time steering approach that
operates across both language-only and vision-language models and tasks. GrAInS
uses contrastive, gradient-based attribution via Integrated Gradients to
identify the top-k most influential tokens, both positively and negatively
attributed based on their contribution to preferred versus dispreferred
outputs. These tokens are then used to construct directional steering vectors
that capture semantic shifts from undesirable to desirable behavior. During
inference, GrAInS adjusts hidden activations at transformer layers guided by
token-level attribution signals, and normalizes activations to preserve
representational scale. This enables fine-grained, interpretable, and modular
control over model behavior, without retraining or auxiliary supervision.
Empirically, GrAInS consistently outperforms both fine-tuning and existing
steering baselines: it achieves a 13.22% accuracy gain on TruthfulQA using
Llama-3.1-8B, reduces hallucination rates on MMHal-Bench from 0.624 to 0.514
with LLaVA-1.6-7B, and improves alignment win rates on SPA-VL by 8.11%, all
while preserving the model's fluency and general capabilities.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Investigates using large language models (LLMs) to generate synthetic phrase break annotations for text-to-speech systems, minimizing reliance on manual annotations and improving efficiency across languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual annotation for phrase break prediction in text-to-speech systems is costly and inconsistent, and inherent speech domain variability exacerbates the challenge.

Method: Utilizes large language models (LLMs) to create synthetic phrase break annotations and evaluates their performance against traditional methods across multiple languages.

Result: Finds that LLM-generated synthetic data overcomes many challenges in manual annotation and performs effectively for phrase break prediction.

Conclusion: LLMs present a promising method for reducing reliance on manual efforts and addressing data challenges in speech-related tasks like phrase break prediction.

Abstract: Current approaches to phrase break prediction address crucial prosodic
aspects of text-to-speech systems but heavily rely on vast human annotations
from audio or text, incurring significant manual effort and cost. Inherent
variability in the speech domain, driven by phonetic factors, further
complicates acquiring consistent, high-quality data. Recently, large language
models (LLMs) have shown success in addressing data challenges in NLP by
generating tailored synthetic data while reducing manual annotation needs.
Motivated by this, we explore leveraging LLM to generate synthetic phrase break
annotations, addressing the challenges of both manual annotation and
speech-related tasks by comparing with traditional annotations and assessing
effectiveness across multiple languages. Our findings suggest that LLM-based
synthetic data generation effectively mitigates data challenges in phrase break
prediction and highlights the potential of LLMs as a viable solution for the
speech domain.

TL;DR: The paper evaluates the diversity and privacy risks of text-based synthetic data from Large Language Models (LLMs), proposing metrics and introducing a prompt-based technique to improve data quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With the growing use of synthetic data for model training, understanding its limitations in diversity and privacy is crucial for optimizing its potential.

Method: The authors present quantitative metrics to assess diversity and privacy, conduct experiments on state-of-the-art LLMs, and develop a prompt-based approach to address deficiencies.

Result: Experiments reveal significant limitations in the diversity and privacy preservation capabilities of synthetic data generated by LLMs.

Conclusion: Synthetic data generated by LLMs requires improvements in diversity and privacy, and the proposed prompt-based solution demonstrates potential in achieving these goals.

Abstract: The increasing use of synthetic data generated by Large Language Models
(LLMs) presents both opportunities and challenges in data-driven applications.
While synthetic data provides a cost-effective, scalable alternative to
real-world data to facilitate model training, its diversity and privacy risks
remain underexplored. Focusing on text-based synthetic data, we propose a
comprehensive set of metrics to quantitatively assess the diversity (i.e.,
linguistic expression, sentiment, and user perspective), and privacy (i.e.,
re-identification risk and stylistic outliers) of synthetic datasets generated
by several state-of-the-art LLMs. Experiment results reveal significant
limitations in LLMs' capabilities in generating diverse and privacy-preserving
synthetic data. Guided by the evaluation results, a prompt-based approach is
proposed to enhance the diversity of synthetic reviews while preserving
reviewer privacy.

TL;DR: The paper introduces TELEVAL, a new benchmark for evaluating spoken language models (SLMs) in realistic Chinese conversational settings, with a focus on implicit user cues and natural dialogue.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Evaluate spoken language models (SLMs) in a way that aligns with real-world conversational user interactions rather than focusing only on complex tasks.

Method: Proposed TELEVAL, a dynamic benchmark with three evaluation dimensions: Explicit Semantics, Paralinguistic and Implicit Semantics, and System Abilities. It separately evaluates text and audio in realistic conversation formats.

Result: Experiments show that recent SLMs still struggle with natural conversational tasks, highlighting the need for improvement.

Conclusion: TELEVAL offers a user-centered framework for assessing SLM capabilities in practical scenarios, promoting the development of better conversational models.

Abstract: Spoken language models (SLMs) have seen rapid progress in recent years, along
with the development of numerous benchmarks for evaluating their performance.
However, most existing benchmarks primarily focus on evaluating whether SLMs
can perform complex tasks comparable to those tackled by large language models
(LLMs), often failing to align with how users naturally interact in real-world
conversational scenarios. In this paper, we propose TELEVAL, a dynamic
benchmark specifically designed to evaluate SLMs' effectiveness as
conversational agents in realistic Chinese interactive settings. TELEVAL
defines three evaluation dimensions: Explicit Semantics, Paralinguistic and
Implicit Semantics, and System Abilities. It adopts a dialogue format
consistent with real-world usage and evaluates text and audio outputs
separately. TELEVAL particularly focuses on the model's ability to extract
implicit cues from user speech and respond appropriately without additional
instructions. Our experiments demonstrate that despite recent progress,
existing SLMs still have considerable room for improvement in natural
conversational tasks. We hope that TELEVAL can serve as a user-centered
evaluation framework that directly reflects the user experience and contributes
to the development of more capable dialogue-oriented SLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A novel hybrid fine-tuning approach integrates BOFT and LoRA-GA techniques, achieving superior efficiency and reduced computational costs in tuning large language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fine-tuning large language models is demanding in terms of computational resources and memory, necessitating more efficient strategies.

Method: The study combines BOFT's stability with LoRA-GA's convergence strategy using per-layer adaptive updates guided by gradient norms. It also explores unitary RNN principles for transformer-based LLMs.

Result: The hybrid approach outperformed existing PEFT techniques across benchmarks like GLUE, GSM8K, MT-Bench, and HumanEval, achieving up to 2.1x faster training and 50% less memory use while maintaining accuracy akin to full fine-tuning.

Conclusion: The proposed hybrid method is a scalable and resource-efficient solution for tuning large language models in practical settings.

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) remains a computational bottleneck
due to their scale and memory demands. This paper presents a comprehensive
evaluation of parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques, including
LoRA, BOFT, LoRA-GA, and uRNN, and introduces a novel hybrid strategy that
dynamically integrates BOFT's orthogonal stability with LoRA-GA's
gradient-aligned rapid convergence. By computing per-layer adaptive updates
guided by gradient norms, the hybrid method achieves superior convergence
efficiency and generalization across diverse tasks. We also explore, for the
first time, the adaptation of unitary RNN (uRNN) principles to
transformer-based LLMs, enhancing gradient stability through structured unitary
constraints. Empirical evaluations on four benchmarks -- GLUE, GSM8K, MT-Bench,
and HumanEval -- using models ranging from 7B to 405B parameters demonstrate
that our hybrid method consistently outperforms individual PEFT baselines,
approaching full fine-tuning accuracy while reducing resource consumption by up
to 2.1 times in training time and 50 percent in memory usage. These findings
establish the hybrid approach as a practical and scalable fine-tuning solution
for real-world deployment of LLMs under resource constraints.

TL;DR: This paper presents updated GloVe word embedding models (2024) with enhanced documentation and improved performance on recent tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the evolving nature of language and rectify the lack of proper documentation in the original 2014 GloVe models.

Method: Trained new embeddings using Wikipedia, Gigaword, and Dolma data, complemented with evaluations via vocabulary comparison, analogy, similarity tests, and NER task performance.

Result: The 2024 models include updated vocabulary, maintain structural performance, and excel in temporally dependent tasks like modern NER datasets.

Conclusion: The updated GloVe 2024 models provide more culturally and linguistically relevant embeddings and are better aligned with contemporary tasks.

Abstract: This report documents, describes, and evaluates new 2024 English GloVe
(Global Vectors for Word Representation) models. While the original GloVe
models built in 2014 have been widely used and found useful, languages and the
world continue to evolve and we thought that current usage could benefit from
updated models. Moreover, the 2014 models were not carefully documented as to
the exact data versions and preprocessing that were used, and we rectify this
by documenting these new models. We trained two sets of word embeddings using
Wikipedia, Gigaword, and a subset of Dolma. Evaluation through vocabulary
comparison, direct testing, and NER tasks shows that the 2024 vectors
incorporate new culturally and linguistically relevant words, perform
comparably on structural tasks like analogy and similarity, and demonstrate
improved performance on recent, temporally dependent NER datasets such as
non-Western newswire data.

*Hongjie Chen,Zehan Li,Yaodong Song,Wenming Deng,Yitong Yao,Yuxin Zhang,Hang Lv,Xuechao Zhu,Jian Kang,Jie Lian,Jie Li,Chao Wang,Shuangyong Song,Yongxiang Li,Zhongjiang He*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces GOAT-SLM, a spoken language model that incorporates paralinguistic and speaker-specific cues beyond basic text semantics, outperforming existing models in aspects like emotion, dialect, and age detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most spoken language models focus exclusively on speech as a carrier for textual information, neglecting paralinguistic cues such as emotion, dialect, and age, which are integral to natural interactions.

Method: The authors propose a dual-modality head architecture to separate linguistic processing from acoustic realization. They also implement a modular training method aligning speech-text corpora progressively with paralinguistic and speaker characteristics.

Result: Experiments on the TELEVAL benchmark show GOAT-SLM achieves balanced performance on semantic and non-semantic tasks, excelling in handling emotion, dialectal variations, and age-sensitive contexts compared to existing models.

Conclusion: GOAT-SLM represents a significant step forward in creating adaptive and socially aware spoken language systems, emphasizing the need to model paralinguistic and speaker-specific characteristics in tandem with linguistic content.

Abstract: Recent advances in end-to-end spoken language models (SLMs) have
significantly improved the ability of AI systems to engage in natural spoken
interactions. However, most existing models treat speech merely as a vehicle
for linguistic content, often overlooking the rich paralinguistic and speaker
characteristic cues embedded in human speech, such as dialect, age, emotion,
and non-speech vocalizations. In this work, we introduce GOAT-SLM, a novel
spoken language model with paralinguistic and speaker characteristic awareness,
designed to extend spoken language modeling beyond text semantics. GOAT-SLM
adopts a dual-modality head architecture that decouples linguistic modeling
from acoustic realization, enabling robust language understanding while
supporting expressive and adaptive speech generation. To enhance model
efficiency and versatility, we propose a modular, staged training strategy that
progressively aligns linguistic, paralinguistic, and speaker characteristic
information using large-scale speech-text corpora. Experimental results on
TELEVAL, a multi-dimensional evaluation benchmark, demonstrate that GOAT-SLM
achieves well-balanced performance across both semantic and non-semantic tasks,
and outperforms existing open-source models in handling emotion, dialectal
variation, and age-sensitive interactions. This work highlights the importance
of modeling beyond linguistic content and advances the development of more
natural, adaptive, and socially aware spoken language systems.

*Xiaoyuan Li,Moxin Li,Wenjie Wang,Rui Men,Yichang Zhang,Fuli Feng,Dayiheng Liu,Junyang Lin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study evaluates Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in performing visual operations via code in mathematical reasoning, showing that current models underperform compared to humans.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a lack of study assessing the precise ability of MLLMs to perform visual operations through code in multi-modal mathematical reasoning.

Method: The paper proposes a framework with two evaluation tasks: Multi-modal Code Generation (MCG) to assess visualization from scratch, and Multi-modal Code Editing (MCE) for fine-grained operations like Deletion, Modification, and Annotation. A dataset with various mathematical figures supports evaluation.

Result: Experimental evaluation of nine MLLMs demonstrates significant underperformance compared to human capabilities in executing fine-grained visual operations.

Conclusion: There is substantial room for advancement in MLLMs' code-based multi-modal reasoning capabilities, as current models cannot yet match human proficiency in this domain.

Abstract: Recent progress in Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has enabled
step-by-step multi-modal mathematical reasoning by performing visual operations
based on the textual instructions. A promising approach uses code as an
intermediate representation to precisely express and manipulate the images in
the reasoning steps. However, existing evaluations focus mainly on text-only
reasoning outputs, leaving the MLLM's ability to perform accurate visual
operations via code largely unexplored. This work takes a first step toward
addressing that gap by evaluating MLLM's code-based capabilities in multi-modal
mathematical reasoning.Specifically, our framework focuses on two key
evaluation aspects: (1) Multi-modal Code Generation (MCG) evaluates the model's
ability to accurately understand and construct visualizations from scratch. (2)
Multi-modal Code Editing (MCE) assesses the model's capacity for fine-grained
operations, which include three types: Deletion, Modification and Annotation.
To evaluate the above tasks, we incorporate a dataset that covers the five most
popular types of mathematical figures, including geometric diagrams, function
plots, and three types of statistical charts, to provide a comprehensive and
effective measurement of existing MLLMs. Our experimental evaluation involves
nine mainstream MLLMs, and the results reveal that existing models still lag
significantly behind human performance in performing fine-grained visual
operations.

*Gonzalo Cardenal Antolin,Jacques Fellay,Bashkim Jaha,Roger Kouyos,Niko Beerenwinkel,Diane Duroux*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study evaluates the performance of large language models (LLMs) in HIV clinical care, introducing the HIVMedQA benchmark to assess their capabilities in medical question answering. Results indicate varying performance, with challenges in reasoning and comprehension.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the need to evaluate LLMs in HIV care due to the complexity of management and the lack of existing benchmarks for assessing their performance.

Method: The researchers introduced HIVMedQA, a benchmark dataset for HIV-related open-ended medical questions. They assessed seven general-purpose and three medically specialized LLMs using prompt engineering and evaluation metrics like lexical similarity and LLM-as-a-judge approaches.

Result: Gemini 2.5 Pro outperformed other models, though performance declined with increasing question complexity. General-purpose models sometimes outperformed medically fine-tuned ones, and model size was not always indicative of performance.

Conclusion: LLMs show promise but have limitations in reasoning, comprehension, and clinical biases. Targeted development and rigorous evaluation are essential for their safe integration into clinical care.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as valuable tools to support
clinicians in routine decision-making. HIV management is a compelling use case
due to its complexity, including diverse treatment options, comorbidities, and
adherence challenges. However, integrating LLMs into clinical practice raises
concerns about accuracy, potential harm, and clinician acceptance. Despite
their promise, AI applications in HIV care remain underexplored, and LLM
benchmarking studies are scarce. This study evaluates the current capabilities
of LLMs in HIV management, highlighting their strengths and limitations. We
introduce HIVMedQA, a benchmark designed to assess open-ended medical question
answering in HIV care. The dataset consists of curated, clinically relevant
questions developed with input from an infectious disease physician. We
evaluated seven general-purpose and three medically specialized LLMs, applying
prompt engineering to enhance performance. Our evaluation framework
incorporates both lexical similarity and an LLM-as-a-judge approach, extended
to better reflect clinical relevance. We assessed performance across key
dimensions: question comprehension, reasoning, knowledge recall, bias,
potential harm, and factual accuracy. Results show that Gemini 2.5 Pro
consistently outperformed other models across most dimensions. Notably, two of
the top three models were proprietary. Performance declined as question
complexity increased. Medically fine-tuned models did not always outperform
general-purpose ones, and larger model size was not a reliable predictor of
performance. Reasoning and comprehension were more challenging than factual
recall, and cognitive biases such as recency and status quo were observed.
These findings underscore the need for targeted development and evaluation to
ensure safe, effective LLM integration in clinical care.

### [44] [Sticking to the Mean: Detecting Sticky Tokens in Text Embedding Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18171)
*Kexin Chen,Dongxia Wang,Yi Liu,Haonan Zhang,Wenhai Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper identifies and investigates anomalous 'sticky tokens' that disrupt transformer-based text embedding models, introducing an efficient detection method and revealing their prevalence and severity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate the factors undermining the reliability of Transformer-based text embeddings caused by anomalous tokens called 'sticky tokens.'

Method: Defined sticky tokens, developed the Sticky Token Detector (STD) for detection, and applied it to 40 checkpoints from 14 model families. Conducted analyses including impact on downstream tasks and attention-layer representation.

Result: Identified 868 sticky tokens, revealing their origins and showing their effects on downstream tasks with performance drops of up to 50%. These tokens disproportionately dominate models' internal representations, independent of model or vocabulary size.

Conclusion: Sticky tokens pose significant challenges to tokenization robustness and embedding-based tasks, necessitating improved tokenization strategies and model design in NLP applications.

Abstract: Despite the widespread use of Transformer-based text embedding models in NLP
tasks, surprising 'sticky tokens' can undermine the reliability of embeddings.
These tokens, when repeatedly inserted into sentences, pull sentence similarity
toward a certain value, disrupting the normal distribution of embedding
distances and degrading downstream performance. In this paper, we
systematically investigate such anomalous tokens, formally defining them and
introducing an efficient detection method, Sticky Token Detector (STD), based
on sentence and token filtering. Applying STD to 40 checkpoints across 14 model
families, we discover a total of 868 sticky tokens. Our analysis reveals that
these tokens often originate from special or unused entries in the vocabulary,
as well as fragmented subwords from multilingual corpora. Notably, their
presence does not strictly correlate with model size or vocabulary size. We
further evaluate how sticky tokens affect downstream tasks like clustering and
retrieval, observing significant performance drops of up to 50%. Through
attention-layer analysis, we show that sticky tokens disproportionately
dominate the model's internal representations, raising concerns about
tokenization robustness. Our findings show the need for better tokenization
strategies and model design to mitigate the impact of sticky tokens in future
text embedding applications.

### [45] [SCOPE: Stochastic and Counterbiased Option Placement for Evaluating Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18182)
*Wonjun Jeong,Dongseok Kim,Taegkeun Whangbo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes SCOPE, a framework to address selection bias in Large Language Models (LLMs) by equalizing answer options and restructuring question placement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issue of inflated performance scores in LLMs caused by inherent selection biases, which hinder accurate evaluation of these models.

Method: SCOPE estimates position-bias distributions using null prompts and redistributes answer slots based on inverse-bias. It also prevents distractors from being placed adjacent to correct answers.

Result: SCOPE demonstrated consistent and stable improvements over existing methods in benchmark experiments, along with clearer confidence distributions for correct options.

Conclusion: SCOPE enhances fairness and reliability in LLM evaluations by mitigating selection bias, setting a new standard for evaluation frameworks.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can achieve inflated scores on multiple-choice
tasks by exploiting inherent biases in option positions or labels, rather than
demonstrating genuine understanding. This study introduces SCOPE, an evaluation
framework designed to measure and mitigate such selection bias in a
dataset-independent manner. By repeatedly invoking a null prompt that lacks
semantic content, SCOPE estimates each model's unique position-bias
distribution. It then redistributes the answer slot according to the
inverse-bias distribution, thereby equalizing the lucky-rate, the probability
of selecting the correct answer by chance. Furthermore, it prevents
semantically similar distractors from being placed adjacent to the answer,
thereby blocking near-miss guesses based on superficial proximity cues. Across
multiple benchmark experiments, SCOPE consistently outperformed existing
debiasing methods in terms of stable performance improvements and showed
clearer confidence distributions over correct options. This framework thus
offers a new standard for enhancing the fairness and reliability of LLM
evaluations.

Result: Highlights significant challenges and needs for realistic benchmarks in graph-based reasoning.

Conclusion: Presents the need to address AI's limitations and benchmark scarcity in RCA for telecom networks.

Abstract: Root Cause Analysis (RCA) in telecommunication networks is a critical task,
yet it presents a formidable challenge for Artificial Intelligence (AI) due to
its complex, graph-based reasoning requirements and the scarcity of realistic
benchmarks.

*Aline Belloni,Patrick Prieur*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper discusses how ISO30401-compliant Knowledge Management Systems integrate with organizational processes, focusing on using SECI model mechanisms in PDCA cycles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of explaining to clients how ISO30401-compliant Knowledge Management Systems (KMS) integrate with existing operational processes.

Method: The authors recapped process modeling principles in ISO9001 and explored how ISO30401 KMS ties into integrated management systems using the SECI model and PDCA cycles.

Result: The paper provides a clearer framework of how knowledge management activities align with operational processes, leveraging established models like SECI and PDCA.

Conclusion: An ISO30401-compliant KMS can be effectively implemented within an organization’s integrated management system by utilizing SECI model techniques in PDCA cycles.

Abstract: Business process modeling is used by most organizations as an essential
framework for ensuring efficiency and effectiveness of the work and workflow
performed by its employees and for ensuring the alignment of such work with its
strategic goals. For organizations that are compliant or near-compliant with
ISO 9001, this approach involves the detailed mapping of processes,
sub-processes, activities, and tasks. ISO30401 is a Management System Standard,
introduced in 2018, establishing universal requirements for the set up of a
Knowledge Management System in an organization. As ``ISO30401 implementers'' we
regularly face the challenge of explaining our clients how the knowledge
development, transformation and conveyances activities depicted in ISO30401 do
integrate with existing operational processes. This article recaps process
modelling principles in the context of ISO9001 and explores, based on our
experience, how an ISO30401-compliant Knowledge Management System (KMS)
entwines with all other processes of an Integrated Management System and in
particular how it can be implemented by deploying the mechanisms of the SECI
model through the steps of PDCA cycles.

### [48] [Safeguarding RAG Pipelines with GMTP: A Gradient-based Masked Token Probability Method for Poisoned Document Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18202)
*San Kim,Jonghwi Kim,Yejin Jeon,Gary Geunbae Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces GMTP, a defense method designed to identify and filter poisoned documents in Retrieval-Augmented Generation systems, achieving over 90% success rate.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the security risks of Retrieval-Augmented Generation methods in LLMs, particularly the vulnerability to poisoned documents in external knowledge bases.

Method: The proposed method, GMTP, analyzes gradients of the retriever's similarity function to identify impactful tokens and uses a Masked Language Model to assess their probabilities for detecting adversarial documents.

Result: Experiments show that GMTP successfully eliminates over 90% of poisoned content without significantly impacting the retrieval of relevant documents.

Conclusion: GMTP is an effective defense mechanism that enhances the security of Retrieval-Augmented Generation systems by filtering adversarial content and ensuring reliable performance in diverse settings.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances Large Language Models (LLMs) by
providing external knowledge for accurate and up-to-date responses. However,
this reliance on external sources exposes a security risk, attackers can inject
poisoned documents into the knowledge base to steer the generation process
toward harmful or misleading outputs. In this paper, we propose Gradient-based
Masked Token Probability (GMTP), a novel defense method to detect and filter
out adversarially crafted documents. Specifically, GMTP identifies high-impact
tokens by examining gradients of the retriever's similarity function. These key
tokens are then masked, and their probabilities are checked via a Masked
Language Model (MLM). Since injected tokens typically exhibit markedly low
masked-token probabilities, this enables GMTP to easily detect malicious
documents and achieve high-precision filtering. Experiments demonstrate that
GMTP is able to eliminate over 90% of poisoned content while retaining relevant
documents, thus maintaining robust retrieval and generation performance across
diverse datasets and adversarial settings.

### [49] [Exploring the Impact of Instruction-Tuning on LLM's Susceptibility to Misinformation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18203)
*Kyubeen Han,Junseo Jang,Hongjin Kim,Geunyeong Jeong,Harksoo Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Instruction-tuning in large language models (LLMs) improves their ability to follow user instructions but also increases their susceptibility to misinformation, especially when presented by the user.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigating how instruction-tuning impacts the susceptibility of LLMs to misinformation, as current research lacks detailed analysis of this effect.

Method: The study involves analyzing instruction-tuned LLMs to assess their likelihood of accepting misinformation compared to non-tuned base models. Additional factors like prompt structure and system warnings are explored.

Result: Instruction-tuned LLMs are significantly more prone to accepting misinformation when provided by the user compared to base models.

Conclusion: Instruction-tuning, while enhancing usability, shifts LLMs' susceptibility to misinformation from their parametric knowledge to user input, necessitating systematic solutions to mitigate this vulnerability.

Abstract: Instruction-tuning enhances the ability of large language models (LLMs) to
follow user instructions more accurately, improving usability while reducing
harmful outputs. However, this process may increase the model's dependence on
user input, potentially leading to the unfiltered acceptance of misinformation
and the generation of hallucinations. Existing studies primarily highlight that
LLMs are receptive to external information that contradict their parametric
knowledge, but little research has been conducted on the direct impact of
instruction-tuning on this phenomenon. In our study, we investigate the impact
of instruction-tuning on LLM's susceptibility to misinformation. Our analysis
reveals that instruction-tuned LLMs are significantly more likely to accept
misinformation when it is presented by the user. A comparison with base models
shows that instruction-tuning increases reliance on user-provided information,
shifting susceptibility from the assistant role to the user role. Furthermore,
we explore additional factors influencing misinformation susceptibility, such
as the role of the user in prompt structure, misinformation length, and the
presence of warnings in the system prompt. Our findings underscore the need for
systematic approaches to mitigate unintended consequences of instruction-tuning
and enhance the reliability of LLMs in real-world applications.

*Xinrui Chen,Hongxing Zhang,Fanyi Zeng,Yongxian Wei,Yizhi Wang,Xitong Ling,Guanghao Li,Chun Yuan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes Prune&Comp, a method to improve layer pruning in large language models by addressing performance degradation caused by removing layers, achieving better results with no runtime overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address significant performance degradation in LLMs caused by the magnitude gap in hidden states after layer removal during layer pruning.

Method: The method involves estimating the magnitude gap caused by layer pruning, and then rescaling the remaining weights offline to compensate for it, all done in a training-free manner.

Result: Prune&Comp enhances layer pruning metrics, nearly halves perplexity, and retains 93.19% of the original model's QA performance while outperforming baselines by 4.01%.

Conclusion: Prune&Comp effectively mitigates performance degradation from layer pruning in LLMs, offering a simple and efficient solution with substantial improvements in key metrics.

Abstract: Layer pruning has emerged as a promising technique for compressing large
language models (LLMs) while achieving acceleration proportional to the pruning
ratio. In this work, we identify that removing any layer induces a significant
magnitude gap in hidden states, resulting in substantial performance
degradation. To address this issue, we propose Prune&Comp, a novel
plug-and-play layer pruning scheme that leverages magnitude compensation to
mitigate such gaps in a training-free manner. Specifically, we first estimate
the magnitude gap caused by layer removal and then eliminate this gap by
rescaling the remaining weights offline, with zero runtime overhead incurred.
We further demonstrate the advantages of Prune&Comp through an iterative
pruning strategy. When integrated with an iterative prune-and-compensate loop,
Prune&Comp consistently enhances existing layer pruning metrics. For instance,
when 5 layers of LLaMA-3-8B are pruned using the prevalent block influence
metric, Prune&Comp nearly halves the perplexity and retains 93.19\% of the
original model's question-answering performance, outperforming the baseline by
4.01%.

*Suhang Wu,Jialong Tang,Chengyi Yang,Pei Zhang,Baosong Yang,Junhui Li,Junfeng Yao,Min Zhang,Jinsong Su*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses challenges in accurately translating terminology in speech translation and introduces a novel "Locate-and-Focus" method to improve translation quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Direct speech translation struggles with accurately translating terminology due to interference and incomplete use of translation knowledge.

Method: The proposed method identifies terminology in speech clips to construct translation knowledge and integrates this knowledge using both audio and text modalities for focused translation.

Result: Experimental results validate that the method effectively locates terminology and improves translation success rate while retaining overall translation quality.

Conclusion: The "Locate-and-Focus" method enhances the translation accuracy for terminology in speech translation without compromising general performance.

Abstract: Direct speech translation (ST) has garnered increasing attention nowadays,
yet the accurate translation of terminology within utterances remains a great
challenge. In this regard, current studies mainly concentrate on leveraging
various translation knowledge into ST models. However, these methods often
struggle with interference from irrelevant noise and can not fully utilize the
translation knowledge. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose a
novel Locate-and-Focus method for terminology translation. It first effectively
locates the speech clips containing terminologies within the utterance to
construct translation knowledge, minimizing irrelevant information for the ST
model. Subsequently, it associates the translation knowledge with the utterance
and hypothesis from both audio and textual modalities, allowing the ST model to
better focus on translation knowledge during translation. Experimental results
across various datasets demonstrate that our method effectively locates
terminologies within utterances and enhances the success rate of terminology
translation, while maintaining robust general translation performance.

*Nevidu Jayatilleke,Nisansa de Silva*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study evaluates six OCR engines for low-resourced languages, Sinhala and Tamil, comparing their performances on character and word-level accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the ongoing challenge of OCR for low-resourced languages with unique scripts, which remains an unresolved issue.

Method: The paper conducts a comparative analysis of six OCR engines, using five evaluation methods, to test character and word-level accuracy for Sinhala and Tamil.

Result: Surya demonstrated the best OCR performance for Sinhala with a WER of 2.61%, while Document AI excelled for Tamil with a CER of 0.78%.

Conclusion: Different engines excel in specific languages, indicating the need for specialized approaches in OCR engine development for low-resourced scripts.

Abstract: Solving the problem of Optical Character Recognition (OCR) on printed text
for Latin and its derivative scripts can now be considered settled due to the
volumes of research done on English and other High-Resourced Languages (HRL).
However, for Low-Resourced Languages (LRL) that use unique scripts, it remains
an open problem. This study presents a comparative analysis of the zero-shot
performance of six distinct OCR engines on two LRLs: Sinhala and Tamil. The
selected engines include both commercial and open-source systems, aiming to
evaluate the strengths of each category. The Cloud Vision API, Surya, Document
AI, and Tesseract were evaluated for both Sinhala and Tamil, while Subasa OCR
and EasyOCR were examined for only one language due to their limitations. The
performance of these systems was rigorously analysed using five measurement
techniques to assess accuracy at both the character and word levels. According
to the findings, Surya delivered the best performance for Sinhala across all
metrics, with a WER of 2.61%. Conversely, Document AI excelled across all
metrics for Tamil, highlighted by a very low CER of 0.78%. In addition to the
above analysis, we also introduce a novel synthetic Tamil OCR benchmarking
dataset.

TL;DR: This paper presents StyleAdaptedLM, an approach for adapting large language models (LLMs) to specific stylistic traits using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) while maintaining instruction adherence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for enterprises to adapt LLMs to specific stylistic characteristics, like brand voice and authorial tones, for effective communication.

Method: Training LoRA adapters on unstructured stylistic corpora and merging them with instruction-following models to enable stylistic customization without paired data.

Result: Experiments show enhanced stylistic consistency and instruction adherence, with human evaluations confirming the adoption of brand-specific conventions.

Conclusion: StyleAdaptedLM provides an efficient way to personalize LLMs stylistically without sacrificing task performance.

Abstract: Adapting LLMs to specific stylistic characteristics, like brand voice or
authorial tones, is crucial for enterprise communication but challenging to
achieve from corpora which lacks instruction-response formatting without
compromising instruction adherence. We introduce StyleAdaptedLM, a framework
that efficiently transfers stylistic traits to instruction-following models
using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). LoRA adapters are first trained on a base
model with diverse unstructured stylistic corpora, then merged with a separate
instruction-following model. This enables robust stylistic customization
without paired data or sacrificing task performance. Experiments across
multiple datasets and models demonstrate improved stylistic consistency while
preserving instruction adherence, with human evaluations confirming
brand-specific convention uptake. StyleAdaptedLM offers an efficient path for
stylistic personalization in LLMs.

*Biao Yi,Zekun Fei,Jianing Geng,Tong Li,Lihai Nie,Zheli Liu,Yiming Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes an attack termed “overthinking backdoors” for large reasoning models (LRMs), enabling control over their reasoning verbosity without loss of correctness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore potential vulnerabilities in large reasoning models (LRMs), which could exploit their chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning strengths, focusing on a resource consumption attack vector.

Method: A novel data poisoning technique pairs a tunable trigger (via repetition) with verbose but correct CoT responses, generated by an LLM trained to add redundant refinement steps.

Result: The attack reliably increases the reasoning verbosity of LRMs without compromising the correctness of outputs, proven across different models.

Conclusion: The study introduces a stealthy, resource-focused backdoor attack mechanism on LRMs, advancing our understanding of their vulnerabilities while maintaining output fidelity.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have emerged as a significant advancement in
artificial intelligence, representing a specialized class of large language
models (LLMs) designed to tackle complex reasoning tasks. The defining
characteristic of LRMs lies in their extensive chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning
capabilities. In this paper, we identify a previously unexplored attack vector
against LRMs, which we term "overthinking backdoors". We advance this concept
by proposing a novel tunable backdoor, which moves beyond simple on/off attacks
to one where an attacker can precisely control the extent of the model's
reasoning verbosity. Our attack is implemented through a novel data poisoning
methodology. It pairs a tunable trigger-where the number of repetitions signals
the desired intensity-with a correspondingly verbose CoT response. These
responses are programmatically generated by instructing a teacher LLM to inject
a controlled number of redundant refinement steps into a correct reasoning
process. The approach preserves output correctness, which ensures stealth and
establishes the attack as a pure resource-consumption vector. Extensive
empirical results on various LRMs demonstrate that our method can reliably
trigger a controllable, multi-fold increase in the length of the reasoning
process, without degrading the final answer's correctness. Our source code is

*Ieva Raminta Staliūnaitė,Julius Cheng,Andreas Vlachos*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper investigates gender bias in machine translation (MT), highlighting how models should reflect uncertainty when gender is ambiguous but often rely on stereotypes instead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing gender biases in MT models to improve their handling of sentences with ambiguous or context-dependent gender requirements.

Method: Utilized semantic uncertainty metrics to analyze how MT models handle both unambiguous and ambiguous gender instances, alongside studying the impact of debiasing techniques.

Result: Findings indicate that high accuracy in gender and translation does not equate with proper uncertainty handling in ambiguous cases, and debiasing methods influence ambiguous and unambiguous contexts differently.

Conclusion: MT models need improvement in reflecting uncertainty for ambiguous gender cases and better debiasing approaches to address stereotypes effectively.

Abstract: In machine translation (MT), when the source sentence includes a lexeme whose
gender is not overtly marked, but whose target-language equivalent requires
gender specification, the model must infer the appropriate gender from the
context and/or external knowledge. Studies have shown that MT models exhibit
biased behaviour, relying on stereotypes even when they clash with contextual
information. We posit that apart from confidently translating using the correct
gender when it is evident from the input, models should also maintain
uncertainty about the gender when it is ambiguous. Using recently proposed
metrics of semantic uncertainty, we find that models with high translation and
gender accuracy on unambiguous instances do not necessarily exhibit the
expected level of uncertainty in ambiguous ones. Similarly, debiasing has
independent effects on ambiguous and unambiguous translation instances.

*Yifu Chen,Bingchen Huang,Zhiling Wang,Yuanchao Du,Junfeng Luo,Lei Shen,Zhineng chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces TDR, a framework addressing challenges in retrieving effective examples for in-context learning with LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods face challenges in retrieving high-quality examples for in-context learning due to issues with cross-task data distribution distinctions and fine-grained connections between retriever outputs and LLM feedback.

Method: The authors propose TDR, which decouples examples across different tasks and incorporates fine-grained feedback from LLMs to guide retrieval module training.

Result: Experiments across 30 NLP tasks demonstrate consistent improvements and state-of-the-art performance for the TDR framework.

Conclusion: TDR offers a plug-and-play solution that can enhance example retrieval for various LLMs, improving in-context learning capabilities significantly.

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) has become a classic approach for enabling LLMs to
handle various tasks based on a few input-output examples. The effectiveness of
ICL heavily relies on the quality of these examples, and previous works which
focused on enhancing example retrieval capabilities have achieved impressive
performances. However, two challenges remain in retrieving high-quality
examples: (1) Difficulty in distinguishing cross-task data distributions, (2)
Difficulty in making the fine-grained connection between retriever output and
feedback from LLMs. In this paper, we propose a novel framework called TDR. TDR
decouples the ICL examples from different tasks, which enables the retrieval
module to retrieve examples specific to the target task within a multi-task
dataset. Furthermore, TDR models fine-grained feedback from LLMs to supervise
and guide the training of the retrieval module, which helps to retrieve
high-quality examples. We conducted extensive experiments on a suite of 30 NLP
tasks, the results demonstrate that TDR consistently improved results across
all datasets and achieves state-of-the-art performance. Meanwhile, our approach
is a plug-and-play method, which can be easily combined with various LLMs to
improve example retrieval abilities for ICL. The code is available at

TL;DR: This paper presents a framework combining human expertise and Large Language Model (LLM) assistance to improve propaganda detection on social media by enhancing annotation consistency and scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address challenges in propaganda detection on social media, which include task complexity and the lack of high-quality labeled data.

Method: The authors propose a hierarchical taxonomy for propaganda techniques, conduct human and machine-assisted annotation studies to improve label consistency and efficiency, and use LLMs for pre-annotation. Smaller language models are fine-tuned using high-quality LLM-generated data via knowledge distillation.

Result: The approach led to significant improvements in annotation agreement and time efficiency while enabling smaller models to perform structured annotations effectively.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates a scalable, robust, and efficient strategy for propaganda detection, contributing to transparent and accountable media ecosystems, aligned with SDG 16.

Abstract: Propaganda detection on social media remains challenging due to task
complexity and limited high-quality labeled data. This paper introduces a novel
framework that combines human expertise with Large Language Model (LLM)
assistance to improve both annotation consistency and scalability. We propose a
hierarchical taxonomy that organizes 14 fine-grained propaganda techniques into
three broader categories, conduct a human annotation study on the HQP dataset
that reveals low inter-annotator agreement for fine-grained labels, and
implement an LLM-assisted pre-annotation pipeline that extracts propagandistic
spans, generates concise explanations, and assigns local labels as well as a
global label. A secondary human verification study shows significant
improvements in both agreement and time-efficiency. Building on this, we
fine-tune smaller language models (SLMs) to perform structured annotation.
Instead of fine-tuning on human annotations, we train on high-quality
LLM-generated data, allowing a large model to produce these annotations and a
smaller model to learn to generate them via knowledge distillation. Our work
contributes towards the development of scalable and robust propaganda detection
systems, supporting the idea of transparent and accountable media ecosystems in
line with SDG 16. The code is publicly available at our GitHub repository.

### [58] [CLEAR: Error Analysis via LLM-as-a-Judge Made Easy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18392)
*Asaf Yehudai,Lilach Eden,Yotam Perlitz,Roy Bar-Haim,Michal Shmueli-Scheuer*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CLEAR offers an interactive tool for detailed LLM error analysis, addressing the 'why' behind performance differences with feedback, error categorization, and visual aid.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Although LLM evaluation increasingly relies on other LLMs, current methods only provide overarching scores or rankings, lacking actionable insights into specific performance issues.

Method: CLEAR generates instance-level feedback, identifies system-level error issues, quantifies their prevalence, and offers interactive data visualization in an open-source dashboard.

Result: CLEAR is demonstrated on RAG and Math benchmarks, revealing specific performance dynamics and usefulness through a user case study.

Conclusion: CLEAR enables actionable error analysis for LLMs, filling the gap between simple scoring and in-depth understanding of performance issues.

Abstract: The evaluation of Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly relies on other
LLMs acting as judges. However, current evaluation paradigms typically yield a
single score or ranking, answering which model is better but not why. While
essential for benchmarking, these top-level scores obscure the specific,
actionable reasons behind a model's performance. To bridge this gap, we
introduce CLEAR, an interactive, open-source package for LLM-based error
analysis. CLEAR first generates per-instance textual feedback, then it creates
a set of system-level error issues, and quantifies the prevalence of each
identified issue. Our package also provides users with an interactive dashboard
that allows for a comprehensive error analysis through aggregate
visualizations, applies interactive filters to isolate specific issues or score
ranges, and drills down to the individual instances that exemplify a particular
behavioral pattern. We demonstrate CLEAR analysis for RAG and Math benchmarks,
and showcase its utility through a user case study.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper examines cross-lingual inconsistencies in Wikipedia's multilingual tabular data and analyzes these discrepancies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address factual inconsistencies across Wikipedia's different language pages, which impact its reliability and AI systems trained on its data.

Method: Developed a methodology to collect, align, and analyze tabular data from Wikipedia in multiple languages, defining inconsistency categories and applying both qualitative and quantitative metrics.

Result: Identified various types of inconsistencies in multilingual Wikipedia tables, highlighting implications for factual verification and AI system design.

Conclusion: Insights into inconsistencies can help improve the neutrality and reliability of Wikipedia and support more robust AI systems leveraging its content.

Abstract: Wikipedia serves as a globally accessible knowledge source with content in
over 300 languages. Despite covering the same topics, the different versions of
Wikipedia are written and updated independently. This leads to factual
inconsistencies that can impact the neutrality and reliability of the
encyclopedia and AI systems, which often rely on Wikipedia as a main training
source. This study investigates cross-lingual inconsistencies in Wikipedia's
structured content, with a focus on tabular data. We developed a methodology to
collect, align, and analyze tables from Wikipedia multilingual articles,
defining categories of inconsistency. We apply various quantitative and
qualitative metrics to assess multilingual alignment using a sample dataset.
These insights have implications for factual verification, multilingual
knowledge interaction, and design for reliable AI systems leveraging Wikipedia
content.

### [60] [FinDPO: Financial Sentiment Analysis for Algorithmic Trading through Preference Optimization of LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18417)
*Giorgos Iacovides,Wuyang Zhou,Danilo Mandic*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces FinDPO, a finance-specific framework that leverages Direct Preference Optimization for sentiment analysis, achieving improved performance and providing practical applications in portfolio strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Financial sentiment analysis plays a critical role in influencing trading decisions and market trends. Current approaches using supervised fine-tuning of large language models often struggle with memorization and fail to generalize to unseen financial scenarios, necessitating better adaptation methods.

Method: The paper utilizes Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) for post-training human preference alignment in large language models, tailoring them for the finance domain. It also introduces a 'logit-to-score' conversion to translate sentiment predictions into actionable continuous probabilities for portfolio strategies.

Result: FinDPO outperforms existing fine-tuned sentiment analysis models by an 11% margin on benchmarks. It demonstrates actionable financial utility by generating a 67% annual return and a Sharpe ratio of 2.0 under realistic transaction cost conditions.

Conclusion: FinDPO provides a substantial advancement in financial sentiment analysis by achieving state-of-the-art performance and enabling seamless integration into investment strategies, showcasing its practical and theoretical merits.

Abstract: Opinions expressed in online finance-related textual data are having an
increasingly profound impact on trading decisions and market movements. This
trend highlights the vital role of sentiment analysis as a tool for quantifying
the nature and strength of such opinions. With the rapid development of
Generative AI (GenAI), supervised fine-tuned (SFT) large language models (LLMs)
have become the de facto standard for financial sentiment analysis. However,
the SFT paradigm can lead to memorization of the training data and often fails
to generalize to unseen samples. This is a critical limitation in financial
domains, where models must adapt to previously unobserved events and the
nuanced, domain-specific language of finance. To this end, we introduce FinDPO,
the first finance-specific LLM framework based on post-training human
preference alignment via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). The proposed
FinDPO achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard sentiment
classification benchmarks, outperforming existing supervised fine-tuned models
by 11% on the average. Uniquely, the FinDPO framework enables the integration
of a fine-tuned causal LLM into realistic portfolio strategies through a novel
'logit-to-score' conversion, which transforms discrete sentiment predictions
into continuous, rankable sentiment scores (probabilities). In this way,
simulations demonstrate that FinDPO is the first sentiment-based approach to
maintain substantial positive returns of 67% annually and strong risk-adjusted
performance, as indicated by a Sharpe ratio of 2.0, even under realistic
transaction costs of 5 basis points (bps).

### [61] [AraTable: Benchmarking LLMs' Reasoning and Understanding of Arabic Tabular Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18442)
*Rana Alshaikh,Israa Alghanmi,Shelan Jeawak*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AraTable is a benchmark for evaluating the reasoning capabilities of large language models on Arabic tabular data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Arabic tabular data lacks comprehensive benchmarks, unlike English, despite unique challenges.

Method: Uses a hybrid pipeline where LLMs generate content, later refined and verified by human experts.

Result: LLMs perform well on simple tasks but struggle with complex tabular reasoning.

Conclusion: AraTable and its evaluation framework aim to improve Arabic structured data understanding by LLMs, offering substantial future opportunities.

Abstract: The cognitive and reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs) have
enabled remarkable progress in natural language processing. However, their
performance in interpreting structured data, especially in tabular formats,
remains limited. Although benchmarks for English tabular data are widely
available, Arabic is still underrepresented because of the limited availability
of public resources and its unique language features. To address this gap, we
present AraTable, a novel and comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the
reasoning and understanding capabilities of LLMs when applied to Arabic tabular
data. AraTable consists of various evaluation tasks, such as direct question
answering, fact verification, and complex reasoning, involving a wide range of
Arabic tabular sources. Our methodology follows a hybrid pipeline, where
initial content is generated by LLMs and subsequently filtered and verified by
human experts to ensure high dataset quality. Initial analyses using AraTable
show that, while LLMs perform adequately on simpler tabular tasks such as
direct question answering, they continue to face significant cognitive
challenges when tasks require deeper reasoning and fact verification. This
indicates that there are substantial opportunities for future work to improve
performance on complex tabular reasoning tasks. We also propose a fully
automated evaluation framework that uses a self-deliberation mechanism and
achieves performance nearly identical to that of human judges. This research
provides a valuable, publicly available resource and evaluation framework that
can help accelerate the development of foundational models for processing and
analysing Arabic structured data.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve readability and downstream applications of unpunctuated Bangla text, especially in low-resource ASR scenarios.

Method: Constructed a varied training dataset and applied data augmentation techniques to enhance punctuation restoration using XLM-RoBERTa-large.

Result: Achieved accuracies of 97.1% (News), 91.2% (Reference), and 90.2% (ASR) on respective test sets.

Conclusion: The method effectively restores punctuation even in noisy environments, establishing a strong baseline for Bangla language processing and contributing resources for further research.

Abstract: Punctuation restoration enhances the readability of text and is critical for
post-processing tasks in Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), especially for
low-resource languages like Bangla. In this study, we explore the application
of transformer-based models, specifically XLM-RoBERTa-large, to automatically
restore punctuation in unpunctuated Bangla text. We focus on predicting four
punctuation marks: period, comma, question mark, and exclamation mark across
diverse text domains. To address the scarcity of annotated resources, we
constructed a large, varied training corpus and applied data augmentation
techniques. Our best-performing model, trained with an augmentation factor of
alpha = 0.20%, achieves an accuracy of 97.1% on the News test set, 91.2% on the
Reference set, and 90.2% on the ASR set.
  Results show strong generalization to reference and ASR transcripts,
demonstrating the model's effectiveness in real-world, noisy scenarios. This
work establishes a strong baseline for Bangla punctuation restoration and
contributes publicly available datasets and code to support future research in
low-resource NLP.

*Basel Alshaikhdeeb,Ahmed Abdelmonem Hemedan,Soumyabrata Ghosh,Irina Balaur,Venkata Satagopam*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper systematically reviews synthetic clinical text generation, examining its purposes, techniques, and evaluation methods, using 94 articles from 1,398 sources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To resolve challenges in clinical NLP like sparsity and privacy through synthetic medical free-text generation.

Method: Systematic review focusing on research questions related to purposes, techniques, and evaluation methods of synthetic text generation.

Result: Synthetic text is valuable for tasks like augmentation, writing assistance, corpus building, and privacy-preserving using transformer models; privacy concerns remain unresolved.

Conclusion: Synthetic text aids NLP tasks and data processing significantly, but future work must address privacy and sensitive information risks for broader adoption.

Abstract: Generating clinical synthetic text represents an effective solution for
common clinical NLP issues like sparsity and privacy. This paper aims to
conduct a systematic review on generating synthetic medical free-text by
formulating quantitative analysis to three research questions concerning (i)
the purpose of generation, (ii) the techniques, and (iii) the evaluation
methods. We searched PubMed, ScienceDirect, Web of Science, Scopus, IEEE,
Google Scholar, and arXiv databases for publications associated with generating
synthetic medical unstructured free-text. We have identified 94 relevant
articles out of 1,398 collected ones. A great deal of attention has been given
to the generation of synthetic medical text from 2018 onwards, where the main
purpose of such a generation is towards text augmentation, assistive writing,
corpus building, privacy-preserving, annotation, and usefulness. Transformer
architectures were the main predominant technique used to generate the text,
especially the GPTs. On the other hand, there were four main aspects of
evaluation, including similarity, privacy, structure, and utility, where
utility was the most frequent method used to assess the generated synthetic
medical text. Although the generated synthetic medical text demonstrated a
moderate possibility to act as real medical documents in different downstream
NLP tasks, it has proven to be a great asset as augmented, complementary to the
real documents, towards improving the accuracy and overcoming
sparsity/undersampling issues. Yet, privacy is still a major issue behind
generating synthetic medical text, where more human assessments are needed to
check for the existence of any sensitive information. Despite that, advances in
generating synthetic medical text will considerably accelerate the adoption of
workflows and pipeline development, discarding the time-consuming legalities of
data transfer.

*Zheyu Zhang,Shuo Yang,Bardh Prenkaj,Gjergji Kasneci*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces GraDe, a method to improve tabular data generation in Large Language Models (LLMs) by integrating sparse dependency graphs for better attention mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle to model sparse feature-level dependencies in tabular data, resulting in diluted focus on key relationships.

Method: GraDe incorporates a dynamic graph learning module, guided by external functional dependencies, to prioritize critical feature interactions in LLM attention.

Result: GraDe improves performance by up to 12% on complex datasets and achieves competitive results in synthetic data quality.

Conclusion: GraDe offers an efficient and minimally intrusive solution for enhancing structure-aware tabular data modeling with LLMs.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong potential for tabular data
generation by modeling textualized feature-value pairs. However, tabular data
inherently exhibits sparse feature-level dependencies, where many feature
interactions are structurally insignificant. This creates a fundamental
mismatch as LLMs' self-attention mechanism inevitably distributes focus across
all pairs, diluting attention on critical relationships, particularly in
datasets with complex dependencies or semantically ambiguous features. To
address this limitation, we propose GraDe (Graph-Guided Dependency Learning), a
novel method that explicitly integrates sparse dependency graphs into LLMs'
attention mechanism. GraDe employs a lightweight dynamic graph learning module
guided by externally extracted functional dependencies, prioritizing key
feature interactions while suppressing irrelevant ones. Our experiments across
diverse real-world datasets demonstrate that GraDe outperforms existing
LLM-based approaches by up to 12% on complex datasets while achieving
competitive results with state-of-the-art approaches in synthetic data quality.
Our method is minimally intrusive yet effective, offering a practical solution
for structure-aware tabular data modeling with LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MMT methods struggle with modality gaps and are limited to their trained multimodal domains. This paper seeks to overcome these limitations by leveraging modality-specific information in a broader way.

Method: The proposed GIIFT framework constructs multimodal scene graphs and employs a Graph-guided Inductive Image-Free Two-stage process. It uses a cross-modal Graph Attention Network adapter for learning and generalizing in a unified fused space.

Result: GIIFT achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Multi30K dataset for English-to-French and English-to-German translation tasks. It also shows significant improvements on the WMT benchmark, particularly in image-free translation.

Conclusion: The GIIFT framework effectively addresses the challenges of modality gaps in MMT. Its ability to generalize to image-free domains and deliver strong performance indicates its broader applicability.

Abstract: Multimodal Machine Translation (MMT) has demonstrated the significant help of
visual information in machine translation. However, existing MMT methods face
challenges in leveraging the modality gap by enforcing rigid visual-linguistic
alignment whilst being confined to inference within their trained multimodal
domains. In this work, we construct novel multimodal scene graphs to preserve
and integrate modality-specific information and introduce GIIFT, a two-stage
Graph-guided Inductive Image-Free MMT framework that uses a cross-modal Graph
Attention Network adapter to learn multimodal knowledge in a unified fused
space and inductively generalize it to broader image-free translation domains.
Experimental results on the Multi30K dataset of English-to-French and
English-to-German tasks demonstrate that our GIIFT surpasses existing
approaches and achieves the state-of-the-art, even without images during
inference. Results on the WMT benchmark show significant improvements over the
image-free translation baselines, demonstrating the strength of GIIFT towards

TL;DR: The paper introduces a hybrid tokenization method merging 6-mer with Byte Pair Encoding for improved DNA Language Model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome challenges of traditional k-mer tokenization like uneven token distribution and limited global sequence understanding in DNA language modeling.

Method: A hybrid tokenization approach combining unique 6-mer tokens with BPE tokens (600 cycles) to create a balance for capturing both local and global DNA sequence patterns.

Result: Enhanced prediction accuracies of 10.78% for 3-mers, 10.1% for 4-mers, and 4.12% for 5-mers, surpassing metrics of NT, DNABERT2, and GROVER.

Conclusion: The hybrid tokenization effectively captures both local structures and global context in DNA sequences, benefiting genomic language modeling and downstream biological research.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel hybrid tokenization strategy that enhances the
performance of DNA Language Models (DLMs) by combining 6-mer tokenization with
Byte Pair Encoding (BPE-600). Traditional k-mer tokenization is effective at
capturing local DNA sequence structures but often faces challenges, including
uneven token distribution and a limited understanding of global sequence
context. To address these limitations, we propose merging unique 6mer tokens
with optimally selected BPE tokens generated through 600 BPE cycles. This
hybrid approach ensures a balanced and context-aware vocabulary, enabling the
model to capture both short and long patterns within DNA sequences
simultaneously. A foundational DLM trained on this hybrid vocabulary was
evaluated using next-k-mer prediction as a fine-tuning task, demonstrating
significantly improved performance. The model achieved prediction accuracies of
10.78% for 3-mers, 10.1% for 4-mers, and 4.12% for 5-mers, outperforming
state-of-the-art models such as NT, DNABERT2, and GROVER. These results
highlight the ability of the hybrid tokenization strategy to preserve both the
local sequence structure and global contextual information in DNA modeling.
This work underscores the importance of advanced tokenization methods in
genomic language modeling and lays a robust foundation for future applications
in downstream DNA sequence analysis and biological research.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces WINO, a training-free decoding algorithm for Diffusion Large Language Models (DLLMs), addressing their quality-speed trade-off by enabling revokable decoding and improving performance and speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DLLMs face challenges in balancing speed and quality during parallel decoding due to irreversible and error-prone mechanisms, motivating the need for a better decoding algorithm.

Method: WINO introduces a draft-and-verify approach where multiple tokens are aggressively generated and verified using bidirectional context. Suspicious tokens are masked for refinement, allowing revokable decoding.

Result: WINO improves the quality-speed trade-off in DLLMs, accelerating inference by up to 10× while enhancing accuracy and performance in tasks like math benchmarks and image captioning.

Conclusion: WINO decisively advances DLLM decoding by solving the irreversibility issue, achieving significant improvements in speed and accuracy without retraining models, and demonstrating strong applicability.

Abstract: Diffusion Large Language Models (DLLMs) have emerged as a compelling
alternative to Autoregressive models, designed for fast parallel generation.
However, existing DLLMs are plagued by a severe quality-speed trade-off, where
faster parallel decoding leads to significant performance degradation. We
attribute this to the irreversibility of standard decoding in DLLMs, which is
easily polarized into the wrong decoding direction along with early error
context accumulation. To resolve this, we introduce Wide-In, Narrow-Out (WINO),
a training-free decoding algorithm that enables revokable decoding in DLLMs.
WINO employs a parallel draft-and-verify mechanism, aggressively drafting
multiple tokens while simultaneously using the model's bidirectional context to
verify and re-mask suspicious ones for refinement. Verified in open-source
DLLMs like LLaDA and MMaDA, WINO is shown to decisively improve the
quality-speed trade-off. For instance, on the GSM8K math benchmark, it
accelerates inference by 6$\times$ while improving accuracy by 2.58%; on
Flickr30K captioning, it achieves a 10$\times$ speedup with higher performance.
More comprehensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate the superiority and
provide an in-depth understanding of WINO.

Abstract: This paper presents our system for CCL25-Eval Task 10, addressing
Fine-Grained Chinese Hate Speech Recognition (FGCHSR). We propose a novel
SRAG-MAV framework that synergistically integrates task reformulation(TR),

(MAV). Our method reformulates the quadruplet extraction task into triplet
extraction, uses dynamic retrieval from the training set to create contextual

stability and performance. Our system, based on the Qwen2.5-7B model, achieves
a Hard Score of 26.66, a Soft Score of 48.35, and an Average Score of 37.505 on

TL;DR: AQuilt is proposed as a cost-efficient framework for generating instruction-tuning data from unlabeled domain-specific datasets to improve large language models' performance in specialized fields.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs excel in general domains but underperform in specialized ones, and existing data-tuning methods involve high costs or limited performance while lacking task generalization.

Method: AQuilt generates domain-specific instruction-tuning data by combining answer, question, unlabeled data, inspection, logic, and task type, encouraging reasoning and self-inspection for better model outputs.

Result: AQuilt achieved comparable performance to DeepSeek-V3 at 17% of the cost, and its generated data showed better relevance to downstream tasks in experiments.

Conclusion: AQuilt offers an efficient and effective approach to improve LLMs for specialized domains, balancing cost and performance while maintaining generalization across tasks.

Abstract: Despite the impressive performance of large language models (LLMs) in general
domains, they often underperform in specialized domains. Existing approaches
typically rely on data synthesis methods and yield promising results by using
unlabeled data to capture domain-specific features. However, these methods
either incur high computational costs or suffer from performance limitations,
while also demonstrating insufficient generalization across different tasks. To
address these challenges, we propose AQuilt, a framework for constructing
instruction-tuning data for any specialized domains from corresponding
unlabeled data, including Answer, Question, Unlabeled data, Inspection, Logic,
and Task type. By incorporating logic and inspection, we encourage reasoning
processes and self-inspection to enhance model performance. Moreover,
customizable task instructions enable high-quality data generation for any
task. As a result, we construct a dataset of 703k examples to train a powerful
data synthesis model. Experiments show that AQuilt is comparable to DeepSeek-V3
while utilizing just 17% of the production cost. Further analysis demonstrates
that our generated data exhibits higher relevance to downstream tasks. Source

Motivation: The motivation is to improve the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) through optimized prompts, leveraging textual feedback and without requiring dataset pre-collection or model parameter adjustments.

Method: The proposed method, TRPrompt, directly incorporates textual feedback during the training of a prompt model, iteratively refining the prompts through feedback while relying on LLMs to internalize the concept of high-quality prompts.

Result: The approach demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in generating query-specific prompts for math reasoning tasks in datasets like GSMHard and MATH.

Conclusion: Combining textual feedback with the training of a prompt model can significantly enhance prompt generation for LLMs, improving their reasoning abilities and achieving superior results in domain-specific applications.

Abstract: Prompt optimization improves the reasoning abilities of large language models
(LLMs) without requiring parameter updates to the target model. Following
heuristic-based "Think step by step" approaches, the field has evolved in two
main directions: while one group of methods uses textual feedback to elicit
improved prompts from general-purpose LLMs in a training-free way, a concurrent
line of research relies on numerical rewards to train a special prompt model,
tailored for providing optimal prompts to the target model. In this paper, we
introduce the Textual Reward Prompt framework (TRPrompt), which unifies these
approaches by directly incorporating textual feedback into training of the
prompt model. Our framework does not require prior dataset collection and is
being iteratively improved with the feedback on the generated prompts. When
coupled with the capacity of an LLM to internalize the notion of what a "good"
prompt is, the high-resolution signal provided by the textual rewards allows us
to train a prompt model yielding state-of-the-art query-specific prompts for
the problems from the challenging math datasets GSMHard and MATH.

### [74] [Checklists Are Better Than Reward Models For Aligning Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18624)
*Vijay Viswanathan,Yanchao Sun,Shuang Ma,Xiang Kong,Meng Cao,Graham Neubig,Tongshuang Wu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents a method called Reinforcement Learning from Checklist Feedback (RLCF) to improve language models' adherence to a variety of user instructions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing reinforcement learning approaches for instruction following in language models rely on fixed criteria like helpfulness and harmfulness. The authors aim to create a more flexible approach to accommodate diverse user needs through instruction-specific criteria.

Method: The proposed method, RLCF, extracts checklists from user instructions and evaluates model responses based on these checklist items. Artificial intelligence judges and specialized verifier programs assess the responses, combining their scores to compute rewards for reinforcement learning.

Result: RLCF outperforms other alignment methods in tasks tested on five benchmarks, achieving notable performance improvements, such as a 4-point boost in satisfaction on FollowBench and a 6-point increase on InFoBench.

Conclusion: Checklist feedback can enhance language models' ability to follow diverse instructions, making RLCF a powerful tool for improving model alignment with user needs.

Abstract: Language models must be adapted to understand and follow user instructions.
Reinforcement learning is widely used to facilitate this -- typically using
fixed criteria such as "helpfulness" and "harmfulness". In our work, we instead
propose using flexible, instruction-specific criteria as a means of broadening
the impact that reinforcement learning can have in eliciting instruction
following. We propose "Reinforcement Learning from Checklist Feedback" (RLCF).
From instructions, we extract checklists and evaluate how well responses
satisfy each item - using both AI judges and specialized verifier programs -
then combine these scores to compute rewards for RL. We compare RLCF with other
alignment methods applied to a strong instruction following model
(Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct) on five widely-studied benchmarks -- RLCF is the only
method to improve performance on every benchmark, including a 4-point boost in
hard satisfaction rate on FollowBench, a 6-point increase on InFoBench, and a
3-point rise in win rate on Arena-Hard. These results establish checklist
feedback as a key tool for improving language models' support of queries that
express a multitude of needs.

TL;DR: Lumina-mGPT 2.0 is a standalone autoregressive model for image generation rivaling state-of-the-art diffusion models and excelling in multimodal tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations of pretrained and hybrid models by creating a model trained entirely from scratch for flexibility and licensing freedom.

Method: Developed a decoder-only autoregressive model trained from scratch employing a unified tokenization scheme for multiple tasks, efficient decoding strategies, and extensive benchmark evaluations.

Result: Lumina-mGPT 2.0 matches or surpasses the performance of state-of-the-art models in text-to-image generation and exhibits strong multi-task capabilities.

Conclusion: Lumina-mGPT 2.0 is positioned as a powerful, flexible, and unified model for multimodal generation, with accessible training details and code provided.

Abstract: We present Lumina-mGPT 2.0, a stand-alone, decoder-only autoregressive model
that revisits and revitalizes the autoregressive paradigm for high-quality
image generation and beyond. Unlike existing approaches that rely on pretrained
components or hybrid architectures, Lumina-mGPT 2.0 is trained entirely from
scratch, enabling unrestricted architectural design and licensing freedom. It
achieves generation quality on par with state-of-the-art diffusion models such
as DALL-E 3 and SANA, while preserving the inherent flexibility and
compositionality of autoregressive modeling. Our unified tokenization scheme
allows the model to seamlessly handle a wide spectrum of tasks-including
subject-driven generation, image editing, controllable synthesis, and dense
prediction-within a single generative framework. To further boost usability, we
incorporate efficient decoding strategies like inference-time scaling and
speculative Jacobi sampling to improve quality and speed, respectively.
Extensive evaluations on standard text-to-image benchmarks (e.g., GenEval, DPG)
demonstrate that Lumina-mGPT 2.0 not only matches but in some cases surpasses
diffusion-based models. Moreover, we confirm its multi-task capabilities on the
Graph200K benchmark, with the native Lumina-mGPT 2.0 performing exceptionally
well. These results position Lumina-mGPT 2.0 as a strong, flexible foundation
model for unified multimodal generation. We have released our training details,
code, and models at https://github.com/Alpha-VLLM/Lumina-mGPT-2.0.

### [76] [A Multimodal Seq2Seq Transformer for Predicting Brain Responses to Naturalistic Stimuli](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18104)
*Qianyi He,Yuan Chang Leong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a sequence-to-sequence Transformer model for predicting brain fMRI activity from multimodal inputs, using a combination of pretrained models, dual cross-attention mechanisms, and a partially subject-specific decoder.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the challenge of predicting whole-brain fMRI responses to naturalistic, multimodal movies, as posed by the Algonauts 2025 Challenge.

Method: The authors propose a sequence-to-sequence Transformer model that incorporates pretrained feature extraction models (VideoMAE, HuBERT, Qwen, BridgeTower), dual cross-attention mechanisms, and a model structure combining shared and subject-specific components.

Result: The model demonstrates strong performance on in-distribution and out-of-distribution data, showcasing its ability to effectively handle long-range temporal and multimodal dependencies in brain activity prediction.

Conclusion: The study presents an effective, temporally-aware, multimodal sequence modeling framework, contributing to advancements in brain activity prediction and achieving promising results for future applications.

Abstract: The Algonauts 2025 Challenge called on the community to develop encoding
models that predict whole-brain fMRI responses to naturalistic multimodal
movies. In this submission, we propose a sequence-to-sequence Transformer that
autoregressively predicts fMRI activity from visual, auditory, and language
inputs. Stimulus features were extracted using pretrained models including
VideoMAE, HuBERT, Qwen, and BridgeTower. The decoder integrates information
from prior brain states, current stimuli, and episode-level summaries via dual
cross-attention mechanisms that attend to both perceptual information extracted
from the stimulus as well as narrative information provided by high-level
summaries of narrative content. One core innovation of our approach is the use
of sequences of multimodal context to predict sequences of brain activity,
enabling the model to capture long-range temporal structure in both stimuli and
neural responses. Another is the combination of a shared encoder with partial
subject-specific decoder, which leverages common structure across subjects
while accounting for individual variability. Our model achieves strong
performance on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution data, demonstrating
the effectiveness of temporally-aware, multimodal sequence modeling for brain
activity prediction. The code is available at

TL;DR: The paper introduces SV3.3B, a lightweight 3.3 billion parameter video understanding model for automated sports video analysis, which achieves superior performance and computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current sports video analysis models have limitations in capturing fine-grained athletic movements and biomechanical transitions, essential for precise sports analysis.

Method: The authors developed SV3.3B using a combination of DWT-VGG16-LDA keyframe extraction, a V-DWT-JEPA2 encoder pretrained with mask-denoising, and an LLM decoder fine-tuned for sports descriptions.

Result: SV3.3B outperformed larger models like GPT-4o variants, achieving a 29.2% improvement in ground truth validation metrics, with noteworthy gains in information density, action complexity, and measurement precision.

Conclusion: SV3.3B is a highly efficient, lightweight, and technically capable model for sports video analysis, providing superior understanding and description of athletic actions while reducing computational demands.

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of automated sports video analysis, which
has traditionally been limited by computationally intensive models requiring
server-side processing and lacking fine-grained understanding of athletic
movements. Current approaches struggle to capture the nuanced biomechanical
transitions essential for meaningful sports analysis, often missing critical
phases like preparation, execution, and follow-through that occur within
seconds. To address these limitations, we introduce SV3.3B, a lightweight 3.3B
parameter video understanding model that combines novel temporal motion
difference sampling with self-supervised learning for efficient on-device
deployment. Our approach employs a DWT-VGG16-LDA based keyframe extraction
mechanism that intelligently identifies the 16 most representative frames from
sports sequences, followed by a V-DWT-JEPA2 encoder pretrained through
mask-denoising objectives and an LLM decoder fine-tuned for sports action
description generation. Evaluated on a subset of the NSVA basketball dataset,
SV3.3B achieves superior performance across both traditional text generation
metrics and sports-specific evaluation criteria, outperforming larger
closed-source models including GPT-4o variants while maintaining significantly
lower computational requirements. Our model demonstrates exceptional capability
in generating technically detailed and analytically rich sports descriptions,
achieving 29.2% improvement over GPT-4o in ground truth validation metrics,
with substantial improvements in information density, action complexity, and
measurement precision metrics essential for comprehensive athletic analysis.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Detail++, a training-free framework for improving text-to-image generation with complex prompts by progressively refining details during the generation process.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenges faced by text-to-image generation models in handling complex prompts involving multiple subjects and distinct attributes.

Method: Detail++ applies a Progressive Detail Injection (PDI) strategy by breaking down complex prompts into simplified sub-prompts, guiding the generation in stages. It leverages self-attention for layout control, cross-attention mechanisms for binding attributes to subjects, and includes a Centroid Alignment Loss during testing.

Result: Detail++ achieves superior performance compared to existing methods in generating images with multiple objects and complex stylistic conditions, as shown by experiments on established benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed framework demonstrates its effectiveness in enhancing text-to-image generation for scenarios with intricate prompts, paving the way for improved visual fidelity and attribute binding.

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-image (T2I) generation have led to impressive
visual results. However, these models still face significant challenges when
handling complex prompt, particularly those involving multiple subjects with
distinct attributes. Inspired by the human drawing process, which first
outlines the composition and then incrementally adds details, we propose
Detail++, a training-free framework that introduces a novel Progressive Detail
Injection (PDI) strategy to address this limitation. Specifically, we decompose
a complex prompt into a sequence of simplified sub-prompts, guiding the
generation process in stages. This staged generation leverages the inherent
layout-controlling capacity of self-attention to first ensure global
composition, followed by precise refinement. To achieve accurate binding
between attributes and corresponding subjects, we exploit cross-attention
mechanisms and further introduce a Centroid Alignment Loss at test time to
reduce binding noise and enhance attribute consistency. Extensive experiments
on T2I-CompBench and a newly constructed style composition benchmark
demonstrate that Detail++ significantly outperforms existing methods,
particularly in scenarios involving multiple objects and complex stylistic
conditions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fish detection for applications like ecological monitoring and aquaculture automation faces challenges due to fragmented datasets, inconsistent protocols, and diverse imaging conditions. The need for a unified evaluation platform drives the work.

Method: The study consolidates 13 publicly available datasets into FishDet-M with standardized COCO-style annotations. It benchmarks 28 object detection models, evaluates them with various metrics, and proposes a CLIP-based framework for adaptive model selection.

Result: FishDet-M provides comprehensive performance insights across 28 detection models, revealing trade-offs between accuracy and efficiency. The CLIP-based model selection approach performs well in zero-shot mode, offering scalable real-time deployment capabilities.

Conclusion: FishDet-M is a significant contribution to underwater computer vision, offering harmonized datasets, reproducible evaluations, and adaptive deployment tools. Its availability promotes future research in related fields.

Abstract: Accurate fish detection in underwater imagery is essential for ecological
monitoring, aquaculture automation, and robotic perception. However, practical
deployment remains limited by fragmented datasets, heterogeneous imaging
conditions, and inconsistent evaluation protocols. To address these gaps, we
present \textit{FishDet-M}, the largest unified benchmark for fish detection,
comprising 13 publicly available datasets spanning diverse aquatic environments
including marine, brackish, occluded, and aquarium scenes. All data are
harmonized using COCO-style annotations with both bounding boxes and
segmentation masks, enabling consistent and scalable cross-domain evaluation.
We systematically benchmark 28 contemporary object detection models, covering
the YOLOv8 to YOLOv12 series, R-CNN based detectors, and DETR based models.
Evaluations are conducted using standard metrics including mAP, mAP@50, and
mAP@75, along with scale-specific analyses (AP$_S$, AP$_M$, AP$_L$) and
inference profiling in terms of latency and parameter count. The results
highlight the varying detection performance across models trained on FishDet-M,
as well as the trade-off between accuracy and efficiency across models of
different architectures. To support adaptive deployment, we introduce a
CLIP-based model selection framework that leverages vision-language alignment
to dynamically identify the most semantically appropriate detector for each
input image. This zero-shot selection strategy achieves high performance
without requiring ensemble computation, offering a scalable solution for
real-time applications. FishDet-M establishes a standardized and reproducible
platform for evaluating object detection in complex aquatic scenes. All
datasets, pretrained models, and evaluation tools are publicly available to
facilitate future research in underwater computer vision and intelligent marine
systems.

Result: The system achieves a classification accuracy of 99%, power consumption of 3.5W, and processing speed of 9 FPS.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully delivers a resource-efficient and real-time object detection system tailored for edge computing applications.

Abstract: Object detection and classification are crucial tasks across various
application domains, particularly in the development of safe and reliable
Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS). Existing deep learning-based methods
such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Single Shot Detectors (SSDs), and
You Only Look Once (YOLO) have demonstrated high performance in terms of

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper assesses the fairness of melanoma detection models using synthetic data generated by the LightningDiT model, highlighting the challenges and potential of this approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address and improve fairness in AI-based melanoma detection systems, given the risks of biases and the importance of representative evaluation datasets for different demographic groups.

Method: The study uses synthetic data generated by the state-of-the-art Generative AI LightningDiT model to evaluate the fairness of publicly available melanoma classifiers.

Result: The results indicate synthetic data is promising for fairness assessment, but challenges arise when the evaluation model's training data differs from the synthetic image dataset.

Conclusion: The approach of using synthetic data provides a valuable method to assess and potentially enhance fairness in medical AI systems, despite challenges with data variation.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Deep Learning and its application on the edge hold
great potential for the revolution of routine screenings for skin cancers like
Melanoma. Along with the anticipated benefits of this technology, potential
dangers arise from unforseen and inherent biases. Thus, assessing and improving
the fairness of such systems is of utmost importance. A key challenge in
fairness assessment is to ensure that the evaluation dataset is sufficiently
representative of different Personal Identifiable Information (PII) (sex, age,
and race) and other minority groups. Against the backdrop of this challenge,
this study leverages the state-of-the-art Generative AI (GenAI) LightningDiT
model to assess the fairness of publicly available melanoma classifiers. The
results suggest that fairness assessment using highly realistic synthetic data
is a promising direction. Yet, our findings indicate that verifying fairness
becomes difficult when the melanoma-detection model used for evaluation is
trained on data that differ from the dataset underpinning the synthetic images.
Nonetheless, we propose that our approach offers a valuable new avenue for
employing synthetic data to gauge and enhance fairness in medical-imaging GenAI
systems.

### [82] [DiNAT-IR: Exploring Dilated Neighborhood Attention for High-Quality Image Restoration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17892)
*Hanzhou Liu,Binghan Li,Chengkai Liu,Mi Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Restormer introduced channel-wise self-attention for efficient image restoration but neglected some localized details. A new architecture, DiNAT-IR, combines Dilated Neighborhood Attention (DiNA) and a channel-aware module to enhance global and local features, showing improved performance in image restoration tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The current dominant Transformer-based methods for image restoration, like Restormer, suffer from a trade-off between quality and computational efficiency, especially on high-resolution images. Restormer's channel-wise attention overlooks critical localized artifacts, motivating exploration of new attention mechanisms.

Method: The paper introduces Dilated Neighborhood Attention (DiNA), which combines sliding-window attention with mixed dilation factors, as a foundation. It also includes a channel-aware module to complement local attention by improving global context understanding without losing pixel-level precision, forming the DiNAT-IR model.

Result: DiNAT-IR demonstrates competitive performance across multiple image restoration benchmarks, offering a balanced solution between efficiency and quality.

Conclusion: The proposed DiNAT-IR architecture addresses the limitations of previous approaches by harmonizing global and local contexts for image restoration, enabling high-quality results across diverse tasks.

Abstract: Transformers, with their self-attention mechanisms for modeling long-range
dependencies, have become a dominant paradigm in image restoration tasks.
However, the high computational cost of self-attention limits scalability to
high-resolution images, making efficiency-quality trade-offs a key research
focus. To address this, Restormer employs channel-wise self-attention, which
computes attention across channels instead of spatial dimensions. While
effective, this approach may overlook localized artifacts that are crucial for
high-quality image restoration. To bridge this gap, we explore Dilated
Neighborhood Attention (DiNA) as a promising alternative, inspired by its
success in high-level vision tasks. DiNA balances global context and local
precision by integrating sliding-window attention with mixed dilation factors,
effectively expanding the receptive field without excessive overhead. However,
our preliminary experiments indicate that directly applying this global-local
design to the classic deblurring task hinders accurate visual restoration,
primarily due to the constrained global context understanding within local
attention. To address this, we introduce a channel-aware module that
complements local attention, effectively integrating global context without
sacrificing pixel-level precision. The proposed DiNAT-IR, a Transformer-based
architecture specifically designed for image restoration, achieves competitive
results across multiple benchmarks, offering a high-quality solution for
diverse low-level computer vision problems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Adaptive Feature Refinement (AFR) module for Unsupervised Domain Adaptive Semantic Segmentation (UDA-SS). AFR enhances segmentation precision by refining features, integrating high-frequency components, and using uncertainty-driven attention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing UDA-SS methods struggle to balance fine-grained local details with global contextual data, leading to segmentation errors in complex regions.

Method: The Adaptive Feature Refinement (AFR) module refines high-resolution features using semantic priors from low-resolution logits, integrates high-frequency components for boundary clarity, and employs uncertainty-driven attention to balance local and global information.

Result: AFR improves UDA-SS segmentation performance by 1.05% mIoU on GTA V-->Cityscapes and 1.04% mIoU on Synthia-->Cityscapes.

Conclusion: The AFR module enhances state-of-the-art UDA-SS performance, is lightweight, and integrates seamlessly into existing systems, addressing segmentation errors effectively.

Abstract: In Unsupervised Domain Adaptive Semantic Segmentation (UDA-SS), a model is
trained on labeled source domain data (e.g., synthetic images) and adapted to
an unlabeled target domain (e.g., real-world images) without access to target
annotations. Existing UDA-SS methods often struggle to balance fine-grained
local details with global contextual information, leading to segmentation
errors in complex regions. To address this, we introduce the Adaptive Feature
Refinement (AFR) module, which enhances segmentation accuracy by refining
highresolution features using semantic priors from low-resolution logits. AFR
also integrates high-frequency components, which capture fine-grained
structures and provide crucial boundary information, improving object
delineation. Additionally, AFR adaptively balances local and global information
through uncertaintydriven attention, reducing misclassifications. Its
lightweight design allows seamless integration into HRDA-based UDA methods,
leading to state-of-the-art segmentation performance. Our approach improves
existing UDA-SS methods by 1.05% mIoU on GTA V --> Cityscapes and 1.04% mIoU on
Synthia-->Cityscapes. The implementation of our framework is available at:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study introduces OPEN, a dataset for AI-driven engagement recognition in older adults during virtual learning sessions, achieving 81% accuracy with multiple models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the lack of research and datasets focusing on engagement detection for older adults in virtual and telehealth learning settings, an essential aspect for participant satisfaction and performance.

Method: Researchers developed the OPEN dataset by collecting engagement data from 11 older adults participating in six weeks of cardiac rehabilitation virtual group sessions. The dataset includes facial, hand, and body joint landmarks, behavioral features, engagement annotations, and various sample lengths for analysis.

Result: The OPEN dataset demonstrated its utility by achieving up to 81% accuracy in engagement recognition using machine learning and deep learning models. It is the largest dataset of its kind for older adults.

Conclusion: OPEN offers a privacy-preserving, scalable resource for personalized engagement modeling for aging populations, addressing a key gap in virtual learning and telehealth environments.

Abstract: Engagement in virtual learning is essential for participant satisfaction,
performance, and adherence, particularly in online education and virtual
rehabilitation, where interactive communication plays a key role. Yet,
accurately measuring engagement in virtual group settings remains a challenge.
There is increasing interest in using artificial intelligence (AI) for
large-scale, real-world, automated engagement recognition. While engagement has
been widely studied in younger academic populations, research and datasets
focused on older adults in virtual and telehealth learning settings remain
limited. Existing methods often neglect contextual relevance and the
longitudinal nature of engagement across sessions. This paper introduces OPEN
(Older adult Patient ENgagement), a novel dataset supporting AI-driven
engagement recognition. It was collected from eleven older adults participating
in weekly virtual group learning sessions over six weeks as part of cardiac
rehabilitation, producing over 35 hours of data, making it the largest dataset
of its kind. To protect privacy, raw video is withheld; instead, the released
data include facial, hand, and body joint landmarks, along with affective and
behavioral features extracted from video. Annotations include binary engagement
states, affective and behavioral labels, and context-type indicators, such as
whether the instructor addressed the group or an individual. The dataset offers
versions with 5-, 10-, 30-second, and variable-length samples. To demonstrate
utility, multiple machine learning and deep learning models were trained,
achieving engagement recognition accuracy of up to 81 percent. OPEN provides a
scalable foundation for personalized engagement modeling in aging populations
and contributes to broader engagement recognition research.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper develops an automated system for monitoring bearded dragon behavior using YOLO object detection, focusing on basking and hunting behaviors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Behavioral monitoring of bearded dragons is traditionally time-consuming and error-prone.

Method: Five YOLO variants were trained on a custom dataset to identify key behaviors, with YOLOv8s selected for optimal accuracy and speed. Temporal interpolation and rule-based logic classified behaviors.

Result: Basking behavior detection was reliable, but hunting accuracy was hindered by weak cricket detection.

Conclusion: The system is scalable and improves research efficiency; future work will focus on enhancing detection of small objects like crickets.

Abstract: Traditional monitoring of bearded dragon (Pogona Viticeps) behaviour is
time-consuming and prone to errors. This project introduces an automated system
for real-time video analysis, using You Only Look Once (YOLO) object detection
models to identify two key behaviours: basking and hunting. We trained five
YOLO variants (v5, v7, v8, v11, v12) on a custom, publicly available dataset of
1200 images, encompassing bearded dragons (600), heating lamps (500), and
crickets (100). YOLOv8s was selected as the optimal model due to its superior
balance of accuracy (mAP@0.5:0.95 = 0.855) and speed. The system processes
video footage by extracting per-frame object coordinates, applying temporal
interpolation for continuity, and using rule-based logic to classify specific
behaviours. Basking detection proved reliable. However, hunting detection was
less accurate, primarily due to weak cricket detection (mAP@0.5 = 0.392).
Future improvements will focus on enhancing cricket detection through expanded
datasets or specialised small-object detectors. This automated system offers a
scalable solution for monitoring reptile behaviour in controlled environments,
significantly improving research efficiency and data quality.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel aerial-ground cross-modality video-based person Re-ID dataset (AG-VPReID.VIR) and proposes a three-stream architecture (TCC-VPReID) to address unique challenges in surveillance across modalities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Re-ID datasets focus only on ground-level perspectives and do not address limitations like occlusion and obstructions, especially in nighttime surveillance. The paper introduces aerial perspectives as a solution.

Method: The authors developed a new dataset, AG-VPReID.VIR, with 1,837 identities captured across different modalities (RGB and IR) and proposed TCC-VPReID, a three-stream architecture involving style-robust feature learning, cross-view adaptation, and temporal modeling.

Result: AG-VPReID.VIR dataset posed unique challenges compared to existing ones, and the TCC-VPReID framework showed significant performance improvements across multiple evaluation protocols.

Conclusion: The proposed dataset and architecture offer significant contributions to extending person Re-ID capabilities across aerial and ground perspectives and modalities, enhancing surveillance systems.

Abstract: Person re-identification (Re-ID) across visible and infrared modalities is
crucial for 24-hour surveillance systems, but existing datasets primarily focus
on ground-level perspectives. While ground-based IR systems offer nighttime
capabilities, they suffer from occlusions, limited coverage, and vulnerability
to obstructions--problems that aerial perspectives uniquely solve. To address
these limitations, we introduce AG-VPReID.VIR, the first aerial-ground
cross-modality video-based person Re-ID dataset. This dataset captures 1,837
identities across 4,861 tracklets (124,855 frames) using both UAV-mounted and
fixed CCTV cameras in RGB and infrared modalities. AG-VPReID.VIR presents
unique challenges including cross-viewpoint variations, modality discrepancies,
and temporal dynamics. Additionally, we propose TCC-VPReID, a novel
three-stream architecture designed to address the joint challenges of
cross-platform and cross-modality person Re-ID. Our approach bridges the domain
gaps between aerial-ground perspectives and RGB-IR modalities, through
style-robust feature learning, memory-based cross-view adaptation, and
intermediary-guided temporal modeling. Experiments show that AG-VPReID.VIR
presents distinctive challenges compared to existing datasets, with our
TCC-VPReID framework achieving significant performance gains across multiple
evaluation protocols. Dataset and code are available at

### [87] [Exploring the interplay of label bias with subgroup size and separability: A case study in mammographic density classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17996)
*Emma A. M. Stanley,Raghav Mehta,Mélanie Roschewitz,Nils D. Forkert,Ben Glocker*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper examines how label bias in medical imaging data affects deep learning models, particularly focusing on subgroup fairness based on size and separability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical AI systems often face fairness concerns due to systematic mislabeling (label bias) in datasets, which specifically impacts subgroups. Understanding this phenomenon is critical for developing equitable AI models.

Method: Deep learning models were trained using the EMBED dataset, simulating label bias affecting different subgroups categorized by separability and size.

Result: Models exhibited shifts in learned features and subgroup performance depended on label bias conditions, with notable disparities based on validation set labeling (clean vs biased).

Conclusion: Subgroup fairness in medical imaging AI models is significantly influenced by label bias, and employing validation sets with clean labels is crucial to mitigate these impacts.

Abstract: Systematic mislabelling affecting specific subgroups (i.e., label bias) in
medical imaging datasets represents an understudied issue concerning the
fairness of medical AI systems. In this work, we investigated how size and
separability of subgroups affected by label bias influence the learned features
and performance of a deep learning model. Therefore, we trained deep learning
models for binary tissue density classification using the EMory BrEast imaging
Dataset (EMBED), where label bias affected separable subgroups (based on
imaging manufacturer) or non-separable "pseudo-subgroups". We found that
simulated subgroup label bias led to prominent shifts in the learned feature
representations of the models. Importantly, these shifts within the feature
space were dependent on both the relative size and the separability of the
subgroup affected by label bias. We also observed notable differences in
subgroup performance depending on whether a validation set with clean labels
was used to define the classification threshold for the model. For instance,
with label bias affecting the majority separable subgroup, the true positive
rate for that subgroup fell from 0.898, when the validation set had clean
labels, to 0.518, when the validation set had biased labels. Our work
represents a key contribution toward understanding the consequences of label
bias on subgroup fairness in medical imaging AI.

*Jaeho Shin,Hyeonjae Gil,Junwoo Jang,Maani Ghaffari,Ayoung Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces an optimizable cost function on an affine Grassmannian manifold for registration problems and demonstrates its theoretical and practical benefits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing proximity measurements for lines and planes on the affine Grassmannian lack an explicit distance function relative to rigid body transformations, limiting their application in registration tasks.

Method: The authors derive a cost function based on high-dimensional linear subspace bases that measures proximity through geodesic distances and is optimized for rigid body transformations.

Result: The proposed cost function improves convergence and outperforms existing methods in various computer vision tasks, tested via an implementation available online.

Conclusion: This work advances the usability of affine Grassmannian metrics by offering an implementable, optimizable, and theoretically sound cost function for practical registration problems in computer vision.

Abstract: Affine Grassmannian has been favored for expressing proximity between lines
and planes due to its theoretical exactness in measuring distances among
features. Despite this advantage, the existing method can only measure the
proximity without yielding the distance as an explicit function of rigid body
transformation. Thus, an optimizable distance function on the manifold has
remained underdeveloped, stifling its application in registration problems.
This paper is the first to explicitly derive an optimizable cost function
between two Grassmannian features with respect to rigid body transformation
($\mathbf{R}$ and $\mathbf{t}$). Specifically, we present a rigorous
mathematical proof demonstrating that the bases of high-dimensional linear
subspaces can serve as an explicit representation of the cost. Finally, we
propose an optimizable cost function based on the transformed bases that can be
applied to the registration problem of any affine subspace. Compared to vector
parameter-based approaches, our method is able to find a globally optimal
solution by directly minimizing the geodesic distance which is agnostic to
representation ambiguity. The resulting cost function and its extension to the
inlier-set maximizing \ac{BnB} solver have been demonstrated to improve the
convergence of existing solutions or outperform them in various computer vision
tasks. The code is available on

*Jake R. Patock,Nicole Catherine Lewis,Kevin McCoy,Christina Gomez,Canling Chen,Lorenzo Luzi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces GRR-CoCa, an enhanced version of the Contrastive Captioner model, integrating advanced techniques from large language models to improve both performance and generalizability in vision-language tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current state-of-the-art multimodal models, like Contrastive Captioner (CoCa), underperform in architecture compared to advanced large language models, creating a need for structural enhancements to boost their capabilities.

Method: The authors enhance the CoCa model by integrating Gaussian error gated linear units, root mean squared normalization, and rotary positional embeddings into its vision transformer encoder and textual decoders, followed by pretraining and fine-tuning to compare its performance against a baseline.

Result: The GRR-CoCa model achieved significant performance gains over the baseline CoCa model, with improvements of 27.25% in pretraining contrastive loss, 3.71% in perplexity, and 7.15% in CoCa loss, along with notable fine-tuning advancements.

Conclusion: Incorporating advanced architectural techniques into the GRR-CoCa model improves its efficiency and generalizability in vision-language pretraining and fine-tuning tasks, setting a new benchmark for multimodal models.

Abstract: State-of-the-art (SOTA) image and text generation models are multimodal
models that have many similarities to large language models (LLMs). Despite
achieving strong performances, leading foundational multimodal model
architectures frequently lag behind the architectural sophistication of
contemporary LLMs. We propose GRR-CoCa, an improved SOTA Contrastive Captioner
(CoCa) model that incorporates Gaussian error gated linear units, root mean
squared normalization, and rotary positional embedding into the textual
decoders and the vision transformer (ViT) encoder. Each architectural
modification has been shown to improve model performance in LLMs, but has yet
to be adopted in CoCa. We benchmarked GRR-CoCa against Baseline CoCa, a model
with the same modified textual decoders but with CoCa's original ViT encoder.
We used standard pretraining and fine-tuning workflows to benchmark the models
on contrastive and generative tasks. Our GRR-CoCa significantly outperformed
Baseline CoCa on the pretraining dataset and three diverse fine-tuning
datasets. Pretraining improvements were 27.25% in contrastive loss, 3.71% in
perplexity, and 7.15% in CoCa loss. The average fine-tuning improvements were
13.66% in contrastive loss, 5.18% in perplexity, and 5.55% in CoCa loss. We
show that GRR-CoCa's modified architecture improves performance and
generalization across vision-language domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing diversity of DeepFake videos demands robust detection models capable of handling a wide range of forgeries.

Method: Celeb-DF++ contains videos that represent three forgery scenarios—Face-swap, Face-reenactment, and Talking-face—using 22 varied DeepFake methods to enhance generalizable forensics.

Result: The dataset offers high-quality videos showcasing diverse forgery types and protocols to evaluate generalizability of 24 recent detection methods.

Conclusion: Celeb-DF++ provides a significant benchmark to analyze limitations of existing detection methods and promote advancements in generalizable forensics.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of AI technologies has significantly increased the
diversity of DeepFake videos circulating online, posing a pressing challenge
for \textit{generalizable forensics}, \ie, detecting a wide range of unseen
DeepFake types using a single model. Addressing this challenge requires
datasets that are not only large-scale but also rich in forgery diversity.
However, most existing datasets, despite their scale, include only a limited
variety of forgery types, making them insufficient for developing generalizable
detection methods. Therefore, we build upon our earlier Celeb-DF dataset and
introduce {Celeb-DF++}, a new large-scale and challenging video DeepFake
benchmark dedicated to the generalizable forensics challenge. Celeb-DF++ covers
three commonly encountered forgery scenarios: Face-swap (FS), Face-reenactment
(FR), and Talking-face (TF). Each scenario contains a substantial number of
high-quality forged videos, generated using a total of 22 various recent
DeepFake methods. These methods differ in terms of architectures, generation
pipelines, and targeted facial regions, covering the most prevalent DeepFake
cases witnessed in the wild. We also introduce evaluation protocols for
measuring the generalizability of 24 recent detection methods, highlighting the
limitations of existing detection methods and the difficulty of our new
dataset.

*Jun Zhou,Dinghao Li,Nannan Li,Mingjie Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents a novel 3D inpainting method combining a refined mask process and uncertainty-guided optimization to improve multi-view consistency and detail fidelity, outperforming existing solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inpainting 3D scenes is difficult due to structural irregularities and the requirement for multi-view consistency.

Method: The proposed framework refines inpainting masks with operations such as Gaussian scene filtering and introduces an Uncertainty-guided Fine-grained Optimization strategy to handle multi-view regions effectively.

Result: The method demonstrates superior performance over state-of-the-art techniques in terms of visual quality and view consistency through experiments on diverse datasets.

Conclusion: Refining masks and leveraging uncertainty-based region importance can significantly enhance the 3D inpainting process, offering a better solution for multi-view consistent scene reconstruction.

Abstract: Recent advancements in multi-view 3D reconstruction and novel-view synthesis,
particularly through Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting
(3DGS), have greatly enhanced the fidelity and efficiency of 3D content
creation. However, inpainting 3D scenes remains a challenging task due to the
inherent irregularity of 3D structures and the critical need for maintaining
multi-view consistency. In this work, we propose a novel 3D Gaussian inpainting
framework that reconstructs complete 3D scenes by leveraging sparse inpainted
views. Our framework incorporates an automatic Mask Refinement Process and
region-wise Uncertainty-guided Optimization. Specifically, we refine the
inpainting mask using a series of operations, including Gaussian scene
filtering and back-projection, enabling more accurate localization of occluded
regions and realistic boundary restoration. Furthermore, our Uncertainty-guided
Fine-grained Optimization strategy, which estimates the importance of each
region across multi-view images during training, alleviates multi-view
inconsistencies and enhances the fidelity of fine details in the inpainted
results. Comprehensive experiments conducted on diverse datasets demonstrate
that our approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in both visual
quality and view consistency.

enhanced the feasibility of emotion recognition based on full-body motion. This
survey provides a comprehensive and systematic review of skeleton-based emotion
recognition techniques. First, we introduce psychological models of emotion and
examine the relationship between bodily movements and emotional expression.
Next, we summarize publicly available datasets, highlighting the differences in
data acquisition methods and emotion labeling strategies. We then categorize
existing methods into posture-based and gait-based approaches, analyzing them
from both data-driven and technical perspectives. In particular, we propose a
unified taxonomy that encompasses four primary technical paradigms: Traditional
approaches, Feat2Net, FeatFusionNet, and End2EndNet. Representative works
within each category are reviewed and compared, with benchmarking results
across commonly used datasets. Finally, we explore the extended applications of
emotion recognition in mental health assessment, such as detecting depression
and autism, and discuss the open challenges and future research directions in
this rapidly evolving field.

*Ahmad ALBarqawi,Mahmoud Nazzal,Issa Khalil,Abdallah Khreishah,NhatHai Phan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ViGText is a novel approach that combines Vision Large Language Model (VLLM) Text explanations and images in a graph-based framework to improve deepfake detection with higher generalization and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of the paper is to address the limitations of traditional deepfake detection methods, which struggle with generalization and robustness, particularly against sophisticated, customized deepfakes.

Method: The proposed method, ViGText, integrates image patches with Vision Large Language Model explanations into a graph-based framework. It combines image and text data using Graph Neural Networks for a context-aware analysis, leveraging multi-level feature extraction across spatial and frequency domains to enhance detection capabilities.

Result: ViGText achieves notable performance improvements, increasing the average F1 score from 72.45% to 98.32% in generalization evaluations and improving recall by 11.1% in robustness tests. It limits performance degradation to less than 4% against targeted attacks.

Conclusion: ViGText sets a new benchmark in deepfake detection by combining visual and textual analysis, offering robust and generalized solutions for ensuring the authenticity of media content.

Abstract: The rapid rise of deepfake technology, which produces realistic but
fraudulent digital content, threatens the authenticity of media. Traditional
deepfake detection approaches often struggle with sophisticated, customized
deepfakes, especially in terms of generalization and robustness against
malicious attacks. This paper introduces ViGText, a novel approach that
integrates images with Vision Large Language Model (VLLM) Text explanations
within a Graph-based framework to improve deepfake detection. The novelty of
ViGText lies in its integration of detailed explanations with visual data, as
it provides a more context-aware analysis than captions, which often lack
specificity and fail to reveal subtle inconsistencies. ViGText systematically
divides images into patches, constructs image and text graphs, and integrates
them for analysis using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to identify deepfakes.
Through the use of multi-level feature extraction across spatial and frequency
domains, ViGText captures details that enhance its robustness and accuracy to
detect sophisticated deepfakes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ViGText
significantly enhances generalization and achieves a notable performance boost
when it detects user-customized deepfakes. Specifically, average F1 scores rise
from 72.45% to 98.32% under generalization evaluation, and reflects the model's
superior ability to generalize to unseen, fine-tuned variations of stable
diffusion models. As for robustness, ViGText achieves an increase of 11.1% in
recall compared to other deepfake detection approaches. When facing targeted
attacks that exploit its graph-based architecture, ViGText limits
classification performance degradation to less than 4%. ViGText uses detailed
visual and textual analysis to set a new standard for detecting deepfakes,
helping ensure media authenticity and information integrity.

*Hanwen Shen,Jiajie Lu,Yupeng Cao,Xiaonan Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Transition-Aware Video (TAV) dataset to improve AI models' ability to generate coherent, multi-scene videos by enhancing scene transition understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI models struggle with generating longer, multi-scene videos due to their training on single-scene datasets, which limits their capability to detect necessary scene transitions.

Method: The authors created the TAV dataset, a collection of video clips with multiple scene transitions, and post-trained existing models on this specialized dataset to enhance scene transition awareness.

Result: Post-training with the TAV dataset improved models' understanding of prompt-based scene transitions, reduced discrepancies between expected and generated scenes, and preserved video quality.

Conclusion: Using the TAV dataset develops scene transition awareness in text-to-video models, enabling them to generate coherent multi-scene videos while maintaining quality.

Abstract: Recent advances in AI-generated video have shown strong performance on
\emph{text-to-video} tasks, particularly for short clips depicting a single
scene. However, current models struggle to generate longer videos with coherent
scene transitions, primarily because they cannot infer when a transition is
needed from the prompt. Most open-source models are trained on datasets
consisting of single-scene video clips, which limits their capacity to learn
and respond to prompts requiring multiple scenes. Developing scene transition
awareness is essential for multi-scene generation, as it allows models to
identify and segment videos into distinct clips by accurately detecting
transitions.
  To address this, we propose the \textbf{Transition-Aware Video} (TAV)
dataset, which consists of preprocessed video clips with multiple scene
transitions. Our experiment shows that post-training on the \textbf{TAV}
dataset improves prompt-based scene transition understanding, narrows the gap
between required and generated scenes, and maintains image quality.

TL;DR: BokehDiff introduces a lens blur rendering technique leveraging generative diffusion for high-quality visual results without relying heavily on depth estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of existing lens blur methods, which struggle with depth discontinuities and accuracy issues.

Method: Utilizes a physics-inspired self-attention module with depth constraints integrated into a diffusion model for one-step inference.

Result: Achieves high-quality lens blur rendering and synthesizes scalable photorealistic foregrounds with a transparent diffusion model.

Conclusion: BokehDiff improves accuracy and fidelity of lens blur rendering while addressing paired data challenges.

Abstract: We introduce BokehDiff, a novel lens blur rendering method that achieves
physically accurate and visually appealing outcomes, with the help of
generative diffusion prior. Previous methods are bounded by the accuracy of
depth estimation, generating artifacts in depth discontinuities. Our method
employs a physics-inspired self-attention module that aligns with the image
formation process, incorporating depth-dependent circle of confusion constraint
and self-occlusion effects. We adapt the diffusion model to the one-step
inference scheme without introducing additional noise, and achieve results of
high quality and fidelity. To address the lack of scalable paired data, we
propose to synthesize photorealistic foregrounds with transparency with
diffusion models, balancing authenticity and scene diversity.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study introduces VLM-IMI, a framework using vision-language models and iterative manual instructions for improving low-light image enhancement (LLIE). It combines textual cues with image features for effective restoration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most LLIE methods ignore semantic guidance from normal-light images, limiting their performance in complex lighting situations.

Method: The study integrates textual descriptions as cues for image enhancement and uses a fusion module to align image and text features. Iterative textual refinement during inference improves semantic and structural fidelity.

Result: VLM-IMI surpasses state-of-the-art methods in quantitative metrics and perceptual quality under diverse scenarios.

Conclusion: Leveraging vision-language models and iterative textual refinement provides semantically guided and superior low-light image enhancement results.

Abstract: Most existing low-light image enhancement (LLIE) methods rely on pre-trained
model priors, low-light inputs, or both, while neglecting the semantic guidance
available from normal-light images. This limitation hinders their effectiveness
in complex lighting conditions. In this paper, we propose VLM-IMI, a novel
framework that leverages large vision-language models (VLMs) with iterative and
manual instructions (IMIs) for LLIE. VLM-IMI incorporates textual descriptions
of the desired normal-light content as enhancement cues, enabling semantically
informed restoration. To effectively integrate cross-modal priors, we introduce
an instruction prior fusion module, which dynamically aligns and fuses image
and text features, promoting the generation of detailed and semantically
coherent outputs. During inference, we adopt an iterative and manual
instruction strategy to refine textual instructions, progressively improving
visual quality. This refinement enhances structural fidelity, semantic
alignment, and the recovery of fine details under extremely low-light
conditions. Extensive experiments across diverse scenarios demonstrate that
VLM-IMI outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative metrics and
perceptual quality. The source code is available at

TL;DR: This paper introduces Scenethesis, a novel approach for generating requirement-sensitive 3D software using a domain-specific language that ensures accurate user specification traceability and fine-grained scene modifications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods excel in automated 2D software generation but face challenges in 3D software generation, particularly in modifying specific elements and managing spatial/semantic constraints.

Method: Scenethesis uses ScenethesisLang, a domain-specific language, as an intermediate representation to bridge natural language requirements and executable 3D software. It decomposes the synthesis process into stages for verification, modification, and constraint satisfaction.

Result: Scenethesis captures over 80% of user requirements, satisfies more than 90% of hard constraints, handles over 100 constraints simultaneously, and achieves a 42.8% improvement in BLIP-2 visual evaluation scores compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: Scenethesis offers a significant improvement in 3D software generation by enabling traceability, fine-grained modifications, and effective handling of complex constraints, advancing the state of the art in this domain.

Abstract: Graphical user interface (UI) software has undergone a fundamental
transformation from traditional two-dimensional (2D) desktop/web/mobile
interfaces to spatial three-dimensional (3D) environments. While existing work
has made remarkable success in automated 2D software generation, such as
HTML/CSS and mobile app interface code synthesis, the generation of 3D software
still remains under-explored. Current methods for 3D software generation
usually generate the 3D environments as a whole and cannot modify or control
specific elements in the software. Furthermore, these methods struggle to
handle the complex spatial and semantic constraints inherent in the real world.
To address the challenges, we present Scenethesis, a novel
requirement-sensitive 3D software synthesis approach that maintains formal
traceability between user specifications and generated 3D software. Scenethesis
is built upon ScenethesisLang, a domain-specific language that serves as a
granular constraint-aware intermediate representation (IR) to bridge natural
language requirements and executable 3D software. It serves both as a
comprehensive scene description language enabling fine-grained modification of
3D software elements and as a formal constraint-expressive specification
language capable of expressing complex spatial constraints. By decomposing 3D
software synthesis into stages operating on ScenethesisLang, Scenethesis
enables independent verification, targeted modification, and systematic
constraint satisfaction. Our evaluation demonstrates that Scenethesis
accurately captures over 80% of user requirements and satisfies more than 90%
of hard constraints while handling over 100 constraints simultaneously.
Furthermore, Scenethesis achieves a 42.8% improvement in BLIP-2 visual
evaluation scores compared to the state-of-the-art method.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel framework for Visual Place Recognition (VPR) integrating a transformer-based module (DSFormer) and an optimized data clustering strategy to achieve state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome challenges in maintaining reliable VPR performance under changing environmental conditions and diverse viewpoints.

Method: The proposed method incorporates DSFormer, a Transformer-based module that enhances feature representation with bidirectional information transfer between dual-scale CNN features, and a block clustering strategy to optimize training dataset partitioning for improved viewpoint robustness.

Result: The framework achieves state-of-the-art performance across most benchmark datasets compared to advanced methods while improving computational efficiency and reducing required training data volume by 30%.

Conclusion: The approach effectively enhances VPR robustness, adaptability, and efficiency, setting new benchmarks in global retrieval performance with compact descriptors.

Abstract: Visual Place Recognition (VPR) is crucial for robust mobile robot
localization, yet it faces significant challenges in maintaining reliable
performance under varying environmental conditions and viewpoints. To address
this, we propose a novel framework that integrates Dual-Scale-Former
(DSFormer), a Transformer-based cross-learning module, with an innovative block
clustering strategy. DSFormer enhances feature representation by enabling
bidirectional information transfer between dual-scale features extracted from
the final two CNN layers, capturing both semantic richness and spatial details
through self-attention for long-range dependencies within each scale and shared
cross-attention for cross-scale learning. Complementing this, our block
clustering strategy repartitions the widely used San Francisco eXtra Large
(SF-XL) training dataset from multiple distinct perspectives, optimizing data
organization to further bolster robustness against viewpoint variations.
Together, these innovations not only yield a robust global embedding adaptable
to environmental changes but also reduce the required training data volume by
approximately 30\% compared to previous partitioning methods. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance
across most benchmark datasets, surpassing advanced reranking methods like
DELG, Patch-NetVLAD, TransVPR, and R2Former as a global retrieval solution
using 512-dim global descriptors, while significantly improving computational
efficiency.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces TextSAM-EUS, a lightweight, text-driven model for automatic pancreatic tumor segmentation in Endoscopic Ultrasound (EUS) images, achieving state-of-the-art performance without requiring extensive manually labeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pancreatic cancer detection via EUS is challenging due to speckle noise, low contrast, and the dataset dependence of deep learning models. The study aims to create a more efficient approach that minimizes manual annotation requirements.

Method: The authors propose adapting the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to a medical context, employing text prompt learning via BiomedCLIP and LoRA techniques to fine-tune the model with only 0.86% of its total parameters.

Result: TextSAM-EUS achieved an 82.69% Dice score and 85.28% NSD using automatic prompts, while manual geometric prompts resulted in 83.10% Dice and 85.70% NSD. It outperformed existing state-of-the-art supervised DL models and prior SAM variants.

Conclusion: TextSAM-EUS is the first application of text prompt learning in SAM-based medical image segmentation and is a practical, efficient solution for EUS pancreatic tumor segmentation. The code is to be released publicly for further development.

Abstract: Pancreatic cancer carries a poor prognosis and relies on endoscopic
ultrasound (EUS) for targeted biopsy and radiotherapy. However, the speckle
noise, low contrast, and unintuitive appearance of EUS make segmentation of
pancreatic tumors with fully supervised deep learning (DL) models both
error-prone and dependent on large, expert-curated annotation datasets. To
address these challenges, we present TextSAM-EUS, a novel, lightweight,
text-driven adaptation of the Segment Anything Model (SAM) that requires no
manual geometric prompts at inference. Our approach leverages text prompt
learning (context optimization) through the BiomedCLIP text encoder in
conjunction with a LoRA-based adaptation of SAM's architecture to enable
automatic pancreatic tumor segmentation in EUS, tuning only 0.86% of the total
parameters. On the public Endoscopic Ultrasound Database of the Pancreas,
TextSAM-EUS with automatic prompts attains 82.69% Dice and 85.28% normalized
surface distance (NSD), and with manual geometric prompts reaches 83.10% Dice
and 85.70% NSD, outperforming both existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) supervised
DL models and foundation models (e.g., SAM and its variants). As the first
attempt to incorporate prompt learning in SAM-based medical image segmentation,
TextSAM-EUS offers a practical option for efficient and robust automatic EUS
segmentation. Our code will be publicly available upon acceptance.

Result: Experiments on DFEW and FERV39k datasets showcased HDF's superior performance in recognition accuracy and robustness, achieving high WAR and UAR metrics.

Conclusion: The HDF framework effectively handles heterogeneity in expression data, improving industry-standard metrics while maintaining generalization across diverse scenarios.

Abstract: Dynamic Facial Expression Recognition (DFER) plays a critical role in
affective computing and human-computer interaction. Although existing methods
achieve comparable performance, they inevitably suffer from performance
degradation under sample heterogeneity caused by multi-source data and
individual expression variability. To address these challenges, we propose a
novel framework, called Heterogeneity-aware Distributional Framework (HDF), and
design two plug-and-play modules to enhance time-frequency modeling and
mitigate optimization imbalance caused by hard samples. Specifically, the
Time-Frequency Distributional Attention Module (DAM) captures both temporal
consistency and frequency robustness through a dual-branch attention design,
improving tolerance to sequence inconsistency and visual style shifts. Then,
based on gradient sensitivity and information bottleneck principles, an
adaptive optimization module Distribution-aware Scaling Module (DSM) is
introduced to dynamically balance classification and contrastive losses,
enabling more stable and discriminative representation learning. Extensive
experiments on two widely used datasets, DFEW and FERV39k, demonstrate that HDF
significantly improves both recognition accuracy and robustness. Our method
achieves superior weighted average recall (WAR) and unweighted average recall
(UAR) while maintaining strong generalization across diverse and imbalanced
scenarios. Codes are released at https://github.com/QIcita/HDF_DFER.

*JinYoung Kim,DaeUng Jo,Kimin Yun,Jeonghyo Song,Youngjoon Yoo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Free-Energy Posterior Network for improved out-of-distribution (OoD) detection by jointly modeling distributional uncertainty and misclassified regions, validated on real-world benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for OoD detection largely rely on predictive uncertainty but fail to capture the semantic goal of identifying OoD samples effectively.

Method: The method uses a free-energy-based density estimator parameterized by a Beta distribution for fine-grained uncertainty estimation and incorporates a loss into a posterior network for direct uncertainty calculation without stochastic sampling.

Result: The proposed approach demonstrates semantic alignment and computational efficiency while achieving impressive results on benchmarks like Fishyscapes, RoadAnomaly, and Segment-Me-If-You-Can.

Conclusion: The framework provides a meaningful, efficient, and superior solution for uncertainty-aware segmentation compared to conventional OoD detection techniques.

Abstract: Estimating uncertainty from deep neural networks is a widely used approach
for detecting out-of-distribution (OoD) samples, which typically exhibit high
predictive uncertainty. However, conventional methods such as Monte Carlo (MC)
Dropout often focus solely on either model or data uncertainty, failing to
align with the semantic objective of OoD detection. To address this, we propose
the Free-Energy Posterior Network, a novel framework that jointly models
distributional uncertainty and identifying OoD and misclassified regions using
free energy. Our method introduces two key contributions: (1) a
free-energy-based density estimator parameterized by a Beta distribution, which
enables fine-grained uncertainty estimation near ambiguous or unseen regions;
and (2) a loss integrated within a posterior network, allowing direct
uncertainty estimation from learned parameters without requiring stochastic
sampling. By integrating our approach with the residual prediction branch (RPL)
framework, the proposed method goes beyond post-hoc energy thresholding and
enables the network to learn OoD regions by leveraging the variance of the Beta
distribution, resulting in a semantically meaningful and computationally
efficient solution for uncertainty-aware segmentation. We validate the
effectiveness of our method on challenging real-world benchmarks, including
Fishyscapes, RoadAnomaly, and Segment-Me-If-You-Can.

Method: The researchers created T2VWorldBench, which evaluates text-to-video models across 6 major categories, 60 subcategories, and 1,200 prompts using human and automated evaluation techniques.

Result: 10 advanced text-to-video models were evaluated, revealing significant shortcomings in their ability to understand and generate outputs based on world knowledge.

Conclusion: Current text-to-video models have limited ability in commonsense reasoning and factual generation, revealing gaps and research opportunities to enhance their capabilities.

Abstract: Text-to-video (T2V) models have shown remarkable performance in generating
visually reasonable scenes, while their capability to leverage world knowledge
for ensuring semantic consistency and factual accuracy remains largely
understudied. In response to this challenge, we propose T2VWorldBench, the
first systematic evaluation framework for evaluating the world knowledge
generation abilities of text-to-video models, covering 6 major categories, 60
subcategories, and 1,200 prompts across a wide range of domains, including
physics, nature, activity, culture, causality, and object. To address both
human preference and scalable evaluation, our benchmark incorporates both human
evaluation and automated evaluation using vision-language models (VLMs). We
evaluated the 10 most advanced text-to-video models currently available,
ranging from open source to commercial models, and found that most models are
unable to understand world knowledge and generate truly correct videos. These
findings point out a critical gap in the capability of current text-to-video
models to leverage world knowledge, providing valuable research opportunities
and entry points for constructing models with robust capabilities for
commonsense reasoning and factual generation.

TL;DR: This paper proposes an information entropy-based framework for curve tortuosity quantification, demonstrating its potential through analysis of meibomian gland atrophy uniformity and achieving robust experimental results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Precise quantification of curve tortuosity is critical for auxiliary diagnosis and pathological assessment in medical imaging.

Method: The study introduces an entropy-based framework that compares target curves to biologically plausible reference curves, ensuring robust and objective evaluation. Numerical simulations and clinical analyses were conducted to validate the method.

Result: The framework showed significant differentiation in meibomian gland atrophy uniformity for Demodex-negative vs. positive patients, with an AUC of 0.8768, sensitivity of 0.75, and specificity of 0.93.

Conclusion: The proposed method offers a robust, objective approach to curve tortuosity assessment, showcasing strong potential for generalizable application in medical diagnostics.

Abstract: In the medical image analysis field, precise quantification of curve
tortuosity plays a critical role in the auxiliary diagnosis and pathological
assessment of various diseases. In this study, we propose a novel framework for
tortuosity quantification and demonstrate its effectiveness through the
evaluation of meibomian gland atrophy uniformity,serving as a representative
application scenario.
  We introduce an information entropy-based tortuosity quantification framework
that integrates probability modeling with entropy theory and incorporates
domain transformation of curve data. Unlike traditional methods such as
curvature or arc-chord ratio, this approach evaluates the tortuosity of a
target curve by comparing it to a designated reference curve. Consequently, it
is more suitable for tortuosity assessment tasks in medical data where
biologically plausible reference curves are available, providing a more robust
and objective evaluation metric without relying on idealized straight-line
comparisons.
  First, we conducted numerical simulation experiments to preliminarily assess
the stability and validity of the method. Subsequently, the framework was
applied to quantify the spatial uniformity of meibomian gland atrophy and to
analyze the difference in this uniformity between \textit{Demodex}-negative and
\textit{Demodex}-positive patient groups. The results demonstrated a
significant difference in tortuosity-based uniformity between the two groups,
with an area under the curve of 0.8768, sensitivity of 0.75, and specificity of
0.93. These findings highlight the clinical utility of the proposed framework
in curve tortuosity analysis and its potential as a generalizable tool for
quantitative morphological evaluation in medical diagnostics.

### [106] [Degradation-Consistent Learning via Bidirectional Diffusion for Low-Light Image Enhancement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18144)
*Jinhong He,Minglong Xue,Zhipu Liu,Mingliang Zhou,Aoxiang Ning,Palaiahnakote Shivakumara*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a bidirectional diffusion optimization mechanism for improving low-light image enhancement, showing superior performance in generating high-quality images compared to state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing inadequacies in existing unidirectional diffusion-based image enhancement methods that struggle with real-world degradation complexity, leading to inconsistencies in image structure and pixel alignment.

Method: The authors propose a bidirectional diffusion approach that models both low-light and normal-light degradations. This is achieved through bidirectional diffusion operations during training and the introduction of an adaptive feature interaction block (AFI) and a reflection-aware correction module (RACM).

Result: The approach demonstrated improved alignment with human visual perception, suppressed overexposure, and enhanced generalization across different degradation scenarios, outperforming existing methods on benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: By leveraging bidirectional diffusion and novel modules, the method ensures consistent degradation learning, high-quality image restoration, and generalization to diverse visual scenarios.

Abstract: Low-light image enhancement aims to improve the visibility of degraded images
to better align with human visual perception. While diffusion-based methods
have shown promising performance due to their strong generative capabilities.
However, their unidirectional modelling of degradation often struggles to
capture the complexity of real-world degradation patterns, leading to
structural inconsistencies and pixel misalignments. To address these
challenges, we propose a bidirectional diffusion optimization mechanism that
jointly models the degradation processes of both low-light and normal-light
images, enabling more precise degradation parameter matching and enhancing
generation quality. Specifically, we perform bidirectional diffusion-from
low-to-normal light and from normal-to-low light during training and introduce
an adaptive feature interaction block (AFI) to refine feature representation.
By leveraging the complementarity between these two paths, our approach imposes
an implicit symmetry constraint on illumination attenuation and noise
distribution, facilitating consistent degradation learning and improving the
models ability to perceive illumination and detail degradation. Additionally,
we design a reflection-aware correction module (RACM) to guide color
restoration post-denoising and suppress overexposed regions, ensuring content
consistency and generating high-quality images that align with human visual
perception. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate
that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative and
qualitative evaluations while generalizing effectively to diverse degradation
scenarios. Code at https://github.com/hejh8/BidDiff

TL;DR: WaveMamba is a cross-modality fusion method using RGB and IR imagery for object detection by leveraging DWT, advanced feature fusion, and gated attention mechanisms, achieving a 4.5% mAP improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance object detection by effectively integrating complementary features of RGB and IR imagery.

Method: The paper proposes the WaveMamba method, employing Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) for feature decomposition and fusion, incorporating a WaveMamba Fusion Block (WMFB) with low- and high-frequency enhancements and gated attention mechanisms.

Result: WaveMamba outperforms state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating an average mAP improvement of 4.5% across four benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: Cross-modality fusion using WaveMamba demonstrates the potential of integrating RGB and IR imagery through frequency-specific methods for improved object detection performance.

Abstract: Leveraging the complementary characteristics of visible (RGB) and infrared
(IR) imagery offers significant potential for improving object detection. In
this paper, we propose WaveMamba, a cross-modality fusion method that
efficiently integrates the unique and complementary frequency features of RGB
and IR decomposed by Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT). An improved detection
head incorporating the Inverse Discrete Wavelet Transform (IDWT) is also
proposed to reduce information loss and produce the final detection results.
The core of our approach is the introduction of WaveMamba Fusion Block (WMFB),
which facilitates comprehensive fusion across low-/high-frequency sub-bands.
Within WMFB, the Low-frequency Mamba Fusion Block (LMFB), built upon the Mamba
framework, first performs initial low-frequency feature fusion with channel
swapping, followed by deep fusion with an advanced gated attention mechanism
for enhanced integration. High-frequency features are enhanced using a strategy
that applies an ``absolute maximum" fusion approach. These advancements lead to
significant performance gains, with our method surpassing state-of-the-art
approaches and achieving average mAP improvements of 4.5% on four benchmarks.

*Abhishek Kaushik,Norbert Haala,Uwe Soergel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a two-stage framework for improving 3D LiDAR semantic segmentation under domain shifts using unsupervised domain adaptation strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address performance issues in 3D LiDAR semantic segmentation caused by domain shifts, which are critical for autonomous systems where manual target domain annotation is infeasible.

Method: The proposed method combines contrastive pre-training at the segment level to learn domain-invariant features and a multi-model pseudo-labeling strategy that refines labels via an ensemble of architectures using hard voting.

Result: The approach significantly outperforms direct transfer and single-model UDA methods on SemanticKITTI to unlabeled target datasets like SemanticPOSS and SemanticSlamantic.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that combining contrastive learning with ensemble-based pseudo-labeling effectively reduces domain gaps in 3D LiDAR semantic segmentation, eliminating the need for manual annotations in target domains.

Abstract: Addressing performance degradation in 3D LiDAR semantic segmentation due to
domain shifts (e.g., sensor type, geographical location) is crucial for
autonomous systems, yet manual annotation of target data is prohibitive. This
study addresses the challenge using Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) and
introduces a novel two-stage framework to tackle it. Initially, unsupervised
contrastive learning at the segment level is used to pre-train a backbone
network, enabling it to learn robust, domain-invariant features without labels.
Subsequently, a multi-model pseudo-labeling strategy is introduced, utilizing
an ensemble of diverse state-of-the-art architectures (including projection,
voxel, hybrid, and cylinder-based methods). Predictions from these models are
aggregated via hard voting to generate high-quality, refined pseudo-labels for
the unlabeled target domain, mitigating single-model biases. The contrastively
pre-trained network is then fine-tuned using these robust pseudo-labels.
Experiments adapting from SemanticKITTI to unlabeled target datasets
(SemanticPOSS, SemanticSlamantic) demonstrate significant improvements in
segmentation accuracy compared to direct transfer and single-model UDA
approaches. These results highlight the effectiveness of combining contrastive
pre-training with refined ensemble pseudo-labeling for bridging complex domain
gaps without requiring target domain annotations.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Diff-UMamba enhances segmentation accuracy in medical imaging by integrating UNet and mamba frameworks with a focus on long-range dependency modeling and noise reduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models perform poorly in data-scarce scenarios, often overfitting irrelevant patterns, particularly in medical image segmentation tasks.

Method: Diff-UMamba combines UNet with mamba and introduces a Noise Reduction Module (NRM) utilizing signal differencing to suppress noise in encoder activations.

Result: The model demonstrates 1-3% accuracy improvements on MSD and AIIB23 datasets and 4-5% improvements in small datasets like NSCLC gross tumor volume segmentation.

Conclusion: Diff-UMamba offers robust and accurate segmentation performance, especially under limited data conditions, making it suitable for clinical applications.

Abstract: In data-scarce scenarios, deep learning models often overfit to noise and
irrelevant patterns, which limits their ability to generalize to unseen
samples. To address these challenges in medical image segmentation, we
introduce Diff-UMamba, a novel architecture that combines the UNet framework
with the mamba mechanism for modeling long-range dependencies. At the heart of
Diff-UMamba is a Noise Reduction Module (NRM), which employs a signal
differencing strategy to suppress noisy or irrelevant activations within the
encoder. This encourages the model to filter out spurious features and enhance
task-relevant representations, thereby improving its focus on clinically
meaningful regions. As a result, the architecture achieves improved
segmentation accuracy and robustness, particularly in low-data settings.
Diff-UMamba is evaluated on multiple public datasets, including MSD (lung and
pancreas) and AIIB23, demonstrating consistent performance gains of 1-3% over
baseline methods across diverse segmentation tasks. To further assess
performance under limited-data conditions, additional experiments are conducted
on the BraTS-21 dataset by varying the proportion of available training
samples. The approach is also validated on a small internal non-small cell lung
cancer (NSCLC) dataset for gross tumor volume (GTV) segmentation in cone beam
CT (CBCT), where it achieves a 4-5% improvement over the baseline.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MatSSL, a self-supervised learning architecture with Gated Feature Fusion, surpasses conventional supervised methods in metallic micrograph analysis, achieving strong segmentation results using small-scale pretraining datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Micrograph analysis in metallic materials heavily depends on supervised methods, which require dataset-specific retraining and perform poorly on limited labeled samples. Self-supervised learning offers promise, but existing approaches still demand large datasets.

Method: MatSSL employs self-supervised pretraining on a small, unlabeled dataset and utilizes Gated Feature Fusion in its architecture. Fine-tuning is then performed on benchmark datasets to achieve competitive segmentation results.

Result: MatSSL achieves a 69.13% mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) on the MetalDAM dataset, surpassing ImageNet-pretrained models (66.73%), and delivers up to 40% better average mIoU on the EBC benchmark compared to MicroNet-pretrained models.

Conclusion: MatSSL effectively adapts to metallographic domains with limited labeled data while preserving transferable features from natural image pretraining.

Abstract: MatSSL is a streamlined self-supervised learning (SSL) architecture that
employs Gated Feature Fusion at each stage of the backbone to integrate
multi-level representations effectively. Current micrograph analysis of
metallic materials relies on supervised methods, which require retraining for
each new dataset and often perform inconsistently with only a few labeled
samples. While SSL offers a promising alternative by leveraging unlabeled data,
most existing methods still depend on large-scale datasets to be effective.
MatSSL is designed to overcome this limitation. We first perform
self-supervised pretraining on a small-scale, unlabeled dataset and then
fine-tune the model on multiple benchmark datasets. The resulting segmentation
models achieve 69.13% mIoU on MetalDAM, outperforming the 66.73% achieved by an
ImageNet-pretrained encoder, and delivers consistently up to nearly 40%
improvement in average mIoU on the Environmental Barrier Coating benchmark
dataset (EBC) compared to models pretrained with MicroNet. This suggests that
MatSSL enables effective adaptation to the metallographic domain using only a
small amount of unlabeled data, while preserving the rich and transferable
features learned from large-scale pretraining on natural images.

*Minghao Fu,Guo-Hua Wang,Xiaohao Chen,Qing-Guo Chen,Zhao Xu,Weihua Luo,Kaifu Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TeEFusion introduces an efficient way to reduce inference costs in text-to-image synthesis without compromising image quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-to-image synthesis faces high inference costs due to complex sampling strategies and the dual forward passes required for classifier-free guidance (CFG).

Method: The paper proposes TeEFusion, which directly incorporates guidance into text embeddings and distills the teacher model's sampling strategy using linear fusion operations between conditional and unconditional embeddings.

Result: Experiments on SD3 show TeEFusion allows a student model to mimic the teacher's performance and achieve up to 6x faster inference speeds while maintaining comparable image quality.

Conclusion: TeEFusion simplifies the process of text-to-image generation, improving efficiency significantly with minimal compromises in output quality.

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-image synthesis largely benefit from sophisticated
sampling strategies and classifier-free guidance (CFG) to ensure high-quality
generation. However, CFG's reliance on two forward passes, especially when
combined with intricate sampling algorithms, results in prohibitively high
inference costs. To address this, we introduce TeEFusion (\textbf{Te}xt
\textbf{E}mbeddings \textbf{Fusion}), a novel and efficient distillation method
that directly incorporates the guidance magnitude into the text embeddings and
distills the teacher model's complex sampling strategy. By simply fusing
conditional and unconditional text embeddings using linear operations,
TeEFusion reconstructs the desired guidance without adding extra parameters,
simultaneously enabling the student model to learn from the teacher's output
produced via its sophisticated sampling approach. Extensive experiments on
state-of-the-art models such as SD3 demonstrate that our method allows the
student to closely mimic the teacher's performance with a far simpler and more
efficient sampling strategy. Consequently, the student model achieves inference
speeds up to 6$\times$ faster than the teacher model, while maintaining image
quality at levels comparable to those obtained through the teacher's complex
sampling approach. The code is publicly available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces LEAF, a diffusion-model-based medical image segmentation tool aiming to improve task-specific performance without increasing computational or parametric demands.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion model methods lack specific adjustments for segmentation tasks and exhibit deficiencies in feature extraction, necessitating tailored solutions leveraging their capabilities.

Method: LEAF modifies diffusion model fine-tuning by directly predicting segmentation maps to reduce variances and employs feature distillation to align convolutional and transformer-based visual features.

Result: LEAF demonstrated enhanced segmentation performance across multiple medical datasets for various diseases, showcasing improvement over other diffusion models.

Conclusion: LEAF effectively tailors diffusion models for medical image segmentation without altering architecture or computational load during inference, proving its efficiency and efficacy.

Abstract: Leveraging the powerful capabilities of diffusion models has yielded quite
effective results in medical image segmentation tasks. However, existing
methods typically transfer the original training process directly without
specific adjustments for segmentation tasks. Furthermore, the commonly used
pre-trained diffusion models still have deficiencies in feature extraction.
Based on these considerations, we propose LEAF, a medical image segmentation
model grounded in latent diffusion models. During the fine-tuning process, we
replace the original noise prediction pattern with a direct prediction of the
segmentation map, thereby reducing the variance of segmentation results. We
also employ a feature distillation method to align the hidden states of the
convolutional layers with the features from a transformer-based vision encoder.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method enhances the performance of
the original diffusion model across multiple segmentation datasets for
different disease types. Notably, our approach does not alter the model
architecture, nor does it increase the number of parameters or computation
during the inference phase, making it highly efficient.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GSDTTA introduces an efficient way to adapt pre-trained models for 3D point cloud classification in the presence of domain shifts by leveraging graph spectral information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges of applying TTA methods to irregular and unordered 3D point clouds, aiming to enhance efficiency and performance.

Method: Adapt target domain point clouds into graph spectral domain, optimize low-frequency components using Graph Fourier Transform, reconstruct with inverse GFT, and refine with eigenmap-guided self-training.

Result: Improved accuracy and computational efficiency compared to previous 3D point cloud TTA methods based on experimental results and ablation studies.

Conclusion: GSDTTA effectively addresses domain shifts in 3D point cloud classification by using global spectral properties, delivering superior adaptation performance and efficiency.

Abstract: While test-time adaptation (TTA) methods effectively address domain shifts by
dynamically adapting pre-trained models to target domain data during online
inference, their application to 3D point clouds is hindered by their irregular
and unordered structure. Current 3D TTA methods often rely on computationally
expensive spatial-domain optimizations and may require additional training
data. In contrast, we propose Graph Spectral Domain Test-Time Adaptation
(GSDTTA), a novel approach for 3D point cloud classification that shifts
adaptation to the graph spectral domain, enabling more efficient adaptation by
capturing global structural properties with fewer parameters. Point clouds in
target domain are represented as outlier-aware graphs and transformed into
graph spectral domain by Graph Fourier Transform (GFT). For efficiency,
adaptation is performed by optimizing only the lowest 10% of frequency
components, which capture the majority of the point cloud's energy. An inverse
GFT (IGFT) is then applied to reconstruct the adapted point cloud with the
graph spectral-driven point shift. This process is enhanced by an
eigenmap-guided self-training strategy that iteratively refines both the
spectral adjustments and the model parameters. Experimental results and
ablation studies on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of GSDTTA,
outperforming existing TTA methods for 3D point cloud classification.

Result: Extensive experiments show that DATA achieves state-of-the-art performance across three datasets while maintaining robustness to delays and errors.

Conclusion: The proposed DATA network effectively aligns and enhances features, facilitating improved collaborative perception under challenging conditions.

Abstract: Feature-level fusion shows promise in collaborative perception (CP) through
balanced performance and communication bandwidth trade-off. However, its
effectiveness critically relies on input feature quality. The acquisition of
high-quality features faces domain gaps from hardware diversity and deployment
conditions, alongside temporal misalignment from transmission delays. These
challenges degrade feature quality with cumulative effects throughout the
collaborative network. In this paper, we present the Domain-And-Time Alignment
(DATA) network, designed to systematically align features while maximizing
their semantic representations for fusion. Specifically, we propose a
Consistency-preserving Domain Alignment Module (CDAM) that reduces domain gaps
through proximal-region hierarchical downsampling and observability-constrained
discriminator. We further propose a Progressive Temporal Alignment Module
(PTAM) to handle transmission delays via multi-scale motion modeling and
two-stage compensation. Building upon the aligned features, an Instance-focused
Feature Aggregation Module (IFAM) is developed to enhance semantic
representations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DATA achieves
state-of-the-art performance on three typical datasets, maintaining robustness
with severe communication delays and pose errors. The code will be released at

*Longjian Zeng,Zunjie Zhu,Rongfeng Lu,Ming Lu,Bolun Zheng,Chenggang Yan,Anke Xue*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces DepthDark, a foundation model for monocular depth estimation specifically designed for low-light environments, using a novel simulation-based dataset generation and fine-tuning strategy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a lack of robust models for monocular depth estimation under low-light conditions due to the absence of high-quality datasets and effective fine-tuning strategies.

Method: The authors simulate low-light conditions with flare and noise modules, create a paired depth dataset, and propose a PEFT strategy with illumination guidance and multiscale feature fusion.

Result: DepthDark achieves state-of-the-art performance on the nuScenes-Night and RobotCar-Night datasets, even with limited training data and computational resources.

Conclusion: DepthDark demonstrates significant advancements in low-light monocular depth estimation, addressing current deficiencies and providing a robust solution for challenging scenarios.

Abstract: In recent years, foundation models for monocular depth estimation have
received increasing attention. Current methods mainly address typical daylight
conditions, but their effectiveness notably decreases in low-light
environments. There is a lack of robust foundational models for monocular depth
estimation specifically designed for low-light scenarios. This largely stems
from the absence of large-scale, high-quality paired depth datasets for
low-light conditions and the effective parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT)
strategy. To address these challenges, we propose DepthDark, a robust
foundation model for low-light monocular depth estimation. We first introduce a
flare-simulation module and a noise-simulation module to accurately simulate
the imaging process under nighttime conditions, producing high-quality paired
depth datasets for low-light conditions. Additionally, we present an effective
low-light PEFT strategy that utilizes illumination guidance and multiscale
feature fusion to enhance the model's capability in low-light environments. Our
method achieves state-of-the-art depth estimation performance on the
challenging nuScenes-Night and RobotCar-Night datasets, validating its
effectiveness using limited training data and computing resources.

*Zhuoguang Chen,Minghui Qin,Tianyuan Yuan,Zhe Liu,Hang Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces LONG3R, a model for real-time 3D scene reconstruction from long sequences of multi-view images, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-view scene reconstruction methods struggle with processing long sequences in real-time due to reliance on either offline optimization or sequence length restrictions.

Method: The proposed LONG3R model incorporates recurrent processing with a memory gating mechanism, a dual-source refined decoder, a spatio-temporal memory for efficient long-sequence capture, and a two-stage curriculum training strategy.

Result: LONG3R surpasses state-of-the-art streaming methods, particularly on longer sequences, while achieving real-time inference speed.

Conclusion: The model successfully addresses the limitations of prior methods, offering an efficient real-time approach for long-sequence 3D scene reconstruction with significant improvements in both performance and applicability.

Abstract: Recent advancements in multi-view scene reconstruction have been significant,
yet existing methods face limitations when processing streams of input images.
These methods either rely on time-consuming offline optimization or are
restricted to shorter sequences, hindering their applicability in real-time
scenarios. In this work, we propose LONG3R (LOng sequence streaming 3D
Reconstruction), a novel model designed for streaming multi-view 3D scene
reconstruction over longer sequences. Our model achieves real-time processing
by operating recurrently, maintaining and updating memory with each new
observation. We first employ a memory gating mechanism to filter relevant
memory, which, together with a new observation, is fed into a dual-source
refined decoder for coarse-to-fine interaction. To effectively capture
long-sequence memory, we propose a 3D spatio-temporal memory that dynamically
prunes redundant spatial information while adaptively adjusting resolution
along the scene. To enhance our model's performance on long sequences while
maintaining training efficiency, we employ a two-stage curriculum training
strategy, each stage targeting specific capabilities. Experiments demonstrate
that LONG3R outperforms state-of-the-art streaming methods, particularly for
longer sequences, while maintaining real-time inference speed. Project page:

### [117] [Exploiting Gaussian Agnostic Representation Learning with Diffusion Priors for Enhanced Infrared Small Target Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18260)
*Junyao Li,Yahao Lu,Xingyuan Guo,Xiaoyu Xian,Tiantian Wang,Yukai Shi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses the fragility of state-of-the-art infrared small target detection (ISTD) methods in real-world data-scarce scenarios by introducing a novel approach based on Gaussian representation learning and two-stage diffusion models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve the robustness and performance of ISTD methods, which currently rely heavily on large, high-quality, manually labeled datasets and struggle in real-world scenarios where such data scarcity exists.

Method: The authors propose the Gaussian Group Squeezer for non-uniform quantization using Gaussian sampling, and a two-stage diffusion model to improve the alignment of synthetic samples with real-world distributions.

Result: The introduced methods enhance the resilience of ISTD models to challenges posed by data scarcity and significantly improve their detection performance in comparison to mainstream methods in such scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed Gaussian Agnostic Representation Learning approach, through its innovative methods, strengthens the effectiveness and practical usability of ISTD in challenging real-world environments.

Abstract: Infrared small target detection (ISTD) plays a vital role in numerous
practical applications. In pursuit of determining the performance boundaries,
researchers employ large and expensive manual-labeling data for representation
learning. Nevertheless, this approach renders the state-of-the-art ISTD methods
highly fragile in real-world challenges. In this paper, we first study the
variation in detection performance across several mainstream methods under
various scarcity -- namely, the absence of high-quality infrared data -- that
challenge the prevailing theories about practical ISTD. To address this
concern, we introduce the Gaussian Agnostic Representation Learning.
Specifically, we propose the Gaussian Group Squeezer, leveraging Gaussian
sampling and compression for non-uniform quantization. By exploiting a diverse
array of training samples, we enhance the resilience of ISTD models against
various challenges. Then, we introduce two-stage diffusion models for
real-world reconstruction. By aligning quantized signals closely with
real-world distributions, we significantly elevate the quality and fidelity of
the synthetic samples. Comparative evaluations against state-of-the-art
detection methods in various scarcity scenarios demonstrate the efficacy of the
proposed approach.

*Wenran Zhang,Huihuan Luo,Linda Wei,Ping Nie,Yiqun Wu,Dedong Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study identifies a causal relationship between dental caries and lung cancer, mediated partially by impaired lung function, while periodontitis shows no causal effect.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if the observed link between dental traits (periodontitis, dental caries) and lung cancer is causal.

Method: Two-sample Mendelian randomization using genetic instruments derived from large genome-wide association studies and statistical mediation analysis.

Result: Dental caries showed a significant positive causal effect on lung cancer, especially squamous cell carcinoma, mediated partially by reduced pulmonary function metrics. Periodontitis had no causal effect.

Conclusion: Dental caries contributes causally to lung cancer risk, emphasizing the need for integrated dental and pulmonary monitoring in cancer prevention.

Abstract: Periodontitis and dental caries are common oral diseases affecting billions
globally. While observational studies suggest links between these conditions
and lung cancer, causality remains uncertain. This study used two sample
Mendelian randomization (MR) to explore causal relationships between dental
traits (periodontitis, dental caries) and lung cancer subtypes, and to assess
mediation by pulmonary function. Genetic instruments were derived from the
largest available genome wide association studies, including data from 487,823
dental caries and 506,594 periodontitis cases, as well as lung cancer data from
the Transdisciplinary Research of Cancer in Lung consortium. Inverse variance
weighting was the main analytical method; lung function mediation was assessed
using the delta method. The results showed a significant positive causal effect
of dental caries on overall lung cancer and its subtypes. Specifically, a one
standard deviation increase in dental caries incidence was associated with a
188.0% higher risk of squamous cell lung carcinoma (OR = 2.880, 95% CI =
1.236--6.713, p = 0.014), partially mediated by declines in forced vital
capacity (FVC) and forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), accounting
for 5.124% and 5.890% of the total effect. No causal effect was found for
periodontitis. These findings highlight a causal role of dental caries in lung
cancer risk and support integrating dental care and pulmonary function
monitoring into cancer prevention strategies.

*Jincheng Li,Chunyu Xie,Ji Ao,Dawei Leng,Yuhui Yin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The authors propose LMM-Det, a novel approach to leverage Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) for object detection without specialized detection modules. This study addresses the limitations of LMMs in object detection tasks and introduces optimization techniques for improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the performance gap in object detection between Large Multimodal Models and specialized detection models, aiming to enhance LMMs' efficiency in handling this task, without resorting to heavy integrations.

Method: The authors conducted exploratory analysis on LMMs’ object detection capabilities, implemented data distribution adjustments, inference optimization techniques, and improved instruction conversation organization to boost performance.

Result: Experiments demonstrated that LMM-Det enhances object detection recall rate and capability, validating the model's potential as a versatile and lightweight solution for the task.

Conclusion: Large Multimodal Models have inherent object detection capabilities that can be effectively improved with tailored adjustments, making LMM-Det a promising direction for future research without the need for specialized modules.

Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) have garnered wide-spread attention and
interest within the artificial intelligence research and industrial
communities, owing to their remarkable capability in multimodal understanding,
reasoning, and in-context learning, among others. While LMMs have demonstrated
promising results in tackling multimodal tasks like image captioning, visual
question answering, and visual grounding, the object detection capabilities of
LMMs exhibit a significant gap compared to specialist detectors. To bridge the
gap, we depart from the conventional methods of integrating heavy detectors
with LMMs and propose LMM-Det, a simple yet effective approach that leverages a
Large Multimodal Model for vanilla object Detection without relying on
specialized detection modules. Specifically, we conduct a comprehensive
exploratory analysis when a large multimodal model meets with object detection,
revealing that the recall rate degrades significantly compared with specialist
detection models. To mitigate this, we propose to increase the recall rate by
introducing data distribution adjustment and inference optimization tailored
for object detection. We re-organize the instruction conversations to enhance
the object detection capabilities of large multimodal models. We claim that a
large multimodal model possesses detection capability without any extra
detection modules. Extensive experiments support our claim and show the
effectiveness of the versatile LMM-Det. The datasets, models, and codes are
available at https://github.com/360CVGroup/LMM-Det.

*Xiaomei Zhang,Hanyu Zheng,Xiangyu Zhu,Jinghuan Wei,Junhong Zou,Zhen Lei,Zhaoxiang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FieldLVLM enhances Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) for scientific field data with a novel strategy and compressed tuning, significantly surpassing existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LVLMs excel in tasks like image captioning and visual question answering but underperform in scientific domains, particularly in understanding complex field data used in natural sciences.

Method: FieldLVLM introduces a field-aware language generation strategy, which extracts key physical features and converts them into textual descriptions, coupled with a data-compressed multimodal tuning to streamline model training.

Result: FieldLVLM significantly outperforms existing methods on new benchmark datasets for tasks involving scientific field data.

Conclusion: FieldLVLM shows transformative potential for extending the capabilities of LVLMs into scientific research, bridging the gap between advanced models and domain-specific applications.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have shown impressive capabilities
across a range of tasks that integrate visual and textual understanding, such
as image captioning and visual question answering. These models are trained on
large-scale image and video datasets paired with text, enabling them to bridge
visual perception and natural language processing. However, their application
to scientific domains, especially in interpreting complex field data commonly
used in the natural sciences, remains underexplored. In this work, we introduce
FieldLVLM, a novel framework designed to improve large vision-language models'
understanding of field data. FieldLVLM consists of two main components: a
field-aware language generation strategy and a data-compressed multimodal model
tuning. The field-aware language generation strategy leverages a
special-purpose machine learning pipeline to extract key physical features from
field data, such as flow classification, Reynolds number, and vortex patterns.
This information is then converted into structured textual descriptions that
serve as a dataset. The data-compressed multimodal model tuning focuses on
LVLMs with these generated datasets, using a data compression strategy to
reduce the complexity of field inputs and retain only the most informative
values. This ensures compatibility with the models language decoder and guides
its learning more effectively. Experimental results on newly proposed benchmark
datasets demonstrate that FieldLVLM significantly outperforms existing methods
in tasks involving scientific field data. Our findings suggest that this
approach opens up new possibilities for applying large vision-language models
to scientific research, helping bridge the gap between large models and
domain-specific discovery.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a benchmark for semi-supervised ECG delineation, comparing five algorithms and showing the superiority of transformers over convolutional networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The scarcity of annotated ECG datasets limits progress in ECG waveform segmentation, crucial for clinical diagnosis.

Method: The researchers curated multiple public datasets, tested five SemiSeg algorithms on convolutional networks and transformers, introduced ECG-specific training methods, and evaluated performance under in-domain and cross-domain settings.

Result: Transformers outperformed convolutional networks in semi-supervised ECG delineation across different benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed benchmark is intended to advance semi-supervised ECG delineation and foster further research by addressing the limitations of existing methods.

Abstract: Electrocardiogram (ECG) delineation, the segmentation of meaningful waveform
features, is critical for clinical diagnosis. Despite recent advances using
deep learning, progress has been limited by the scarcity of publicly available
annotated datasets. Semi-supervised learning presents a promising solution by
leveraging abundant unlabeled ECG data. In this study, we present the first
systematic benchmark for semi-supervised semantic segmentation (SemiSeg) in ECG
delineation. We curated and unified multiple public datasets, including
previously underused sources, to support robust and diverse evaluation. We
adopted five representative SemiSeg algorithms from computer vision,
implemented them on two different architectures: the convolutional network and
the transformer, and evaluated them in two different settings: in-domain and
cross-domain. Additionally, we propose ECG-specific training configurations and
augmentation strategies and introduce a standardized evaluation framework. Our
results show that the transformer outperforms the convolutional network in
semi-supervised ECG delineation. We anticipate that our benchmark will serve as
a foundation for advancing semi-supervised ECG delineation methods and will
facilitate further research in this domain.

*Jiangjun Peng,Yisi Luo,Xiangyong Cao,Shuang Xu,Deyu Meng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a modified nuclear norm (MNN) framework for matrix recovery problems, providing enhanced data recovery by combining global low-rankness and local information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches to matrix recovery struggle to effectively combine global low-rank structures with local information and often require parameter tuning.

Method: The authors propose a Modified Nuclear Norm framework that uses transformations on matrices before applying the nuclear norm, offering theoretical guarantees under certain conditions.

Result: The MNN framework achieves superior performance in matrix recovery tasks like Robust PCA and matrix completion, validated through theoretical proofs and extensive experiments.

Conclusion: MNN is a flexible and unified approach that effectively leverages global and local structure for structured low-rank recovery, surpassing the limitations of prior methods.

Abstract: The nuclear norm (NN) has been widely explored in matrix recovery problems,
such as Robust PCA and matrix completion, leveraging the inherent global
low-rank structure of the data. In this study, we introduce a new modified
nuclear norm (MNN) framework, where the MNN family norms are defined by
adopting suitable transformations and performing the NN on the transformed
matrix. The MNN framework offers two main advantages: (1) it jointly captures
both local information and global low-rankness without requiring trade-off
parameter tuning; (2) Under mild assumptions on the transformation, we provided
exact theoretical recovery guarantees for both Robust PCA and MC tasks-an
achievement not shared by existing methods that combine local and global
information. Thanks to its general and flexible design, MNN can accommodate
various proven transformations, enabling a unified and effective approach to
structured low-rank recovery. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method. Code and supplementary material are available at

TL;DR: A new dataset (GVCCS) of contrails is created using ground-based cameras, along with a deep learning framework for analyzing their formation, lifecycle, and climate impact.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To better understand and assess the significant climate impact of aviation contrails, particularly their non-CO2 effects, and to address limitations in current datasets and contrail tracking methods.

Method: Developed the Ground Visible Camera Contrail Sequences (GVCCS) dataset using ground-based all-sky cameras, offering detailed temporal tracking and flight attribution. Proposed a unified deep learning model for semantic segmentation, instance segmentation, and temporal tracking of contrails.

Result: Provided a dataset with 122 video sequences and 24,228 frames, including high-quality annotations and flight linkage. Benchmarked the deep learning model for contrail analysis tasks.

Conclusion: The study enhances contrail monitoring, enables better calibration of physics-based models, and lays the foundation for more accurate understanding of aviation's climate impacts.

Abstract: Aviation's climate impact includes not only CO2 emissions but also
significant non-CO2 effects, especially from contrails. These ice clouds can
alter Earth's radiative balance, potentially rivaling the warming effect of
aviation CO2. Physics-based models provide useful estimates of contrail
formation and climate impact, but their accuracy depends heavily on the quality
of atmospheric input data and on assumptions used to represent complex
processes like ice particle formation and humidity-driven persistence.
Observational data from remote sensors, such as satellites and ground cameras,
could be used to validate and calibrate these models. However, existing
datasets don't explore all aspect of contrail dynamics and formation: they
typically lack temporal tracking, and do not attribute contrails to their
source flights. To address these limitations, we present the Ground Visible
Camera Contrail Sequences (GVCCS), a new open data set of contrails recorded
with a ground-based all-sky camera in the visible range. Each contrail is
individually labeled and tracked over time, allowing a detailed analysis of its
lifecycle. The dataset contains 122 video sequences (24,228 frames) and
includes flight identifiers for contrails that form above the camera. As
reference, we also propose a unified deep learning framework for contrail
analysis using a panoptic segmentation model that performs semantic
segmentation (contrail pixel identification), instance segmentation (individual
contrail separation), and temporal tracking in a single architecture. By
providing high-quality, temporally resolved annotations and a benchmark for
model evaluation, our work supports improved contrail monitoring and will
facilitate better calibration of physical models. This sets the groundwork for
more accurate climate impact understanding and assessments.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SGCDet, an innovative 3D object detection framework that enhances voxel feature representation through adaptive geometry and context-aware modules. It is state-of-the-art on multiple datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D object detection methods suffer from limited voxel receptive fields and inefficiencies in computation due to redundant voxels, limiting their capability in multi-view indoor scenarios.

Method: SGCDet integrates geometric and contextual information dynamically with a geometry-context aware aggregation module and proposes a sparse volume construction strategy to focus computation and refine features on highly occupied voxels.

Result: SGCDet achieves state-of-the-art performance on ScanNet, ScanNet200, and ARKitScenes datasets without needing ground-truth scene geometry for supervision.

Conclusion: The SGCDet framework enhances effectiveness and efficiency in 3D volume construction, advancing indoor object detection while reducing dependency on explicit geometric labeling.

Abstract: This work presents SGCDet, a novel multi-view indoor 3D object detection
framework based on adaptive 3D volume construction. Unlike previous approaches
that restrict the receptive field of voxels to fixed locations on images, we
introduce a geometry and context aware aggregation module to integrate
geometric and contextual information within adaptive regions in each image and
dynamically adjust the contributions from different views, enhancing the
representation capability of voxel features. Furthermore, we propose a sparse
volume construction strategy that adaptively identifies and selects voxels with
high occupancy probabilities for feature refinement, minimizing redundant
computation in free space. Benefiting from the above designs, our framework
achieves effective and efficient volume construction in an adaptive way. Better
still, our network can be supervised using only 3D bounding boxes, eliminating
the dependence on ground-truth scene geometry. Experimental results demonstrate
that SGCDet achieves state-of-the-art performance on the ScanNet, ScanNet200
and ARKitScenes datasets. The source code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to improve bird species classification from bird songs using color-enhanced spectrograms, achieving significant accuracy improvements over prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classifying bird species from song recordings is challenging due to noise, overlapping sounds, and missing labels, which hinder existing models.

Method: The authors embed frequency information in spectrograms through primary color additives to visualize bird motifs, addressing confusion caused by similar motifs across species.

Result: The proposed method achieves substantial improvements over existing models, enhancing F1 score by 7.3%, ROC-AUC by 6.2%, and CMAP by 6.6%, surpassing benchmark results from BirdCLEF 2024.

Conclusion: Embedding frequency information through spectrogram colorization is effective in enhancing bird species classification, as evidenced by significant performance gains.

Abstract: We address the problem of classifying bird species using their song
recordings, a challenging task due to environmental noise, overlapping
vocalizations, and missing labels. Existing models struggle with low-SNR or
multi-species recordings. We hypothesize that birds can be classified by
visualizing their pitch pattern, speed, and repetition, collectively called
motifs. Deep learning models applied to spectrogram images help, but similar
motifs across species cause confusion. To mitigate this, we embed frequency
information into spectrograms using primary color additives. This enhances
species distinction and improves classification accuracy. Our experiments show
that the proposed approach achieves statistically significant gains over models
without colorization and surpasses the BirdCLEF 2024 winner, improving F1 by
7.3%, ROC-AUC by 6.2%, and CMAP by 6.6%. These results demonstrate the
effectiveness of incorporating frequency information via colorization.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents EgoExoBench, a benchmark for evaluating cross-view reasoning between egocentric and exocentric perspectives using video-based tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding and reasoning across first-person and third-person perspectives is key to advancing human-like intelligence in machines, but current MLLMs lack this ability.

Method: The authors created EgoExoBench with over 7,300 question-answer pairs spanning eleven tasks, evaluating 13 MLLMs in semantic alignment, viewpoint association, and temporal reasoning.

Result: MLLMs excel at single-view tasks but show significant limitations in handling cross-view reasoning tasks like semantic alignment and temporal inference.

Conclusion: EgoExoBench provides a foundation for advancing research on embodied AI and intelligent systems capable of cross-view understanding and reasoning.

Abstract: Transferring and integrating knowledge across first-person (egocentric) and
third-person (exocentric) viewpoints is intrinsic to human intelligence,
enabling humans to learn from others and convey insights from their own
experiences. Despite rapid progress in multimodal large language models
(MLLMs), their ability to perform such cross-view reasoning remains unexplored.
To address this, we introduce EgoExoBench, the first benchmark for
egocentric-exocentric video understanding and reasoning. Built from publicly
available datasets, EgoExoBench comprises over 7,300 question-answer pairs
spanning eleven sub-tasks organized into three core challenges: semantic
alignment, viewpoint association, and temporal reasoning. We evaluate 13
state-of-the-art MLLMs and find that while these models excel on single-view
tasks, they struggle to align semantics across perspectives, accurately
associate views, and infer temporal dynamics in the ego-exo context. We hope
EgoExoBench can serve as a valuable resource for research on embodied agents
and intelligent assistants seeking human-like cross-view intelligence.

Abstract: Bias in computer vision models remains a significant challenge, often
resulting in unfair, unreliable, and non-generalizable AI systems. Although
research into bias mitigation has intensified, progress continues to be
hindered by fragmented implementations and inconsistent evaluation practices.

development, evaluation, and comparative analysis of visual bias mitigation
techniques. VB-Mitigator offers a unified research environment encompassing 12
established mitigation methods, 7 diverse benchmark datasets. A key strength of
VB-Mitigator is its extensibility, allowing for seamless integration of
additional methods, datasets, metrics, and models. VB-Mitigator aims to
accelerate research toward fairness-aware computer vision models by serving as
a foundational codebase for the research community to develop and assess their
approaches. To this end, we also recommend best evaluation practices and
provide a comprehensive performance comparison among state-of-the-art
methodologies.

### [128] [Deformable Convolution Module with Globally Learned Relative Offsets for Fundus Vessel Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18354)
*Lexuan Zhu,Yuxuan Li,Yuning Ren*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new deformable convolutional module using attention and feedforward networks to improve global feature capture, especially for fundus blood vessel segmentation, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deformable convolution methods inadequately address long-distance and global feature deformation in tasks with complex self-similar patterns, such as fundus blood vessel segmentation.

Method: The proposed module uses attention and feedforward networks to learn sub-pixel displacement fields, adaptively warping feature maps across channels. This enables global feature deformation and decouples kernel size from the learning network.

Result: The GDCUnet model, incorporating the proposed module, achieves state-of-the-art performance in fundus blood vessel segmentation on public datasets. Ablation studies confirm improved feature learning and generalization over traditional methods.

Conclusion: The module enhances the adaptability of feature learning for tasks with complex global self-similar patterns and is recommended for wider application in machine vision tasks.

Abstract: Deformable convolution can adaptively change the shape of convolution kernel
by learning offsets to deal with complex shape features. We propose a novel
plug and play deformable convolutional module that uses attention and
feedforward networks to learn offsets, so that the deformable patterns can
capture long-distance global features. Compared with previously existing
deformable convolutions, the proposed module learns the sub pixel displacement
field and adaptively warps the feature maps across all channels rather than
directly deforms the convolution kernel , which is equivalent to a relative
deformation of the kernel sampling grids, achieving global feature deformation
and the decoupling of kernel size and learning network. Considering that the
fundus blood vessels have globally self similar complex edges, we design a deep
learning model for fundus blood vessel segmentation, GDCUnet, based on the
proposed convolutional module. Empirical evaluations under the same
configuration and unified framework show that GDCUnet has achieved state of the
art performance on public datasets. Further ablation experiments demonstrated
that the proposed deformable convolutional module could more significantly
learn the complex features of fundus blood vessels, enhancing the model
representation and generalization capabilities.The proposed module is similar
to the interface of conventional convolution, we suggest applying it to more
machine vision tasks with complex global self similar features.

*Xiaotian Chen,DongFu Yin,Fei Richard Yu,Xuanchen Li,Xinhao Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MVG4D is a novel framework designed for generating high-quality dynamic 4D content from a single static image by combining multi-view synthesis with 4D Gaussian Splatting. It surpasses existing methods in temporal consistency, visual quality, and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of producing temporally consistent, geometrically accurate, and visually realistic 4D dynamic content from minimal inputs, a task that remains difficult despite advancements in generative modeling.

Method: MVG4D uses an image matrix module to synthesize multi-view images that are temporally coherent and spatially diverse. These images are used to optimize a 3D Gaussian point cloud, which is extended into the temporal dimension using a lightweight deformation network.

Result: MVG4D demonstrates superior performance on the Objaverse dataset compared to state-of-the-art baselines, achieving better CLIP-I, PSNR, FVD scores, and time efficiency while mitigating flickering artifacts and enhancing structural details.

Conclusion: MVG4D effectively addresses challenges in 4D content generation such as motion discontinuity and background degradation, paving the way for efficient and immersive AR/VR applications from minimal input sources.

Abstract: Advances in generative modeling have significantly enhanced digital content
creation, extending from 2D images to complex 3D and 4D scenes. Despite
substantial progress, producing high-fidelity and temporally consistent dynamic
4D content remains a challenge. In this paper, we propose MVG4D, a novel
framework that generates dynamic 4D content from a single still image by
combining multi-view synthesis with 4D Gaussian Splatting (4D GS). At its core,
MVG4D employs an image matrix module that synthesizes temporally coherent and
spatially diverse multi-view images, providing rich supervisory signals for
downstream 3D and 4D reconstruction. These multi-view images are used to
optimize a 3D Gaussian point cloud, which is further extended into the temporal
domain via a lightweight deformation network. Our method effectively enhances
temporal consistency, geometric fidelity, and visual realism, addressing key
challenges in motion discontinuity and background degradation that affect prior
4D GS-based methods. Extensive experiments on the Objaverse dataset demonstrate
that MVG4D outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in CLIP-I, PSNR, FVD, and
time efficiency. Notably, it reduces flickering artifacts and sharpens
structural details across views and time, enabling more immersive AR/VR
experiences. MVG4D sets a new direction for efficient and controllable 4D
generation from minimal inputs.

### [131] [Towards Consistent Long-Term Pose Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18382)
*Yayuan Li,Filippos Bellos,Jason Corso*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a one-stage architecture for generating pose coordinates directly from RGB images and text descriptions without intermediate tokenization, outperforming existing methods in long-term pose generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods suffer from error accumulation and performance degradation in long-term pose generation due to reliance on intermediate representations.

Method: The proposed approach operates directly on pose coordinates using relative movement prediction, eliminates intermediate representations by introducing a placeholder token for unified training and inference, and utilizes continuous coordinate space.

Result: Experiments on datasets like Penn Action and F-PHAB show significant performance improvements over quantization-based and autoregressive methods, particularly in maintaining temporal coherence for long-term scenarios.

Conclusion: By bypassing intermediate tokenization and focusing on direct pose coordinate prediction, the approach ensures robust long-term generation and bridges the gap between training and inference behavior.

Abstract: Current approaches to pose generation rely heavily on intermediate
representations, either through two-stage pipelines with quantization or
autoregressive models that accumulate errors during inference. This fundamental
limitation leads to degraded performance, particularly in long-term pose
generation where maintaining temporal coherence is crucial. We propose a novel
one-stage architecture that directly generates poses in continuous coordinate
space from minimal context - a single RGB image and text description - while
maintaining consistent distributions between training and inference. Our key
innovation is eliminating the need for intermediate representations or
token-based generation by operating directly on pose coordinates through a
relative movement prediction mechanism that preserves spatial relationships,
and a unified placeholder token approach that enables single-forward generation
with identical behavior during training and inference. Through extensive
experiments on Penn Action and First-Person Hand Action Benchmark (F-PHAB)
datasets, we demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing
quantization-based and autoregressive methods, especially in long-term
generation scenarios.

### [132] [HumanMaterial: Human Material Estimation from a Single Image via Progressive Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18385)
*Yu Jiang,Jiahao Xia,Jiongming Qin,Yusen Wang,Tuo Cao,Chunxia Xiao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new dataset and model for full-body human inverse rendering with improved material realism and estimation performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for full-body human inverse rendering lack realism and struggle to accurately estimate materials, especially for skin, due to simplified datasets and equations.

Method: The authors constructed a high-quality dataset (OpenHumanBRDF) with additional material properties and developed a model (HumanMaterial) with progressive training using prior models and a Controlled PBR Rendering (CPR) loss.

Result: Experiments using the OpenHumanBRDF dataset and real data show that the model outperforms previous methods in material estimation and rendering realism.

Conclusion: The proposed dataset and model improve the realism and accuracy of full-body human inverse rendering, setting a new performance benchmark.

Abstract: Full-body Human inverse rendering based on physically-based rendering aims to
acquire high-quality materials, which helps achieve photo-realistic rendering
under arbitrary illuminations. This task requires estimating multiple material
maps and usually relies on the constraint of rendering result. The absence of
constraints on the material maps makes inverse rendering an ill-posed task.
Previous works alleviated this problem by building material dataset for
training, but their simplified material data and rendering equation lead to
rendering results with limited realism, especially that of skin. To further
alleviate this problem, we construct a higher-quality dataset (OpenHumanBRDF)
based on scanned real data and statistical material data. In addition to the
normal, diffuse albedo, roughness, specular albedo, we produce displacement and
subsurface scattering to enhance the realism of rendering results, especially
for the skin. With the increase in prediction tasks for more materials, using
an end-to-end model as in the previous work struggles to balance the importance
among various material maps, and leads to model underfitting. Therefore, we
design a model (HumanMaterial) with progressive training strategy to make full
use of the supervision information of the material maps and improve the
performance of material estimation. HumanMaterial first obtain the initial
material results via three prior models, and then refine the results by a
finetuning model. Prior models estimate different material maps, and each map
has different significance for rendering results. Thus, we design a Controlled
PBR Rendering (CPR) loss, which enhances the importance of the materials to be
optimized during the training of prior models. Extensive experiments on
OpenHumanBRDF dataset and real data demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitation of Swin Transformer requiring consecutive blocks for global attention, and to improve the efficiency and versatility of vision transformers in hierarchical tasks.

Method: The Iwin Transformer combines interleaved window attention for linking distant tokens and depthwise separable convolution to connect neighboring tokens, enabling effective global information exchange within a single module.

Result: Iwin Transformer achieves competitive performance on various vision tasks like image classification (87.4% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K), semantic segmentation, and video action recognition. It also proves effective in replacing the self-attention module in class-conditional image generation.

Conclusion: Iwin Transformer introduces novel architectural components that enhance hierarchical vision tasks, and its concepts may catalyze future innovations in areas like video generation and 3D attention.

Abstract: We introduce Iwin Transformer, a novel position-embedding-free hierarchical
vision transformer, which can be fine-tuned directly from low to high
resolution, through the collaboration of innovative interleaved window
attention and depthwise separable convolution. This approach uses attention to
connect distant tokens and applies convolution to link neighboring tokens,
enabling global information exchange within a single module, overcoming Swin
Transformer's limitation of requiring two consecutive blocks to approximate
global attention. Extensive experiments on visual benchmarks demonstrate that
Iwin Transformer exhibits strong competitiveness in tasks such as image
classification (87.4 top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K), semantic segmentation and
video action recognition. We also validate the effectiveness of the core
component in Iwin as a standalone module that can seamlessly replace the
self-attention module in class-conditional image generation. The concepts and
methods introduced by the Iwin Transformer have the potential to inspire future
research, like Iwin 3D Attention in video generation. The code and models are

*Xun Ye,Ruixiang Tang,Mingda Zhang,Jianglong Qin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces DCFFSNet, a new network for medical image segmentation, using a feature-decoupling strategy to improve accuracy and address edge fragmentation issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep networks forcibly integrate topological connectivity features without a standardized mechanism to balance their strength against other features, leading to suboptimal segmentation performance.

Method: The paper proposes DCFFSNet, which employs a feature space decoupling strategy to quantify and balance connectivity features dynamically within a deep connectivity fusion-separation architecture. Experiments were performed on multiple medical image segmentation datasets.

Result: DCFFSNet improves performance compared to leading models. For instance, on the ISIC2018 dataset, it showed a 1.3% (Dice) and 1.2% (IoU) improvement over CMUNet. Similar improvements were demonstrated on the DSB2018 and MoNuSeg datasets.

Conclusion: DCFFSNet effectively addresses issues like segmentation fragmentation and edge irregularities, improving medical image segmentation accuracy and clinical usability. It consistently outperformed existing methods in the field.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation leverages topological connectivity theory to
enhance edge precision and regional consistency. However, existing deep
networks integrating connectivity often forcibly inject it as an additional
feature module, resulting in coupled feature spaces with no standardized
mechanism to quantify different feature strengths. To address these issues, we
propose DCFFSNet (Dual-Connectivity Feature Fusion-Separation Network). It
introduces an innovative feature space decoupling strategy. This strategy
quantifies the relative strength between connectivity features and other
features. It then builds a deep connectivity feature fusion-separation
architecture. This architecture dynamically balances multi-scale feature
expression. Experiments were conducted on the ISIC2018, DSB2018, and MoNuSeg
datasets. On ISIC2018, DCFFSNet outperformed the next best model (CMUNet) by
1.3% (Dice) and 1.2% (IoU). On DSB2018, it surpassed TransUNet by 0.7% (Dice)
and 0.9% (IoU). On MoNuSeg, it exceeded CSCAUNet by 0.8% (Dice) and 0.9% (IoU).
The results demonstrate that DCFFSNet exceeds existing mainstream methods
across all metrics. It effectively resolves segmentation fragmentation and
achieves smooth edge transitions. This significantly enhances clinical
usability.

*Edward Ellis,Robert Mendel,Andrew Bulpitt,Nasim Parsa,Michael F Byrne,Sharib Ali*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores adapting the V-JEPA framework for ultrasound video data, proposing a 3D localization auxiliary task to enhance segmentation performance, especially with limited training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Acquiring and annotating large ultrasound datasets is challenging due to issues such as low contrast, high noise, and susceptibility to artefacts. Self-supervised learning (SSL) can leverage unlabelled data to enhance representation learning, improving segmentation when annotated data is scarce.

Method: The authors adopt V-JEPA, a feature prediction-based SSL framework designed for video data, and propose a novel 3D localization auxiliary task during V-JEPA pre-training to address limitations in ViT models, such as lack of locality understanding.

Result: The proposed approach improved segmentation performance. Using 100% of the training data resulted in up to 3.4% performance gain, while using only 10% of the data achieved gains up to 8.35%.

Conclusion: Integrating the V-JEPA framework with the 3D localization auxiliary task is effective for ultrasound video data, particularly in scenarios with limited annotated training data, enhancing segmentation performance significantly.

Abstract: Acquiring and annotating large datasets in ultrasound imaging is challenging
due to low contrast, high noise, and susceptibility to artefacts. This process
requires significant time and clinical expertise. Self-supervised learning
(SSL) offers a promising solution by leveraging unlabelled data to learn useful
representations, enabling improved segmentation performance when annotated data
is limited. Recent state-of-the-art developments in SSL for video data include
V-JEPA, a framework solely based on feature prediction, avoiding pixel level
reconstruction or negative samples. We hypothesise that V-JEPA is well-suited
to ultrasound imaging, as it is less sensitive to noisy pixel-level detail
while effectively leveraging temporal information. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first study to adopt V-JEPA for ultrasound video data.
Similar to other patch-based masking SSL techniques such as VideoMAE, V-JEPA is
well-suited to ViT-based models. However, ViTs can underperform on small
medical datasets due to lack of inductive biases, limited spatial locality and
absence of hierarchical feature learning. To improve locality understanding, we
propose a novel 3D localisation auxiliary task to improve locality in ViT
representations during V-JEPA pre-training. Our results show V-JEPA with our
auxiliary task improves segmentation performance significantly across various
frozen encoder configurations, with gains up to 3.4\% using 100\% and up to
8.35\% using only 10\% of the training data.

*Mahdi Ghafourian,Federico M. Sukno*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes NLML-HPE, a deep learning approach for head pose estimation using tensor decomposition and neural networks, focusing on regression rather than classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve head pose estimation using limited, accurate, and consistent training data while addressing challenges of incorrect pose annotations in existing datasets.

Method: The approach uses Tucker decomposition to split Euler angles into separate subspaces and models rotation manifolds with cosine curves. A precise 2D head pose dataset was generated by rendering rotated 3D head models.

Result: The method achieved real-time performance with limited training data, accurately predicting unseen data by learning the nature of facial landmark-based rotation.

Conclusion: NLML-HPE demonstrated effective and efficient head pose estimation through non-linear manifold learning, potentially impacting computer vision applications like facial recognition and human-computer interaction.

Abstract: Head pose estimation (HPE) plays a critical role in various computer vision
applications such as human-computer interaction and facial recognition. In this
paper, we propose a novel deep learning approach for head pose estimation with
limited training data via non-linear manifold learning called NLML-HPE. This
method is based on the combination of tensor decomposition (i.e., Tucker
decomposition) and feed forward neural networks. Unlike traditional
classification-based approaches, our method formulates head pose estimation as
a regression problem, mapping input landmarks into a continuous representation
of pose angles. To this end, our method uses tensor decomposition to split each
Euler angle (yaw, pitch, roll) to separate subspaces and models each dimension
of the underlying manifold as a cosine curve. We address two key challenges: 1.
Almost all HPE datasets suffer from incorrect and inaccurate pose annotations.
Hence, we generated a precise and consistent 2D head pose dataset for our
training set by rotating 3D head models for a fixed set of poses and rendering
the corresponding 2D images. 2. We achieved real-time performance with limited
training data as our method accurately captures the nature of rotation of an
object from facial landmarks. Once the underlying manifold for rotation around
each axis is learned, the model is very fast in predicting unseen data. Our
training and testing code is available online along with our trained models:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces PDB-Eval, a benchmark for understanding Personalized Driver Behavior through external and internal views of driving and aligning Large Multimodal Models (MLLMs) with driving tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve safety and driver assistance systems by better understanding driver behavior and intentions through enhanced datasets and multimodal reasoning.

Method: The researchers develop a two-part benchmark called PDB-Eval: 1) PDB-X for evaluating temporal scene understanding, and 2) PDB-QA for visual explanation question-answering tasks aimed at fine-tuning MLLMs for driving comprehension.

Result: Fine-tuned MLLMs on PDB-Eval achieve a 73.2% improvement in zero-shot question-answering and show significant performance boosts in intention prediction (up to 12.5%) and recognition tasks (up to 11.0%).

Conclusion: Aligning MLLMs' reasoning abilities with driving tasks through fine-tuning on detailed and domain-specific datasets significantly enhances their interpretive and predictive capabilities in driving scenarios.

Abstract: Understanding a driver's behavior and intentions is important for potential
risk assessment and early accident prevention. Safety and driver assistance
systems can be tailored to individual drivers' behavior, significantly
enhancing their effectiveness. However, existing datasets are limited in
describing and explaining general vehicle movements based on external visual
evidence. This paper introduces a benchmark, PDB-Eval, for a detailed
understanding of Personalized Driver Behavior, and aligning Large Multimodal
Models (MLLMs) with driving comprehension and reasoning. Our benchmark consists
of two main components, PDB-X and PDB-QA. PDB-X can evaluate MLLMs'
understanding of temporal driving scenes. Our dataset is designed to find valid
visual evidence from the external view to explain the driver's behavior from
the internal view. To align MLLMs' reasoning abilities with driving tasks, we
propose PDB-QA as a visual explanation question-answering task for MLLM
instruction fine-tuning. As a generic learning task for generative models like
MLLMs, PDB-QA can bridge the domain gap without harming MLLMs'
generalizability. Our evaluation indicates that fine-tuning MLLMs on
fine-grained descriptions and explanations can effectively bridge the gap
between MLLMs and the driving domain, which improves zero-shot performance on
question-answering tasks by up to 73.2%. We further evaluate the MLLMs
fine-tuned on PDB-X in Brain4Cars' intention prediction and AIDE's recognition
tasks. We observe up to 12.5% performance improvements on the turn intention
prediction task in Brain4Cars, and consistent performance improvements up to
11.0% on all tasks in AIDE.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a standardized framework for physical adversarial attacks on LiDAR systems to improve research reproducibility and understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of reproducible setups and hardware differences in physical adversarial object attacks on LiDAR-based systems.

Method: Proposed a device-agnostic framework with open-source code and benchmarking protocols that covers simulation and real-world settings.

Result: The framework demonstrates successful transferability of simulated attacks into physical LiDAR systems.

Conclusion: Enabling fair comparisons, the framework accelerates research while enhancing insights into adversarial robustness in LiDAR perception.

Abstract: Adversarial robustness in LiDAR-based 3D object detection is a critical
research area due to its widespread application in real-world scenarios. While
many digital attacks manipulate point clouds or meshes, they often lack
physical realizability, limiting their practical impact. Physical adversarial
object attacks remain underexplored and suffer from poor reproducibility due to
inconsistent setups and hardware differences. To address this, we propose a
device-agnostic, standardized framework that abstracts key elements of physical
adversarial object attacks, supports diverse methods, and provides open-source
code with benchmarking protocols in simulation and real-world settings. Our
framework enables fair comparison, accelerates research, and is validated by
successfully transferring simulated attacks to a physical LiDAR system. Beyond
the framework, we offer insights into factors influencing attack success and
advance understanding of adversarial robustness in real-world LiDAR perception.

*Si-Woo Kim,MinJu Jeon,Ye-Chan Kim,Soeun Lee,Taewhan Kim,Dong-Jin Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents SynC, a framework designed to refine synthetic image-caption datasets used in zero-shot image captioning (ZIC), by reassociating captions to the best-matched images using a cycle-consistency-based scoring method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to tackle the semantic misalignments in synthetic datasets generated by text-to-image (T2I) models, which can negatively impact zero-shot image captioning (ZIC). Existing methods are inadequate for addressing issues unique to synthetic data—with noisy images rather than text.

Method: SynC uses a one-to-many mapping strategy for refining datasets. It retrieves multiple candidate images for each caption and applies a cycle-consistency-inspired alignment scorer to determine the best-matched image for the original caption.

Result: SynC significantly enhances ZIC performance across standard benchmarks like MS-COCO, Flickr30k, and NoCaps. It establishes state-of-the-art results in various scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed framework, SynC, effectively addresses challenges in synthetic image-caption datasets by reassigning captions to more semantically accurate images, serving as a powerful tool for improving ZIC model training.

Abstract: Zero-shot Image Captioning (ZIC) increasingly utilizes synthetic datasets
generated by text-to-image (T2I) models to mitigate the need for costly manual
annotation. However, these T2I models often produce images that exhibit
semantic misalignments with their corresponding input captions (e.g., missing
objects, incorrect attributes), resulting in noisy synthetic image-caption
pairs that can hinder model training. Existing dataset pruning techniques are
largely designed for removing noisy text in web-crawled data. However, these
methods are ill-suited for the distinct challenges of synthetic data, where
captions are typically well-formed, but images may be inaccurate
representations. To address this gap, we introduce SynC, a novel framework
specifically designed to refine synthetic image-caption datasets for ZIC.
Instead of conventional filtering or regeneration, SynC focuses on reassigning
captions to the most semantically aligned images already present within the
synthetic image pool. Our approach employs a one-to-many mapping strategy by
initially retrieving multiple relevant candidate images for each caption. We
then apply a cycle-consistency-inspired alignment scorer that selects the best
image by verifying its ability to retrieve the original caption via
image-to-text retrieval. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that SynC
consistently and significantly improves performance across various ZIC models
on standard benchmarks (MS-COCO, Flickr30k, NoCaps), achieving state-of-the-art
results in several scenarios. SynC offers an effective strategy for curating
refined synthetic data to enhance ZIC.

Motivation: To address the limited exploration of simulation's potential for data generation and augmentation in V2X scenarios, which are essential for autonomous driving and cooperation between vehicles and infrastructure.

Method: CRUISE leverages decomposed Gaussian Splatting to reconstruct real-world driving scenes and decomposes dynamic traffic participants into editable Gaussian representations, allowing for scene modification and augmentation. It renders images from various perspectives to support dataset generation.

Result: CRUISE achieves high-fidelity reconstruction of V2X scenes, enhances 3D detection and tracking on the V2X-Seq benchmark, and generates complex corner cases for evaluation.

Conclusion: The CRUISE framework proves to be a valuable tool for V2X data augmentation and evaluation, supporting the advancement of autonomous driving systems by improving dataset diversity and simulation capabilities.

Abstract: Vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication plays a crucial role in autonomous
driving, enabling cooperation between vehicles and infrastructure. While
simulation has significantly contributed to various autonomous driving tasks,
its potential for data generation and augmentation in V2X scenarios remains
underexplored. In this paper, we introduce CRUISE, a comprehensive
reconstruction-and-synthesis framework designed for V2X driving environments.
CRUISE employs decomposed Gaussian Splatting to accurately reconstruct
real-world scenes while supporting flexible editing. By decomposing dynamic
traffic participants into editable Gaussian representations, CRUISE allows for
seamless modification and augmentation of driving scenes. Furthermore, the
framework renders images from both ego-vehicle and infrastructure views,
enabling large-scale V2X dataset augmentation for training and evaluation. Our
experimental results demonstrate that: 1) CRUISE reconstructs real-world V2X
driving scenes with high fidelity; 2) using CRUISE improves 3D detection across
ego-vehicle, infrastructure, and cooperative views, as well as cooperative 3D
tracking on the V2X-Seq benchmark; and 3) CRUISE effectively generates
challenging corner cases.

TL;DR: The paper introduces an unsupervised method for medical anomaly detection using a new autoencoder framework called Q-Former Autoencoder, leveraging pretrained vision models to achieve state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Anomaly detection in medical imaging is challenging due to the diversity of anomalies and the impracticality of collecting fully annotated datasets.

Method: A Q-Former Autoencoder framework is proposed, combining pretrained vision foundation models and a Q-Former bottleneck for feature extraction and reconstruction. Perceptual loss is added to guide semantically meaningful reconstructions.

Result: The method achieves state-of-the-art results on various medical anomaly detection benchmarks, demonstrating its effectiveness and generalization capabilities.

Conclusion: The approach shows that vision foundation models pretrained on natural images can generalize well to medical image anomaly detection tasks without requiring domain-specific fine-tuning. Code and models are made publicly available.

Abstract: Anomaly detection in medical images is an important yet challenging task due
to the diversity of possible anomalies and the practical impossibility of
collecting comprehensively annotated data sets. In this work, we tackle
unsupervised medical anomaly detection proposing a modernized autoencoder-based
framework, the Q-Former Autoencoder, that leverages state-of-the-art pretrained
vision foundation models, such as DINO, DINOv2 and Masked Autoencoder. Instead
of training encoders from scratch, we directly utilize frozen vision foundation
models as feature extractors, enabling rich, multi-stage, high-level
representations without domain-specific fine-tuning. We propose the usage of
the Q-Former architecture as the bottleneck, which enables the control of the
length of the reconstruction sequence, while efficiently aggregating multiscale
features. Additionally, we incorporate a perceptual loss computed using
features from a pretrained Masked Autoencoder, guiding the reconstruction
towards semantically meaningful structures. Our framework is evaluated on four
diverse medical anomaly detection benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art
results on BraTS2021, RESC, and RSNA. Our results highlight the potential of
vision foundation model encoders, pretrained on natural images, to generalize
effectively to medical image analysis tasks without further fine-tuning. We

an essential component of reliable malaria diagnosis, especially in developing
countries. Deep learning-based object detection methods have demonstrated
strong potential for automated Malaria diagnosis, but their adoption is limited
by the scarcity of datasets with detailed instance-level annotations. In this
work, we present an enhanced version of the publicly available NIH malaria
dataset, with detailed bounding box annotations in COCO format to support
object detection training. We validated the revised annotations by training a
Faster R-CNN model to detect infected and non-infected red blood cells, as well
as white blood cells. Cross-validation on the original dataset yielded F1
scores of up to 0.88 for infected cell detection. These results underscore the
importance of annotation volume and consistency, and demonstrate that automated
annotation refinement combined with targeted manual correction can produce
training data of sufficient quality for robust detection performance. The
updated annotations set is publicly available via GitHub:

### [143] [Reinforced Embodied Active Defense: Exploiting Adaptive Interaction for Robust Visual Perception in Adversarial 3D Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18484)
*Xiao Yang,Lingxuan Wu,Lizhong Wang,Chengyang Ying,Hang Su,Jun Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses the need for proactive defense against adversarial attacks in 3D environments, introducing the Rein-EAD framework that balances immediate prediction accuracy and long-term policy adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing defenses against adversarial attacks in 3D environments rely on static or predefined assumptions, making them less effective in dynamic and complex settings such as autonomous driving or face recognition.

Method: The proposed method, Rein-EAD, implements a multi-step objective combining immediate prediction accuracy and entropy minimization, along with uncertainty-oriented reward shaping, to proactively defend visual perception systems in 3D.

Result: Rein-EAD significantly reduces attack success rates while maintaining standard accuracy across various tasks and generalizes effectively to unseen attacks without requiring differentiable environments.

Conclusion: Rein-EAD is a robust and adaptable proactive defense framework suitable for addressing 3D adversarial attacks in real-world applications.

Abstract: Adversarial attacks in 3D environments have emerged as a critical threat to
the reliability of visual perception systems, particularly in safety-sensitive
applications such as identity verification and autonomous driving. These
attacks employ adversarial patches and 3D objects to manipulate deep neural
network (DNN) predictions by exploiting vulnerabilities within complex scenes.
Existing defense mechanisms, such as adversarial training and purification,
primarily employ passive strategies to enhance robustness. However, these
approaches often rely on pre-defined assumptions about adversarial tactics,
limiting their adaptability in dynamic 3D settings. To address these
challenges, we introduce Reinforced Embodied Active Defense (Rein-EAD), a
proactive defense framework that leverages adaptive exploration and interaction
with the environment to improve perception robustness in 3D adversarial
contexts. By implementing a multi-step objective that balances immediate
prediction accuracy with predictive entropy minimization, Rein-EAD optimizes
defense strategies over a multi-step horizon. Additionally, Rein-EAD involves
an uncertainty-oriented reward-shaping mechanism that facilitates efficient
policy updates, thereby reducing computational overhead and supporting
real-world applicability without the need for differentiable environments.
Comprehensive experiments validate the effectiveness of Rein-EAD, demonstrating
a substantial reduction in attack success rates while preserving standard
accuracy across diverse tasks. Notably, Rein-EAD exhibits robust generalization
to unseen and adaptive attacks, making it suitable for real-world complex
tasks, including 3D object classification, face recognition and autonomous
driving.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces methods to enhance mapless trajectory prediction for autonomous driving by analyzing the impact of kinematic state and map uncertainty, showing significant performance improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the uncertainty in online-generated maps used in autonomous driving and identify scenarios where map uncertainty improves trajectory prediction.

Method: The paper introduces Proprioceptive Scenario Gating, which integrates map uncertainty based on the ego vehicle’s future kinematics, along with a Covariance-based Map Uncertainty approach.

Result: The methods achieved up to 23.6% improvement in trajectory prediction compared to the state-of-the-art methods, validated through experiments on the nuScenes dataset.

Conclusion: Incorporating kinematic state and improved map uncertainty enhances trajectory prediction, advancing interpretability and reliability for mapless autonomous driving systems.

Abstract: Recent advances in autonomous driving are moving towards mapless approaches,
where High-Definition (HD) maps are generated online directly from sensor data,
reducing the need for expensive labeling and maintenance. However, the
reliability of these online-generated maps remains uncertain. While
incorporating map uncertainty into downstream trajectory prediction tasks has
shown potential for performance improvements, current strategies provide
limited insights into the specific scenarios where this uncertainty is
beneficial. In this work, we first analyze the driving scenarios in which
mapping uncertainty has the greatest positive impact on trajectory prediction
and identify a critical, previously overlooked factor: the agent's kinematic
state. Building on these insights, we propose a novel Proprioceptive Scenario
Gating that adaptively integrates map uncertainty into trajectory prediction
based on forecasts of the ego vehicle's future kinematics. This lightweight,
self-supervised approach enhances the synergy between online mapping and
trajectory prediction, providing interpretability around where uncertainty is
advantageous and outperforming previous integration methods. Additionally, we
introduce a Covariance-based Map Uncertainty approach that better aligns with
map geometry, further improving trajectory prediction. Extensive ablation
studies confirm the effectiveness of our approach, achieving up to 23.6%
improvement in mapless trajectory prediction performance over the
state-of-the-art method using the real-world nuScenes driving dataset. Our
code, data, and models are publicly available at

TL;DR: The paper introduces SemBA-FAST, a semantic Bayesian framework designed to model human visual attention in target-present search tasks. This approach outperforms baseline methods and matches human scanpaths closely.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance human-like visual attention modeling for goal-directed tasks, integrating top-down semantics and foveal strategies into computational models.

Method: SemBA-FAST combines deep object detection with probabilistic semantic mechanisms, pre-trained detectors, and artificial foveation to sequentially predict human fixation points during visual search.

Result: SemBA-FAST outperforms baselines and top-down models, aligning closely with human ground-truth scanpaths, and competes effectively with scanpath-informed models on the COCO-Search18 dataset.

Conclusion: Semantic-foveal probabilistic frameworks like SemBA-FAST offer promising advancements for human-like visual attention modeling, with applications in cognitive computing and robotics.

Abstract: In goal-directed visual tasks, human perception is guided by both top-down
and bottom-up cues. At the same time, foveal vision plays a crucial role in
directing attention efficiently. Modern research on bio-inspired computational
attention models has taken advantage of advancements in deep learning by
utilizing human scanpath data to achieve new state-of-the-art performance. In
this work, we assess the performance of SemBA-FAST, i.e. Semantic-based
Bayesian Attention for Foveal Active visual Search Tasks, a top-down framework
designed for predicting human visual attention in target-present visual search.
SemBA-FAST integrates deep object detection with a probabilistic semantic
fusion mechanism to generate attention maps dynamically, leveraging pre-trained
detectors and artificial foveation to update top-down knowledge and improve
fixation prediction sequentially. We evaluate SemBA-FAST on the COCO-Search18
benchmark dataset, comparing its performance against other scanpath prediction
models. Our methodology achieves fixation sequences that closely match human
ground-truth scanpaths. Notably, it surpasses baseline and other top-down
approaches and competes, in some cases, with scanpath-informed models. These
findings provide valuable insights into the capabilities of semantic-foveal
probabilistic frameworks for human-like attention modelling, with implications
for real-time cognitive computing and robotics.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel indicator to compare features from Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) across different modalities like visual, textual, and multimodal encoders, enabling quantitative analyses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how SAE-derived features can be compared across different modalities helps in exploring shared representations and improving multimodal learning.

Method: Introduced a quantitative comparison tool and Comparative Sharedness metric, tested on diverse datasets and 21 encoders spanning visual, textual, and multimodal domains.

Result: Findings highlight shared features among encoders, especially between visual encoders in VLMs and text encoders, revealing the influence of text pretraining.

Conclusion: The paper broadens perspectives on previous encoder studies and emphasizes the shared representations across modalities enabled by multimodal context training.

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a powerful technique for
extracting human-interpretable features from neural networks activations.
Previous works compared different models based on SAE-derived features but
those comparisons have been restricted to models within the same modality. We
propose a novel indicator allowing quantitative comparison of models across SAE
features, and use it to conduct a comparative study of visual, textual and
multimodal encoders. We also propose to quantify the Comparative Sharedness of
individual features between different classes of models. With these two new
tools, we conduct several studies on 21 encoders of the three types, with two
significantly different sizes, and considering generalist and domain specific
datasets. The results allow to revisit previous studies at the light of
encoders trained in a multimodal context and to quantify to which extent all
these models share some representations or features. They also suggest that
visual features that are specific to VLMs among vision encoders are shared with
text encoders, highlighting the impact of text pretraining. The code is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper tackles rare object detection in remote sensing by focusing on bio-digester detection and methane emission estimation in France.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of detecting rare objects, such as bio-digesters, in vast remote sensing imagery for large-scale applications like environmental impact analysis.

Method: Introduced a novel dataset, developed a part-based detection method leveraging bio-digester sub-elements, and applied it to unseen data to inventory bio-digesters.

Result: The method facilitated the identification of bio-digesters in new regions, enabling geostatistical methane production estimation.

Conclusion: Their approach effectively detects rare bio-digester sites and assesses their methane contribution for environmental insights.

Abstract: Object detection is one of the main applications of computer vision in remote
sensing imagery. Despite its increasing availability, the sheer volume of
remote sensing data poses a challenge when detecting rare objects across large
geographic areas. Paradoxically, this common challenge is crucial to many
applications, such as estimating environmental impact of certain human
activities at scale. In this paper, we propose to address the problem by
investigating the methane production and emissions of bio-digesters in France.
We first introduce a novel dataset containing bio-digesters, with small
training and validation sets, and a large test set with a high imbalance
towards observations without objects since such sites are rare. We develop a
part-based method that considers essential bio-digester sub-elements to boost
initial detections. To this end, we apply our method to new, unseen regions to
build an inventory of bio-digesters. We then compute geostatistical estimates
of the quantity of methane produced that can be attributed to these
infrastructures in a given area at a given time.

Motivation: The motivation is to enable accurate object segmentation in highly cluttered scenes for applications like vision-guided neuroprostheses for upper limb support.

Method: The authors propose a prompt-based method informed by gaze fixations to guide the Segment Anything Model (SAM) and fine-tune it on egocentric visual data.

Result: Their method improved the Intersection over Union (IoU) metric by up to 0.51 points on real-world challenging 'Grasping-in-the-Wild' visual data.

Conclusion: The proposed approach enhances object segmentation performance using foundational models and gaze-based fine-tuning, thus contributing to neuroprosthetic applications.

Abstract: In this work, we address the problem of semantic object segmentation using
foundation models. We investigate whether foundation models, trained on a large
number and variety of objects, can perform object segmentation without
fine-tuning on specific images containing everyday objects, but in highly
cluttered visual scenes. The ''in the wild'' context is driven by the target
application of vision guided upper limb neuroprostheses. We propose a method
for generating prompts based on gaze fixations to guide the Segment Anything
Model (SAM) in our segmentation scenario, and fine-tune it on egocentric visual
data. Evaluation results of our approach show an improvement of the IoU
segmentation quality metric by up to 0.51 points on real-world challenging data

TL;DR: GaussianFusionOcc revolutionizes 3D semantic occupancy prediction by combining efficient 3D Gaussian representations with an innovative sensor fusion mechanism across camera, LiDAR, and radar sensors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve 3D semantic occupancy prediction for autonomous driving, enabling precise and safe navigation in complex environments by leveraging innovative sensor fusion and memory-efficient strategies.

Method: The method uses 3D semantic Gaussian representations combined with a modality-agnostic deformable attention mechanism to integrate features from cameras, LiDAR, and radar. These features refine Gaussian properties for accurate environmental modeling.

Result: Extensive testing demonstrated that GaussianFusionOcc excels across various sensor combinations, outperforming existing state-of-the-art models in 3D semantic occupancy prediction.

Conclusion: GaussianFusionOcc proves highly effective in fusing multi-modal sensor data while maintaining efficiency and scalability, making it a superior solution for 3D semantic occupancy tasks in autonomous driving.

Abstract: 3D semantic occupancy prediction is one of the crucial tasks of autonomous
driving. It enables precise and safe interpretation and navigation in complex
environments. Reliable predictions rely on effective sensor fusion, as
different modalities can contain complementary information. Unlike conventional
methods that depend on dense grid representations, our approach,
GaussianFusionOcc, uses semantic 3D Gaussians alongside an innovative sensor
fusion mechanism. Seamless integration of data from camera, LiDAR, and radar
sensors enables more precise and scalable occupancy prediction, while 3D
Gaussian representation significantly improves memory efficiency and inference
speed. GaussianFusionOcc employs modality-agnostic deformable attention to
extract essential features from each sensor type, which are then used to refine
Gaussian properties, resulting in a more accurate representation of the
environment. Extensive testing with various sensor combinations demonstrates
the versatility of our approach. By leveraging the robustness of multi-modal
fusion and the efficiency of Gaussian representation, GaussianFusionOcc
outperforms current state-of-the-art models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces IntentVCNet, a method for improving intent-specific video captioning using LVLMs by addressing spatio-temporal gaps with innovative prompting and model adaptation strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LVLMs are unable to perform fine-grained spatial control across time sequences when generating video captions based on user intent, leaving a spatio-temporal gap.

Method: IntentVCNet integrates LVLMs' spatial and temporal understanding by combining prompt strategies to model user intent relationships and introducing a parameter-efficient box adapter for refining visual context.

Result: The proposed method shows enhanced spatial modeling, achieves state-of-the-art results on open-source LVLMs, and secures second place in the IntentVC challenge.

Conclusion: IntentVCNet successfully addresses the spatio-temporal gap in LVLMs, advancing controlled video captioning tailored to user intent while achieving competitive results in benchmarks.

Abstract: Intent-oriented controlled video captioning aims to generate targeted
descriptions for specific targets in a video based on customized user intent.
Current Large Visual Language Models (LVLMs) have gained strong instruction
following and visual comprehension capabilities. Although the LVLMs
demonstrated proficiency in spatial and temporal understanding respectively, it
was not able to perform fine-grained spatial control in time sequences in
direct response to instructions. This substantial spatio-temporal gap
complicates efforts to achieve fine-grained intention-oriented control in
video. Towards this end, we propose a novel IntentVCNet that unifies the
temporal and spatial understanding knowledge inherent in LVLMs to bridge the
spatio-temporal gap from both prompting and model perspectives. Specifically,
we first propose a prompt combination strategy designed to enable LLM to model
the implicit relationship between prompts that characterize user intent and
video sequences. We then propose a parameter efficient box adapter that
augments the object semantic information in the global visual context so that
the visual token has a priori information about the user intent. The final
experiment proves that the combination of the two strategies can further
enhance the LVLM's ability to model spatial details in video sequences, and
facilitate the LVLMs to accurately generate controlled intent-oriented
captions. Our proposed method achieved state-of-the-art results in several open
source LVLMs and was the runner-up in the IntentVC challenge. Our code is
available on https://github.com/thqiu0419/IntentVCNet.

TL;DR: EDM's limitation of using only Gaussian noise for diffusion models leads to increased complexity in image restoration. To address this, EDA introduces arbitrary noise patterns while maintaining computational efficiency and showing significant improvements across various tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of EDM, where fixed Gaussian noise adds unnecessary complexity to image restoration tasks.

Method: EDA (Elucidates the Design space of Arbitrary-noise-based diffusion models) expands to arbitrary noise patterns while keeping EDM's flexibility and ensures no extra computational load for restoration.

Result: EDA demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in MRI bias field correction, CT metal artifact reduction, and natural image shadow removal, excelling with only 5 sampling steps.

Conclusion: EDA proves that greater flexibility in noise patterns enhances restoration quality while maintaining computational efficiency, surpassing existing methods across multiple tasks.

Abstract: EDM elucidates the unified design space of diffusion models, yet its fixed
noise patterns restricted to pure Gaussian noise, limit advancements in image
restoration. Our study indicates that forcibly injecting Gaussian noise
corrupts the degraded images, overextends the image transformation distance,
and increases restoration complexity. To address this problem, our proposed EDA
Elucidates the Design space of Arbitrary-noise-based diffusion models.
Theoretically, EDA expands the freedom of noise pattern while preserving the
original module flexibility of EDM, with rigorous proof that increased noise
complexity incurs no additional computational overhead during restoration. EDA
is validated on three typical tasks: MRI bias field correction (global smooth
noise), CT metal artifact reduction (global sharp noise), and natural image
shadow removal (local boundary-aware noise). With only 5 sampling steps, EDA
outperforms most task-specific methods and achieves state-of-the-art
performance in bias field correction and shadow removal.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces TTS-VAR, a test-time scaling framework for visual auto-regressive models, aiming to optimize computational efficiency and exploration in generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for scaling visual generation models efficiently during test time, which avoids the high training and computational requirements of traditional approaches.

Method: The TTS-VAR framework includes an adaptive descending batch size schedule, clustering-based diversity search at coarse scales, and resampling-based potential selection at fine scales, leveraging hierarchical coarse-to-fine multi-scale generation.

Result: Using the Infinity VAR model, the framework improved GenEval scores by 8.7% and highlighted the impact of early structural features and scale-specific resampling efficacy.

Conclusion: TTS-VAR effectively balances computational efficiency and outcome quality, demonstrating scalability and structural preservation in visual generation.

Abstract: Scaling visual generation models is essential for real-world content
creation, yet requires substantial training and computational expenses.
Alternatively, test-time scaling has garnered growing attention due to resource
efficiency and promising performance. In this work, we present TTS-VAR, the
first general test-time scaling framework for visual auto-regressive (VAR)
models, modeling the generation process as a path searching problem. To
dynamically balance computational efficiency with exploration capacity, we
first introduce an adaptive descending batch size schedule throughout the
causal generation process. Besides, inspired by VAR's hierarchical
coarse-to-fine multi-scale generation, our framework integrates two key
components: (i) At coarse scales, we observe that generated tokens are hard for
evaluation, possibly leading to erroneous acceptance of inferior samples or
rejection of superior samples. Noticing that the coarse scales contain
sufficient structural information, we propose clustering-based diversity
search. It preserves structural variety through semantic feature clustering,
enabling later selection on samples with higher potential. (ii) In fine scales,
resampling-based potential selection prioritizes promising candidates using
potential scores, which are defined as reward functions incorporating
multi-scale generation history. Experiments on the powerful VAR model Infinity
show a notable 8.7% GenEval score improvement (from 0.69 to 0.75). Key insights
reveal that early-stage structural features effectively influence final
quality, and resampling efficacy varies across generation scales. Code is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework that improves 3D Gaussian Splatting for unposed 3D reconstruction by combining Multi-View Stereo (MVS) priors with a probabilistic Procrustes mapping strategy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing techniques for 3D Gaussian Splatting struggle with memory limits and lose accuracy in unposed 3D reconstruction tasks involving large-scale outdoor image datasets due to challenges in handling input images.

Method: A probabilistic Procrustes mapping is used to partition images into subsets, align submaps, and optimize both geometry and camera poses. It utilizes probabilistic coupling and a soft dustbin mechanism to reject uncertain correspondences, along with joint optimization that integrates analytical Jacobians into 3D Gaussian Splatting.

Result: The method demonstrates accurate reconstruction and pose estimation from unposed image sequences, achieving state-of-the-art performance on the Waymo and KITTI datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses the challenges in unposed 3D reconstruction, providing a robust approach to align and optimize point clouds from large image datasets efficiently and accurately.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a core technique for 3D
representation. Its effectiveness largely depends on precise camera poses and
accurate point cloud initialization, which are often derived from pretrained
Multi-View Stereo (MVS) models. However, in unposed reconstruction task from
hundreds of outdoor images, existing MVS models may struggle with memory limits
and lose accuracy as the number of input images grows. To address this
limitation, we propose a novel unposed 3DGS reconstruction framework that
integrates pretrained MVS priors with the probabilistic Procrustes mapping
strategy. The method partitions input images into subsets, maps submaps into a
global space, and jointly optimizes geometry and poses with 3DGS. Technically,
we formulate the mapping of tens of millions of point clouds as a probabilistic
Procrustes problem and solve a closed-form alignment. By employing
probabilistic coupling along with a soft dustbin mechanism to reject uncertain
correspondences, our method globally aligns point clouds and poses within
minutes across hundreds of images. Moreover, we propose a joint optimization
framework for 3DGS and camera poses. It constructs Gaussians from
confidence-aware anchor points and integrates 3DGS differentiable rendering
with an analytical Jacobian to jointly refine scene and poses, enabling
accurate reconstruction and pose estimation. Experiments on Waymo and KITTI
datasets show that our method achieves accurate reconstruction from unposed
image sequences, setting a new state of the art for unposed 3DGS
reconstruction.

TL;DR: This study presents a new method for registering real-time ultrasound (iUS) and preoperative MRI using a 3D cross-modal keypoint descriptor and supervised contrastive learning. The approach achieves state-of-the-art results in detection and registration accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The unsolved challenge of intraoperative iUS and preoperative MRI registration, due to differences in appearance, resolution, and field-of-view, motivates the development of robust methods to simplify and improve the accuracy of medical image registration.

Method: The method generates synthetic iUS volumes from MRI for contrastive learning of a shared descriptor space. It uses probabilistic keypoint detection and a curriculum-based triplet loss with dynamic negative mining to train robust, rotation-invariant descriptors. Keypoints detected in MRI and real iUS images during inference are matched to perform rigid registration.

Result: The proposed method outperformed existing keypoint matching approaches with 69.8% precision and achieved a competitive mean Target Registration Error (2.39 mm) on the ReMIND2Reg benchmark using data from 11 patients.

Conclusion: The framework is interpretable, does not need manual initialization, and is robust to field-of-view variations in iUS, making it a reliable and competitive approach for MRI-iUS registration.

Abstract: Intraoperative registration of real-time ultrasound (iUS) to preoperative
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) remains an unsolved problem due to severe
modality-specific differences in appearance, resolution, and field-of-view. To
address this, we propose a novel 3D cross-modal keypoint descriptor for MRI-iUS
matching and registration. Our approach employs a patient-specific
matching-by-synthesis approach, generating synthetic iUS volumes from
preoperative MRI. This enables supervised contrastive training to learn a
shared descriptor space.
  A probabilistic keypoint detection strategy is then employed to identify
anatomically salient and modality-consistent locations. During training, a
curriculum-based triplet loss with dynamic hard negative mining is used to
learn descriptors that are i) robust to iUS artifacts such as speckle noise and
limited coverage, and ii) rotation-invariant . At inference, the method detects
keypoints in MR and real iUS images and identifies sparse matches, which are
then used to perform rigid registration. Our approach is evaluated using 3D
MRI-iUS pairs from the ReMIND dataset. Experiments show that our approach
outperforms state-of-the-art keypoint matching methods across 11 patients, with
an average precision of $69.8\%$. For image registration, our method achieves a
competitive mean Target Registration Error of 2.39 mm on the ReMIND2Reg
benchmark.
  Compared to existing iUS-MR registration approach, our framework is
interpretable, requires no manual initialization, and shows robustness to iUS
field-of-view variation. Code is available at

representation. The dataset comprises 103K video samples (3K reserved for
testing), each paired with audio and systematically detailed textual
descriptions. Specifically, every video and its audio is described across three
hierarchical layers (factual, abstract, and intent), progressing from surface
to depth. It contains over 22 million words, averaging ~225 words per sample.
VideoMind's key distinction from existing datasets is its provision of intent
expressions, which require contextual integration across the entire video and
are not directly observable. These deep-cognitive expressions are generated
using a Chain-of-Thought (COT) approach, prompting the mLLM through
step-by-step reasoning. Each description includes annotations for subject,
place, time, event, action, and intent, supporting downstream recognition
tasks. Crucially, we establish a gold-standard benchmark with 3,000 manually
validated samples for evaluating deep-cognitive video understanding. We design
hybrid-cognitive retrieval experiments, scored by multi-level retrieval
metrics, to appropriately assess deep video comprehension. Evaluation results
for models (e.g., InternVideo, VAST, UMT-L) are released. VideoMind serves as a
powerful benchmark for fine-grained cross-modal alignment and advances fields
requiring in-depth video understanding, such as emotion and intent recognition.
The data is publicly available on GitHub, HuggingFace, and OpenDataLab,

### [157] [Synthetic Data Augmentation for Enhanced Chicken Carcass Instance Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18558)
*Yihong Feng,Chaitanya Pallerla,Xiaomin Lin,Pouya Sohrabipour Sr,Philip Crandall,Wan Shou,Yu She,Dongyi Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a pipeline for generating synthetic, automatically labeled images to improve chicken carcass segmentation, showing that synthetic data complements real-world data effectively, especially when labeled real data is limited.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge in poultry processing plants of using deep learning for tasks like instance segmentation, hindered by the time-consuming requirement of acquiring and annotating large-scale datasets.

Method: The authors developed a pipeline for creating photo-realistic, automatically labeled synthetic images of chicken carcasses and introduced a benchmark dataset with 300 annotated real-world images for evaluating segmentation models. Synthetic and real datasets were tested on prominent instance segmentation models.

Result: The study demonstrates that the inclusion of synthetic data significantly enhances the performance of chicken carcass segmentation across all tested models, especially in scenarios with limited real annotated data.

Conclusion: Synthetic data augmentation proves to be an effective strategy for mitigating data scarcity, reducing manual effort in dataset annotation, and supporting robust automation in poultry carcass segmentation systems.

Abstract: The poultry industry has been driven by broiler chicken production and has
grown into the world's largest animal protein sector. Automated detection of
chicken carcasses on processing lines is vital for quality control, food
safety, and operational efficiency in slaughterhouses and poultry processing
plants. However, developing robust deep learning models for tasks like instance
segmentation in these fast-paced industrial environments is often hampered by
the need for laborious acquisition and annotation of large-scale real-world
image datasets. We present the first pipeline generating photo-realistic,
automatically labeled synthetic images of chicken carcasses. We also introduce
a new benchmark dataset containing 300 annotated real-world images, curated
specifically for poultry segmentation research. Using these datasets, this
study investigates the efficacy of synthetic data and automatic data annotation
to enhance the instance segmentation of chicken carcasses, particularly when
real annotated data from the processing line is scarce. A small real dataset
with varying proportions of synthetic images was evaluated in prominent
instance segmentation models. Results show that synthetic data significantly
boosts segmentation performance for chicken carcasses across all models. This
research underscores the value of synthetic data augmentation as a viable and
effective strategy to mitigate data scarcity, reduce manual annotation efforts,
and advance the development of robust AI-driven automated detection systems for
chicken carcasses in the poultry processing industry.

### [158] [Deep Learning-Based Age Estimation and Gender Deep Learning-Based Age Estimation and Gender Classification for Targeted Advertisement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18565)
*Muhammad Imran Zaman,Nisar Ahmed*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a deep learning-based approach using a custom CNN architecture for simultaneous facial age and gender classification, improving task performance by leveraging shared features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The work aims to enhance targeted advertising campaigns through better age and gender classification methods by addressing limitations in treating these tasks independently.

Method: A custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) optimized for joint learning of age and gender from facial features is proposed. The model uses shared representations and is trained on a large dataset, with steps to handle variations in lighting, pose, and image quality.

Result: The model achieved 95% accuracy in gender classification and a mean absolute error of 5.77 years in age estimation. Specific challenges for younger age groups were identified.

Conclusion: Simultaneous learning of age and gender using a shared representation boosts classification performance. Further refinements are needed to address biases, particularly for younger age groups.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel deep learning-based approach for simultaneous age
and gender classification from facial images, designed to enhance the
effectiveness of targeted advertising campaigns. We propose a custom
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture, optimized for both tasks,
which leverages the inherent correlation between age and gender information
present in facial features. Unlike existing methods that often treat these
tasks independently, our model learns shared representations, leading to
improved performance. The network is trained on a large, diverse dataset of
facial images, carefully pre-processed to ensure robustness against variations
in lighting, pose, and image quality. Our experimental results demonstrate a
significant improvement in gender classification accuracy, achieving 95%, and a
competitive mean absolute error of 5.77 years for age estimation. Critically,
we analyze the performance across different age groups, identifying specific
challenges in accurately estimating the age of younger individuals. This
analysis reveals the need for targeted data augmentation and model refinement
to address these biases. Furthermore, we explore the impact of different CNN
architectures and hyperparameter settings on the overall performance, providing
valuable insights for future research.

### [159] [Facial Demorphing from a Single Morph Using a Latent Conditional GAN](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18566)
*Nitish Shukla,Arun Ross*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel method for demorphing face images that overcomes the replication problem and provides high-quality results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Morph attacks allow forged biometric images to be linked to multiple identities, posing a significant security risk. Current detection methods only identify the morph but don't reveal the original constituents, necessitating improved demorphing methods.

Method: The proposed approach uses latent space decomposition to demorph images, allowing the method to perform well on unseen morph techniques and diverse face styles. Training is conducted on synthetic morphs and tested on real morphs.

Result: The method demonstrates superior performance compared to existing approaches, effectively demorphing images created using various morphing techniques and producing high-quality outputs.

Conclusion: The proposed technique is robust and versatile, overcoming limitations in current demorphing methods and enhancing biometric security systems.

Abstract: A morph is created by combining two (or more) face images from two (or more)
identities to create a composite image that is highly similar to both
constituent identities, allowing the forged morph to be biometrically
associated with more than one individual. Morph Attack Detection (MAD) can be
used to detect a morph, but does not reveal the constituent images. Demorphing
- the process of deducing the constituent images - is thus vital to provide
additional evidence about a morph. Existing demorphing methods suffer from the
morph replication problem, where the outputs tend to look very similar to the
morph itself, or assume that train and test morphs are generated using the same
morph technique. The proposed method overcomes these issues. The method
decomposes a morph in latent space allowing it to demorph images created from
unseen morph techniques and face styles. We train our method on morphs created
from synthetic faces and test on morphs created from real faces using arbitrary
morph techniques. Our method outperforms existing methods by a considerable
margin and produces high fidelity demorphed face images.

### [160] [Adversarial Distribution Matching for Diffusion Distillation Towards Efficient Image and Video Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18569)
*Yanzuo Lu,Yuxi Ren,Xin Xia,Shanchuan Lin,Xing Wang,Xuefeng Xiao,Andy J. Ma,Xiaohua Xie,Jian-Huang Lai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Adversarial Distribution Matching (ADM) to address mode collapse issues in score distillation, significantly improving one-step and multi-step performance in efficient image and video synthesis tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to resolve mode collapse caused by reverse KL divergence minimization in Distribution Matching Distillation (DMD) and to improve efficiency in score distillation.

Method: ADM was developed using diffusion-based discriminators and hybrid discriminators in both latent and pixel spaces, coupled with distributional loss for initialization and fine-tuning in a unified pipeline called DMDX.

Result: ADM achieves superior performance in one-step distillation compared to DMD2 on SDXL while using less GPU time and sets new benchmarks in multi-step tasks for efficient image and video synthesis.

Conclusion: ADM combined with the DMDX pipeline is an effective framework for improving score distillation performance and efficiency, paving the way for advancements in image and video synthesis.

Abstract: Distribution Matching Distillation (DMD) is a promising score distillation
technique that compresses pre-trained teacher diffusion models into efficient
one-step or multi-step student generators. Nevertheless, its reliance on the
reverse Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence minimization potentially induces mode
collapse (or mode-seeking) in certain applications. To circumvent this inherent
drawback, we propose Adversarial Distribution Matching (ADM), a novel framework
that leverages diffusion-based discriminators to align the latent predictions
between real and fake score estimators for score distillation in an adversarial
manner. In the context of extremely challenging one-step distillation, we
further improve the pre-trained generator by adversarial distillation with
hybrid discriminators in both latent and pixel spaces. Different from the mean
squared error used in DMD2 pre-training, our method incorporates the
distributional loss on ODE pairs collected from the teacher model, and thus
providing a better initialization for score distillation fine-tuning in the
next stage. By combining the adversarial distillation pre-training with ADM
fine-tuning into a unified pipeline termed DMDX, our proposed method achieves
superior one-step performance on SDXL compared to DMD2 while consuming less GPU
time. Additional experiments that apply multi-step ADM distillation on
SD3-Medium, SD3.5-Large, and CogVideoX set a new benchmark towards efficient
image and video synthesis.

### [161] [HybridTM: Combining Transformer and Mamba for 3D Semantic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18575)
*Xinyu Wang,Jinghua Hou,Zhe Liu,Yingying Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HybridTM integrates Transformer and Mamba for efficient and precise 3D semantic segmentation, achieving state-of-the-art results on multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer methods perform well in 3D semantic segmentation but are computationally expensive for large point clouds, whereas Mamba-based approaches are efficient but weaker in feature extraction. Combining their strengths effectively is a challenge.

Method: The authors propose HybridTM, a hybrid architecture combining Transformer and Mamba, along with the Inner Layer Hybrid Strategy to capture both long-range dependencies and local features efficiently.

Result: HybridTM demonstrates effectiveness and generalization through extensive experiments across diverse datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks like ScanNet, ScanNet200, and nuScenes.

Conclusion: Integrating Transformer and Mamba, along with fine-grained layer-level combination, can overcome individual limitations and optimize performance in 3D semantic segmentation tasks.

Abstract: Transformer-based methods have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in 3D
semantic segmentation through their powerful attention mechanisms, but the
quadratic complexity limits their modeling of long-range dependencies in
large-scale point clouds. While recent Mamba-based approaches offer efficient
processing with linear complexity, they struggle with feature representation
when extracting 3D features. However, effectively combining these complementary
strengths remains an open challenge in this field. In this paper, we propose
HybridTM, the first hybrid architecture that integrates Transformer and Mamba
for 3D semantic segmentation. In addition, we propose the Inner Layer Hybrid
Strategy, which combines attention and Mamba at a finer granularity, enabling
simultaneous capture of long-range dependencies and fine-grained local
features. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and
generalization of our HybridTM on diverse indoor and outdoor datasets.
Furthermore, our HybridTM achieves state-of-the-art performance on ScanNet,
ScanNet200, and nuScenes benchmarks. The code will be made available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces DRWKV, a model for low-light image enhancement that preserves edge details and improves visual naturalness, achieving state-of-the-art results on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing challenges in enhancing low-light images, particularly in maintaining edge continuity and structural details.

Method: The model, DRWKV, combines GER theory for illumination-edge decoupling, spiral-scanning Evolving WKV Attention for edge modeling, Bi-SAB for luminance-chrominance alignment, and MS2-Loss for artifact reduction.

Result: DRWKV demonstrates superior performance on benchmarks, achieving high PSNR, SSIM, and NIQE scores with low computational costs. It also performs well in downstream low-light multi-object tracking.

Conclusion: DRWKV effectively enhances low-light images while maintaining structural and visual fidelity, proving its generalization and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Low-light image enhancement remains a challenging task, particularly in
preserving object edge continuity and fine structural details under extreme
illumination degradation. In this paper, we propose a novel model, DRWKV
(Detailed Receptance Weighted Key Value), which integrates our proposed Global
Edge Retinex (GER) theory, enabling effective decoupling of illumination and
edge structures for enhanced edge fidelity. Secondly, we introduce Evolving WKV
Attention, a spiral-scanning mechanism that captures spatial edge continuity
and models irregular structures more effectively. Thirdly, we design the
Bilateral Spectrum Aligner (Bi-SAB) and a tailored MS2-Loss to jointly align
luminance and chrominance features, improving visual naturalness and mitigating
artifacts. Extensive experiments on five LLIE benchmarks demonstrate that DRWKV
achieves leading performance in PSNR, SSIM, and NIQE while maintaining low
computational complexity. Furthermore, DRWKV enhances downstream performance in
low-light multi-object tracking tasks, validating its generalization
capabilities.

### [163] [SIDA: Synthetic Image Driven Zero-shot Domain Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18632)
*Ye-Chan Kim,SeungJu Cha,Si-Woo Kim,Taewhan Kim,Dong-Jin Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SIDA, a zero-shot domain adaptation method using synthetic images instead of text-based methods to capture domain variations effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing zero-shot domain adaptation methods struggle with complex real-world variations and are time-consuming due to reliance on text descriptions and CLIP's embedding space.

Method: SIDA generates synthetic images by creating source-like images and translating them into target-like styles. It employs Domain Mix to blend styles and Patch Style Transfer for patch-level style variations to better model real-world scenarios.

Result: The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance across various zero-shot adaptation tasks, especially in challenging domains, while reducing adaptation time.

Conclusion: SIDA effectively addresses the limitations of text-driven zero-shot methods by using image-based synthetic data to simulate target domains, enhancing both performance and efficiency.

Abstract: Zero-shot domain adaptation is a method for adapting a model to a target
domain without utilizing target domain image data. To enable adaptation without
target images, existing studies utilize CLIP's embedding space and text
description to simulate target-like style features. Despite the previous
achievements in zero-shot domain adaptation, we observe that these text-driven
methods struggle to capture complex real-world variations and significantly
increase adaptation time due to their alignment process. Instead of relying on
text descriptions, we explore solutions leveraging image data, which provides
diverse and more fine-grained style cues. In this work, we propose SIDA, a
novel and efficient zero-shot domain adaptation method leveraging synthetic
images. To generate synthetic images, we first create detailed, source-like
images and apply image translation to reflect the style of the target domain.
We then utilize the style features of these synthetic images as a proxy for the
target domain. Based on these features, we introduce Domain Mix and Patch Style
Transfer modules, which enable effective modeling of real-world variations. In
particular, Domain Mix blends multiple styles to expand the intra-domain
representations, and Patch Style Transfer assigns different styles to
individual patches. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by showing
state-of-the-art performance in diverse zero-shot adaptation scenarios,
particularly in challenging domains. Moreover, our approach achieves high
efficiency by significantly reducing the overall adaptation time.

*Grace Su,Sheng-Yu Wang,Aaron Hertzmann,Eli Shechtman,Jun-Yan Zhu,Richard Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a benchmark and dataset for recognizing artist styles in images generated by text-to-image models, addressing generalization challenges and ethical concerns about style attribution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate the ability of models to recognize artist-specific styles in AI-generated images and to address concerns about ethical use of these technologies.

Method: The authors create a dataset of 1.95M images for 110 named artists and assess performance across generalization tasks using feature similarity baselines, style descriptors, data attribution, supervised methods, and few-shot learning.

Result: Supervised and few-shot models perform well on familiar artists and prompts, while style descriptors transfer better to unique artist styles. Multi-artist prompts remain the hardest to interpret, and results indicate room for improvement.

Conclusion: This benchmark highlights challenges in generalizing artist-style recognition, offering a testbed for better moderation of text-to-image models. The dataset and benchmark both are shared to encourage ethical advancements.

Abstract: A common and controversial use of text-to-image models is to generate
pictures by explicitly naming artists, such as "in the style of Greg
Rutkowski". We introduce a benchmark for prompted-artist recognition:
predicting which artist names were invoked in the prompt from the image alone.
The dataset contains 1.95M images covering 110 artists and spans four
generalization settings: held-out artists, increasing prompt complexity,
multiple-artist prompts, and different text-to-image models. We evaluate
feature similarity baselines, contrastive style descriptors, data attribution
methods, supervised classifiers, and few-shot prototypical networks.
Generalization patterns vary: supervised and few-shot models excel on seen
artists and complex prompts, whereas style descriptors transfer better when the
artist's style is pronounced; multi-artist prompts remain the most challenging.
Our benchmark reveals substantial headroom and provides a public testbed to
advance the responsible moderation of text-to-image models. We release the
dataset and benchmark to foster further research:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Captain Cinema is a framework for generating short movies using textual descriptions, keyframes, and video synthesis models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To automate the creation of visually coherent and narratively consistent short movies efficiently.

Method: The framework employs a two-step process: (1) Top-down keyframe planning for narrative coherence and (2) Bottom-up video synthesis using a Multimodal Diffusion Transformer (MM-DiT) trained on a cinematic dataset.

Result: Captain Cinema demonstrates effective generation of high-quality, narratively consistent short movies.

Conclusion: The framework provides a novel approach to automated movie generation, enhancing both visual and narrative coherence.

Abstract: We present Captain Cinema, a generation framework for short movie generation.
Given a detailed textual description of a movie storyline, our approach firstly
generates a sequence of keyframes that outline the entire narrative, which
ensures long-range coherence in both the storyline and visual appearance (e.g.,
scenes and characters). We refer to this step as top-down keyframe planning.
These keyframes then serve as conditioning signals for a video synthesis model,
which supports long context learning, to produce the spatio-temporal dynamics
between them. This step is referred to as bottom-up video synthesis. To support
stable and efficient generation of multi-scene long narrative cinematic works,
we introduce an interleaved training strategy for Multimodal Diffusion
Transformers (MM-DiT), specifically adapted for long-context video data. Our
model is trained on a specially curated cinematic dataset consisting of
interleaved data pairs. Our experiments demonstrate that Captain Cinema
performs favorably in the automated creation of visually coherent and narrative
consistent short movies in high quality and efficiency. Project page:

*Felix Quinque,Alan Aboudib,Szymon Fonau,Rodrigo Lopez Portillo Alcocer,Brian McCrindle,Steffen Cruz*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: This paper proposes IOTA, an architecture to enhance decentralized pretraining of large language models by enabling scalable cooperation among independent actors while offering fair incentives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation was to address core issues from SN9's decentralized pretraining method, particularly scalability constraints due to local fitting requirements and unfair winner-takes-all reward structures.

Method: The method used involves transforming isolated competitors into cooperative units through innovations like a Data- and Pipeline-parallel SWARM, Activation compression, Butterfly All-Reduce, and CLASP attribution schemes.

Result: Preliminary results show improvements in scalability, training speed, bandwidth reduction, fair reward distribution, and collusion detection.

Conclusion: The proposed IOTA architecture enables decentralized model pretraining to scale and operate more efficiently while offering fair token-based incentives to contributors.

Abstract: In August 2024, Bittensor's Subnet 9 (SN9) demonstrated that a distributed
network of incentivized, permissionless actors could each pretrain large
language models (LLMs) ranging from 700 million to 14 billion parameters, while
surpassing established baselines. While that work validated blockchain-based
decentralized pretraining as viable, it contained core issues: (i) every miner
had to fit an entire model locally, and (ii) "winner-takes-all" rewards
encouraged model hoarding.
  Here we introduce IOTA (Incentivized Orchestrated Training Architecture), an
architecture that addresses these limitations by transforming SN9's previously
isolated competitors into a single cooperating unit that can scale arbitrarily
while still rewarding each contributor fairly.
  Key preliminary results: (1) Data- and Pipeline-parallel SWARM architecture -
An orchestrator distributes model layers across heterogeneous miners and
streams activations between them, enabling model sizes to scale with the number
of participants rather than being constrained by the VRAM of a single machine;
(2) Granular, continuous incentives - Validators measure each miner's
contribution and allocate token emissions proportionally; (3) Activation
compression - We used model-bottlenecks to cut communication bandwidths of
activations by up to 128x, vastly improving training speed; (4) Butterfly
All-Reduce - Miners average disjoint parameter slices in O(1) bandwidth,
offering linear scalability, redundancy and built-in collusion detection; (5)
CLASP (Contribution Loss Assessment via Sampling of Pathways) - A fair
attribution scheme assigns credit to miners proportional to their marginal
utility and detects exploits, even when contributions are interdependent across
the pipeline.

*Kan Zhu,Haiyang Shi,Le Xu,Jiaxin Shan,Arvind Krishnamurthy,Baris Kasikci,Liguang Xie*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: PolyServe is a multi-SLO scheduling system that improves large language model application performance by grouping and routing requests based on token latency requirements, achieving better throughput and SLO attainment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing systems for Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle to efficiently handle diverse latency-sensitive workload requirements, leading to suboptimal user experiences and scheduling inefficiencies.

Method: PolyServe employs a multi-SLO scheduling mechanism where requests are grouped by latency requirements, scheduled to specific servers, and managed through profiling data. It uses techniques like request-wait-time-aware scheduling, dynamic chunking, and chunked prefill prediction.

Result: PolyServe demonstrated 1.23x goodput improvement compared to current policies, attaining up to 92.5% of optimal goodput.

Conclusion: PolyServe successfully addresses the challenges of serving diverse latency-sensitive requests in LLM-powered applications, enhancing scheduling efficiency and user experience.

Abstract: Advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have led to a surge of LLM-powered
applications. These applications have diverse token-generation latency
requirements. As a result, simply classifying workloads as latency-sensitive
(LS) or best-effort (BE) overlooks the nuances within the latency-sensitive
category and results in suboptimal user experiences and scheduling
opportunities. However, efficiently serving requests with multiple SLO
requirements poses significant challenges. First, all requests within a batch
generate new tokens simultaneously, which can misalign them with their distinct
SLO requirements. Moreover, while existing systems focus on auto-scaling for
handling various overall request rates, the diversity of SLOs necessitates
fine-grained auto-scaling among these SLO tiers. Finally, unlike LS/BE
scenarios, where BE requests can be aborted at any time to ensure the SLO
attainment of LS requests, those with different latency-sensitive SLOs cannot
tolerate prolonged delays, and tail latency must be controlled.
  To tackle these challenges, we propose PolyServe, a novel multi-SLO
scheduling policy at scale that maintains high SLO attainment while maximizing
throughput. PolyServe first groups requests into multiple bins based on their
per-token latency requirement, then schedules each bin to a subset of the
server fleet. PolyServe routes requests to the highest-load but still
SLO-attainable server to create a load gradient that facilitates auto-scaling.
To increase utilization, PolyServe permits looser-SLO requests to share
tighter-SLO instances when their own servers are saturated. PolyServe uses
profiling data to guide scheduling decisions and manage tail latency through
request-wait-time-aware scheduling, dynamic chunking, and continuous chunked
prefill prediction. PolyServe achieves 1.23x goodput gain compared to existing
policies, achieving up to 92.5% of optimal goodput.

### [168] [Comparative Evaluation of PyTorch, JAX, SciPy, and Neal for Solving QUBO Problems at Scale](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17770)
*Pei-Kun Yang*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: This paper benchmarks five QUBO solvers (Neal, PyTorch, JAX, and SciPy) on their performance regarding solution quality, scalability, and runtime, revealing PyTorch as the most balanced for large-scale problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study seeks to identify the most efficient QUBO solver for large-scale optimization problems by comparing solution quality, computational time, and scalability.

Method: The authors benchmarked Neal, PyTorch (CPU and GPU), JAX, and SciPy solvers on randomly generated QUBO matrices, analyzing results across varying problem sizes and convergence thresholds.

Result: Neal achieved the best solution quality (lowest energy) but could only scale up to 6000 variables due to high memory consumption. PyTorch achieved slightly higher energy but scaled efficiently to 45000 variables with faster runtimes. JAX scaled up to 25000 variables but had slightly worse energy values. SciPy performed worst in terms of scalability, energy, and computation time.

Conclusion: PyTorch is identified as the most balanced QUBO solver for handling large-scale problems, offering a trade-off between solution quality, scalability, and runtime efficiency.

Abstract: Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) is a versatile framework
for modeling combinatorial optimization problems. This study benchmarks five
software-based QUBO solvers: Neal, PyTorch (CPU), PyTorch (GPU), JAX, and
SciPy, on randomly generated QUBO matrices ranging from 1000x1000 to
45000x45000, under six convergence thresholds from 10^-1 to 10^-6. We evaluate
their performance in terms of solution quality (energy) and computational time.
Among the solvers tested, Neal achieved the lowest energy values but was
limited to problems with up to 6000 variables due to high memory consumption.
PyTorch produced slightly higher energy results than Neal but demonstrated
superior scalability, solving instances with up to 45000 variables. Its support
for GPU acceleration and CPU multi-threading also resulted in significantly
shorter runtimes. JAX yielded energy values slightly above those of PyTorch and
was limited to 25000 variables, with runtimes comparable to PyTorch on GPU.
SciPy was the most constrained solver, handling only up to 6000 variables and
consistently producing the highest energy values with the longest computation
times. These findings highlight trade-offs between solution quality,
scalability, and runtime efficiency, and suggest that PyTorch is the most
balanced choice for large-scale QUBO problems when computational resources
permit.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern CNNs face challenges in deployment on embedded platforms due to resource constraints, necessitating innovations in system integration and memory optimization.

Method: The study highlights hardware integration challenges, evaluates performance bottlenecks, and utilizes the RISC-V Vector 1.0 extension and cache hierarchy schemes to optimize computation and execution.

Result: Up to 9x speedup in image pre-processing and up to 3x improvement in fallback layer execution compared to conventional CPU processes.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates the viability of RISC-V Vector 1.0 for balanced computation, improved memory management, power efficiency, and enhanced dataflows in embedded systems for deep learning.

Abstract: The emergence of heterogeneity and domain-specific architectures targeting
deep learning inference show great potential for enabling the deployment of
modern CNNs on resource-constrained embedded platforms. A significant
development is the diversification of custom hardware solely targeting the most
expensive parts of CNNs. DLAs (deep learning accelerators) and NPUs (neural
processing units), among others, can overcome the approaching limits of
traditional silicon scaling and provide a solution to the power/performance
tradeoff within embedded SoCs. Efficient DSA utilization requires proper system
integration and a compilation/execution model for balanced execution in these
heterogeneous architectures. There is a critical need for proper system
integration and an efficient compilation/execution model for balanced execution
in these heterogeneous architectures. This work highlights the hardware
integration challenges for efficiently placing these units within the memory
hierarchy and correct proximity to other execution blocks. We experimentally
verify performance bottlenecks in CNN execution and pre/post-processing at
runtime, where previous attention has generally been given to accelerator
speedup alone. This work takes advantage of the ratification of the RISC-V
Vector 1.0 extension and demonstrates its potential as a flexible target within
a well-suited cache hierarchy scheme to reduce pre-processing bottlenecks and
CPU fallback processes. Our results show up to a 9x speedup of image
pre-processing and YOLOv3 fallback layer execution by up to 3x compared to CPU.
We demonstrate RVV-1.0 in exposing a flexible programming model that can enable
a balanced computation and memory footprint on accelerator-rich embedded SoCs
supporting modern deep-learning dataflows while consuming less power than
traditional parallel execution platforms.

*Zhongzhen Wen,Yinghui Zhang,Zhong Li,Zhongxin Liu,Linna Xie,Tian Zhang*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: MultiKernelBench is a comprehensive benchmark for using large language models in generating deep learning kernels, spanning 285 tasks and three hardware platforms with modular extensibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitations of current benchmarks for LLM-based deep learning kernel generation, which suffer from limited hardware support, poor categorization, and imbalanced task coverage.

Method: Introduced MultiKernelBench, a benchmark with detailed kernel categories, support for major hardware platforms (Nvidia GPUs, Huawei NPUs, Google TPUs), and a modular backend layer for extensibility. Proposed a category-aware one-shot prompting method for improved performance.

Result: Evaluated seven state-of-the-art LLMs, observed high variation in task difficulties, poor generalization to less-exposed platforms, and the efficacy of targeted prompting strategies.

Conclusion: MultiKernelBench highlights key benchmarks for LLM kernel generation, improves kernel generation quality, and introduces tools to address performance disparities across platforms.

Abstract: The automatic generation of deep learning (DL) kernels using large language
models (LLMs) has emerged as a promising approach to reduce the manual effort
and hardware-specific expertise required for writing high-performance operator
implementations. However, existing benchmarks for evaluating LLMs in this
domain suffer from limited hardware support, coarse-grained kernel
categorization, and imbalanced task coverage. To address these limitations, we
introduce MultiKernelBench, the first comprehensive, multi-platform benchmark
for LLM-based DL kernel generation. MultiKernelBench spans 285 tasks across 14
well-defined kernel categories and supports three major hardware platforms:
Nvidia GPUs, Huawei NPUs, and Google TPUs. To enable future extensibility, we
design a modular backend abstraction layer that decouples platform-specific
logic from the core benchmarking infrastructure, allowing easy integration of
new hardware platforms. We further propose a simple yet effective
category-aware one-shot prompting method that improves generation quality by
providing in-category exemplars. Through systematic evaluations of seven
state-of-the-art LLMs, we reveal significant variation in task difficulty, poor
generalization to platforms with less training exposure, and the effectiveness
of targeted prompting strategies. MultiKernelBench is publicly available at

Conclusion: CHAMP represents a practical step toward modular AI systems with secure and scalable capabilities, with identified potential for future enhancements in bus protocols and software.

Abstract: What if you could piece together your own custom biometrics and AI analysis
system, a bit like LEGO blocks? We aim to bring that technology to field
operators in the field who require flexible, high-performance edge AI system
that can be adapted on a moment's notice. This paper introduces CHAMP
(Configurable Hot-swappable Architecture for Machine Perception), a modular
edge computing platform that allows operators to dynamically swap in
specialized AI "capability cartridges" for tasks like face recognition, object

accelerators on a high-throughput bus, orchestrated by a custom operating
system (VDiSK) to enable plug-and-play AI pipelines and cryptographically
secured biometric datasets. In this paper we describe the CHAMP design,
including its modular scaling with multiple accelerators and the VDiSK
operating system for runtime reconfiguration, along with its cryptographic
capabilities to keep data stored on modules safe and private. Experiments
demonstrate near-linear throughput scaling from 1 to 5 neural compute
accelerators, highlighting both the performance gains and saturation limits of
the USB3-based bus. Finally, we discuss applications of CHAMP in field
biometrics, surveillance, and disaster response, and outline future
improvements in bus protocols, cartridge capabilities, and system software.

*Talha Mehboob,Luanzheng Guo,Nathan Tallent,Michael Zink,David Irwin*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper introduces PowerTrip, a system designed to optimize AI model training across geographically distributed sites with heterogeneous power availability, reducing time-to-accuracy by up to 50%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The exponential growth of large-scale AI models requires massive computational power, which often exceeds the capacity of individual data centers due to regional power limitations. Distributing workloads across multiple sites introduces network latency issues, creating a trade-off between computational power and communication overhead.

Method: The proposed solution, PowerTrip, dynamically selects data center sites based on a power-to-cost heuristic that prioritizes power availability and minimizes network latency. It uses a dynamic greedy approach to optimize training efficiency by balancing computational gains against the communication overhead.

Result: PowerTrip achieves up to a 50% reduction in time-to-accuracy compared to existing policies, as demonstrated by evaluations using real-world Google power traces.

Conclusion: PowerTrip effectively addresses the challenges of training large AI models in geo-distributed, power-constrained environments by optimizing the trade-off between computational power and communication delays, resulting in significantly improved training efficiency.

Abstract: The exponential growth of large-scale AI models has led to computational and
power demands that can exceed the capacity of a single data center. This is due
to the limited power supplied by regional grids that leads to limited regional
computational power. Consequently, distributing training workloads across
geographically distributed sites has become essential. However, this approach
introduces a significant challenge in the form of communication overhead,
creating a fundamental trade-off between the performance gains from accessing
greater aggregate power and the performance losses from increased network
latency. Although prior work has focused on reducing communication volume or
using heuristics for distribution, these methods assume constant homogeneous
power supplies and ignore the challenge of heterogeneous power availability
between sites.
  To address the challenge of training large models in power-constrained,
geo-distributed environments, we introduce PowerTrip, a system that dynamically
selects a subset of sites during runtime to optimize the power-communication
trade-off. Specifically, PowerTrip selects sites based on a power-to-cost
heuristic, prioritizing those with high power availability and low network
latency. PowerTrip employs a dynamic greedy approach and uses the marginal gain
in training efficiency, i.e., accuracy improvement per unit of time, to
optimize for the number of sites where the performance penalty from network
overhead negates the benefit of adding more computational power. Our
evaluation, which uses real-world Google power traces to model realistic power
capacity constraints, demonstrates that PowerTrip can reduce time-to-accuracy
by up to 50% compared to existing baseline policies.

*Shengye Song,Minxian Xu,Zuowei Zhang,Chengxi Gao,Fansong Zeng,Yu Ding,Kejiang Ye,Chengzhong Xu*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper addresses interference challenges in co-located microservices clusters by proposing a CPI-based interference prediction model and presenting the C-Koordinator platform, achieving improved application performance and reduced latency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To mitigate resource competition and interference in large-scale co-located microservices clusters while enhancing resource utilization and stabilizing application latency.

Method: Analyzed Alibaba's production clusters, introduced CPI as the metric for interference, developed prediction models using multi-dimensional metrics, and designed the open-source C-Koordinator platform for interference mitigation.

Result: Achieved over 90.3% accuracy in CPI interference prediction and reduced application latency by 16.7%-36.1% across percentiles under diverse system loads compared to state-of-the-art systems.

Conclusion: The proposed interference prediction and mitigation strategies effectively stabilize application performance and reduce latency in co-located microservices clusters, demonstrating a scalable solution for enterprise-level challenges.

Abstract: Microservices transform traditional monolithic applications into lightweight,
loosely coupled application components and have been widely adopted in many
enterprises. Cloud platform infrastructure providers enhance the resource
utilization efficiency of microservices systems by co-locating different
microservices. However, this approach also introduces resource competition and
interference among microservices. Designing interference-aware strategies for
large-scale, co-located microservice clusters is crucial for enhancing resource
utilization and mitigating competition-induced interference. These challenges
are further exacerbated by unreliable metrics, application diversity, and node
heterogeneity.
  In this paper, we first analyze the characteristics of large-scale and
co-located microservices clusters at Alibaba and further discuss why cycle per
instruction (CPI) is adopted as a metric for interference measurement in
large-scale production clusters, as well as how to achieve accurate prediction
of CPI through multi-dimensional metrics. Based on CPI interference prediction
and analysis, we also present the design of the C-Koordinator platform, an
open-source solution utilized in Alibaba cluster, which incorporates
co-location and interference mitigation strategies. The interference prediction
models consistently achieve over 90.3% accuracy, enabling precise prediction
and rapid mitigation of interference in operational environments. As a result,
application latency is reduced and stabilized across all percentiles (P50, P90,
P99) response time (RT), achieving improvements ranging from 16.7% to 36.1%
under various system loads compared with state-of-the-art system. These results
demonstrate the system's ability to maintain smooth application performance in
co-located environments.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: CoCoServe proposes an elastic system for serving large language models (LLMs) with dynamic and fine-grained scaling capabilities to optimize resource management and reduce costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to tackle the inefficiencies in resource utilization and scaling challenges in current serving systems for LLMs under dynamic and unpredictable workloads.

Method: CoCoServe innovates through module-level operations like replication and migration of LLM components, paired with auto-scaling mechanisms that optimize resource allocation and performance.

Result: CoCoServe demonstrates scalability while reducing serving costs by 46%. It decreases latency by 14%-75% and boosts throughput by 1.16x-4x compared to existing systems.

Conclusion: The system successfully enhances the cost-effectiveness, scalability, and performance of LLM serving, addressing the limitations of static deployment and high-cost adjustments in existing methodologies.

Abstract: The rise of large language models (LLMs) has created new opportunities across
various fields but has also introduced significant challenges in resource
management. Current LLM serving systems face a fundamental tension: balancing
serving demands with limited resources while adapting to unpredictable traffic
patterns. Static deployments lead to suboptimal resource utilization and
performance degradation under dynamic workloads. Furthermore, the high cost of
adjusting instances hinders dynamic scaling, limiting the true potential of
efficient LLM serving.
  To address this, we propose CoCoServe, an elastic system that facilitates
dynamic and fine-grained scaling. Its key innovation lies in the module-level
operations for the replication and migration of LLM modules, such as decoder
layers and projections. Through a comprehensive analysis of the trade-offs
associated with these operations, we develop an auto-scaling mechanism that
dynamically regulates module-level resource allocation and performance
optimization, enabling a more cost-effective deployment of LLMs. Our evaluation
demonstrates that the scaling operations employed by CoCoServe exhibit
excellent scalability and can reduce costs by 46% while maintaining
availability. Compared to state-of-the-art LLM serving systems (e.g., Hugging
Face Transformers and vLLM), our approach reduces latency by 14%-75% and
achieves 1.16x-4x throughput on average across different model sizes and
workloads.

serving. By leveraging these technologies, we demonstrate how a Cloud Native
system enables more efficient resource allocation, reduces latency, and
enhances throughput in high-demand scenarios. Through real-world evaluations

broader perspective on how Cloud Native frameworks could reshape the future of
scalable LLM inference serving, offering key insights for researchers,
practitioners, and industry leaders in cloud computing and artificial
intelligence.

TL;DR: The paper introduces FCPO, a hybrid approach combining Continual RL and Federated RL to optimize real-time Edge Video Analytics, achieving significant throughput, latency, and memory consumption improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Edge Video Analytics systems face challenges in adapting to rapidly changing environments and scaling traditional scheduling methods efficiently.

Method: FCPO integrates Continual RL and Federated RL to dynamically adjust system parameters like batch sizes and input resolutions, employing aggregation schemes and experience buffers to enhance adaptability and learning.

Result: Experiments demonstrated over 5x improvement in throughput, 60% latency reduction, 20% quicker convergence, and up to 10x lower memory usage compared to existing RL methods.

Conclusion: FCPO effectively addresses scalability, adaptability, and knowledge integration issues in EVA systems, making it superior to state-of-the-art RL-based approaches.

Abstract: The growing complexity of Edge Video Analytics (EVA) facilitates new kind of
intelligent applications, but creates challenges in real-time inference serving
systems. State-of-the-art (SOTA) scheduling systems optimize global workload
distributions for heterogeneous devices but often suffer from extended
scheduling cycles, leading to sub-optimal processing in rapidly changing Edge
environments. Local Reinforcement Learning (RL) enables quick adjustments
between cycles but faces scalability, knowledge integration, and adaptability
issues. Thus, we propose FCPO, which combines Continual RL (CRL) with Federated
RL (FRL) to address these challenges. This integration dynamically adjusts
inference batch sizes, input resolutions, and multi-threading during pre- and
post-processing. CRL allows agents to learn from changing Markov Decision
Processes, capturing dynamic environmental variations, while FRL improves
generalization and convergence speed by integrating experiences across
inference models. FCPO combines these via an agent-specific aggregation scheme
and a diversity-aware experience buffer. Experiments on a real-world EVA
testbed showed over 5 times improvement in effective throughput, 60% reduced
latency, and 20% faster convergence with up to 10 times less memory consumption
compared to SOTA RL-based approaches.

Motivation: Traditional PDES engines face scalability limits and inefficiencies in LP resource allocation and complex entity interactions during large-scale simulations.

Method: The paper proposes four improvements: asynchronous listener threads for reduced monitoring latency, METIS-based load rebalancing for dynamic event allocation, constraint-based entity interaction solver, and spatial hashing for efficient neighbor searches.

Result: The enhanced framework shows up to 16x acceleration compared to baseline, with 58.18% reduction in synchronization overhead and notable improvements in temporal fidelity and computational efficiency.

Conclusion: The proposed optimizations significantly enhance PDES for large-scale simulations, addressing inherent limitations in existing engines and improving scalability, speed, and efficiency.

Abstract: Rising demand for complex simulations highlights conventional

adoption.Warped2, a PDES engine leveraging Time Warp synchronization with
Pending Event Set optimization, delivers strong performance, it struggles with
inherent wargaming limitations: inefficient LP resource allocation during
synchronization and unaddressed complex entity interaction patterns. To address
these challenges, we present an optimized framework featuring four synergistic
improvements: (1) Asynchronous listener threads are introduced to address event
monitoring latency in large-scale scenarios, instead of synchronous polling
mechanisms, (2) METIS-based load rebalancing strategy is incorporated to
address the issue of dynamic event allocation during real-world simulation, (3)
Entity interaction solver with constraint satisfaction mechanisms is designed
to mitigate state conflicts, and (4) Spatial hashing algorithm to overcome
O(n^2) complexity bottlenecks in large-scale nearest-neighbor searches.
Experimental validation through a GridWorld demo demonstrates significant
enhancements in temporal fidelity and computational efficiency. Benchmark
results show our framework achieves 16x acceleration over baseline
implementations and maintains 8x speedup over 1-thread configuration across MPI
and Pthreads implementations.The combined load balancing and LP migration
strategy reduces synchronization overhead by 58.18%, with load balancing
accounting for 57% of the total improvement as the dominant optimization
factor. These improvements provide an enhanced solution for PDES implementation
in large-scale simulation scenarios.

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel data replication strategy for cloud systems, using reinforcement learning to optimize service quality, provider profit, and environmental impact.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growth of global data volumes has heightened the need for adaptable and scalable distributed systems, prompting reliance on data replication for performance and availability. Traditional threshold-based methods require manual adjustment, which is labor-intensive and reactive.

Method: The paper introduces a reinforcement learning-based strategy for data replication, where states, actions, and rewards are defined to dynamically adapt to system changes and workloads.

Result: The proposed strategy improves adaptability to workload changes and architectures, ensuring a balance between service quality, provider profit, and environmental sustainability.

Conclusion: Reinforcement learning effectively enhances data replication performance in cloud systems, reducing administrative effort while optimizing critical metrics for sustainable and efficient service delivery.

Abstract: The rapid growth of global data volumes has created a demand for scalable
distributed systems that can maintain a high quality of service. Data
replication is a widely used technique that provides fault tolerance, improved
performance and higher availability. Traditional implementations often rely on
threshold-based activation mechanisms, which can vary depending on workload
changes and system architecture. System administrators typically bear the
responsibility of adjusting these thresholds. To address this challenge,
reinforcement learning can be used to dynamically adapt to workload changes and
different architectures. In this paper, we propose a novel data replication
strategy for cloud systems that employs reinforcement learning to automatically
learn system characteristics and adapt to workload changes. The strategy's aim
is to provide satisfactory Quality of Service while optimizing a trade-off
between provider profit and environmental impact. We present the architecture
behind our solution and describe the reinforcement learning model by defining
the states, actions and rewards.

*Yujia Tong,Jingling Yuan,Chuang Hu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces QuaRC, a framework for Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) on edge devices that uses a coreset selection phase and layer correction to improve the efficiency and accuracy of low-bit quantized models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the increasing need for low-bit quantized models on edge devices while overcoming privacy concerns and computational costs associated with retraining using sensitive edge data.

Method: QuaRC includes two key phases: (1) Relative Entropy Score-based coreset selection to identify datasets most representative of quantization errors, and (2) Cascaded Layer Correction for aligning intermediate outputs of quantized models with full-precision models.

Result: Experimental results showed that QuaRC achieves significant improvements in model accuracy. For instance, a 2-bit quantized ResNet-18 utilizing only 1% of data improved by 5.72% in Top-1 ImageNet accuracy compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: QuaRC effectively enhances the performance of low-bit quantized models under constrained datasets, making it a viable solution for efficient and accurate quantization on edge devices.

Abstract: With the development of mobile and edge computing, the demand for low-bit
quantized models on edge devices is increasing to achieve efficient deployment.
To enhance the performance, it is often necessary to retrain the quantized
models using edge data. However, due to privacy concerns, certain sensitive
data can only be processed on edge devices. Therefore, employing
Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) on edge devices has become an effective
solution. Nevertheless, traditional QAT relies on the complete dataset for
training, which incurs a huge computational cost. Coreset selection techniques
can mitigate this issue by training on the most representative subsets.
However, existing methods struggle to eliminate quantization errors in the
model when using small-scale datasets (e.g., only 10% of the data), leading to
significant performance degradation. To address these issues, we propose QuaRC,
a QAT framework with coresets on edge devices, which consists of two main
phases: In the coreset selection phase, QuaRC introduces the ``Relative Entropy
Score" to identify the subsets that most effectively capture the model's
quantization errors. During the training phase, QuaRC employs the Cascaded
Layer Correction strategy to align the intermediate layer outputs of the
quantized model with those of the full-precision model, thereby effectively
reducing the quantization errors in the intermediate layers. Experimental
results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. For instance, when
quantizing ResNet-18 to 2-bit using a 1% data subset, QuaRC achieves a 5.72%
improvement in Top-1 accuracy on the ImageNet-1K dataset compared to
state-of-the-art techniques.

*Minh-Duong Nguyen,Quoc-Viet Pham,Nguyen H. Tran,Hoang-Khoi Do,Duy T. Ngo,Won-Joo Hwang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a generative adversarial network using causality-invariant learning for more robust semantic communication with improved data reconstruction and consistent performance across diverse domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As user-collected data diversifies and evolves, there is a need to ensure reliable channel decoding and effective semantic communication while minimizing communication overhead.

Method: They designed a generative adversarial network (GAN) using causality-invariant learning to extract causal and non-causal features, enabling robust and invariant semantic knowledge reconstruction. Sparse update protocols were included to maintain consistency and reduce overhead.

Result: The proposed method ensures consistency across varying devices, achieves promising classification performance, and outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR).

Conclusion: The causality-invariant approach enables reliable, robust, and efficient semantic communication, especially when handling diverse and evolving user data.

Abstract: In this study, we design a low-complexity and generalized AI model that can
capture common knowledge to improve data reconstruction of the channel decoder
for semantic communication. Specifically, we propose a generative adversarial
network that leverages causality-invariant learning to extract causal and
non-causal representations from the data. Causal representations are invariant
and encompass crucial information to identify the data's label. They can
encapsulate semantic knowledge and facilitate effective data reconstruction at
the receiver. Moreover, the causal mechanism ensures that learned
representations remain consistent across different domains, making the system
reliable even with users collecting data from diverse domains. As
user-collected data evolves over time causing knowledge divergence among users,
we design sparse update protocols to improve the invariant properties of the
knowledge while minimizing communication overheads. Three key observations were
drawn from our empirical evaluations. Firstly, causality-invariant knowledge
ensures consistency across different devices despite the diverse training data.
Secondly, invariant knowledge has promising performance in classification
tasks, which is pivotal for goal-oriented semantic communications. Thirdly, our
knowledge-based data reconstruction highlights the robustness of our decoder,
which surpasses other state-of-the-art data reconstruction and semantic
compression methods in terms of Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR).

TL;DR: This study investigates the role of self-similarity in feature representation across hidden layers of deep neural networks using complex network modeling, revealing impacts on classification performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of quantitative analysis on self-similarity's influence in hidden space geometry during model weight optimization and its effect on neuron dynamics.

Method: The authors model hidden-layer neuron output as complex networks to study self-similarity across different layers and apply constraints to enhance self-similarity during training.

Result: Embedding self-similarity constraints improved classification performance of self-similar architectures by up to 6 percentage points, with variations across MLP, convolutional, and attention networks.

Conclusion: Adjusting self-similarity in feature networks impacts the dynamic behavior of neurons and can significantly enhance performances in certain neural architectures.

Abstract: Current research has found that some deep neural networks exhibit strong
hierarchical self-similarity in feature representation or parameter
distribution. However, aside from preliminary studies on how the power-law
distribution of weights across different training stages affects model
performance,there has been no quantitative analysis on how the self-similarity
of hidden space geometry influences model weight optimization, nor is there a
clear understanding of the dynamic behavior of internal neurons. Therefore,
this paper proposes a complex network modeling method based on the output
features of hidden-layer neurons to investigate the self-similarity of feature
networks constructed at different hidden layers, and analyzes how adjusting the
degree of self-similarity in feature networks can enhance the classification
performance of deep neural networks. Validated on three types of networks MLP
architectures, convolutional networks, and attention architectures this study
reveals that the degree of self-similarity exhibited by feature networks varies
across different model architectures. Furthermore, embedding constraints on the
self-similarity of feature networks during the training process can improve the
performance of self-similar deep neural networks (MLP architectures and
attention architectures) by up to 6 percentage points.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a reinforcement learning-based optimization method for aerodynamic shape design, utilizing surrogate models and freezing parameters to reduce computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Aerodynamic shape optimization is computationally intensive, and dimensionality reduction can help minimize effort while understanding optimization results.

Method: The approach uses RL actor-critic policy with MCMC and ground truth simulations. Parameters are adjusted locally around intermediate simulations, ensuring accuracy in neighborhood rewards and costs.

Result: The method accelerates global optimization by leveraging local parameter changes and maintains accuracy in rewards for step-wise adaption.

Conclusion: The RL-based optimization offers computational efficiency and deeper insights into feature importance for fluid dynamics problems.

Abstract: We introduce a reinforcement learning (RL) based adaptive optimization
algorithm for aerodynamic shape optimization focused on dimensionality
reduction. The form in which RL is applied here is that of a surrogate-based,
actor-critic policy evaluation MCMC approach allowing for temporal 'freezing'
of some of the parameters to be optimized. The goals are to minimize
computational effort, and to use the observed optimization results for
interpretation of the discovered extrema in terms of their role in achieving
the desired flow-field.
  By a sequence of local optimized parameter changes around intermediate CFD
simulations acting as ground truth, it is possible to speed up the global
optimization if (a) the local neighbourhoods of the parameters in which the
changed parameters must reside are sufficiently large to compete with the
grid-sized steps and its large number of simulations, and (b) the estimates of
the rewards and costs on these neighbourhoods necessary for a good step-wise
parameter adaption are sufficiently accurate. We give an example of a simple
fluid-dynamical problem on which the method allows interpretation in the sense
of a feature importance scoring.

### [185] [Hyperbolic Deep Learning for Foundation Models: A Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17787)
*Neil He,Hiren Madhu,Ngoc Bui,Menglin Yang,Rex Ying*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper reviews hyperbolic neural networks and their potential for improving foundation models in areas such as reasoning, generalization, and semantic alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in foundation models like limited representational capacity, adaptability, and scalability, by exploring alternative geometric spaces such as hyperbolic spaces that better align with complex real-world data.

Method: The study provides a comprehensive review of recent advancements in hyperbolic neural networks and their application to foundation models like LLMs and VLMs to enhance reasoning, generalization, and efficiency.

Result: Hyperbolic spaces have been shown to improve models by enabling low-distortion embeddings of hierarchical structures and power-law distributions, elevating reasoning and generalization capabilities while maintaining parameter efficiency.

Conclusion: Incorporating hyperbolic spaces into foundation models has the potential to overcome key limitations, but further research is needed to address remaining challenges and advance this promising approach.

Abstract: Foundation models pre-trained on massive datasets, including large language
models (LLMs), vision-language models (VLMs), and large multimodal models, have
demonstrated remarkable success in diverse downstream tasks. However, recent
studies have shown fundamental limitations of these models: (1) limited
representational capacity, (2) lower adaptability, and (3) diminishing
scalability. These shortcomings raise a critical question: is Euclidean
geometry truly the optimal inductive bias for all foundation models, or could
incorporating alternative geometric spaces enable models to better align with
the intrinsic structure of real-world data and improve reasoning processes?
Hyperbolic spaces, a class of non-Euclidean manifolds characterized by
exponential volume growth with respect to distance, offer a mathematically
grounded solution. These spaces enable low-distortion embeddings of
hierarchical structures (e.g., trees, taxonomies) and power-law distributions
with substantially fewer dimensions compared to Euclidean counterparts. Recent
advances have leveraged these properties to enhance foundation models,
including improving LLMs' complex reasoning ability, VLMs' zero-shot
generalization, and cross-modal semantic alignment, while maintaining parameter
efficiency. This paper provides a comprehensive review of hyperbolic neural
networks and their recent development for foundation models. We further outline
key challenges and research directions to advance the field.

### [186] [Adaptive Repetition for Mitigating Position Bias in LLM-Based Ranking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17788)
*Ali Vardasbi,Gustavo Penha,Claudia Hauff,Hugues Bouchard*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study addresses position bias and low repetition consistency in LLMs when ranking items, proposing a dynamic early-stopping method that significantly reduces computational costs while preserving accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To mitigate the computational inefficiencies and variable performance caused by position bias and low repetition consistency in LLMs while maintaining reliability in tasks like ranking and evaluation.

Method: A dynamic early-stopping method that determines the minimum repetitions per instance, alongside a confidence-based adaptation to further minimize LLM calls.

Result: The dynamic repetition strategy reduces LLM calls by 81% on average while maintaining accuracy, and the confidence-based adaptation further lowers LLM calls by 87% with minor accuracy trade-offs.

Conclusion: Dynamic instance-based repetition strategies can effectively address position bias and improve performance efficiency in tasks using LLMs, achieving large reductions in computational costs with minimal impact on accuracy.

Abstract: When using LLMs to rank items based on given criteria, or evaluate answers,
the order of candidate items can influence the model's final decision. This
sensitivity to item positioning in a LLM's prompt is known as position bias.
Prior research shows that this bias exists even in large models, though its
severity varies across models and tasks. In addition to position bias, LLMs
also exhibit varying degrees of low repetition consistency, where repeating the
LLM call with the same candidate ordering can lead to different rankings. To
address both inconsistencies, a common approach is to prompt the model multiple
times with different candidate orderings and aggregate the results via majority
voting. However, this repetition strategy, significantly increases
computational costs. Extending prior findings, we observe that both the
direction -- favoring either the earlier or later candidate in the prompt --
and magnitude of position bias across instances vary substantially, even within
a single dataset. This observation highlights the need for a per-instance
mitigation strategy. To this end, we introduce a dynamic early-stopping method
that adaptively determines the number of repetitions required for each
instance. Evaluating our approach across three LLMs of varying sizes and on two
tasks, namely re-ranking and alignment, we demonstrate that transitioning to a
dynamic repetition strategy reduces the number of LLM calls by an average of
81%, while preserving the accuracy. Furthermore, we propose a confidence-based
adaptation to our early-stopping method, reducing LLM calls by an average of
87% compared to static repetition, with only a slight accuracy trade-off
relative to our original early-stopping method.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CICME proposes a novel method for understanding sensor systems using causality principles to identify common and individual mechanisms across domains, showing promising results in specific applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to enhance understanding of complex sensor systems by applying causal inference, especially for data collected in heterogeneous domains.

Method: The authors developed CICME, a three-step technique that integrates Causal Transfer Learning for identifying domain-invariant causal mechanisms, followed by the estimation of individual domain-specific mechanisms.

Result: Utilizing linear Gaussian models inspired by manufacturing processes, CICME demonstrates improved performance over baseline methods under certain scenarios.

Conclusion: CICME effectively combines pooled and individual domain data to discover causal mechanisms, showcasing its potential in causality analysis for complex systems.

Abstract: To gain deeper insights into a complex sensor system through the lens of
causality, we present common and individual causal mechanism estimation
(CICME), a novel three-step approach to inferring causal mechanisms from
heterogeneous data collected across multiple domains. By leveraging the
principle of Causal Transfer Learning (CTL), CICME is able to reliably detect
domain-invariant causal mechanisms when provided with sufficient samples. The
identified common causal mechanisms are further used to guide the estimation of
the remaining causal mechanisms in each domain individually. The performance of
CICME is evaluated on linear Gaussian models under scenarios inspired from a
manufacturing process. Building upon existing continuous optimization-based
causal discovery methods, we show that CICME leverages the benefits of applying
causal discovery on the pooled data and repeatedly on data from individual
domains, and it even outperforms both baseline methods under certain scenarios.

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'CoCAI,' a framework combining generative AI and copula-based modeling for accurate forecasting and robust anomaly detection in multivariate time-series analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The work aims to overcome key challenges in multivariate time-series: accurate predictions and reliable anomaly detection.

Method: CoCAI uses a diffusion model for forecasting, conformal prediction for statistical calibration, and combines dimensionality reduction with copula-based modeling for anomaly detection.

Result: Empirical tests on water distribution and sewerage systems data show high effectiveness in both forecasting and anomaly detection.

Conclusion: CoCAI's theoretical grounding and minimal deployment overhead make it a practical and powerful tool for multivariate time-series analysis.

Abstract: We propose a novel framework that harnesses the power of generative
artificial intelligence and copula-based modeling to address two critical
challenges in multivariate time-series analysis: delivering accurate
predictions and enabling robust anomaly detection. Our method, Copula-based
Conformal Anomaly Identification for Multivariate Time-Series (CoCAI),
leverages a diffusion-based model to capture complex dependencies within the
data, enabling high quality forecasting. The model's outputs are further
calibrated using a conformal prediction technique, yielding predictive regions
which are statistically valid, i.e., cover the true target values with a
desired confidence level. Starting from these calibrated forecasts, robust
outlier detection is performed by combining dimensionality reduction techniques
with copula-based modeling, providing a statistically grounded anomaly score.
CoCAI benefits from an offline calibration phase that allows for minimal
overhead during deployment and delivers actionable results rooted in
established theoretical foundations. Empirical tests conducted on real
operational data derived from water distribution and sewerage systems confirm
CoCAI's effectiveness in accurately forecasting target sequences of data and in
identifying anomalous segments within them.

*Shiyuan Zhang,Tong Li,Zhu Xiao,Hongyang Du,Kaibin Huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a model, LSDM, that improves individual user service-level mobile traffic prediction by leveraging diffusion models and large language models (LLMs) for better accuracy and adaptability. It shows notable improvements over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current mobile traffic prediction methods struggle with adaptability to various urban settings and are hindered by uncertain traffic patterns, lack of detailed environmental context, and complex service dependencies, motivating the need for advanced, adaptive modeling techniques.

Method: The proposed method, LSDM, combines diffusion models' generative capabilities with transformers' contextual modeling and incorporates multimodal environmental information to predict service-level mobile traffic distributions and patterns.

Result: The model demonstrates excellent generalization and accuracy. It improves coefficient of determination by at least 2.83% and reduces root mean squared error by at least 8.29% compared to similar models such as CSDI.

Conclusion: The integration of diffusion models and LLMs leads to significant enhancements in service-level traffic prediction accuracy and adaptability. The model outperforms existing methods, and the code and datasets are publicly accessible.

Abstract: Service-level mobile traffic prediction for individual users is essential for
network efficiency and quality of service enhancement. However, current
prediction methods are limited in their adaptability across different urban
environments and produce inaccurate results due to the high uncertainty in
personal traffic patterns, the lack of detailed environmental context, and the
complex dependencies among different network services. These challenges demand
advanced modeling techniques that can capture dynamic traffic distributions and
rich environmental features. Inspired by the recent success of diffusion models
in distribution modeling and Large Language Models (LLMs) in contextual
understanding, we propose an LLM-Enhanced Spatio-temporal Diffusion Model
(LSDM). LSDM integrates the generative power of diffusion models with the
adaptive learning capabilities of transformers, augmented by the ability to
capture multimodal environmental information for modeling service-level
patterns and dynamics. Extensive evaluations on real-world service-level
datasets demonstrate that the model excels in traffic usage predictions,
showing outstanding generalization and adaptability. After incorporating
contextual information via LLM, the performance improves by at least 2.83% in
terms of the coefficient of determination. Compared to models of a similar
type, such as CSDI, the root mean squared error can be reduced by at least
8.29%. The code and dataset will be available at:

*Lakshmana Sri Harsha Nemani,P. K. Srijith,Tomasz Kuśmierczyk*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a new method to improve uncertainty quantification in large language models (LLMs) without requiring computationally expensive methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Uncertainty quantification in LLMs is computationally demanding due to existing methods relying on expensive sampling techniques.

Method: The authors distill uncertainty-aware teacher models into student models using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). They explore softmax-based outputs and Dirichlet-distributed outputs for distillation.

Result: The student models deliver comparable or superior uncertainty quantification and prediction performance using a single forward pass in contrast to costly teacher models.

Conclusion: Evidential distillation enables efficient, robust uncertainty quantification in LLMs with reduced computational effort.

Abstract: Accurate uncertainty quantification remains a key challenge for standard
LLMs, prompting the adoption of Bayesian and ensemble-based methods. However,
such methods typically necessitate computationally expensive sampling,
involving multiple forward passes to effectively estimate predictive
uncertainty.
  In this paper, we introduce a novel approach enabling efficient and effective
uncertainty estimation in LLMs without sacrificing performance. Specifically,
we distill uncertainty-aware teacher models - originally requiring multiple
forward passes - into compact student models sharing the same architecture but
fine-tuned using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). We compare two distinct
distillation strategies: one in which the student employs traditional
softmax-based outputs, and another in which the student leverages
Dirichlet-distributed outputs to explicitly model epistemic uncertainty via
evidential learning.
  Empirical evaluations on classification datasets demonstrate that such
students can achieve comparable or superior predictive and uncertainty
quantification performance relative to their teacher models, while critically
requiring only a single forward pass. To our knowledge, this is the first
demonstration that immediate and robust uncertainty quantification can be
achieved in LLMs through evidential distillation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes GenSelect, a method for selecting the best solution among N candidates leveraging LLMs' reasoning capabilities while scaling effectively with parallel sampling budgets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pointwise and pairwise scoring methods have limitations in utilizing LLMs' comparative abilities and scaling with large sampling budgets.

Method: The authors introduce GenSelect, where LLMs use long reasoning for evaluating the best candidate solution among parallel sampled options.

Result: The GenSelect method demonstrates superior performance in math reasoning tasks compared to existing approaches, using models like QwQ and DeepSeek-R1-0528.

Conclusion: GenSelect effectively combines parallel sampling with LLMs' comparative strengths, enabling scalable and superior reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Generative reward models with parallel sampling have enabled effective
test-time scaling for reasoning tasks. Current approaches employ pointwise
scoring of individual solutions or pairwise comparisons. However, pointwise
methods underutilize LLMs' comparative abilities, while pairwise methods scale
inefficiently with larger sampling budgets. We introduce GenSelect, where the
LLM uses long reasoning to select the best solution among N candidates. This
leverages LLMs' comparative strengths while scaling efficiently across parallel
sampling budgets. For math reasoning, we demonstrate that reasoning models,
such as QwQ and DeepSeek-R1-0528, excel at GenSelect, outperforming existing
scoring approaches with simple prompting.

Motivation: To better understand the relationship between Fisher information matrices and NTK, and to derive insights into their spectral properties.

both notions as a linear transformation and show that spectral decomposition of
NTK with concrete forms of eigenfunctions with major eigenvalues. We also

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper uses Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network (WGAN) for precipitation downscaling, improving visual realism while introducing a new perspective for dataset evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate high-resolution precipitation prediction is crucial to mitigate the effects of localized heavy rainfall, which traditional weather prediction models struggle to achieve.

Method: The authors utilized the Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network (WGAN) with optimal transport cost for precipitation downscaling, aiming to improve realism compared to conventional neural networks.

Result: WGAN generated highly realistic precipitation fields with fine-scale details, although its conventional evaluation metric scores were slightly lower. The WGAN critic demonstrated correlation with human perceptual realism, identifying artifacts and unrealistic outputs.

Conclusion: The WGAN framework enhances visual realism in precipitation modeling, provides new insights into dataset evaluation, and could be a valuable tool for quality control.

Abstract: High-resolution (HR) precipitation prediction is essential for reducing
damage from stationary and localized heavy rainfall; however, HR precipitation
forecasts using process-driven numerical weather prediction models remains
challenging. This study proposes using Wasserstein Generative Adversarial
Network (WGAN) to perform precipitation downscaling with an optimal transport
cost. In contrast to a conventional neural network trained with mean squared
error, the WGAN generated visually realistic precipitation fields with
fine-scale structures even though the WGAN exhibited slightly lower performance
on conventional evaluation metrics. The learned critic of WGAN correlated well
with human perceptual realism. Case-based analysis revealed that large
discrepancies in critic scores can help identify both unrealistic WGAN outputs
and potential artifacts in the reference data. These findings suggest that the
WGAN framework not only improves perceptual realism in precipitation
downscaling but also offers a new perspective for evaluating and
quality-controlling precipitation datasets.

*Varsha Ramineni,Hossein A. Rahmani,Emine Yilmaz,David Barber*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to address data scarcity in AI fairness testing by constructing synthetic datasets with demographic information, validated as comparable to real data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing use of AI in high-risk decision-making requires addressing potential harms and biases. However, obtaining demographic data for fairness testing is often restricted by legal, privacy, and access issues, making it difficult to assess group disparities.

Method: The authors propose creating synthetic datasets by leveraging overlapping datasets to include demographic information accurately. These synthetic datasets are validated against real data to ensure fidelity.

Result: The study finds that fairness metrics from synthetic data testing are consistent with those derived from real data, showcasing the method's reliability.

Conclusion: The work presents a solution to data scarcity in AI fairness testing, enabling reliable, model-agnostic evaluation of fairness using synthetic datasets where real data is limited or inaccessible.

Abstract: As AI becomes prevalent in high-risk domains and decision-making, it is
essential to test for potential harms and biases. This urgency is reflected by
the global emergence of AI regulations that emphasise fairness and adequate
testing, with some mandating independent bias audits. However, procuring the
necessary data for fairness testing remains a significant challenge.
Particularly in industry settings, legal and privacy concerns restrict the
collection of demographic data required to assess group disparities, and
auditors face practical and cultural challenges in gaining access to data.
Further, internal historical datasets are often insufficiently representative
to identify real-world biases. This work focuses on evaluating classifier
fairness when complete datasets including demographics are inaccessible. We
propose leveraging separate overlapping datasets to construct complete
synthetic data that includes demographic information and accurately reflects
the underlying relationships between protected attributes and model features.
We validate the fidelity of the synthetic data by comparing it to real data,
and empirically demonstrate that fairness metrics derived from testing on such
synthetic data are consistent with those obtained from real data. This work,
therefore, offers a path to overcome real-world data scarcity for fairness
testing, enabling independent, model-agnostic evaluation of fairness, and
serving as a viable substitute where real data is limited.

TL;DR: GraphEXT is a novel explainability framework for Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) leveraging cooperative game theory and social externalities, focusing on node interactions and structural changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GNNs often face challenges in explainability due to their 'black-box' nature and the lack of methods addressing intricate node interaction patterns.

Method: GraphEXT uses cooperative game theory by partitioning graph nodes into coalitions and quantifying node importance via Shapley value assessments with externality consideration.

Result: Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets revealed that GraphEXT offers improved fidelity across various GNN architectures compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: GraphEXT enhances explainability in GNN models by effectively considering node interactions and graph structure impacts on predictions.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved outstanding performance across a
wide range of graph-related tasks. However, their "black-box" nature poses
significant challenges to their explainability, and existing methods often fail
to effectively capture the intricate interaction patterns among nodes within
the network. In this work, we propose a novel explainability framework,
GraphEXT, which leverages cooperative game theory and the concept of social
externalities. GraphEXT partitions graph nodes into coalitions, decomposing the
original graph into independent subgraphs. By integrating graph structure as an
externality and incorporating the Shapley value under externalities, GraphEXT
quantifies node importance through their marginal contributions to GNN
predictions as the nodes transition between coalitions. Unlike traditional
Shapley value-based methods that primarily focus on node attributes, our
GraphEXT places greater emphasis on the interactions among nodes and the impact
of structural changes on GNN predictions. Experimental studies on both
synthetic and real-world datasets show that GraphEXT outperforms existing
baseline methods in terms of fidelity across diverse GNN architectures ,
significantly enhancing the explainability of GNN models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes molecular task arithmetic, a novel approach for molecule design that uses negative examples to derive property directions and generates positive molecules by moving in the opposite direction. It improves design diversity and success without requiring positively labeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The inherent scarcity of molecules with desirable properties limits generative molecule design, necessitating an efficient method to overcome this bottleneck.

Method: The approach involves training models on abundant negative examples to learn property directions. Models are then shifted in the opposite direction to generate molecules with the desired properties, enabling zero-shot, dual-objective, and few-shot design tasks.

Result: Molecular task arithmetic successfully generated more diverse and functional molecules compared to models trained on positive examples, across multiple design experiments.

Conclusion: This technique provides a data-efficient and effective method for generative molecule design, establishing molecular task arithmetic as a promising transfer learning strategy for de novo molecule generation.

Abstract: The scarcity of molecules with desirable properties (i.e., 'positive'
molecules) is an inherent bottleneck for generative molecule design. To
sidestep such obstacle, here we propose molecular task arithmetic: training a
model on diverse and abundant negative examples to learn 'property directions'
$--$ without accessing any positively labeled data $--$ and moving models in
the opposite property directions to generate positive molecules. When analyzed
on 20 zero-shot design experiments, molecular task arithmetic generated more
diverse and successful designs than models trained on positive molecules.
Moreover, we employed molecular task arithmetic in dual-objective and few-shot
design tasks. We find that molecular task arithmetic can consistently increase
the diversity of designs while maintaining desirable design properties. With
its simplicity, data efficiency, and performance, molecular task arithmetic
bears the potential to become the $\textit{de-facto}$ transfer learning
strategy for de novo molecule design.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing methods like FNO when handling non-periodic inputs and to improve efficiency for stochastic dynamics modeling.

Method: Built on the Fourier neural operator, MFNO incorporates mirror padding and uses Wong-Zakai theorems alongside approximation techniques for theoretical grounding.

Result: MFNO matches or surpasses baseline models like LSTMs or DeepONet in performance, while enabling faster sample path generation.

Conclusion: MFNO is highly effective for learning stochastic system dynamics with superior resolution generalization and computational efficiency.

Abstract: This paper introduces an operator-based neural network, the mirror-padded
Fourier neural operator (MFNO), designed to learn the dynamics of stochastic
systems. MFNO extends the standard Fourier neural operator (FNO) by
incorporating mirror padding, enabling it to handle non-periodic inputs. We
rigorously prove that MFNOs can approximate solutions of path-dependent
stochastic differential equations and Lipschitz transformations of fractional
Brownian motions to an arbitrary degree of accuracy. Our theoretical analysis
builds on Wong--Zakai type theorems and various approximation techniques.
Empirically, the MFNO exhibits strong resolution generalization--a property
rarely seen in standard architectures such as LSTMs, TCNs, and DeepONet.
Furthermore, our model achieves performance that is comparable or superior to
these baselines while offering significantly faster sample path generation than

*Amrith Setlur,Pratiksha Thaker,Jonathan Ullman*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper analyzes the interaction of public and private data under distribution shifts in differentially private machine learning, showing conditions where either data can or cannot complement the other.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current differentially private machine learning methods often combine private and public data, yet it is unclear when this combination adds complementary value, especially under distribution shifts.

Method: The study extends lower bounds for public-private learning by analyzing Gaussian mean estimation and Gaussian linear regression under scenarios of distribution shift, quantifying its impact on parameter estimation.

Result: When distribution shifts are small, sufficient amounts of either public or private data are needed to estimate private parameters. When shifts are large, public data offers no benefit.

Conclusion: The complementary value of combining public and private data diminishes with large distribution shifts, and small shifts require abundant data from one source.

Abstract: The most effective differentially private machine learning algorithms in
practice rely on an additional source of purportedly public data. This paradigm
is most interesting when the two sources combine to be more than the sum of
their parts. However, there are settings such as mean estimation where we have
strong lower bounds, showing that when the two data sources have the same
distribution, there is no complementary value to combining the two data
sources. In this work we extend the known lower bounds for public-private
learning to setting where the two data sources exhibit significant distribution
shift. Our results apply to both Gaussian mean estimation where the two
distributions have different means, and to Gaussian linear regression where the
two distributions exhibit parameter shift. We find that when the shift is small
(relative to the desired accuracy), either public or private data must be
sufficiently abundant to estimate the private parameter. Conversely, when the
shift is large, public data provides no benefit.

TL;DR: The paper addresses a defense problem for unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) by introducing ARBoids, a reinforcement learning framework that outperforms traditional strategies in intercepting adversaries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of defending against more maneuverable adversarial USVs and improve interception strategies.

Method: Introduces ARBoids, combining deep reinforcement learning (DRL) with a biologically inspired, force-based Boids model. The Boids model provides a baseline policy, while DRL refines defender actions via a residual policy.

Result: ARBoids performed better than traditional interception methods in a simulation and adapted effectively to attackers with various maneuverability capacities.

Conclusion: ARBoids showed robustness, adaptability, and superior interception performance. Its release aims to enhance multi-agent coordination in target defense scenarios.

Abstract: The target defense problem (TDP) for unmanned surface vehicles (USVs)
concerns intercepting an adversarial USV before it breaches a designated target
region, using one or more defending USVs. A particularly challenging scenario
arises when the attacker exhibits superior maneuverability compared to the
defenders, significantly complicating effective interception. To tackle this
challenge, this letter introduces ARBoids, a novel adaptive residual
reinforcement learning framework that integrates deep reinforcement learning
(DRL) with the biologically inspired, force-based Boids model. Within this
framework, the Boids model serves as a computationally efficient baseline
policy for multi-agent coordination, while DRL learns a residual policy to
adaptively refine and optimize the defenders' actions. The proposed approach is
validated in a high-fidelity Gazebo simulation environment, demonstrating
superior performance over traditional interception strategies, including pure
force-based approaches and vanilla DRL policies. Furthermore, the learned
policy exhibits strong adaptability to attackers with diverse maneuverability
profiles, highlighting its robustness and generalization capability. The code
of ARBoids will be released upon acceptance of this letter.

Method: Presents the fundamental concepts of FL and its application to cloud robotic manipulation, analyzing centralized and decentralized FL designs.

Result: Identifies how FL can alleviate computational demands and improve robotic tasks at scale.

Conclusion: FL provides significant advantages for cloud robotic manipulation, but necessitates careful design to overcome associated challenges.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is an emerging distributed machine learning paradigm,
where the collaborative training of a model involves dynamic participation of
devices to achieve broad objectives. In contrast, classical machine learning
(ML) typically requires data to be located on-premises for training, whereas FL
leverages numerous user devices to train a shared global model without the need
to share private data. Current robotic manipulation tasks are constrained by
the individual capabilities and speed of robots due to limited low-latency
computing resources. Consequently, the concept of cloud robotics has emerged,
allowing robotic applications to harness the flexibility and reliability of
computing resources, effectively alleviating their computational demands across
the cloud-edge continuum. Undoubtedly, within this distributed computing
context, as exemplified in cloud robotic manipulation scenarios, FL offers
manifold advantages while also presenting several challenges and opportunities.
In this paper, we present fundamental concepts of FL and their connection to
cloud robotic manipulation. Additionally, we envision the opportunities and
challenges associated with realizing efficient and reliable cloud robotic
manipulation at scale through FL, where researchers adopt to design and verify
FL models in either centralized or decentralized settings.

### [202] [Deep learning-aided inverse design of porous metamaterials](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17907)
*Phu Thien Nguyen,Yousef Heider,Dennis M. Kochmann,Fadi Aldakheel*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper develops a property-variational autoencoder (pVAE) to design porous metamaterials with tailored hydraulic properties such as porosity and permeability, using deep learning and the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) for training datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to reduce computational costs and enable efficient design of porous metamaterials by creating a framework that links microstructure to hydraulic properties, allowing for tailored material design.

Method: A property-variational autoencoder (pVAE) augmented with a regressor is used alongside a convolutional neural network (CNN) trained on synthetic and real datasets. A latent space representation is developed to perform structure-property mapping and interpolation.

Result: The pVAE framework successfully creates a compact, interpretable latent space that enables efficient structure-property exploration, and reduces dependence on computationally expensive LBM simulations.

Conclusion: The proposed framework facilitates the generation of porous metamaterials with specific properties, making it a powerful tool for inverse material design. Open-access datasets and codes are provided to support further research.

Abstract: The ultimate aim of the study is to explore the inverse design of porous
metamaterials using a deep learning-based generative framework. Specifically,
we develop a property-variational autoencoder (pVAE), a variational autoencoder
(VAE) augmented with a regressor, to generate structured metamaterials with
tailored hydraulic properties, such as porosity and permeability. While this
work uses the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) to generate intrinsic permeability
tensor data for limited porous microstructures, a convolutional neural network
(CNN) is trained using a bottom-up approach to predict effective hydraulic
properties. This significantly reduces the computational cost compared to
direct LBM simulations. The pVAE framework is trained on two datasets: a
synthetic dataset of artificial porous microstructures and CT-scan images of
volume elements from real open-cell foams. The encoder-decoder architecture of
the VAE captures key microstructural features, mapping them into a compact and
interpretable latent space for efficient structure-property exploration. The
study provides a detailed analysis and interpretation of the latent space,
demonstrating its role in structure-property mapping, interpolation, and
inverse design. This approach facilitates the generation of new metamaterials
with desired properties. The datasets and codes used in this study will be made
open-access to support further research.

*Charles H Martin,Christopher Hinrichs*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Semi-Empirical Theory of Learning (SETOL) to explain the performance of state-of-the-art neural networks, utilizing statistical mechanics, random matrix theory, and quantum chemistry, and validates its framework through experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to provide a formal explanation for the phenomenological Heavy-Tailed Self-Regularization theory, specifically the heavy-tailed power-law metrics like alpha and alpha-hat, which predict test performance of neural networks without requiring test or training data.

Method: The authors combine techniques from statistical mechanics, random matrix theory, and quantum chemistry to derive the SETOL framework, and validate it on both a simple 3-layer MLP and state-of-the-art neural networks by estimating layer qualities using empirical spectral densities.

Result: The study finds excellent agreement between the theoretical assumptions of SETOL and experimental observations on the MLP model. Furthermore, the HTSR alpha and SETOL ERG metrics align well when applied to SOTA neural networks.

Conclusion: SETOL offers a robust theoretical framework to measure and predict the performance of neural networks using spectral analysis and could guide future neural network training and evaluation methods.

Abstract: We present a SemiEmpirical Theory of Learning (SETOL) that explains the
remarkable performance of State-Of-The-Art (SOTA) Neural Networks (NNs). We
provide a formal explanation of the origin of the fundamental quantities in the
phenomenological theory of Heavy-Tailed Self-Regularization (HTSR): the
heavy-tailed power-law layer quality metrics, alpha and alpha-hat. In prior
work, these metrics have been shown to predict trends in the test accuracies of
pretrained SOTA NN models, importantly, without needing access to either
testing or training data. Our SETOL uses techniques from statistical mechanics
as well as advanced methods from random matrix theory and quantum chemistry.
The derivation suggests new mathematical preconditions for ideal learning,
including a new metric, ERG, which is equivalent to applying a single step of
the Wilson Exact Renormalization Group. We test the assumptions and predictions
of SETOL on a simple 3-layer multilayer perceptron (MLP), demonstrating
excellent agreement with the key theoretical assumptions. For SOTA NN models,
we show how to estimate the individual layer qualities of a trained NN by
simply computing the empirical spectral density (ESD) of the layer weight
matrices and plugging this ESD into our SETOL formulas. Notably, we examine the
performance of the HTSR alpha and the SETOL ERG layer quality metrics, and find
that they align remarkably well, both on our MLP and on SOTA NNs.

### [204] [From Seed to Harvest: Augmenting Human Creativity with AI for Red-teaming Text-to-Image Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17922)
*Jessica Quaye,Charvi Rastogi,Alicia Parrish,Oana Inel,Minsuk Kahng,Lora Aroyo,Vijay Janapa Reddi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Seed2Harvest introduces a hybrid method to expand culturally diverse human-crafted adversarial prompts to stress-test Text-to-Image (T2I) models against adversarial attacks, while balancing human nuances and scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current adversarial prompts used to evaluate T2I models are often small and lack diversity (human-crafted) or are overly synthetic without realistic qualities. Seed2Harvest aims to address these issues by combining human creativity with machine scalability.

Method: Seed2Harvest employs a human-machine hybrid approach to expand human-crafted adversarial prompt seeds while preserving their original characteristics. The expanded dataset features increased cultural diversity and nuanced attack strategies.

Result: The expanded dataset obtained through Seed2Harvest demonstrates high diversity, spanning 535 unique geographic locations compared to 58 in the original dataset, and exhibits increased Shannon entropy (7.48 vs. 5.28). Attack success rates remain comparable to baseline human-crafted prompts.

Conclusion: Human-machine collaboration can enhance the realism and scale of adversarial prompt datasets for T2I model evaluation, ensuring robust and diverse safety testing across multiple vectors.

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models have become prevalent across numerous
applications, making their robust evaluation against adversarial attacks a
critical priority. Continuous access to new and challenging adversarial prompts
across diverse domains is essential for stress-testing these models for
resilience against novel attacks from multiple vectors. Current techniques for
generating such prompts are either entirely authored by humans or synthetically
generated. On the one hand, datasets of human-crafted adversarial prompts are
often too small in size and imbalanced in their cultural and contextual
representation. On the other hand, datasets of synthetically-generated prompts
achieve scale, but typically lack the realistic nuances and creative
adversarial strategies found in human-crafted prompts. To combine the strengths
of both human and machine approaches, we propose Seed2Harvest, a hybrid
red-teaming method for guided expansion of culturally diverse, human-crafted
adversarial prompt seeds. The resulting prompts preserve the characteristics
and attack patterns of human prompts while maintaining comparable average
attack success rates (0.31 NudeNet, 0.36 SD NSFW, 0.12 Q16). Our expanded
dataset achieves substantially higher diversity with 535 unique geographic
locations and a Shannon entropy of 7.48, compared to 58 locations and 5.28
entropy in the original dataset. Our work demonstrates the importance of
human-machine collaboration in leveraging human creativity and machine
computational capacity to achieve comprehensive, scalable red-teaming for
continuous T2I model safety evaluation.

*Hongrong Yang,Markus Schlaepfer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: UrbanPulse is a scalable deep learning framework that predicts city-wide, ultra-fine-grained OD flows by treating each POI as a node, overcoming limitations in current models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitations of existing methods in population flow prediction, such as poor cross-city generalization, computational inefficiencies, and lack of fine-grained resolution.

Method: Combines a temporal graph convolutional encoder with a transformer-based decoder to model spatiotemporal dependencies, complemented by a three-stage transfer learning strategy.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art accuracy and scalability when evaluated on over 103 million GPS records across three California metropolitan areas.

Conclusion: UrbanPulse demonstrates the feasibility of deployable, high-resolution AI-powered urban forecasting by improving accuracy, scalability, and cross-city generalizability.

Abstract: Accurate population flow prediction is essential for urban planning,
transportation management, and public health. Yet existing methods face key
limitations: traditional models rely on static spatial assumptions, deep
learning models struggle with cross-city generalization, and Large Language
Models (LLMs) incur high computational costs while failing to capture spatial
structure. Moreover, many approaches sacrifice resolution by clustering Points
of Interest (POIs) or restricting coverage to subregions, limiting their
utility for city-wide analytics. We introduce UrbanPulse, a scalable deep
learning framework that delivers ultra-fine-grained, city-wide OD flow
predictions by treating each POI as an individual node. It combines a temporal
graph convolutional encoder with a transformer-based decoder to model
multi-scale spatiotemporal dependencies. To ensure robust generalization across
urban contexts, UrbanPulse employs a three-stage transfer learning strategy:
pretraining on large-scale urban graphs, cold-start adaptation, and
reinforcement learning fine-tuning.Evaluated on over 103 million cleaned GPS
records from three metropolitan areas in California, UrbanPulse achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy and scalability. Through efficient transfer learning,
UrbanPulse takes a key step toward making high-resolution, AI-powered urban
forecasting deployable in practice across diverse cities.

### [206] [Multimodal Fine-grained Reasoning for Post Quality Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17934)
*Xiaoxu Guo,Siyan Liang,Yachao Cui,Juxiang Zhou,Lei Wang,Han Cao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces the MFTRR framework to improve post quality assessment using advanced multimodal and relational reasoning, achieving considerable performance gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods inadequately handle post quality assessment due to limitations in leveraging multimodal data, managing noise in fusion, and capturing complex semantic relationships.

Method: The proposed MFTRR framework reframes quality assessment as a ranking task and consists of two modules: Local-Global Semantic Correlation Reasoning for fine-grained interactions and noise reduction and Multi-Level Evidential Relational Reasoning for capturing relational cues.

Result: MFTRR outperforms state-of-the-art methods, showing up to 9.52% improvement in NDCG@3 on datasets such as Art History.

Conclusion: MFTRR's advanced multimodal reasoning and noise-handling techniques establish it as a significantly improved framework for post quality assessment.

Abstract: Accurately assessing post quality requires complex relational reasoning to
capture nuanced topic-post relationships. However, existing studies face three
major limitations: (1) treating the task as unimodal categorization, which
fails to leverage multimodal cues and fine-grained quality distinctions; (2)
introducing noise during deep multimodal fusion, leading to misleading signals;
and (3) lacking the ability to capture complex semantic relationships like
relevance and comprehensiveness. To address these issues, we propose the
Multimodal Fine-grained Topic-post Relational Reasoning (MFTRR) framework,
which mimics human cognitive processes. MFTRR reframes post-quality assessment
as a ranking task and incorporates multimodal data to better capture quality
variations. It consists of two key modules: (1) the Local-Global Semantic
Correlation Reasoning Module, which models fine-grained semantic interactions
between posts and topics at both local and global levels, enhanced by a maximum
information fusion mechanism to suppress noise; and (2) the Multi-Level
Evidential Relational Reasoning Module, which explores macro- and micro-level
relational cues to strengthen evidence-based reasoning. We evaluate MFTRR on
three newly constructed multimodal topic-post datasets and the public
Lazada-Home dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that MFTRR significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving up to 9.52% NDCG@3
improvement over the best unimodal method on the Art History dataset.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: VIBE is a two-stage Transformer model for predicting fMRI activity from multi-modal inputs like video, audio, and text, achieving strong performance on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a model capable of accurately predicting fMRI brain activity from multi-modal information such as video, audio, and text.

Method: VIBE is a two-stage Transformer architecture. The first stage uses a modality-fusion transformer to merge representations from open-source models (e.g., Qwen2.5, BEATs, Whisper). The second stage decodes the temporal information with a prediction transformer incorporating rotary embeddings. The model is trained on 65 hours of multi-modal movie data.

Result: VIBE achieved mean parcel-wise Pearson correlations of 32.25 on in-distribution data (Friends S07) and 21.25 on out-of-distribution data. Earlier iterations of the architecture achieved competitive results in the Algonauts 2025 Challenge.

Conclusion: The results indicate that VIBE is an effective and generalizable model for multi-modal fMRI activity prediction under both in-distribution and out-of-distribution scenarios.

Abstract: We present VIBE, a two-stage Transformer that fuses multi-modal video, audio,
and text features to predict fMRI activity. Representations from open-source
models (Qwen2.5, BEATs, Whisper, SlowFast, V-JEPA) are merged by a
modality-fusion transformer and temporally decoded by a prediction transformer
with rotary embeddings. Trained on 65 hours of movie data from the CNeuroMod
dataset and ensembled across 20 seeds, VIBE attains mean parcel-wise Pearson
correlations of 32.25 on in-distribution Friends S07 and 21.25 on six
out-of-distribution films. An earlier iteration of the same architecture
obtained 0.3198 and 0.2096, respectively, winning Phase-1 and placing second
overall in the Algonauts 2025 Challenge.

*Rui Deng,Ziqi Li,Mingshu Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper improves GeoAggregator (GA), a transformer-based model for geospatial tabular data, optimizing computational efficiency and incorporating better explainability features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modeling and explaining geospatial tabular data is crucial for understanding geospatial phenomena. The study aims to enhance the performance and explainability of the GeoAggregator model, which has already shown superior results compared to other methods.

Method: The authors optimize GA by streamlining its data loading and forward pass processes, improving computational efficiency. They also introduce a model ensembling strategy and use GeoShapley for enhanced explainability.

Result: The improved GA achieves better prediction accuracy and faster inference speed. Explanation experiments confirm that it effectively captures spatial effects.

Conclusion: The improved GA is a more efficient and explainable tool for geospatial data analysis. The implementation is publicly available, contributing to the community.

Abstract: Accurate modeling and explaining geospatial tabular data (GTD) are critical
for understanding geospatial phenomena and their underlying processes. Recent
work has proposed a novel transformer-based deep learning model named
GeoAggregator (GA) for this purpose, and has demonstrated that it outperforms
other statistical and machine learning approaches. In this short paper, we
further improve GA by 1) developing an optimized pipeline that accelerates the
dataloading process and streamlines the forward pass of GA to achieve better
computational efficiency; and 2) incorporating a model ensembling strategy and
a post-hoc model explanation function based on the GeoShapley framework to
enhance model explainability. We validate the functionality and efficiency of
the proposed strategies by applying the improved GA model to synthetic
datasets. Experimental results show that our implementation improves the
prediction accuracy and inference speed of GA compared to the original
implementation. Moreover, explanation experiments indicate that GA can
effectively captures the inherent spatial effects in the designed synthetic
dataset. The complete pipeline has been made publicly available for community
use (https://github.com/ruid7181/GA-sklearn).

*Shubham Mohole,Sainyam Galhotra*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes SIFOTL, a privacy-compliant method for identifying data shifts in tabular datasets, focusing on noise-resilient, interpretable analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of identifying factors behind data shifts in tabular datasets is compounded by limited data access due to privacy restrictions and noise from complex processes, especially in healthcare.

Method: SIFOTL employs a three-step process: (i) extraction of privacy-compliant summary statistics, (ii) twin XGBoost models to isolate intervention signals with LLM assistance, and (iii) a Pareto-weighted decision tree to merge outputs and identify key segments.

Result: The method achieved significant real-world efficacy, including outperforming other analytics methods in identifying Medicare drug subsidy recipients and sustaining high F1 scores (0.86-0.96) across multiple EHR datasets even with noise.

Conclusion: SIFOTL offers a privacy-conscious, interpretable, and empirically robust workflow for analyzing tabular data shifts, particularly under conditions of restricted access and observational noise.

Abstract: Identifying the factors driving data shifts in tabular datasets is a
significant challenge for analysis and decision support systems, especially
those focusing on healthcare. Privacy rules restrict data access, and noise
from complex processes hinders analysis. To address this challenge, we propose
SIFOTL (Statistically-Informed Fidelity-Optimization Method for Tabular
Learning) that (i) extracts privacy-compliant data summary statistics, (ii)
employs twin XGBoost models to disentangle intervention signals from noise with
assistance from LLMs, and (iii) merges XGBoost outputs via a Pareto-weighted
decision tree to identify interpretable segments responsible for the shift.
Unlike existing analyses which may ignore noise or require full data access for
LLM-based analysis, SIFOTL addresses both challenges using only privacy-safe
summary statistics. Demonstrating its real-world efficacy, for a MEPS panel
dataset mimicking a new Medicare drug subsidy, SIFOTL achieves an F1 score of
0.85, substantially outperforming BigQuery Contribution Analysis (F1=0.46) and
statistical tests (F1=0.20) in identifying the segment receiving the subsidy.
Furthermore, across 18 diverse EHR datasets generated based on Synthea ABM,
SIFOTL sustains F1 scores of 0.86-0.96 without noise and >= 0.75 even with
injected observational noise, whereas baseline average F1 scores range from
0.19-0.67 under the same tests. SIFOTL, therefore, provides an interpretable,
privacy-conscious workflow that is empirically robust to observational noise.

TL;DR: This paper proposes Machine Unlearning for traffic state estimation and prediction (TSEP) to address privacy by allowing models to "forget" sensitive, outdated, or poisoned data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Beyond data abundance fueling ML breakthroughs in TSEP, growing concerns about privacy, cybersecurity, and public trust in intelligent transportation systems necessitated addressing the "right to be forgotten".

Method: The study introduces a novel Machine Unlearning paradigm tailored for TSEP, enabling selective data removal from trained models.

Result: The implementation of Machine Unlearning empowers TSEP models to securely forget specified data, aligning with privacy regulations like the "right to be forgotten."

Conclusion: Machine Unlearning strengthens the reliability and trustworthiness of TSEP, addressing privacy concerns effectively within intelligent transportation systems.

Abstract: Data-driven traffic state estimation and prediction (TSEP) relies heavily on
data sources that contain sensitive information. While the abundance of data
has fueled significant breakthroughs, particularly in machine learning-based
methods, it also raises concerns regarding privacy, cybersecurity, and data
freshness. These issues can erode public trust in intelligent transportation
systems. Recently, regulations have introduced the "right to be forgotten",
allowing users to request the removal of their private data from models. As
machine learning models can remember old data, simply removing it from back-end
databases is insufficient in such systems. To address these challenges, this
study introduces a novel learning paradigm for TSEP-Machine Unlearning
TSEP-which enables a trained TSEP model to selectively forget
privacy-sensitive, poisoned, or outdated data. By empowering models to
"unlearn," we aim to enhance the trustworthiness and reliability of data-driven
traffic TSEP.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a predictive framework to optimize fine-tuning large language models using GRPO, identifying phases and proposing earlier stopping to save resources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fine-tuning large language models with GRPO is highly computationally demanding, motivating the need for more resource-efficient approaches.

Method: The framework models training dynamics, derives an empirical scaling law, and identifies phases in training using experiments on Llama and Qwen models.

Result: The study achieved prediction of reward trajectories, identified three phases of training, and demonstrated that early stopping saves computational resources without performance loss.

Conclusion: The approach generalizes across model types, offering a practical guide for efficient fine-tuning in reasoning tasks leveraging GRPO.

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) for reasoning tasks using
reinforcement learning methods like Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)
is computationally expensive. To address this, we propose a predictive
framework that models training dynamics and helps optimize resource usage.
Through experiments on Llama and Qwen models (3B 8B), we derive an empirical
scaling law based on model size, initial performance, and training progress.
This law predicts reward trajectories and identifies three consistent training
phases: slow start, rapid improvement, and plateau. We find that training
beyond certain number of an epoch offers little gain, suggesting earlier
stopping can significantly reduce compute without sacrificing performance. Our
approach generalizes across model types, providing a practical guide for
efficient GRPO-based fine-tuning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Satellite ocean current data lack the spatial resolution necessary for detailed local oceanographic applications like coastal management and maritime safety.

Method: The paper proposes a supervised deep learning framework based on neural operators to solve partial differential equations at any resolution, coupled with downscaling models specifically for ocean current data.

Result: Evaluation shows the framework performs well on real-world Copernicus ocean current data and synthetic datasets such as Navier-Stokes simulations, enabling high-resolution solutions.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively improves the spatial granularity of ocean current modeling, making it valuable for applications needing detailed local analyses.

Abstract: Accurate modeling of physical systems governed by partial differential
equations is a central challenge in scientific computing. In oceanography,
high-resolution current data are critical for coastal management, environmental
monitoring, and maritime safety. However, available satellite products, such as
Copernicus data for sea water velocity at ~0.08 degrees spatial resolution and
global ocean models, often lack the spatial granularity required for detailed
local analyses. In this work, we (a) introduce a supervised deep learning
framework based on neural operators for solving PDEs and providing arbitrary
resolution solutions, and (b) propose downscaling models with an application to
Copernicus ocean current data. Additionally, our method can model surrogate
PDEs and predict solutions at arbitrary resolution, regardless of the input
resolution. We evaluated our model on real-world Copernicus ocean current data
and synthetic Navier-Stokes simulation datasets.

Motivation: The paper seeks to improve reinforcement learning algorithms for training large language models, addressing inefficiencies and instabilities in existing methods like GRPO.

Method: GSPO uses sequence-level importance ratios instead of token-level ones, incorporating sequence-level clipping, rewarding, and optimization strategies.

Result: GSPO outperforms the GRPO algorithm, stabilizes Mixture-of-Experts RL training, and simplifies RL infrastructure design.

Conclusion: GSPO contributes to significant advancements in training large language models, evidenced by improvements in Qwen3 models.

Abstract: This paper introduces Group Sequence Policy Optimization (GSPO), our stable,
efficient, and performant reinforcement learning algorithm for training large
language models. Unlike previous algorithms that adopt token-level importance
ratios, GSPO defines the importance ratio based on sequence likelihood and
performs sequence-level clipping, rewarding, and optimization. We demonstrate
that GSPO achieves superior training efficiency and performance compared to the
GRPO algorithm, notably stabilizes Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) RL training, and
has the potential for simplifying the design of RL infrastructure. These merits
of GSPO have contributed to the remarkable improvements in the latest Qwen3

*Ryusei Fujimoto,Yugo Nakamura,Yutaka Arakawa*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces the C-AAE, a framework combining anonymization and data compression for wearable sensor data, balancing user privacy and activity recognition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the privacy risks posed by wearable accelerometers and gyroscopes, which can be exploited to re-identify users during healthcare data processing.

Method: The proposed approach combines an Anonymizing AutoEncoder (AAE) for suppressing identity cues with Adaptive Differential Pulse-Code Modulation (ADPCM) for further masking identity and compressing data.

Result: C-AAE reduced user re-identification F1 scores by 10-15 points compared to AAE alone, with only a small drop in activity-recognition performance. It also achieved a 75% reduction in data volume.

Conclusion: C-AAE provides an effective solution for achieving the trade-off between privacy protection and utility in wearable sensor-based healthcare applications.

Abstract: Wearable accelerometers and gyroscopes encode fine-grained behavioural
signatures that can be exploited to re-identify users, making privacy
protection essential for healthcare applications. We introduce C-AAE, a
compressive anonymizing autoencoder that marries an Anonymizing AutoEncoder
(AAE) with Adaptive Differential Pulse-Code Modulation (ADPCM). The AAE first
projects raw sensor windows into a latent space that retains activity-relevant
features while suppressing identity cues. ADPCM then differentially encodes
this latent stream, further masking residual identity information and shrinking
the bitrate. Experiments on the MotionSense and PAMAP2 datasets show that C-AAE
cuts user re-identification F1 scores by 10-15 percentage points relative to
AAE alone, while keeping activity-recognition F1 within 5 percentage points of
the unprotected baseline. ADPCM also reduces data volume by roughly 75 %,
easing transmission and storage overheads. These results demonstrate that C-AAE
offers a practical route to balancing privacy and utility in continuous,
sensor-based activity recognition for healthcare.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces Squeeze10-LLM, a framework for ultra low-bit quantization of large language models, achieving superior performance at 1.6 bits per weight.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reducing storage and inference cost of large language models (LLMs) without sacrificing significant performance.

Method: Mixed-precision post-training quantization framework with innovations like PBAR (activation robustness) and FIAS (activation supervision).

Result: Squeeze10-LLM achieves an average of 1.6 bits per weight, improving accuracy from 43% to 56% in zero-shot classification tasks compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: Squeeze10-LLM demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in ultra low-bit quantization while preserving model effectiveness, paving the way for efficient deployment of LLMs.

Abstract: Deploying large language models (LLMs) is challenging due to their massive
parameters and high computational costs. Ultra low-bit quantization can
significantly reduce storage and accelerate inference, but extreme compression
(i.e., mean bit-width <= 2) often leads to severe performance degradation. To
address this, we propose Squeeze10-LLM, effectively "squeezing" 16-bit LLMs'
weights by 10 times. Specifically, Squeeze10-LLM is a staged mixed-precision
post-training quantization (PTQ) framework and achieves an average of 1.6 bits
per weight by quantizing 80% of the weights to 1 bit and 20% to 4 bits. We
introduce Squeeze10LLM with two key innovations: Post-Binarization Activation
Robustness (PBAR) and Full Information Activation Supervision (FIAS). PBAR is a
refined weight significance metric that accounts for the impact of quantization
on activations, improving accuracy in low-bit settings. FIAS is a strategy that
preserves full activation information during quantization to mitigate
cumulative error propagation across layers. Experiments on LLaMA and LLaMA2
show that Squeeze10-LLM achieves state-of-the-art performance for sub-2bit

### [216] [Learning from Hard Labels with Additional Supervision on Non-Hard-Labeled Classes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18098)
*Kosuke Sugiyama,Masato Uchida*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores how additional supervision, like confidence scores for hard labels, can enhance classification accuracy when training data is scarce.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of building accurate classification models with limited training data by leveraging enriched label information.

Method: The authors propose a theoretical framework combining hard labels and additional supervision as probability distributions to refine classification models. They analyze generalization error impacts and roles of the additional supervision and mixing coefficient.

Result: The study finds that the distribution over non-hard-labeled classes is key, and that additional supervision and its mixing coefficient aid in refining soft labels for improved generalization. Experiments validate that this approach enhances classification accuracy.

Conclusion: Additional supervision, alongside appropriate design and mixing approaches, can yield improved classification outcomes, particularly in data-scarce scenarios.

Abstract: In scenarios where training data is limited due to observation costs or data
scarcity, enriching the label information associated with each instance becomes
crucial for building high-accuracy classification models. In such contexts, it
is often feasible to obtain not only hard labels but also {\it additional
supervision}, such as the confidences for the hard labels. This setting
naturally raises fundamental questions: {\it What kinds of additional
supervision are intrinsically beneficial?} And {\it how do they contribute to
improved generalization performance?} To address these questions, we propose a
theoretical framework that treats both hard labels and additional supervision
as probability distributions, and constructs soft labels through their affine
combination. Our theoretical analysis reveals that the essential component of
additional supervision is not the confidence score of the assigned hard label,
but rather the information of the distribution over the non-hard-labeled
classes. Moreover, we demonstrate that the additional supervision and the
mixing coefficient contribute to the refinement of soft labels in complementary
roles. Intuitively, in the probability simplex, the additional supervision
determines the direction in which the deterministic distribution representing
the hard label should be adjusted toward the true label distribution, while the
mixing coefficient controls the step size along that direction. Through
generalization error analysis, we theoretically characterize how the additional
supervision and its mixing coefficient affect both the convergence rate and
asymptotic value of the error bound. Finally, we experimentally demonstrate
that, based on our theory, designing additional supervision can lead to
improved classification accuracy, even when utilized in a simple manner.

*Peyman Tehrani,Anas Alsoliman*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses radio access network (RAN) slicing in O-RAN architecture by proposing a Percentile-based Delay-Aware Deep Reinforcement Learning (PDA-DRL) approach, achieving significant delay reduction and robust personalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficient radio resource management in O-RAN architecture is critical, especially when multiple MVNOs compete for limited physical resource blocks (PRBs) while seeking to meet delay constraints and minimize resource usage.

Method: The authors developed a reward function based on the law of large numbers and refined it for real-world applicability. They introduced PDA-DRL, outperforming existing DRL models, and proposed a reward-based personalization method for sharing model weights among MVNOs.

Result: PDA-DRL achieved a 38% reduction in average delay compared to baselines. The reward-based personalization outperformed federated averaging and other strategies by better prioritizing model weight sharing among MVNOs.

Conclusion: PDA-DRL effectively addresses delay challenges in an O-RAN setting, and the reward-based personalization technique fosters superior collaboration among MVNOs, making it a promising approach for RAN slicing.

Abstract: In this paper, we tackle the challenge of radio access network (RAN) slicing
within an open RAN (O-RAN) architecture. Our focus centers on a network that
includes multiple mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs) competing for
physical resource blocks (PRBs) with the goal of meeting probabilistic delay
upper bound constraints for their clients while minimizing PRB utilization.
Initially, we derive a reward function based on the law of large numbers (LLN),
then implement practical modifications to adapt it for real-world experimental
scenarios. We then propose our solution, the Percentile-based Delay-Aware Deep
Reinforcement Learning (PDA-DRL), which demonstrates its superiority over
several baselines, including DRL models optimized for average delay
constraints, by achieving a 38\% reduction in resultant average delay.
Furthermore, we delve into the issue of model weight sharing among multiple
MVNOs to develop a robust personalized model. We introduce a reward-based
personalization method where each agent prioritizes other agents' model weights
based on their performance. This technique surpasses traditional aggregation
methods, such as federated averaging, and strategies reliant on traffic
patterns and model weight distance similarities.

*Junyong Jiang,Buwei Tian,Chenxing Xu,Songze Li,Lu Dong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel attack strategy to mislead reinforcement learning systems using adversarial rewards, generated by large language models (LLMs), without changing the environment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing reinforcement learning systems are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, but current methodologies modify the environment or policy, limiting their real-world applicability.

Method: The authors develop a reward iteration optimization framework that uses LLMs to craft adversarial rewards tailored to exploit vulnerabilities in a target agent. A critical state identification algorithm is also introduced to locate sensitive states of the target agent.

Result: Experimental evaluation across multiple environments reveals that the proposed adversarial attack method outperforms existing techniques in degrading the target agent's performance.

Conclusion: The study successfully demonstrates the potential of using adversarial rewards and critical state identification to mislead RL systems, offering practical insights into vulnerabilities without modifying the environment.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has achieved remarkable success in fields like
robotics and autonomous driving, but adversarial attacks designed to mislead RL
systems remain challenging. Existing approaches often rely on modifying the
environment or policy, limiting their practicality. This paper proposes an
adversarial attack method in which existing agents in the environment guide the
target policy to output suboptimal actions without altering the environment. We
propose a reward iteration optimization framework that leverages large language
models (LLMs) to generate adversarial rewards explicitly tailored to the
vulnerabilities of the target agent, thereby enhancing the effectiveness of
inducing the target agent toward suboptimal decision-making. Additionally, a
critical state identification algorithm is designed to pinpoint the target
agent's most vulnerable states, where suboptimal behavior from the victim leads
to significant degradation in overall performance. Experimental results in
diverse environments demonstrate the superiority of our method over existing
approaches.

*Matthias Otth,Jonas Hübotter,Ido Hakimi,Andreas Krause*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper explores using language models' self-confidence to enhance mathematical reasoning tasks, achieving notable performance gains through a method called 'prefix-confidence scaling.'


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to investigate how language models can self-improve for mathematical reasoning tasks by leveraging their own confidence instead of external feedback or reward signals.

Method: Test-time scaling experiments were conducted where models used 'prefix-confidence' to select and continue the most promising solution attempts across five mathematical reasoning datasets.

Result: Significant performance improvements were observed with prefix-confidence scaling, outperforming traditional majority voting and showing fewer biases. However, test-time training with prefix-confidence showed inferior results compared to this scaling method.

Conclusion: Prefix-confidence scaling is an effective approach for improving language model performance on mathematical tasks, but test-time training is not as effective in this context.

Abstract: Recent work has shown that language models can self-improve by maximizing
their own confidence in their predictions, without relying on external
verifiers or reward signals. In this work, we study the test-time scaling of
language models for mathematical reasoning tasks, where the model's own
confidence is used to select the most promising attempts. Surprisingly, we find
that we can achieve significant performance gains by continuing only the most
promising attempt, selected by the model's prefix-confidence. We systematically
evaluate prefix-confidence scaling on five mathematical reasoning datasets: the
school-level GSM8K and MATH500, and the competition-level AMC23, AIME24, and
AIME25. We find that prefix-confidence scaling with prefixes of only 32 tokens
achieves a better accuracy-compute trade-off than majority voting. Moreover,
prefix-confidence scaling appears less susceptible than BoN to length biases.
Finally, we also evaluate test-time training with prefix-confidence and find
that, while outperforming the base model, it does not improve over
prefix-confidence scaling.

### [221] [When Noisy Labels Meet Class Imbalance on Graphs: A Graph Augmentation Method with LLM and Pseudo Label](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18153)
*Riting Xia,Rucong Wang,Yulin Liu,Anchen Li,Xueyan Liu,Yan Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents GraphALP, a novel framework addressing class imbalance and noisy labels in graph node classification using techniques like LLM-based augmentation and pseudo-labeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Class-imbalanced graph node classification is common in real-world scenarios, but existing methods often assume clean labels. This research aims to address the challenges when labels are noisy.

Method: GraphALP combines LLM-based oversampling to generate synthetic minority nodes and dynamically weighted pseudo-labeling to improve label accuracy. Additional mechanisms address class distribution skew from pseudo labels.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate that GraphALP outperforms state-of-the-art solutions on graphs that have both class imbalance and noisy labels, yielding superior classification outcomes.

Conclusion: The framework effectively tackles both class imbalance and label noise challenges in graph node classification, providing a robust solution for real-world graph datasets.

Abstract: Class-imbalanced graph node classification is a practical yet underexplored
research problem. Although recent studies have attempted to address this issue,
they typically assume clean and reliable labels when processing
class-imbalanced graphs. This assumption often violates the nature of
real-world graphs, where labels frequently contain noise. Given this gap, this
paper systematically investigates robust node classification for
class-imbalanced graphs with noisy labels. We propose GraphALP, a novel Graph
Augmentation framework based on Large language models (LLMs) and
Pseudo-labeling techniques. Specifically, we design an LLM-based oversampling
method to generate synthetic minority nodes, producing label-accurate minority
nodes to alleviate class imbalance. Based on the class-balanced graphs, we
develop a dynamically weighted pseudo-labeling method to obtain high-confidence
pseudo labels to reduce label noise ratio. Additionally, we implement a
secondary LLM-guided oversampling mechanism to mitigate potential class
distribution skew caused by pseudo labels. Experimental results show that
GraphALP achieves superior performance over state-of-the-art methods on
class-imbalanced graphs with noisy labels.

*Jianchao Wang,Qingfeng Li,Pengcheng Zheng,Xiaorong Pu,Yazhou Ren*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces ChronoSelect, a framework addressing noisy labels in deep neural networks by leveraging temporal learning dynamics for enhanced generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to tackle the issue of noisy labels in training deep neural networks, which significantly reduces generalization performance.

Method: ChronoSelect employs a four-stage memory architecture and a sliding update mechanism to analyze temporal prediction history, enabling a three-way sample partitioning strategy.

Result: Experiments show ChronoSelect achieves state-of-the-art performance on both synthetic and real-world datasets, and theoretical guarantees validate its effectiveness.

Conclusion: ChronoSelect successfully mitigates the effects of noisy labels, improving learning dynamics and overall model performance.

Abstract: Training deep neural networks on real-world datasets is often hampered by the
presence of noisy labels, which can be memorized by over-parameterized models,
leading to significant degradation in generalization performance. While
existing methods for learning with noisy labels (LNL) have made considerable
progress, they fundamentally suffer from static snapshot evaluations and fail
to leverage the rich temporal dynamics of learning evolution. In this paper, we
propose ChronoSelect (chrono denoting its temporal nature), a novel framework
featuring an innovative four-stage memory architecture that compresses
prediction history into compact temporal distributions. Our unique sliding
update mechanism with controlled decay maintains only four dynamic memory units
per sample, progressively emphasizing recent patterns while retaining essential
historical knowledge. This enables precise three-way sample partitioning into
clean, boundary, and noisy subsets through temporal trajectory analysis and
dual-branch consistency. Theoretical guarantees prove the mechanism's
convergence and stability under noisy conditions. Extensive experiments
demonstrate ChronoSelect's state-of-the-art performance across synthetic and
real-world benchmarks.

*Daniel Grimm,Ahmed Abouelazm,J. Marius Zöllner*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based method to improve trajectory prediction for autonomous driving by addressing generalization issues across unseen datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous driving requires reliable environment understanding, yet current trajectory prediction models struggle to generalize to unseen areas, presenting a challenge for full autonomy.

Method: The proposed method uses a heterogeneous graph combining traffic participants and vectorized road networks to improve trajectory prediction using a multi-staged goal classification process.

Result: The model's effectiveness was demonstrated through cross-dataset evaluation — training on Argoverse2 and testing on NuScenes — showing improved generalization.

Conclusion: The approach enhances trajectory prediction generalization, addressing a critical problem for deploying autonomous driving systems in new environments.

Abstract: To achieve full autonomous driving, a good understanding of the surrounding
environment is necessary. Especially predicting the future states of other
traffic participants imposes a non-trivial challenge. Current SotA-models
already show promising results when trained on real datasets (e.g. Argoverse2,
NuScenes). Problems arise when these models are deployed to new/unseen areas.
Typically, performance drops significantly, indicating that the models lack
generalization. In this work, we introduce a new Graph Neural Network (GNN)
that utilizes a heterogeneous graph consisting of traffic participants and
vectorized road network. Latter, is used to classify goals, i.e. endpoints of
the predicted trajectories, in a multi-staged approach, leading to a better
generalization to unseen scenarios. We show the effectiveness of the goal
selection process via cross-dataset evaluation, i.e. training on Argoverse2 and
evaluating on NuScenes.

*Zhongzheng Yuan,Lianshuai Guo,Xunkai Li,Yinlin Zhu,Wenyu Wang,Meixia Qu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes FedSA-GCL, a semi-asynchronous federated graph learning framework, addressing inefficiencies of synchronous communication and limitations of asynchronous methods in graph data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing FGL methods use synchronous communication, which is inefficient, while current asynchronous methods fail to address graph-specific challenges like semantic drift and topological inconsistencies.

Method: The paper introduces FedSA-GCL, leveraging label distribution divergence, graph topology, and a ClusterCast mechanism for efficient semi-asynchronous training.

Result: FedSA-GCL shows improvements over 9 baselines, achieving average performance gains of 2.92% and 3.4% with Louvain and Metis split algorithms, respectively.

Conclusion: FedSA-GCL is robust and efficient for federated graph learning, effectively addressing synchronization challenges and graph data uniqueness to outperform existing methods.

Abstract: Federated Graph Learning (FGL) is a distributed learning paradigm that
enables collaborative training over large-scale subgraphs located on multiple
local systems. However, most existing FGL approaches rely on synchronous
communication, which leads to inefficiencies and is often impractical in
real-world deployments. Meanwhile, current asynchronous federated learning
(AFL) methods are primarily designed for conventional tasks such as image
classification and natural language processing, without accounting for the
unique topological properties of graph data. Directly applying these methods to
graph learning can possibly result in semantic drift and representational
inconsistency in the global model. To address these challenges, we propose
FedSA-GCL, a semi-asynchronous federated framework that leverages both
inter-client label distribution divergence and graph topological
characteristics through a novel ClusterCast mechanism for efficient training.
We evaluate FedSA-GCL on multiple real-world graph datasets using the Louvain
and Metis split algorithms, and compare it against 9 baselines. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method achieves strong robustness and
outstanding efficiency, outperforming the baselines by an average of 2.92% with
the Louvain and by 3.4% with the Metis.

TL;DR: The study introduces SINDy with Library Optimization Mechanism (SINDy-LOM) to improve model accuracy by combining sparse regression and library optimization for nonlinear dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of designing an appropriate library for sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy), which complicates the discovery of governing equations.

Method: Proposes a two-layer optimization framework where candidate basis functions are parametrized. The inner layer extracts the sparse model, and the outer layer optimizes basis functions based on recursive long-term (RLT) prediction accuracy.

Result: The SINDy-LOM method provides a parsimonious, reliable, and interpretable model while reducing user effort compared to traditional SINDy approaches. Effectiveness tested on a diesel engine airpath system.

Conclusion: The proposed SINDy-LOM approach improves reliability in modeling nonlinear systems, thanks to its RLT perspective and library optimization features.

Abstract: The sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) approach can discover
the governing equations of dynamical systems based on measurement data, where
the dynamical model is identified as the sparse linear combination of the given
basis functions. A major challenge in SINDy is the design of a library, which
is a set of candidate basis functions, as the appropriate library is not
trivial for many dynamical systems. To overcome this difficulty, this study
proposes SINDy with library optimization mechanism (SINDy-LOM), which is a
combination of the sparse regression technique and the novel learning strategy
of the library. In the proposed approach, the basis functions are parametrized.
The SINDy-LOM approach involves a two-layer optimization architecture: the
inner-layer, in which the data-driven model is extracted as the sparse linear
combination of the candidate basis functions, and the outer-layer, in which the
basis functions are optimized from the viewpoint of the recursive long-term
(RLT) prediction accuracy; thus, the library design is reformulated as the
optimization of the parametrized basis functions. The resulting SINDy-LOM model
has good interpretability and usability, as the proposed approach yields the
parsimonious model. The library optimization mechanism significantly reduces
user burden. The RLT perspective improves the reliability of the resulting
model compared with the traditional SINDy approach that can only ensure the
one-step-ahead prediction accuracy. The validity of the proposed approach is
demonstrated by applying it to a diesel engine airpath system, which is a
well-known complex industrial system.

Motivation: Totally corrective boosting methods, while theoretically compelling, have not been empirically explored in depth, prompting a need to evaluate their practical viability and performance.

Method: The authors experimentally evaluate six linear programming-based boosting formulations (including two novel ones) on 20 diverse datasets, analyzing various metrics like accuracy, sparsity, margin distribution, and hyperparameter sensitivity.

Result: Totally corrective boosting methods rival state-of-the-art heuristics such as XGBoost and LightGBM in accuracy (using shallow trees) while creating sparser ensembles. They can also successfully compress pre-trained ensembles without loss in performance.

Conclusion: Totally corrective methods have strengths like sparsity and competitive performance but also limitations, particularly when leveraging optimal decision trees, making them promising yet specialized tools.

Abstract: Despite their theoretical appeal, totally corrective boosting methods based
on linear programming have received limited empirical attention. In this paper,
we conduct the first large-scale experimental study of six LP-based boosting
formulations, including two novel methods, NM-Boost and QRLP-Boost, across 20
diverse datasets. We evaluate the use of both heuristic and optimal base
learners within these formulations, and analyze not only accuracy, but also
ensemble sparsity, margin distribution, anytime performance, and hyperparameter
sensitivity. We show that totally corrective methods can outperform or match
state-of-the-art heuristics like XGBoost and LightGBM when using shallow trees,
while producing significantly sparser ensembles. We further show that these
methods can thin pre-trained ensembles without sacrificing performance, and we
highlight both the strengths and limitations of using optimal decision trees in
this context.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Predictive process monitoring often struggles with limited variability and size of real-world event logs, which hampers the performance of deep learning approaches.

Method: The proposed SiamSA-PPM framework integrates Siamese learning and statistical augmentation. It uses three statistically-based transformation methods to generate semantically valid trace variants and learn robust prefix representations without labeled supervision.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that SiamSA-PPM achieves competitive or better results compared to state-of-the-art methods for predicting next activities and final outcomes. Statistical augmentation enhances data variability and outperforms random transformations.

Conclusion: The SiamSA-PPM framework is effective for enriching training data in predictive process monitoring, improving representation learning, and advancing process prediction tasks.

Abstract: Predictive Process Monitoring (PPM) enables forecasting future events or
outcomes of ongoing business process instances based on event logs. However,
deep learning PPM approaches are often limited by the low variability and small
size of real-world event logs. To address this, we introduce SiamSA-PPM, a
novel self-supervised learning framework that combines Siamese learning with
Statistical Augmentation for Predictive Process Monitoring. It employs three
novel statistically grounded transformation methods that leverage control-flow
semantics and frequent behavioral patterns to generate realistic, semantically
valid new trace variants. These augmented views are used within a Siamese
learning setup to learn generalizable representations of process prefixes
without the need for labeled supervision. Extensive experiments on real-life
event logs demonstrate that SiamSA-PPM achieves competitive or superior
performance compared to the SOTA in both next activity and final outcome
prediction tasks. Our results further show that statistical augmentation
significantly outperforms random transformations and improves variability in
the data, highlighting SiamSA-PPM as a promising direction for training data
enrichment in process prediction.

TL;DR: An algorithm using differentiable physics and other techniques reduces grid size in numerical simulations while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Numerical simulations are computationally expensive, and there is a need to reduce problem size without compromising accuracy.

Method: The authors use k-means clustering, autodifferentiation, and stochastic minimization algorithms to coarsen unstructured grids.

Result: The proposed method reduces grid points by up to 10 times while preserving key variable dynamics in select test cases (e.g., flow in porous media, wave equations).

Conclusion: The algorithm is effective for reducing complexity in PDE-based systems, showing potential for broader applications in evolutionary PDE simulations.

Abstract: Due to the high computational load of modern numerical simulation, there is a
demand for approaches that would reduce the size of discrete problems while
keeping the accuracy reasonable. In this work, we present an original algorithm
to coarsen an unstructured grid based on the concepts of differentiable
physics. We achieve this by employing k-means clustering, autodifferentiation
and stochastic minimization algorithms. We demonstrate performance of the
designed algorithm on two PDEs: a linear parabolic equation which governs
slightly compressible fluid flow in porous media and the wave equation. Our
results show that in the considered scenarios, we reduced the number of grid
points up to 10 times while preserving the modeled variable dynamics in the
points of interest. The proposed approach can be applied to the simulation of
an arbitrary system described by evolutionary partial differential equations.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses security regression in continual learning-based malware detection, proposing a regression-aware approach to reduce risks without compromising detection performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Malware evolves rapidly, and retraining ML detectors on large datasets is impractical. Security regression, where previously detected malware evades detection post-update, undermines trust and poses significant risks.

Method: A regression-aware penalty approach is proposed, adapting Positive Congruent Training (PCT) to continual learning settings to preserve prior predictive behavior effectively.

Result: Experiments on multiple datasets (ELSA, Tesseract, and AZ-Class) demonstrate reduced security regression with maintained detection performance across continual learning scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed regression-aware method improves reliability and user trust in machine learning-based malware detection, enabling scalable and secure updates over time.

Abstract: Malware evolves rapidly, forcing machine learning (ML)-based detectors to
adapt continuously. With antivirus vendors processing hundreds of thousands of
new samples daily, datasets can grow to billions of examples, making full
retraining impractical. Continual learning (CL) has emerged as a scalable
alternative, enabling incremental updates without full data access while
mitigating catastrophic forgetting. In this work, we analyze a critical yet
overlooked issue in this context: security regression. Unlike forgetting, which
manifests as a general performance drop on previously seen data, security
regression captures harmful prediction changes at the sample level, such as a
malware sample that was once correctly detected but evades detection after a
model update. Although often overlooked, regressions pose serious risks in
security-critical applications, as the silent reintroduction of previously
detected threats in the system may undermine users' trust in the whole updating
process. To address this issue, we formalize and quantify security regression
in CL-based malware detectors and propose a regression-aware penalty to
mitigate it. Specifically, we adapt Positive Congruent Training (PCT) to the CL
setting, preserving prior predictive behavior in a model-agnostic manner.
Experiments on the ELSA, Tesseract, and AZ-Class datasets show that our method
effectively reduces regression across different CL scenarios while maintaining
strong detection performance over time.

TL;DR: This paper introduces TIDSIT, a novel machine learning model for battery health monitoring, specifically addressing irregular time-series issues, and showcasing superior performance in predicting State of Health (SoH) for batteries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Increasing adoption of batteries in vehicles and storage systems necessitates accurate health monitoring due to degradation affecting efficiency and safety.

Method: Proposes the TIDSIT model, incorporating continuous time embeddings and temporal attention mechanisms to process irregular, variable-length sequences without informational loss.

Result: In experiments with the NASA battery degradation dataset, TIDSIT demonstrated over 50% reduction in prediction error and achieved a prediction error below 0.58%.

Conclusion: TIDSIT provides an effective tool for battery health monitoring, surpassing existing models, and offers generalizability for other irregular time-series monitoring applications.

Abstract: The rapid adoption of battery-powered vehicles and energy storage systems
over the past decade has made battery health monitoring increasingly critical.
Batteries play a central role in the efficiency and safety of these systems,
yet they inevitably degrade over time due to repeated charge-discharge cycles.
This degradation leads to reduced energy efficiency and potential overheating,
posing significant safety concerns. Accurate estimation of a State of Health
(SoH) of battery is therefore essential for ensuring operational reliability
and safety. Several machine learning architectures, such as LSTMs,
transformers, and encoder-based models, have been proposed to estimate SoH from
discharge cycle data. However, these models struggle with the irregularities
inherent in real-world measurements: discharge readings are often recorded at
non-uniform intervals, and the lengths of discharge cycles vary significantly.
To address this, most existing approaches extract features from the sequences
rather than processing them in full, which introduces information loss and
compromises accuracy. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel
architecture: Time-Informed Dynamic Sequence Inverted Transformer (TIDSIT).
TIDSIT incorporates continuous time embeddings to effectively represent
irregularly sampled data and utilizes padded sequences with temporal attention
mechanisms to manage variable-length inputs without discarding sequence
information. Experimental results on the NASA battery degradation dataset show
that TIDSIT significantly outperforms existing models, achieving over 50%
reduction in prediction error and maintaining an SoH prediction error below
0.58%. Furthermore, the architecture is generalizable and holds promise for
broader applications in health monitoring tasks involving irregular time-series
data.

*Kale-ab Abebe Tessera,Leonard Hinckeldey,Riccardo Zamboni,David Abel,Amos Storkey*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper critiques current MARL methods for relying on brittle learning conventions instead of robust, observation-grounded behaviors and proposes improvements in environment design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To identify weaknesses in current MARL approaches, specifically their reliance on brittle conventions that don't generalize well, and to suggest stronger benchmarking methods.

Method: A case study showcasing the failure of current MARL algorithms to handle non-adaptive agents, and an analysis of limitations in current Dec-POMDP environments.

Result: Identified that conventional MARL benchmarks fail to test core Dec-POMDP principles effectively, and discovered that learning failures arise from benchmark design rather than model limitations.

Conclusion: New cooperative environments should emphasize observation-grounded behaviors and memory-based reasoning to ensure robust and transferable MARL policies.

Abstract: Cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is typically formalised
as a Decentralised Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (Dec-POMDP),
where agents must reason about the environment and other agents' behaviour. In
practice, current model-free MARL algorithms use simple recurrent function
approximators to address the challenge of reasoning about others using partial
information. In this position paper, we argue that the empirical success of
these methods is not due to effective Markov signal recovery, but rather to
learning simple conventions that bypass environment observations and memory.
Through a targeted case study, we show that co-adapting agents can learn
brittle conventions, which then fail when partnered with non-adaptive agents.
Crucially, the same models can learn grounded policies when the task design
necessitates it, revealing that the issue is not a fundamental limitation of
the learning models but a failure of the benchmark design. Our analysis also
suggests that modern MARL environments may not adequately test the core
assumptions of Dec-POMDPs. We therefore advocate for new cooperative
environments built upon two core principles: (1) behaviours grounded in
observations and (2) memory-based reasoning about other agents, ensuring
success requires genuine skill rather than fragile, co-adapted agreements.

### [232] [Low-rank adaptive physics-informed HyperDeepONets for solving differential equations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18346)
*Etienne Zeudong,Elsa Cardoso-Bihlo,Alex Bihlo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HyperDeepONets improve operator learning expressivity but are resource-intensive. PI-LoRA-HyperDeepONets reduce complexity with low-rank adaptation, achieving better accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving operator learning architectures while addressing the computational and memory demands of traditional HyperDeepONets.

Method: Introduce PI-LoRA-HyperDeepONets, using low-rank adaptation to decompose weight matrices in the hypernetwork's output layer, reducing trainable parameters and enhancing efficiency.

Result: PI-LoRA-HyperDeepONets achieve up to a 70% reduction in parameters and consistently outperform HyperDeepONets in predictive accuracy and generalization.

Conclusion: PI-LoRA-HyperDeepONets combine efficiency and improved predictive capabilities, offering a scalable solution in physics-informed machine learning.

Abstract: HyperDeepONets were introduced in Lee, Cho and Hwang [ICLR, 2023] as an
alternative architecture for operator learning, in which a hypernetwork
generates the weights for the trunk net of a DeepONet. While this improves
expressivity, it incurs high memory and computational costs due to the large
number of output parameters required. In this work we introduce, in the
physics-informed machine learning setting, a variation, PI-LoRA-HyperDeepONets,
which leverage low-rank adaptation (LoRA) to reduce complexity by decomposing
the hypernetwork's output layer weight matrix into two smaller low-rank
matrices. This reduces the number of trainable parameters while introducing an
extra regularization of the trunk networks' weights. Through extensive
experiments on both ordinary and partial differential equations we show that
PI-LoRA-HyperDeepONets achieve up to 70\% reduction in parameters and
consistently outperform regular HyperDeepONets in terms of predictive accuracy
and generalization.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper reviews the application of diffusion models in agriculture, emphasizing their superiority in tasks like pest detection and image processing compared to GANs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the challenges of a growing global population, scarce arable land, and the need for advanced technologies in smart agriculture.

Method: The study reviews and evaluates diffusion models applications, particularly in crop monitoring, pest detection, remote sensing, and data augmentation.

Result: Diffusion models improve accuracy, robustness, and provide enhanced training stability in agricultural image processing and augmentation compared to traditional methods.

Conclusion: Despite challenges in computational efficiency, diffusion models are expected to significantly benefit sustainable smart agriculture in the future.

Abstract: With the global population growing and arable land resources becoming
increasingly scarce,smart agriculture and precision agriculture have emerged as
key directions for the future ofagricultural development.Artificial
intelligence (AI) technologies, particularly deep learning models, have found
widespread applications in areas such as crop monitoring and pest detection. As
an emerging generative model, diffusion models have shown significant promise
in tasks like agricultural image processing, data augmentation, and remote
sensing. Compared to traditional generative adversarial networks (GANs),
diffusion models offer superior training stability and generation quality,
effectively addressing challenges such as limited agricultural data and
imbalanced image samples. This paper reviews the latest advancements in the
application of diffusion models in agriculture, focusing on their potential in
crop pest and disease detection, remote sensing image enhancement, crop growth
prediction, and agricultural resource management. Experimental results
demonstrate that diffusion models significantly improve model accuracy and
robustness in data augmentation, image generation, and denoising, especially in
complex environments. Despite challenges related to computational efficiency
and generalization capabilities, diffusion models are expected to play an
increasingly important role in smart and precision agriculture as technology
advances, providing substantial support for the sustainable development of
global agriculture.

### [234] [Multi-Model Ensemble and Reservoir Computing for River Discharge Prediction in Ungauged Basins](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18423)
*Mizuki Funato,Yohei Sawada*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces HYPER, a computationally efficient and accurate hydrological prediction method using ensemble modeling and reservoir computing, particularly effective in data-scarce regions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many regions lack sufficient river discharge observations, hindering accurate flood prediction and water management under data-scarce conditions.

Method: The HYPER method combines Bayesian model averaging on 43 conceptual hydrological models with reservoir computing for error correction. It generalizes for ungauged basins by linking weights to catchment attributes.

Result: HYPER achieved comparable performance to LSTM in data-rich environments with only 5% of the computational cost. It outperformed LSTM in data-scarce scenarios, maintaining robustness and low uncertainty.

Conclusion: HYPER is robust, efficient, and generalizable for discharge prediction, especially in ungauged basins, addressing the challenges of limited river discharge observations.

Abstract: Despite the critical need for accurate flood prediction and water management,
many regions lack sufficient river discharge observations, limiting the skill
of rainfall-runoff analyses. Although numerous physically based and machine
learning models exist, achieving high accuracy, interpretability, and
computational efficiency under data-scarce conditions remains a major
challenge. We address this challenge with a novel method, HYdrological
Prediction with multi-model Ensemble and Reservoir computing (HYPER) that
leverages multi-model ensemble and reservoir computing (RC). Our approach first
applies Bayesian model averaging (BMA) to 43 "uncalibrated" catchment-based
conceptual hydrological models. An RC model is then trained via linear
regression to correct errors in the BMA output, a non-iterative process that
ensures high computational efficiency. For ungauged basins, we infer the
required BMA and RC weights by linking them to catchment attributes from gauged
basins, creating a generalizable framework. We evaluated HYPER using data from
87 river basins in Japan. In a data-rich scenario, HYPER (median Kling-Gupta
Efficiency, KGE, of 0.56) performed comparably to a benchmark LSTM (KGE 0.55)
but required only 5% of its computational time. In a data-scarce scenario (23%
of basins gauged), HYPER maintained robust performance (KGE 0.55) and lower
uncertainty, whereas the LSTM's performance degraded significantly (KGE -0.04).
These results reveal that individual conceptual hydrological models do not
necessarily need to be calibrated when an effectively large ensemble is
assembled and combined with machine-learning-based bias correction. HYPER
provides a robust, efficient, and generalizable solution for discharge
prediction, particularly in ungauged basins, making it applicable to a wide
range of regions.

*Leiji Zhang,Zeyu Wang,Xin Li,Yao-Hui Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a revised bisimulation metric for reinforcement learning, addressing issues in conventional metrics and improving their application through adaptive coefficients.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There are limitations in conventional bisimulation metrics: an inability to represent specific scenarios and reliance on static weights.

Method: The authors introduce a revised bisimulation metric with a refined reward gap definition and adaptive update operators, supported by theoretical guarantees.

Result: Experiments on DeepMind Control and Meta-World benchmarks showcase improved representation and effectiveness in reinforcement learning tasks.

Conclusion: The revised metric offers better representation distinctiveness and adaptability, enhancing its control-related learning performance.

Abstract: Bisimulation metric has long been regarded as an effective control-related
representation learning technique in various reinforcement learning tasks.
However, in this paper, we identify two main issues with the conventional
bisimulation metric: 1) an inability to represent certain distinctive
scenarios, and 2) a reliance on predefined weights for differences in rewards
and subsequent states during recursive updates. We find that the first issue
arises from an imprecise definition of the reward gap, whereas the second issue
stems from overlooking the varying importance of reward difference and
next-state distinctions across different training stages and task settings. To
address these issues, by introducing a measure for state-action pairs, we
propose a revised bisimulation metric that features a more precise definition
of reward gap and novel update operators with adaptive coefficient. We also
offer theoretical guarantees of convergence for our proposed metric and its
improved representation distinctiveness. In addition to our rigorous
theoretical analysis, we conduct extensive experiments on two representative
benchmarks, DeepMind Control and Meta-World, demonstrating the effectiveness of
our approach.

*Zhongtian Sun,Anoushka Harit,Alexandra Cristea,Christl A. Donnelly,Pietro Liò*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces GLANCE, a novel graph neural network framework designed to improve learning on heterophilous graphs by combining logic-based reasoning, dynamic refinement, and clustering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve the performance of Graph Neural Networks on heterophilous graphs where traditional models struggle due to basic neighbor aggregation and lack of higher-order patterns incorporation.

Method: GLANCE integrates a logic-guided reasoning layer for embeddings, multi-head attention for edge pruning to denoise graph structures, and clustering to understand global patterns.

Result: GLANCE demonstrates competitive and robust performance on benchmark heterophilous graph datasets (Cornell, Texas, Wisconsin).

Conclusion: GLANCE is a lightweight, adaptable, and interpretable framework that effectively addresses the challenges of heterophilous graphs.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated significant success in
learning from graph-structured data but often struggle on heterophilous graphs,
where connected nodes differ in features or class labels. This limitation
arises from indiscriminate neighbor aggregation and insufficient incorporation
of higher-order structural patterns. To address these challenges, we propose
GLANCE (Graph Logic Attention Network with Cluster Enhancement), a novel
framework that integrates logic-guided reasoning, dynamic graph refinement, and
adaptive clustering to enhance graph representation learning. GLANCE combines a
logic layer for interpretable and structured embeddings, multi-head
attention-based edge pruning for denoising graph structures, and clustering
mechanisms for capturing global patterns. Experimental results in benchmark
datasets, including Cornell, Texas, and Wisconsin, demonstrate that GLANCE
achieves competitive performance, offering robust and interpretable solutions
for heterophilous graph scenarios. The proposed framework is lightweight,
adaptable, and uniquely suited to the challenges of heterophilous graphs.

*Magnus Bengtsson,Kenneth Östberg*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: C2G-KD introduces a method for knowledge distillation utilizing synthetic data generated without real training data, relying on a class-conditional generator combined with PCA-based constraints to ensure data quality and diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of data-free knowledge distillation by allowing the generation of synthetic samples that still maintain structural and semantic alignment with a teacher model.

Method: A class-conditional generator is trained to generate synthetic examples without real data, guided by a frozen teacher model's outputs and constrained by PCA-derived geometric information.

Result: The method shows that even using very limited real class information, the generated synthetic data can lead to successful training pipelines, as demonstrated on MNIST data.

Conclusion: Minimal class-specific structure, guided effectively by PCA and a teacher model, can suffice for data-free knowledge distillation, unlocking new possibilities for synthetic training data generation.

Abstract: We introduce C2G-KD, a data-free knowledge distillation framework where a
class-conditional generator is trained to produce synthetic samples guided by a
frozen teacher model and geometric constraints derived from PCA. The generator
never observes real training data but instead learns to activate the teacher's
output through a combination of semantic and structural losses. By constraining
generated samples to lie within class-specific PCA subspaces estimated from as
few as two real examples per class, we preserve topological consistency and
diversity. Experiments on MNIST show that even minimal class structure is
sufficient to bootstrap useful synthetic training pipelines.

### [238] [The Price equation reveals a universal force-metric-bias law of algorithmic learning and natural selection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18549)
*Steven A. Frank*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a universal framework that unites diverse learning algorithms, optimization methods, and natural selection by revealing their common mathematical structure through the Price equation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To find a unified mathematical foundation for understanding and designing various learning algorithms and natural processes.

Method: The author uses the Price equation to derive a universal force-metric-bias (FMB) law, describing parameter changes ($\Delta\mathbf{\theta}$) as driven by force, metrics, bias, and noise.

Result: The paper shows that prominent concepts such as Fisher information, Kullback-Leibler divergence, and d'Alembert's principle naturally emerge within this unified framework.

Conclusion: The FMB law establishes a shared structure across diverse disciplines, enabling consistent comparison and principled design of learning and optimization methods.

Abstract: Diverse learning algorithms, optimization methods, and natural selection
share a common mathematical structure, despite their apparent differences. Here
I show that a simple notational partitioning of change by the Price equation
reveals a universal force-metric-bias (FMB) law: $\Delta\mathbf{\theta} =
\mathbf{M}\,\mathbf{f} + \mathbf{b} + \mathbf{\xi}$. The force $\mathbf{f}$
drives improvement in parameters, $\Delta\mathbf{\theta}$, through the
covariance between the parameters and performance. The metric $\mathbf{M}$
rescales movement by inverse curvature. The bias $\mathbf{b}$ adds momentum or
changes in the frame of reference. The noise $\mathbf{\xi}$ enables
exploration. This framework unifies natural selection, Bayesian updating,
Newton's method, stochastic gradient descent, stochastic Langevin dynamics,
Adam optimization, and most other algorithms as special cases of the same
underlying process. The Price equation also reveals why Fisher information,
Kullback-Leibler divergence, and d'Alembert's principle arise naturally in
learning dynamics. By exposing this common structure, the FMB law provides a
principled foundation for understanding, comparing, and designing learning
algorithms across disciplines.

### [239] [The Geometry of LLM Quantization: GPTQ as Babai's Nearest Plane Algorithm](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18553)
*Jiale Chen,Torsten Hoefler,Dan Alistarh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper establishes a theoretical connection between GPTQ, a post-training quantization method for large language models, and Babai's nearest plane algorithm for lattice problems, providing geometric interpretation and error guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To theoretically ground GPTQ, a popular quantization method for reducing the bitwidth of large language models, and offer insights to improve its future development.

Method: The authors present a mathematical equivalence between GPTQ and Babai's nearest plane algorithm for the closest vector problem (CVP) on a lattice defined by a layer's Hessian matrix. This includes leveraging lattice theory to analyze GPTQ.

Result: They show that GPTQ can be interpreted geometrically and inherits Babai's error upper bound under the no-clipping condition, linking it to established lattice algorithms.

Conclusion: This work provides a solid theoretical foundation for GPTQ, aligns it with lattice-based techniques, and suggests that advances in lattice algorithms could inspire improvements in quantization for billion-parameter models.

Abstract: Quantizing the weights of large language models (LLMs) from 16-bit to lower
bitwidth is the de facto approach to deploy massive transformers onto more
affordable accelerators. GPTQ emerged as one of the standard methods for
one-shot post-training quantization at LLM scale. Yet, its inner workings are
described as a sequence of ad-hoc algebraic updates that obscure any geometric
meaning or worst-case guarantees. In this work, we show that, when executed
back-to-front (from the last to first dimension) for a linear layer, GPTQ is
mathematically identical to Babai's nearest plane algorithm for the classical
closest vector problem (CVP) on a lattice defined by the Hessian matrix of the
layer's inputs. This equivalence is based on a sophisticated mathematical
argument, and has two analytical consequences: (i) the GPTQ error propagation
step gains an intuitive geometric interpretation; (ii) GPTQ inherits the error
upper bound of Babai's algorithm under the no-clipping condition. Taken
together, these results place GPTQ on firm theoretical footing and open the
door to importing decades of progress in lattice algorithms towards the design
of future quantization algorithms for billion-parameter models.

*Ethan Pronovost,Neha Boloor,Peter Schleede,Noureldin Hendy,Andres Morales,Nicholas Roy*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents an SE(2) invariant transformer for spatial data in autonomous driving tasks, reducing memory requirements from quadratic to linear while improving performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for processing spatial data in autonomous driving require quadratic memory due to explicit computation of all relative poses between objects, which limits scalability.

Method: The authors introduce an SE(2) invariant scaled dot-product attention mechanism in their transformer architecture, leveraging linear memory scaling similar to large language models.

Result: The proposed approach is experimentally shown to be practical and performs better than comparable non-invariant architectures.

Conclusion: The SE(2) invariant transformer improves scalability and performance for spatial data processing tasks in autonomous driving while maintaining efficiency.

Abstract: Processing spatial data is a key component in many learning tasks for
autonomous driving such as motion forecasting, multi-agent simulation, and
planning. Prior works have demonstrated the value in using SE(2) invariant
network architectures that consider only the relative poses between objects
(e.g. other agents, scene features such as traffic lanes). However, these
methods compute the relative poses for all pairs of objects explicitly,
requiring quadratic memory. In this work, we propose a mechanism for SE(2)
invariant scaled dot-product attention that requires linear memory relative to
the number of objects in the scene. Our SE(2) invariant transformer
architecture enjoys the same scaling properties that have benefited large
language models in recent years. We demonstrate experimentally that our
approach is practical to implement and improves performance compared to
comparable non-invariant architectures.

*Zinan Ling,Yi Shi,Da Yan,Yang Zhou,Bo Hui*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses protein generation by proposing a multi-level conditional diffusion model that incorporates sequence-based and structure-based data for better protein design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reliable generation of novel and functional protein sequences for biological applications remains a challenge, particularly when using conditional diffusion models.

Method: The authors introduce a novel multi-level conditional diffusion model integrating sequence and structure-based information and propose a new evaluation metric, Protein-MMD, to assess the quality and consistency of generated proteins.

Result: Experiments on benchmark datasets validate the model's effectiveness in conditional protein generation tasks and demonstrate the utility of the Protein-MMD metric.

Conclusion: The study proposes an innovative approach and reliable evaluation strategy for de novo protein design using conditional diffusion models, resulting in better functional and structural integrity of generated proteins.

Abstract: Generating novel and functional protein sequences is critical to a wide range
of applications in biology. Recent advancements in conditional diffusion models
have shown impressive empirical performance in protein generation tasks.
However, reliable generations of protein remain an open research question in de
novo protein design, especially when it comes to conditional diffusion models.
Considering the biological function of a protein is determined by multi-level
structures, we propose a novel multi-level conditional diffusion model that
integrates both sequence-based and structure-based information for efficient
end-to-end protein design guided by specified functions. By generating
representations at different levels simultaneously, our framework can
effectively model the inherent hierarchical relations between different levels,
resulting in an informative and discriminative representation of the generated
protein. We also propose a Protein-MMD, a new reliable evaluation metric, to
evaluate the quality of generated protein with conditional diffusion models.
Our new metric is able to capture both distributional and functional
similarities between real and generated protein sequences while ensuring
conditional consistency. We experiment with the benchmark datasets, and the
results on conditional protein generation tasks demonstrate the efficacy of the
proposed generation framework and evaluation metric.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new benchmark and method for human-AI collaboration in physically grounded tasks, showcasing improvements in AI performance under constrained dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the complex challenges of human-AI collaboration in environments constrained by physical attributes and dynamics, which are critical for real-world applications.

Method: The authors introduce the "Moving Out" benchmark that simulates various collaborative scenarios involving physical constraints, collect human-human interaction data, and propose a novel method, BASS, designed to enhance diversity and outcome prediction in AI behavior.

Result: Their experiments demonstrate that the proposed BASS method outperforms state-of-the-art models in AI-AI and human-AI collaboration tasks.

Conclusion: The work successfully provides a robust benchmark and methodology to advance the capabilities of embodied AI agents in physically constrained collaborative settings.

Abstract: The ability to adapt to physical actions and constraints in an environment is
crucial for embodied agents (e.g., robots) to effectively collaborate with
humans. Such physically grounded human-AI collaboration must account for the
increased complexity of the continuous state-action space and constrained
dynamics caused by physical constraints. In this paper, we introduce
\textit{Moving Out}, a new human-AI collaboration benchmark that resembles a
wide range of collaboration modes affected by physical attributes and
constraints, such as moving heavy items together and maintaining consistent
actions to move a big item around a corner. Using Moving Out, we designed two
tasks and collected human-human interaction data to evaluate models' abilities
to adapt to diverse human behaviors and unseen physical attributes. To address
the challenges in physical environments, we propose a novel method, BASS
(Behavior Augmentation, Simulation, and Selection), to enhance the diversity of
agents and their understanding of the outcome of actions. Our experiments show
that BASS outperforms state-of-the-art models in AI-AI and human-AI
collaboration. The project page is available at

*James B Aimone*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: Neuromorphic computing (NMC) offers a low-power alternative to conventional architectures like CPUs and GPUs, excelling in scalable and sparse algorithms rather than dense numerical tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To define the computational value proposition of neuromorphic computing and clarify its advantages over traditional von Neumann architectures.

Method: The study compares the time, space, and energy scaling properties of NMC systems with conventional architectures and evaluates their suitability for various algorithm classes.

Result: NMC systems match the computational scaling of infinite conventional processors in time/space but exhibit fundamentally different energy scaling, making them ideal for sparse and optimization-based algorithms.

Conclusion: Neuromorphic systems are more energy-efficient and better-suited for algorithms like iterative optimization and large-scale sampling, distinguishing them from traditional multi-core systems.

Abstract: Neuromorphic computing (NMC) is increasingly viewed as a low-power
alternative to conventional von Neumann architectures such as central
processing units (CPUs) and graphics processing units (GPUs), however the
computational value proposition has been difficult to define precisely.
  Here, we explain how NMC should be seen as general-purpose and programmable
even though it differs considerably from a conventional stored-program
architecture. We show that the time and space scaling of NMC is equivalent to
that of a theoretically infinite processor conventional system, however the
energy scaling is significantly different. Specifically, the energy of
conventional systems scales with absolute algorithm work, whereas the energy of
neuromorphic systems scales with the derivative of algorithm state. The unique
characteristics of NMC architectures make it well suited for different classes
of algorithms than conventional multi-core systems like GPUs that have been
optimized for dense numerical applications such as linear algebra. In contrast,
the unique characteristics of NMC make it ideally suited for scalable and
sparse algorithms whose activity is proportional to an objective function, such
as iterative optimization and large-scale sampling (e.g., Monte Carlo).

*Felix Arnold,Maxence Bouvier,Ryan Amaudruz,Renzo Andri,Lukas Cavigelli*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method that enhances power efficiency in fixed-point multipliers by decomposing them into an encoder and multiplier module with Sign Magnitude encoding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve power-efficiency for fixed-point multipliers used in AI workloads where input values are typically centered around zero.

Method: The method involves decomposing the multiplier into two components: an encoder converting operands into Sign Magnitude representation and a multiplier module. Both components are synthesized separately and optimized.

Result: Post-synthesis simulations show that the method reduces switching activity by up to 12.9% for realistic input streams, with greater reductions of up to 33% under specific conditions.

Conclusion: The method proves to be efficient in saving power and maintaining logic-compliance, while additional optimization techniques can further enhance power-efficiency by 5-10%.

Abstract: This work presents a method to maximize power-efficiency of fixed point
multiplier units by decomposing them into sub-components. First, an encoder
block converts the operands from a two's complement to a sign magnitude
representation, followed by a multiplier module which performs the compute
operation and outputs the resulting value in the original format. This allows
to leverage the power-efficiency of the Sign Magnitude encoding for the
multiplication. To ensure the computing format is not altered, those two
components are synthesized and optimized separately. Our method leads to
significant power savings for input values centered around zero, as commonly
encountered in AI workloads. Under a realistic input stream with values
normally distributed with a standard deviation of 3.0, post-synthesis
simulations of the 4-bit multiplier design show up to 12.9% lower switching
activity compared to synthesis without decomposition. Those gains are achieved
while ensuring compliance into any production-ready system as the overall
circuit stays logic-equivalent. With the compliance lifted and a slightly
smaller input range of -7 to +7, switching activity reductions can reach up to
33%. Additionally, we demonstrate that synthesis optimization methods based on
switching-activity-driven design space exploration can yield a further 5-10%
improvement in power-efficiency compared to a power agnostic approach.

TL;DR: This paper explores Echo-State Networks (ESNs) through the lens of dynamical-systems theory to answer fundamental questions about memory, stability, and expressive power, uniting mathematical and neuroscientific principles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address fragmented understanding of ESNs by providing a unified theoretical framework that integrates insights from functional analysis, random attractor theory, and neuroscience.

Method: The authors employ a combination of mathematical proofs and theoretical formulations to explore key properties of ESNs, such as the Echo-State Property, fading memory, universality, memory capacity, and criticality.

Result: Key findings include tight algebraic tests for Lipschitz constants, proof of ESN universality under certain conditions, resource quantification using memory-capacity spectrum, and rigorous links between network properties and dynamical system behaviors.

Conclusion: The paper provides a comprehensive theoretical foundation for ESNs, offering design rules grounded in both mathematics and neuroscience, and explains why small reservoirs often perform as well as fully trained recurrent networks.

Abstract: Echo-State Networks (ESNs) distil a key neurobiological insight: richly
recurrent but fixed circuitry combined with adaptive linear read-outs can
transform temporal streams with remarkable efficiency. Yet fundamental
questions about stability, memory and expressive power remain fragmented across
disciplines. We present a unified, dynamical-systems treatment that weaves
together functional analysis, random attractor theory and recent
neuroscientific findings. First, on compact multivariate input alphabets we
prove that the Echo-State Property (wash-out of initial conditions) together
with global Lipschitz dynamics necessarily yields the Fading-Memory Property
(geometric forgetting of remote inputs). Tight algebraic tests translate
activation-specific Lipschitz constants into certified spectral-norm bounds,
covering both saturating and rectifying nonlinearities. Second, employing a
Stone-Weierstrass strategy we give a streamlined proof that ESNs with
polynomial reservoirs and linear read-outs are dense in the Banach space of
causal, time-invariant fading-memory filters, extending universality to
stochastic inputs. Third, we quantify computational resources via
memory-capacity spectrum, show how topology and leak rate redistribute
delay-specific capacities, and link these trade-offs to Lyapunov spectra at the
\textit{edge of chaos}. Finally, casting ESNs as skew-product random dynamical
systems, we establish existence of singleton pullback attractors and derive
conditional Lyapunov bounds, providing a rigorous analogue to cortical
criticality. The analysis yields concrete design rules-spectral radius, input
gain, activation choice-grounded simultaneously in mathematics and
neuroscience, and clarifies why modest-sized reservoirs often rival fully
trained recurrent networks in practice.

### [247] [Higher-Order Behavioural Conformances via Fibrations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18509)
*Henning Urbat*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: This paper develops a uniform categorical approach to Howe’s method for establishing program congruences in languages with quantitative features, providing theoretical frameworks like Abstract Higher-Order Specification (AHOS) and fibrations to model operational semantics and behavioral conformances.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to improve methods for proving behavioral equivalences and distances in higher-order languages, particularly those with probabilistic constructs, where existing approaches (e.g., Howe's method) require complex, language-specific adaptations.

Method: The paper introduces a new framework called Abstract Higher-Order Specification (AHOS) coupled with fibrations to generalize Howe’s method for proving congruences in behavioral conformances. It uses categorical models to abstract operational semantics and notions of conformance.

Result: The authors establish a congruence theorem showing that, under specific categorical conditions, the greatest behavioral conformance in the operational model of AHOS forms a congruence. They demonstrate this by applying the theory to probabilistic higher-order languages.

Conclusion: This uniform categorical approach allows for systematic derivations of program congruences in a variety of higher-order languages, simplifying complex proofs and extending applicability to probabilistic and other quantitative language models.

Abstract: Coinduction is a widely used technique for establishing behavioural
equivalence of programs in higher-order languages. In recent years, the rise of
languages with quantitative (e.g.~probabilistic) features has led to extensions
of coinductive methods to more refined types of behavioural conformances, most
notably notions of behavioural distance. To guarantee soundness of coinductive
reasoning, one needs to show that the behavioural conformance at hand forms a
program congruence, i.e. it is suitably compatible with the operations of the
language. This is usually achieved by a complex proof technique known as
\emph{Howe's method}, which needs to be carefully adapted to both the specific
language and the targeted notion of behavioural conformance. We develop a
uniform categorical approach to Howe's method that features two orthogonal
dimensions of abstraction: (1) the underlying higher-order language is modelled
by an \emph{abstract higher-order specification} (AHOS), a novel and very
general categorical account of operational semantics, and (2) notions of
behavioural conformance (such as relations or metrics) are modelled via
fibrations over the base category of an AHOS. Our main result is a fundamental
congruence theorem at this level of generality: Under natural conditions on the
categorical ingredients and the operational rules of a language modelled by an
AHOS, the greatest behavioural (bi)conformance on its operational model forms a
congruence. We illustrate our theory by deriving congruence of bisimilarity and
behavioural pseudometrics for probabilistic higher-order languages.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper explores using multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) to enable robots to interpret complex natural language instructions and effectively navigate outdoor and indoor environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The researchers aim to address the challenge of bridging the gap between language descriptions and real-world robotic actions for navigation and planning.

Method: The paper leverages MLLMs' cross-modal understanding and code-generation capabilities to create bird-eye-view value maps by integrating semantic knowledge with spatial information. Validation is performed using autonomous vehicle datasets and real-life robots.

Result: The proposed framework demonstrates robustness to linguistic ambiguities and object detection errors, achieving effective navigation capabilities under free-form instructions.

Conclusion: The approach successfully showcases real-world usability and robustness in both indoor and outdoor environments, bridging the gap between natural language instructions and robotic navigation.

Abstract: Pre-trained large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong
common-sense reasoning abilities, making them promising for robotic navigation
and planning tasks. However, despite recent progress, bridging the gap between
language descriptions and actual robot actions in the open-world, beyond merely
invoking limited predefined motion primitives, remains an open challenge. In
this work, we aim to enable robots to interpret and decompose complex language
instructions, ultimately synthesizing a sequence of trajectory points to
complete diverse navigation tasks given open-set instructions and open-set
objects. We observe that multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) exhibit
strong cross-modal understanding when processing free-form language
instructions, demonstrating robust scene comprehension. More importantly,
leveraging their code-generation capability, MLLMs can interact with
vision-language perception models to generate compositional 2D bird-eye-view
value maps, effectively integrating semantic knowledge from MLLMs with spatial
information from maps to reinforce the robot's spatial understanding. To
further validate our approach, we effectively leverage large-scale autonomous
vehicle datasets (AVDs) to validate our proposed zero-shot vision-language
navigation framework in outdoor navigation tasks, demonstrating its capability
to execute a diverse range of free-form natural language navigation
instructions while maintaining robustness against object detection errors and
linguistic ambiguities. Furthermore, we validate our system on a Husky robot in
both indoor and outdoor scenes, demonstrating its real-world robustness and
applicability. Supplementary videos are available at

*Behzad Zamani,Jochen Trumpf,Chris Manzie*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes a modular approach for nonlinear least squares filtering that allows independent updates of state and covariance, even for relative measurements involving multiple subsystems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of filtering in systems with coupled estimation problems, like robot-landmark localization, while maintaining modular independence and minimizing information double counting.

Method: The approach uses a modular filtering method integrating the Covariance Intersection (CI) algorithm, derived through an alternative least squares estimation technique.

Result: In a simulation study, the modular method was benchmarked against a monolithic filter, demonstrating its advantages and exploring performance trade-offs and reduced communication variants.

Conclusion: The proposed approach is effective for modular filtering in coupled systems and supports scalable communication requirements.

Abstract: In this paper we propose a modular nonlinear least squares filtering approach
for systems composed of independent subsystems. The state and error covariance
estimate of each subsystem is updated independently, even when a relative
measurement simultaneously depends on the states of multiple subsystems. We
integrate the Covariance Intersection (CI) algorithm as part of our solution in
order to prevent double counting of information when subsystems share estimates
with each other. An alternative derivation of the CI algorithm based on least
squares estimation makes this integration possible. We particularise the
proposed approach to the robot-landmark localization problem. In this problem,
noisy measurements of the bearing angle to a stationary landmark position
measured relative to the SE(2) pose of a moving robot couple the estimation
problems for the robot pose and the landmark position. In a randomized
simulation study, we benchmark the proposed modular method against a monolithic
joint state filter to elucidate their respective trade-offs. In this study we
also include variants of the proposed method that achieve a graceful
degradation of performance with reduced communication and bandwidth
requirements.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address performance degradation in locomotion systems caused by model mismatch and enhance robustness and learning efficiency.

Method: Residual modules are merged into a model-based footstep planner and dynamic model, leveraging a modular design and tailored learning-based frameworks.

Result: Improved control performance, robustness to parameter tuning, and successful real-world tests with a quadrupedal robot in uncertain conditions.

Conclusion: The hybrid approach effectively enhances locomotion systems' adaptability and robustness, validated by real-robot experiments.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach that combines the advantages of both
model-based and learning-based frameworks to achieve robust locomotion. The
residual modules are integrated with each corresponding part of the model-based
framework, a footstep planner and dynamic model designed using heuristics, to
complement performance degradation caused by a model mismatch. By utilizing a
modular structure and selecting the appropriate learning-based method for each
residual module, our framework demonstrates improved control performance in
environments with high uncertainty, while also achieving higher learning
efficiency compared to baseline methods. Moreover, we observed that our
proposed methodology not only enhances control performance but also provides
additional benefits, such as making nominal controllers more robust to
parameter tuning. To investigate the feasibility of our framework, we
demonstrated residual modules combined with model predictive control in a real
quadrupedal robot. Despite uncertainties beyond the simulation, the robot
successfully maintains balance and tracks the commanded velocity.

Motivation: To develop an efficient search and rescue platform capable of real-time detection, recognition, and tracking of individuals in critical situations.

Method: The system integrates UAV navigation with ROS2 framework, leveraging YOLOv11, YOLOv11-pose, and dlib library CNNs for detection and tracking. PD controllers are employed for autonomous UAV navigation based on IMU measurements.

Result: The subsystem successfully detected, recognized, and tracked 14 known individuals in real-time during initial experiments.

Conclusion: The proposed UAV subsystem demonstrates feasibility for real-time search and rescue operations, with future advancements planned for GPS-guided autonomous navigation in field settings.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a subsystem, using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV),
for search and rescue missions, focusing on people detection, face recognition
and tracking of identified individuals. The proposed solution integrates a UAV
with ROS2 framework, that utilizes multiple convolutional neural networks (CNN)
for search missions. System identification and PD controller deployment are
performed for autonomous UAV navigation. The ROS2 environment utilizes the
YOLOv11 and YOLOv11-pose CNNs for tracking purposes, and the dlib library CNN
for face recognition. The system detects a specific individual, performs face
recognition and starts tracking. If the individual is not yet known, the UAV
operator can manually locate the person, save their facial image and
immediately initiate the tracking process. The tracking process relies on
specific keypoints identified on the human body using the YOLOv11-pose CNN
model. These keypoints are used to track a specific individual and maintain a
safe distance. To enhance accurate tracking, system identification is
performed, based on measurement data from the UAVs IMU. The identified system
parameters are used to design PD controllers that utilize YOLOv11-pose to
estimate the distance between the UAVs camera and the identified individual.
The initial experiments, conducted on 14 known individuals, demonstrated that
the proposed subsystem can be successfully used in real time. The next step
involves implementing the system on a large experimental UAV for field use and
integrating autonomous navigation with GPS-guided control for rescue operations
planning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of navigation drift in mobile robots caused by reliance on noisy inertial sensors in environments lacking satellite navigation or cameras.

Method: Proposed a physics-informed neural network framework (MoRPI-PINN) embedding physical laws for training, enhancing inertial-based navigation accuracy during snake-like motion.

Result: Demonstrated over 85% accuracy improvement compared to existing methods using real-world experimental validation.

Conclusion: MoRPI-PINN offers a lightweight, robust, and accurate navigation solution applicable to edge devices, ideal for mobile robot applications.

Abstract: A fundamental requirement for full autonomy in mobile robots is accurate
navigation even in situations where satellite navigation or cameras are
unavailable. In such practical situations, relying only on inertial sensors
will result in navigation solution drift due to the sensors' inherent noise and
error terms. One of the emerging solutions to mitigate drift is to maneuver the
robot in a snake-like slithering motion to increase the inertial
signal-to-noise ratio, allowing the regression of the mobile robot position. In
this work, we propose MoRPI-PINN as a physics-informed neural network framework
for accurate inertial-based mobile robot navigation. By embedding physical laws
and constraints into the training process, MoRPI-PINN is capable of providing
an accurate and robust navigation solution. Using real-world experiments, we
show accuracy improvements of over 85% compared to other approaches. MoRPI-PINN
is a lightweight approach that can be implemented even on edge devices and used
in any typical mobile robot application.

TL;DR: The paper experiments with the MediaPipe algorithm for facial landmark detection in controlled surgical lighting, improving detection accuracy for challenging angles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address challenges in facial landmark detection under variable lighting and positional flexibility, crucial for medical applications like neurosurgery and plastic surgery.

Method: Facial landmarks are detected using the MediaPipe algorithm in a controlled setup with a robotic arm adjusting positions, keeping surgical lighting and the phantom fixed.

Result: The experiment shows improved detection accuracy for larger yaw and pitch angles under surgical lighting but notes increased standard deviation due to imprecision in detecting some landmarks.

Conclusion: The findings suggest that integrating the MediaPipe algorithm into medical procedures could enhance detection performance, especially under surgical conditions and challenging orientations.

Abstract: The use of robotics, computer vision, and their applications is becoming
increasingly widespread in various fields, including medicine. Many face
detection algorithms have found applications in neurosurgery, ophthalmology,
and plastic surgery. A common challenge in using these algorithms is variable
lighting conditions and the flexibility of detection positions to identify and
precisely localize patients. The proposed experiment tests the MediaPipe
algorithm for detecting facial landmarks in a controlled setting, using a
robotic arm that automatically adjusts positions while the surgical light and
the phantom remain in a fixed position. The results of this study demonstrate
that the improved accuracy of facial landmark detection under surgical lighting
significantly enhances the detection performance at larger yaw and pitch
angles. The increase in standard deviation/dispersion occurs due to imprecise
detection of selected facial landmarks. This analysis allows for a discussion
on the potential integration of the MediaPipe algorithm into medical
procedures.

TL;DR: ReSem3D unifies robotic manipulation in semantically diverse environments using VFMs and MLLMs for precise spatial constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address limitations in existing robotic manipulation methods, such as coarse semantic modeling, lack of real-time planning, and reduced robustness in diverse scenarios.

Method: ReSem3D uses hierarchical reasoning in MLLMs and VFMs to construct fine-grained spatial constraints by processing language instructions and RGB-D observations in two distinct stages.

Result: ReSem3D achieves successful zero-shot manipulation across varied tasks in simulated and real-world environments, demonstrating adaptability and generalization.

Conclusion: The study showcases ReSem3D as a robust framework for real-time manipulation under diverse conditions, with potential applications in household and lab settings.

Abstract: Semantics-driven 3D spatial constraints align highlevel semantic
representations with low-level action spaces, facilitating the unification of
task understanding and execution in robotic manipulation. The synergistic
reasoning of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) and Vision Foundation
Models (VFMs) enables cross-modal 3D spatial constraint construction.
Nevertheless, existing methods have three key limitations: (1) coarse semantic
granularity in constraint modeling, (2) lack of real-time closed-loop planning,
(3) compromised robustness in semantically diverse environments. To address
these challenges, we propose ReSem3D, a unified manipulation framework for
semantically diverse environments, leveraging the synergy between VFMs and
MLLMs to achieve fine-grained visual grounding and dynamically constructs
hierarchical 3D spatial constraints for real-time manipulation. Specifically,
the framework is driven by hierarchical recursive reasoning in MLLMs, which
interact with VFMs to automatically construct 3D spatial constraints from
natural language instructions and RGB-D observations in two stages: part-level
extraction and region-level refinement. Subsequently, these constraints are
encoded as real-time optimization objectives in joint space, enabling reactive
behavior to dynamic disturbances. Extensive simulation and real-world
experiments are conducted in semantically rich household and sparse chemical
lab environments. The results demonstrate that ReSem3D performs diverse
manipulation tasks under zero-shot conditions, exhibiting strong adaptability
and generalization. Code and videos at https://resem3d.github.io.

TL;DR: The paper introduces AdaRPG, a framework that enhances robotic manipulation of diverse articulated objects using foundation models for part-level analysis and high-level function reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges with robotic manipulation of diverse articulated objects, such as geometric and functional variability, by improving visual perception, understanding, and an adaptive strategy.

Method: AdaRPG leverages foundation models to extract object parts for better geometric similarity understanding, builds a part-level affordance annotation dataset, and generates high-level control codes using affordance inference.

Result: Simulation and real-world tests show AdaRPG's strong ability to generalize across new categories of articulated objects.

Conclusion: AdaRPG successfully enhances robotic generalization and manipulation capabilities via its novel combination of foundation models and detailed affordance reasoning.

Abstract: Articulated objects pose diverse manipulation challenges for robots. Since
their internal structures are not directly observable, robots must adaptively
explore and refine actions to generate successful manipulation trajectories.
While existing works have attempted cross-category generalization in adaptive
articulated object manipulation, two major challenges persist: (1) the
geometric diversity of real-world articulated objects complicates visual
perception and understanding, and (2) variations in object functions and
mechanisms hinder the development of a unified adaptive manipulation strategy.
To address these challenges, we propose AdaRPG, a novel framework that
leverages foundation models to extract object parts, which exhibit greater
local geometric similarity than entire objects, thereby enhancing visual
affordance generalization for functional primitive skills. To support this, we
construct a part-level affordance annotation dataset to train the affordance
model. Additionally, AdaRPG utilizes the common knowledge embedded in
foundation models to reason about complex mechanisms and generate high-level
control codes that invoke primitive skill functions based on part affordance
inference. Simulation and real-world experiments demonstrate AdaRPG's strong
generalization ability across novel articulated object categories.

TL;DR: The paper proposes AF-RLIO, an adaptive sensor fusion method for robust robotic navigation in complex environments using radar, LiDAR, IMU, and GPS.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of single-sensor systems in extreme conditions like smoke, tunnels, and adverse weather, threatening the stability and safety of autonomous robots.

Method: The AF-RLIO approach integrates radar, LiDAR, IMU, and GPS through modules for pre-processing (dynamic point removal and environment assessment), multimodal odometry (scan-to-map matching paired with IMU), and factor graph optimization (odometry and GPS data balancing).

Result: AF-RLIO shows effectiveness and superiority over existing methods in complex real-world settings by successfully handling environmental challenges during evaluations.

Conclusion: This approach improves precise pose estimation and robust navigation for autonomous robots, even in degraded operational conditions.

Abstract: In robotic navigation, maintaining precise pose estimation and navigation in
complex and dynamic environments is crucial. However, environmental challenges
such as smoke, tunnels, and adverse weather can significantly degrade the
performance of single-sensor systems like LiDAR or GPS, compromising the
overall stability and safety of autonomous robots. To address these challenges,
we propose AF-RLIO: an adaptive fusion approach that integrates 4D
millimeter-wave radar, LiDAR, inertial measurement unit (IMU), and GPS to
leverage the complementary strengths of these sensors for robust odometry
estimation in complex environments. Our method consists of three key modules.
Firstly, the pre-processing module utilizes radar data to assist LiDAR in
removing dynamic points and determining when environmental conditions are
degraded for LiDAR. Secondly, the dynamic-aware multimodal odometry selects
appropriate point cloud data for scan-to-map matching and tightly couples it
with the IMU using the Iterative Error State Kalman Filter. Lastly, the factor
graph optimization module balances weights between odometry and GPS data,
constructing a pose graph for optimization. The proposed approach has been
evaluated on datasets and tested in real-world robotic environments,
demonstrating its effectiveness and advantages over existing methods in
challenging conditions such as smoke and tunnels.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The goal was to improve 3D reconstruction fidelity and pose tracking by addressing limitations of conventional isotropic representations in SLAM systems.

Method: They use Gaussian distributions constrained to the local tangent plane with anisotropic covariance priors, integrated into the SLAM pipeline with a geometry-aware loss for multi-dimensional consistency.

Result: Experiments on Replica and TUM-RGBD datasets showed improvements in localization accuracy and reconstruction quality, while retaining real-time operation and high visual fidelity.

Conclusion: The G2S-ICP SLAM system offers advancements in robust camera tracking and high-quality 3D reconstruction, outperforming prior methods in key benchmarks.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel geometry-aware RGB-D Gaussian Splatting
SLAM system, named G2S-ICP SLAM. The proposed method performs high-fidelity 3D
reconstruction and robust camera pose tracking in real-time by representing
each scene element using a Gaussian distribution constrained to the local
tangent plane. This effectively models the local surface as a 2D Gaussian disk
aligned with the underlying geometry, leading to more consistent depth
interpretation across multiple viewpoints compared to conventional 3D
ellipsoid-based representations with isotropic uncertainty. To integrate this
representation into the SLAM pipeline, we embed the surface-aligned Gaussian
disks into a Generalized ICP framework by introducing anisotropic covariance
prior without altering the underlying registration formulation. Furthermore we
propose a geometry-aware loss that supervises photometric, depth, and normal
consistency. Our system achieves real-time operation while preserving both
visual and geometric fidelity. Extensive experiments on the Replica and
TUM-RGBD datasets demonstrate that G2S-ICP SLAM outperforms prior SLAM systems
in terms of localization accuracy, reconstruction completeness, while
maintaining the rendering quality.

*Yonghao Fu,Cheng Hu,Haokun Xiong,Zhangpeng Bao,Wenyuan Du,Edoardo Ghignone,Michele Magno,Lei Xie,Hongye Su*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Residual Koopman Model Predictive Control (RKMPC) framework for improving vehicle trajectory tracking by combining mechanistic modeling with residual neural networks, achieving better performance with less training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional vehicle modeling in trajectory tracking faces trade-offs between capturing nonlinear dynamics and computational efficiency, leading to compromised control performance. There is a need for a more efficient and accurate control methodology.

Method: The framework integrates two linear MPC architectures: a baseline control using Linear MPC (LMPC) based on the vehicle's kinematic model and a neural network-based RKMPC for compensation. These components are combined to optimize control performance while retaining mechanistic model advantages.

Result: RKMPC demonstrated superior performance with only 20% of the training data compared to traditional Koopman MPC. It reduced lateral error by 11.7%-22.1%, heading error by 8.9%-15.8%, and improved steering stability by up to 27.6%. The effectiveness was validated in both simulation and physical experiments.

Conclusion: RKMPC significantly enhances vehicle trajectory tracking by marrying the interpretability of traditional control methods with the precision of modern residual modeling, achieving better accuracy and data efficiency while maintaining computational feasibility.

Abstract: In vehicle trajectory tracking tasks, the simplest approach is the Pure
Pursuit (PP) Control. However, this single-point preview tracking strategy
fails to consider vehicle model constraints, compromising driving safety. Model
Predictive Control (MPC) as a widely adopted control method, optimizes control
actions by incorporating mechanistic models and physical constraints. While its
control performance critically depends on the accuracy of vehicle modeling.
Traditional vehicle modeling approaches face inherent trade-offs between
capturing nonlinear dynamics and maintaining computational efficiency, often
resulting in reduced control performance. To address these challenges, this
paper proposes Residual Koopman Model Predictive Control (RKMPC) framework.
This method uses two linear MPC architecture to calculate control inputs: a
Linear Model Predictive Control (LMPC) computes the baseline control input
based on the vehicle kinematic model, and a neural network-based RKMPC
calculates the compensation input. The final control command is obtained by
adding these two components. This design preserves the reliability and
interpretability of traditional mechanistic model while achieving performance
optimization through residual modeling. This method has been validated on the
Carsim-Matlab joint simulation platform and a physical 1:10 scale F1TENTH
racing car. Experimental results show that RKMPC requires only 20% of the
training data needed by traditional Koopman Model Predictive Control (KMPC)
while delivering superior tracking performance. Compared to traditional LMPC,
RKMPC reduces lateral error by 11.7%-22.1%, decreases heading error by
8.9%-15.8%, and improves front-wheel steering stability by up to 27.6%. The
implementation code is available at: https://github.com/ZJU-DDRX/Residual

### [261] [Evaluating the Pre-Dressing Step: Unfolding Medical Garments Via Imitation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18436)
*David Blanco-Mulero,Júlia Borràs,Carme Torras*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper proposes an approach for robotic-assisted unfolding of garments, a necessary step before robotic dressing assistance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the gap in robotic-assisted dressing systems which typically assume garments are already unfolded, thereby improving efficiency in clinical settings, especially where dresses are stored in a folded state.

Method: The authors leverage imitation learning to teach three manipulation primitives, utilize a visual classifier to determine the garment's state, and conduct empirical evaluations of the unfolding process.

Result: The experiments demonstrate that highly dynamic motions are not effective, but a combination of slower, controlled motions can successfully unfold garments to the needed configuration.

Conclusion: The study highlights the importance of incorporating a pre-dressing step and shows promise in improving the functionality of robotic dressing systems by effectively handling folded garments.

Abstract: Robotic-assisted dressing has the potential to significantly aid both
patients as well as healthcare personnel, reducing the workload and improving
the efficiency in clinical settings. While substantial progress has been made
in robotic dressing assistance, prior works typically assume that garments are
already unfolded and ready for use. However, in medical applications gowns and
aprons are often stored in a folded configuration, requiring an additional
unfolding step. In this paper, we introduce the pre-dressing step, the process
of unfolding garments prior to assisted dressing. We leverage imitation
learning for learning three manipulation primitives, including both high and
low acceleration motions. In addition, we employ a visual classifier to
categorise the garment state as closed, partly opened, and fully opened. We
conduct an empirical evaluation of the learned manipulation primitives as well
as their combinations. Our results show that highly dynamic motions are not
effective for unfolding freshly unpacked garments, where the combination of
motions can efficiently enhance the opening configuration.

*Alghalya Al-Hajri,Ejmen Al-Ubejdij,Aiman Erbad,Ali Safa*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces an optimized framework for robotic environmental data collection, leveraging Compressed Sensing and Dictionary Learning to minimize travel path and enhance data reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need to efficiently collect high-resolution environmental data using autonomous robots while reducing energy consumption and improving data reconstruction accuracy.

Method: The authors propose a Monte Carlo optimization framework integrated with Dictionary Learning to design optimized trajectories and sparsifying transforms for robotic sensing tasks.

Result: The proposed method reduces robotic travel distance by more than 90% and achieves significantly superior data reconstruction accuracy compared to traditional CS methods and Informative Path Planning approaches.

Conclusion: The framework provides a more efficient and accurate method for environmental monitoring that greatly optimizes robot path planning and reduces the number of required samples while achieving high-quality signal reconstruction.

Abstract: In recent years, Compressed Sensing (CS) has gained significant interest as a
technique for acquiring high-resolution sensory data using fewer measurements
than traditional Nyquist sampling requires. At the same time, autonomous
robotic platforms such as drones and rovers have become increasingly popular
tools for remote sensing and environmental monitoring tasks, including
measurements of temperature, humidity, and air quality. Within this context,
this paper presents, to the best of our knowledge, the first investigation into
how the structure of CS measurement matrices can be exploited to design
optimized sampling trajectories for robotic environmental data collection. We
propose a novel Monte Carlo optimization framework that generates measurement
matrices designed to minimize both the robot's traversal path length and the
signal reconstruction error within the CS framework. Central to our approach is
the application of Dictionary Learning (DL) to obtain a data-driven sparsifying
transform, which enhances reconstruction accuracy while further reducing the
number of samples that the robot needs to collect. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method through experiments reconstructing $NO_2$ pollution
maps over the Gulf region. The results indicate that our approach can reduce
robot travel distance to less than $10\%$ of a full-coverage path, while
improving reconstruction accuracy by over a factor of five compared to
traditional CS methods based on DCT and polynomial dictionaries, as well as by
a factor of two compared to previously-proposed Informative Path Planning (IPP)
methods.

*Sait Sovukluk,Grazia Zambella,Tobias Egle,Christian Ott*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper experimentally compares inverse dynamics whole-body control (ID-WBC) and passivity-based whole-body control (PB-WBC) for humanoid robots under various scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to investigate the robustness and performance characteristics of two distinct whole-body control methodologies (ID-WBC and PB-WBC) given potential real-world challenges.

Method: The authors conduct experiments on a humanoid robot using tasks such as swing foot control, squatting with and without additional weights, and jumping, while considering factors like joint friction, sensor noise, and external disturbances.

Result: The study highlights performance differences, connects them with respective controller formulations, and identifies the specific advantages and disadvantages of ID-WBC and PB-WBC.

Conclusion: The research provides insights into the practicality of each control method, aiding the selection of appropriate controllers for specific humanoid tasks.

Abstract: This paper studies the experimental comparison of two different whole-body
control formulations for humanoid robots: inverse dynamics whole-body control
(ID-WBC) and passivity-based whole-body control (PB-WBC). The two controllers
fundamentally differ from each other as the first is formulated in task
acceleration space and the latter is in task force space with passivity
considerations. Even though both control methods predict stability under ideal
conditions in closed-loop dynamics, their robustness against joint friction,
sensor noise, unmodeled external disturbances, and non-perfect contact
conditions is not evident. Therefore, we analyze and experimentally compare the
two controllers on a humanoid robot platform through swing foot position and
orientation control, squatting with and without unmodeled additional weights,
and jumping. We also relate the observed performance and characteristic
differences with the controller formulations and highlight each controller's
advantages and disadvantages.

### [264] [How Software Engineers Engage with AI: A Pragmatic Process Model and Decision Framework Grounded in Industry Observations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17930)
*Vahid Garousi,Zafar Jafarov*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper explores how software engineers interact with AI tools, proposing a process model and decision framework for balancing efficiency and quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and improve the use of AI tools in software engineering, specifically addressing trust, refinement, and rejection of AI-generated outputs.

Method: The study involves practitioner reports and observations in industry settings to develop a process model and decision framework for AI-assisted software engineering.

Result: The researchers identified key AI-assisted SE activities and developed tools for evaluating trade-offs between saved effort and output quality.

Conclusion: Their findings propose structured models that facilitate deliberate and effective AI usage in software engineering, enhancing human-AI collaboration.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) has the potential to transform Software
Engineering (SE) by enhancing productivity, efficiency, and decision support.
Tools like GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT have given rise to "vibe coding"-an
exploratory, prompt-driven development style. Yet, how software engineers
engage with these tools in daily tasks, especially in deciding whether to
trust, refine, or reject AI-generated outputs, remains underexplored. This
paper presents two complementary contributions. First, a pragmatic process
model capturing real-world AI-assisted SE activities, including prompt design,
inspection, fallback, and refinement. Second, a 2D decision framework that
could help developers reason about trade-offs between effort saved and output
quality. Grounded in practitioner reports and direct observations in three
industry settings across Turkiye and Azerbaijan, our work illustrates how
engineers navigate AI use with human oversight. These models offer structured,
lightweight guidance to support more deliberate and effective use of AI tools
in SE, contributing to ongoing discussions on practical human-AI collaboration.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper compares 11 automated tools across 9 rigor criteria to address scientific transparency issues, highlighting tool performance and areas for improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the reproducibility crisis caused by lack of scientific reporting standardization and transparency.

Method: Conducted a broad comparison of 11 tools across 9 rigor criteria to evaluate their effectiveness.

Result: Found some clear outperforming tools for specific criteria like open data, and cases where tool combinations exceeded individual tool performance.

Conclusion: Recommended improvements for rigor and transparency tools and provided insights for their stakeholders. Study resources are available online.

Abstract: The causes of the reproducibility crisis include lack of standardization and
transparency in scientific reporting. Checklists such as ARRIVE and CONSORT
seek to improve transparency, but they are not always followed by authors and
peer review often fails to identify missing items. To address these issues,
there are several automated tools that have been designed to check different
rigor criteria. We have conducted a broad comparison of 11 automated tools
across 9 different rigor criteria from the ScreenIT group. We found some
criteria, including detecting open data, where the combination of tools showed
a clear winner, a tool which performed much better than other tools. In other
cases, including detection of inclusion and exclusion criteria, the combination
of tools exceeded the performance of any one tool. We also identified key areas
where tool developers should focus their effort to make their tool maximally
useful. We conclude with a set of insights and recommendations for stakeholders
in the development of rigor and transparency detection tools. The code and data

*Xiang Echo Chen,Wenhan Zhu,Guoshuai Albert Shi,Michael W. Godfrey*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper examines the integration of generative AI (GenAI) in open-source game development by comparing its adoption, usage patterns, and challenges to traditional AI (TradAI) and non-AI topics through GitHub issue discussions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to address the limited empirical understanding of how generative AI (GenAI) is adopted and integrated within real-world contexts of open-source game development.

Method: A dataset of GitHub issues in open-source game repositories discussing AI-related topics was collected. Open card sorting and thematic analysis were employed to label these issues and enable comparative analysis between GenAI, TradAI, and NonAI groups.

Result: The study uncovers differences in usage patterns, developer concerns, and integration practices between GenAI and other AI approaches, providing insights into workflows and challenges specific to open-source game development.

Conclusion: The findings reveal how generative AI is changing content creation, gameplay simulation, and design ideation in open-source game development, highlighting its unique impact compared to traditional AI approaches.

Abstract: The growing capabilities of generative AI (GenAI) have begun to reshape how
games are designed and developed, offering new tools for content creation,
gameplay simulation, and design ideation. While prior research has explored
traditional uses of AI in games, such as controlling agents or generating
procedural content. There is limited empirical understanding of how GenAI is
adopted by developers in real-world contexts, especially within the open-source
community. This study aims to explore how GenAI technologies are discussed,
adopted, and integrated into open-source game development by analyzing issue
discussions on GitHub. We investigate the tools, tasks, and challenges
associated with GenAI by comparing GenAI-related issues to those involving
traditional AI (TradAI) and NonAI topics. Our goal is to uncover how GenAI
differs from other approaches in terms of usage patterns, developer concerns,
and integration practices. To address this objective, we construct a dataset of
open-source game repositories that discuss AI-related topics. We apply open
card sorting and thematic analysis to a stratified sample of GitHub issues,
labelling each by type and content. These annotations enable comparative
analysis across GenAI, TradAI, and NonAI groups, and provide insight into how
GenAI is shaping the workflows and pain points of open-source game developers.

TL;DR: The paper presents a mapping between MITRE ATT&CK techniques and a Proactive Software Supply Chain Risk Management (P-SSCRM) framework to help organizations manage software supply chain attack risks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Software organizations face increasing software supply chain attack risks, and a systematic method is required to address these through known tactics and frameworks.

Method: The authors generated mappings of tasks to mitigate attack techniques by employing four independent strategies, aligning P-SSCRM tasks with those from 10 other frameworks.

Result: The study produced a comprehensive mapping between MITRE ATT&CK techniques, P-SSCRM tasks, and tasks from various other prominent frameworks.

Conclusion: The framework enables organizations to better mitigate software supply chain attack risks by providing actionable mappings between adversarial techniques and mitigation tasks.

Abstract: The MITRE Adversarial Tactics, Techniques and Common Knowledge (MITRE ATT&CK)
Attack Technique to Proactive Software Supply Chain Risk Management Framework
(P-SSCRM) Task mapping described in this document helps software organizations
to determine how different tasks mitigate the attack techniques of software
supply chain attacks. The mapping was created through four independent
strategies to find agreed-upon mappings. Because each P-SSCRM task is mapped to
one or more tasks from the 10 frameworks, the mapping we provide is also a
mapping between MITRE ATT&CK and other prominent government and industry
frameworks.

*Ahmad D. Suleiman,Yiming Tang,Daqing Hou*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper analyzes barriers and enablers influencing computing educators' adoption of project-based learning (PjBL) and proposes systemic support structures to facilitate its wider adoption.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate why faculty adoption of project-based learning (PjBL) in software engineering and computing curricula is inconsistent despite its numerous benefits for student learning.

Method: The study used a mixed-methods approach involving an online survey of 80 computing faculty. Quantitative data was analyzed statistically, while qualitative insights were examined through thematic analysis.

Result: The study found that although PjBL is widely valued, its adoption is hindered by planning, project design challenges, limited institutional support, and resource availability. Access to peer collaboration, professional development, and external resources from research or industry partnerships were identified as key enablers.

Conclusion: To enhance the adoption of PjBL, systemic support structures like professional development opportunities, peer collaboration, institutional incentives, and partnerships with industry should be established.

Abstract: This research full paper investigates the factors influencing computing
educators' adoption of project-based learning (PjBL) in software engineering
and computing curricula. Recognized as a student-centered pedagogical approach,
PjBL has the potential to enhance student motivation, engagement, critical
thinking, collaboration, and problem-solving skills. Despite these benefits,
faculty adoption remains inconsistent due to challenges such as insufficient
institutional support, time constraints, limited training opportunities,
designing or sourcing projects, and aligning them with course objectives. This
research explores these barriers and investigates the strategies and resources
that facilitate a successful adoption. Using a mixed-methods approach, data
from 80 computing faculty were collected through an online survey comprising
closed-ended questions to quantify barriers, enablers, and resource needs,
along with an open-ended question to gather qualitative insights. Quantitative
data were analyzed using statistical methods, while qualitative responses
underwent thematic analysis. Results reveal that while PjBL is widely valued,
its adoption is often selective and impacted by challenges in planning and
managing the learning process, designing suitable projects, and a lack of
institutional support, such as time, funding, and teaching assistants. Faculty
are more likely to adopt or sustain PjBL when they have access to peer
collaboration, professional development, and institutional incentives. In
addition, sourcing projects from research, industry partnerships, and borrowing
from peers emerged as key facilitators for new projects. These findings
underscore the need for systemic support structures to empower faculty to
experiment with and scale PjBL practices.

*Edward Abrokwah,Taher A. Ghaleb*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The research focuses on analyzing GitHub Actions (GHA) workflows in open-source repositories to identify their complexity, patterns, and alignment with best practices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite the widespread adoption of GitHub Actions, there is limited empirical evidence to show how real-world CI workflows align with best practices. This motivates the study to examine possible unnecessary complexities and gaps in current practices.

Method: The study analyzes a large dataset of GHA workflows from Java, Python, and C++ repositories to investigate structure, complexity, and adherence to best practices.

Result: The paper aims to identify areas of alignment and deviation from CI best practices in GHA workflows, as well as specific areas for improvement.

Conclusion: The outcomes will inform guidelines and documentation improvements, emphasizing the need for clearer standards and actionable insights into optimal CI pipeline design.

Abstract: Continuous Integration (CI) has evolved from a tooling strategy to a
fundamental mindset in modern CI engineering. It enables teams to develop,
test, and deliver software rapidly and collaboratively. Among CI services,
GitHub Actions (GHA) has emerged as a dominant service due to its deep
integration with GitHub and a vast ecosystem of reusable workflow actions.
Although GHA provides official documentation and community-supported best
practices, there appears to be limited empirical understanding of how
open-source real-world CI workflows align with such practices. Many workflows
might be unnecessarily complex and not aligned with the simplicity goals of CI
practices. This study will investigate the structure, complexity,
heterogeneity, and compliance of GHA workflows in open-source software
repositories. Using a large dataset of GHA workflows from Java, Python, and C++
repositories, our goal is to (a) identify workflow complexities, (b) analyze
recurring and heterogeneous structuring patterns, (c) assess compliance with
GHA best practices, and (d) uncover differences in CI pipeline design across
programming languages. Our findings are expected to reveal both areas of strong
adherence to best practices and areas for improvement where needed. These
insights will also have implications for CI services, as they will highlight
the need for clearer guidelines and comprehensive examples in CI documentation.

TL;DR: This paper explores the impact of similar identifier names on code understanding and collaboration, introducing a taxonomy to categorize such similarities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Identifier names are crucial for program comprehension, but poorly chosen names can lead to misunderstandings and increased cognitive load.

Method: Development of a preliminary taxonomy to classify different types of identifier name similarity observed in software projects.

Result: The study presents findings on identifier name similarity and categorizes them into types through the proposed taxonomy.

Conclusion: The taxonomy serves as an initial framework for researchers to assess the impact of identifier name similarity, with potential for refinement and expansion.

Abstract: Identifier names, which comprise a significant portion of the codebase, are
the cornerstone of effective program comprehension. However, research has shown
that poorly chosen names can significantly increase cognitive load and hinder
collaboration. Even names that appear readable in isolation may lead to
misunderstandings in contexts when they closely resemble other names in either
structure or functionality. In this exploratory study, we present our
preliminary findings on the occurrence of identifier name similarity in
software projects through the development of a taxonomy that categorizes
different forms of identifier name similarity. We envision our initial taxonomy
providing researchers with a platform to analyze and evaluate the impact of
identifier name similarity on code comprehension, maintainability, and
collaboration among developers, while also allowing for further refinement and
expansion of the taxonomy.

*Yujie Ma,Lili Quan,Xiaofei Xie,Qiang Hu,Jiongchi Yu,Yao Zhang,Sen Chen*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This study addresses supply chain security risks in large language model (LLM) systems by introducing a dataset for benchmarking and analyzing vulnerabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding and addressing risks in the supply chains of LLM systems is increasingly critical due to their widespread deployment and interdependencies.

Method: The authors collected data from 3,859 real-world LLM applications, analyzed interdependencies, and mapped the ecosystem's structure. They identified vulnerabilities using 1,555 risk-related issues from databases.

Result: Their analysis unveiled deeply nested dependencies and significant vulnerabilities within the LLM supply chain, highlighting a need for systematic security evaluation.

Conclusion: Comprehensive security analyses of LLM systems are essential, and the paper provides practical recommendations for researchers and developers to create safer systems.

Abstract: The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has led to the widespread deployment
of LLM-based systems across diverse domains. As these systems proliferate,
understanding the risks associated with their complex supply chains is
increasingly important. LLM-based systems are not standalone as they rely on
interconnected supply chains involving pretrained models, third-party
libraries, datasets, and infrastructure. Yet, most risk assessments narrowly
focus on model or data level, overlooking broader supply chain vulnerabilities.
While recent studies have begun to address LLM supply chain risks, there
remains a lack of benchmarks for systematic research.
  To address this gap, we introduce the first comprehensive dataset for
analyzing and benchmarking LLM supply chain security. We collect 3,859
real-world LLM applications and perform interdependency analysis, identifying
109,211 models, 2,474 datasets, and 9,862 libraries. We extract model
fine-tuning paths, dataset reuse, and library reliance, mapping the ecosystem's
structure. To evaluate security, we gather 1,555 risk-related issues-50 for
applications, 325 for models, 18 for datasets, and 1,229 for libraries from
public vulnerability databases.
  Using this dataset, we empirically analyze component dependencies and risks.
Our findings reveal deeply nested dependencies in LLM applications and
significant vulnerabilities across the supply chain, underscoring the need for
comprehensive security analysis. We conclude with practical recommendations to
guide researchers and developers toward safer, more trustworthy LLM-enabled
systems.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces NoCode-bench, a benchmark for evaluating large language models (LLMs) in natural language-driven no-code development tasks, revealing LLM limitations with only a 15.79% success rate.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to explore how LLMs can enable natural language-driven no-code software development, aiming to make programming more accessible and productive.

Method: The authors designed NoCode-bench, a benchmark consisting of 634 real-world tasks tied to code changes validated by test cases, along with a high-quality verified subset.

Result: Experiments showed LLMs performing poorly, with a task success rate of only 15.79%, revealing limitations like difficulty in cross-file edits, understanding codebases, and tool integration.

Conclusion: The study concludes that current LLMs are far from being capable of fully supporting no-code development, but NoCode-bench serves as a foundation for improving such technologies.

Abstract: Natural language-driven no-code development allows users to specify software
functionality using natural language (NL) instead of editing source code,
promising increased productivity and democratized development. Large language
models (LLMs) show potential in enabling this paradigm. In this context,
software documentation acts as an NL specification for functionality. This work
introduces NoCode-bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs on real-world
NL-driven feature addition tasks, consisting of 634 tasks across 10 projects
and 114k code changes. Each task pairs documentation updates with corresponding
code implementations, validated by developer-written test cases. A subset of
114 high-quality, human-verified instances, NoCode-bench Verified, ensures
reliable evaluation. Our experiments reveal that, despite high token usage, the
best LLMs achieve a task success rate of only 15.79%, highlighting challenges
in cross-file editing, codebase understanding, and tool calling. These findings
indicate that LLMs are not yet ready for fully NL-driven no-code development.
NoCode-bench lays the foundation for future advances in this area.

Abstract: Metadata play a crucial role in adopting the FAIR principles for research
software and enables findability and reusability. However, creating
high-quality metadata can be resource-intensive for researchers and research
software engineers. To address this challenge, we developed the Software
Metadata Extraction and Curation Software (SMECS) which integrates the
extraction of metadata from existing sources together with a user-friendly
interface for metadata curation. SMECS extracts metadata from online
repositories such as GitHub and presents it to researchers through an
interactive interface for further curation and export as a CodeMeta file. The
usability of SMECS was evaluated through usability experiments which confirmed
that SMECS provides a satisfactory user experience. SMECS supports the
FAIRification of research software by simplifying metadata creation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to streamline the automotive development cycle, addressing the complexity and inefficiency of creating ADAS functionalities and ensuring regulatory compliance.

Method: Leveraging Large Language Models and MDE techniques, the system begins with requirements input and utilizes model-based summarization, test scenario generation, and code development for simulations and hardware. RAG is also used for regulations-based test generation.

Result: The approach enables faster compliance processes and reduced development/testing times for ADAS functionalities.

Conclusion: GenAI and MDE can enhance ADAS-related automotive software development by automating various processes and improving both efficiency and code reliability.

Abstract: This paper introduces a GenAI-empowered approach to automated development of
automotive software, with emphasis on autonomous and Advanced Driver Assistance
Systems (ADAS) capabilities. The process starts with requirements as input,
while the main generated outputs are test scenario code for simulation
environment, together with implementation of desired ADAS capabilities
targeting hardware platform of the vehicle connected to testbench. Moreover, we
introduce additional steps for requirements consistency checking leveraging
Model-Driven Engineering (MDE). In the proposed workflow, Large Language Models
(LLMs) are used for model-based summarization of requirements (Ecore metamodel,
XMI model instance and OCL constraint creation), test scenario generation,
simulation code (Python) and target platform code generation (C++).
Additionally, Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is adopted to enhance test
scenario generation from autonomous driving regulations-related documents. Our
approach aims shorter compliance and re-engineering cycles, as well as reduced
development and testing time when it comes to ADAS-related capabilities.

TL;DR: This paper categorizes and analyzes 885 EAIR system bugs from 80 projects, highlighting EAIR-specific symptoms and causes, and identifying modules prone to these issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite the rapid evolution of EAIR systems, there is insufficient understanding of their bugs, impeding progress in correcting and preventing errors.

Method: The study systematically analyzed 885 bugs from 80 EAIR projects, categorizing them into 15 symptoms, 18 underlying causes, and identifying 13 affected modules.

Result: The analysis found 8 EAIR-specific symptoms and 8 specific causes, primarily involving AI-agent reasoning and decision-making; it also mapped causes to affected modules for targeted diagnostics.

Conclusion: The findings offer insight into EAIR bugs and provide pathways to improve error prediction, detection, and repair, enhancing the reliability of EAIR systems.

Abstract: Embodied Artificial Intelligence Robots (EAIR) is an emerging and rapidly
evolving technological domain. Ensuring their program correctness is
fundamental to their successful deployment. However, a general and in-depth
understanding of EAIR system bugs remains lacking, which hinders the
development of practices and techniques to tackle EAIR system bugs.
  To bridge this gap, we conducted the first systematic study of 885 EAIR
system bugs collected from 80 EAIR system projects to investigate their
symptoms, underlying causes, and module distribution. Our analysis takes
considerable effort, which classifies these bugs into 18 underlying causes, 15
distinct symptoms, and identifies 13 affected modules. It reveals several new
interesting findings and implications which help shed light on future research
on tackling or repairing EAIR system bugs. First, among the 15 identified
symptoms, our findings highlight 8 symptoms specific to EAIR systems, which is
characterized by severe functional failures and potential physical hazards.
Second, within the 18 underlying causes, we define 8 EAIR-specific causes, the
majority of which stem from the intricate issues of AI- agent reasoning and
decision making. Finally, to facilitate precise and efficient bug prediction,
detection, and repair, we constructed a mapping between underlying causes and
the modules in which they most frequently occur, which enables researchers to
focus diagnostic efforts on the modules most susceptible to specific bug types.

*Yan Li,Wenzhang Yang,Yuekun Wang,Jian Gao,Shaohua Wang,Yinxing Xue,Lijun Zhang*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Scheduzz, an LLM-based fuzzing tool, automates fuzz driver creation with improved efficiency, extracting API constraints and optimizing resource usage, achieving better performance than several state-of-the-art techniques and discovering new bugs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing automatic library fuzzing techniques generate irrational drivers that misuse library APIs, wasting computational resources and causing false positives during bug detection.

Method: Scheduzz employs large language models (LLMs) to understand proper API usage and extract combination constraints. It uses a dual scheduling framework to manage driver generation and execution, treating the process as an online optimization problem.

Result: Scheduzz demonstrated superior performance in tests on 33 real-world libraries, outperforming state-of-the-art tools in coverage and efficiency, and uncovered 33 new bugs, including 3 CVEs.

Conclusion: By leveraging LLM-based insights and an optimized scheduling framework, Scheduzz provides a significant improvement in library fuzzing automation, reducing resource overheads and yielding meaningful bug discoveries.

Abstract: Fuzzing a library requires experts to understand the library usage well and
craft high-quality fuzz drivers, which is tricky and tedious. Therefore, many
techniques have been proposed to automatically generate fuzz drivers. However,
they fail to generate rational fuzz drivers due to the lack of adherence to
proper library usage conventions, such as ensuring a resource is closed after
being opened. To make things worse, existing library fuzzing techniques
unconditionally execute each driver, resulting in numerous irrational drivers
that waste computational resources while contributing little coverage and
generating false positive bug reports.
  To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel automatic library fuzzing
technique, Scheduzz, an LLM-based library fuzzing technique. It leverages LLMs
to understand rational usage of libraries and extract API combination
constraints. To optimize computational resource utilization, a dual scheduling
framework is implemented to efficiently manage API combinations and fuzz
drivers. The framework models driver generation and the corresponding fuzzing
campaign as an online optimization problem. Within the scheduling loop,
multiple API combinations are selected to generate fuzz drivers, while
simultaneously, various optimized fuzz drivers are scheduled for execution or
suspension.
  We implemented Scheduzz and evaluated it in 33 real-world libraries. Compared
to baseline approaches, Scheduzz significantly reduces computational overhead
and outperforms UTopia on 16 out of 21 libraries. It achieves 1.62x, 1.50x, and
1.89x higher overall coverage than the state-of-the-art techniques CKGFuzzer,
Promptfuzz, and the handcrafted project OSS-Fuzz, respectively. In addition,
Scheduzz discovered 33 previously unknown bugs in these well-tested libraries,
3 of which have been assigned CVEs.

### [277] [YATE: The Role of Test Repair in LLM-Based Unit Test Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18316)
*Michael Konstantinou,Renzo Degiovanni,Jie M. Zhang,Mark Harman,Mike Papadakis*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces YATE, a method combining rule-based static analysis and re-prompting to repair incorrect unit tests generated by language models, leading to substantial improvements in testing effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issue of incorrect unit tests generated by language models, which are often discarded but could add value if repaired.

Method: The paper presents a repair technique named YATE that combines rule-based static analysis and re-prompting to fix incorrect tests.

Result: YATE improves testing effectiveness by covering 32.06% more lines of code and killing 21.77% more mutants compared to a plain LLM-based method. It outperforms other LLM-based methods like HITS, SYMPROMPT, TESTSPARK, and COVERUP in terms of line and branch coverage.

Conclusion: YATE demonstrates that repairing incorrect tests can significantly enhance automated test generation, achieving better performance at a comparable computational cost.

Abstract: Recent advances in automated test generation utilises language models to
produce unit tests. While effective, language models tend to generate many
incorrect tests with respect to both syntax and semantics. Although such
incorrect tests can be easily detected and discarded, they constitute a "missed
opportunity" -- if fixed, they are often valuable as they directly add testing
value (they effectively target the underlying program logic to be tested) and
indirectly form good seeds for generating additional tests. To this end, we
propose a simple technique for repairing some of these incorrect tests through
a combination of rule-based static analysis and re-prompting. We evaluate this
simple approach, named YATE, on a set of 6 open-source projects and show that
it can effectively produce tests that cover on average 32.06% more lines and
kill 21.77% more mutants than a plain LLM-based method. We also compare YATE
with four other LLM-based methods, namely HITS, SYMPROMPT, TESTSPARK and
COVERUP and show that it produces tests that cover substantially more code.
YATE achieves 22% higher line coverage, 20% higher branch coverage and kill 20%
more mutants at a comparable cost (number of calls to LLMs).

### [278] [Gotta catch 'em all! Towards File Localisation from Issues at Large](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18319)
*Jesse Maarleveld,Jiapan Guo,Daniel Feitosa*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper focuses on addressing issue file localization comprehensively, challenging bug-specific biases using statistical analysis, and promoting project-specific solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing issue localization research focuses predominantly on bugs or selected issue types, thereby neglecting general issue localization methods.

Method: The study introduces a data pipeline adaptable to diverse branching/merging setups, evaluates baseline information retrieval methods, and applies statistical analysis to assess biases.

Result: Bug-specific heuristics underperform on general issues; there are minor performance variations across issue types and small effects from identifier presence.

Conclusion: General-purpose file localization methods and project-specific adaptability are crucial due to varying characteristics between projects and issue types.

Abstract: Bug localisation, the study of developing methods to localise the files
requiring changes to resolve bugs, has been researched for a long time to
develop methods capable of saving developers' time. Recently, researchers are
starting to consider issues outside of bugs. Nevertheless, most existing
research into file localisation from issues focusses on bugs or uses other
selection methods to ensure only certain types of issues are considered as part
of the focus of the work. Our goal is to work on all issues at large, without
any specific selection.
  In this work, we provide a data pipeline for the creation of issue file
localisation datasets, capable of dealing with arbitrary branching and merging
practices. We provide a baseline performance evaluation for the file
localisation problem using traditional information retrieval approaches.
Finally, we use statistical analysis to investigate the influence of biases
known in the bug localisation community on our dataset.
  Our results show that methods designed using bug-specific heuristics perform
poorly on general issue types, indicating a need for research into general
purpose models. Furthermore, we find that there are small, but statistically
significant differences in performance between different issue types. Finally,
we find that the presence of identifiers have a small effect on performance for
most issue types. Many results are project-dependent, encouraging the
development of methods which can be tuned to project-specific characteristics.

### [279] [FMI Meets SystemC: A Framework for Cross-Tool Virtual Prototyping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18339)
*Nils Bosbach,Meik Schmidt,Lukas Jünger,Matthias Berthold,Rainer Leupers*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper highlights the integration of Functional Mock-up Interface (FMI) with SystemC-based Virtual Platforms to enhance co-simulation capabilities and software testing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing complexity of systems demands robust testing and virtual prototyping, particularly for software running on computing units like SoCs or MCUs which interact with hardware and the environment.

Method: The authors propose a framework to integrate SystemC Virtual Platforms with FMI, enabling dynamic interaction with external tools for environmental input data.

Result: A case study demonstrates successful transfer of temperature data from an external tool to a SystemC VP, enabling realistic software testing without requiring physical hardware.

Conclusion: The integration of FMI with SystemC VPs supports extensive software testing and allows earlier certification processes for standards like ISO 26262.

Abstract: As systems become more complex, the demand for thorough testing and virtual
prototyping grows. To simulate whole systems, multiple tools are usually needed
to cover different parts. These parts include the hardware of a system and the
environment with which the system interacts. The Functional Mock-up Interface
(FMI) standard for co-simulation can be used to connect these tools.
  The control part of modern systems is usually a computing unit, such as a
System-on-a-Chip (SoC) or Microcontroller Unit (MCU), which executes software
from a connected memory and interacts with peripherals. To develop software
without requiring access to physical hardware, full-system simulators, the
so-called Virtual Platforms (VPs), are commonly used. The IEEE-standardized
framework for VP development is SystemC TLM. SystemC provides interfaces and
concepts that enable modular design and model exchange. However, SystemC lacks
native FMI support, which limits the integration into broader co-simulation
environments.
  This paper presents a novel framework to control and interact with
SystemC-based VPs using the FMI. We present a case study showing how a
simulated temperature sensor in a SystemC simulation can obtain temperature
values from an external tool via FMI. This approach allows the unmodified
target software to run on the VP and receive realistic environmental input data
such as temperature, velocity, or acceleration values from other tools. Thus,
extensive software testing and verification is enabled. By having tests ready
and the software pre-tested using a VP once the physical hardware is available,
certifications like ISO 26262 can be done earlier.

*Busra Icoz,Goksel Biricik*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Researchers propose a hybrid approach combining symbolic reasoning with Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate code reviews, demonstrating improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual code reviews are subjective and time-consuming. Automating them using AI, specifically LLMs, could enhance efficiency, but current models often lack logical reasoning to fully evaluate code.

Method: The study integrates symbolic reasoning techniques with LLMs and tests their automated code review approach using the CodexGlue dataset. It compares several models like CodeT5, CodeBERT, and GraphCodeBERT.

Result: The hybrid approach combining symbolic reasoning and LLMs enhances the accuracy and efficiency of automated code reviews.

Conclusion: Incorporating symbolic reasoning with LLMs is a promising direction for improving automated code reviews, overcoming limitations of current AI models in understanding and evaluating code.

Abstract: Code review is one of the key processes in the software development lifecycle
and is essential to maintain code quality. However, manual code review is
subjective and time consuming. Given its rule-based nature, code review is well
suited for automation. In recent years, significant efforts have been made to
automate this process with the help of artificial intelligence. Recent
developments in Large Language Models (LLMs) have also emerged as a promising
tool in this area, but these models often lack the logical reasoning
capabilities needed to fully understand and evaluate code. To overcome this
limitation, this study proposes a hybrid approach that integrates symbolic
reasoning techniques with LLMs to automate the code review process. We tested
our approach using the CodexGlue dataset, comparing several models, including
CodeT5, CodeBERT, and GraphCodeBERT, to assess the effectiveness of combining
symbolic reasoning and prompting techniques with LLMs. Our results show that
this approach improves the accuracy and efficiency of automated code review.

*Zezhou Yang,Ting Peng,Cuiyun Gao,Chaozheng Wang,Hailiang Huang,Yuetang Deng*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: An empirical study explores retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods for code completion in industrial-scale closed-source environments, using various retrieval techniques and LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhancing code completion capabilities in closed-source settings while addressing a distribution shift compared to open-source repositories.

Method: Studied identifier-based and similarity-based RAG across 26 LLMs with lexical and semantic retrieval methods over closed-source codebases.

Result: Similarity-based RAG performs best, with advanced retrieval techniques like BM25 and GTE-Qwen enhancing effectiveness; a blend of retrieval methods achieves optimal results.

Conclusion: RAG methods show utility in closed-source codebases with diverse retrieval strategies, validated via developer feedback in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Code completion, a crucial task in software engineering that enhances
developer productivity, has seen substantial improvements with the rapid
advancement of large language models (LLMs). In recent years,
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has emerged as a promising method to
enhance the code completion capabilities of LLMs, which leverages relevant
context from codebases without requiring model retraining. While existing
studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of RAG on public repositories and
benchmarks, the potential distribution shift between open-source and
closed-source codebases presents unique challenges that remain unexplored. To
mitigate the gap, we conduct an empirical study to investigate the performance
of widely-used RAG methods for code completion in the industrial-scale codebase
of WeChat, one of the largest proprietary software systems. Specifically, we
extensively explore two main types of RAG methods, namely identifier-based RAG
and similarity-based RAG, across 26 open-source LLMs ranging from 0.5B to 671B
parameters. For a more comprehensive analysis, we employ different retrieval
techniques for similarity-based RAG, including lexical and semantic retrieval.
Based on 1,669 internal repositories, we achieve several key findings: (1) both
RAG methods demonstrate effectiveness in closed-source repositories, with
similarity-based RAG showing superior performance, (2) the effectiveness of
similarity-based RAG improves with more advanced retrieval techniques, where
BM25 (lexical retrieval) and GTE-Qwen (semantic retrieval) achieve superior
performance, and (3) the combination of lexical and semantic retrieval
techniques yields optimal results, demonstrating complementary strengths.
Furthermore, we conduct a developer survey to validate the practical utility of
RAG methods in real-world development environments.

*Semih Eren,Deniz Kucukahmetler,Nico Scherf*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: This study introduces a multimodal framework to predict fMRI cortical responses during movie viewing, achieving competitive results in the Algonauts 2025 challenge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how the human brain integrates multisensory information during naturalistic stimuli to predict distributed cortical responses.

Method: A hierarchical multimodal recurrent ensemble using pretrained video, audio, and language embeddings mapped to fMRI time series, with bidirectional RNNs and subject-specific heads guided by a composite loss and curriculum training.

Result: Achieved third place on the Algonauts leaderboard with a Pearson correlation r=0.2094 and peak single-parcel score mean r=0.63, especially excelling with the most challenging subject.

Conclusion: This approach provides a robust, extensible benchmark method for multimodal brain encoding tasks, merging sensory data and temporal dynamics effectively.

Abstract: Accurately predicting distributed cortical responses to naturalistic stimuli
requires models that integrate visual, auditory and semantic information over
time. We present a hierarchical multimodal recurrent ensemble that maps
pretrained video, audio, and language embeddings to fMRI time series recorded
while four subjects watched almost 80 hours of movies provided by the Algonauts
2025 challenge. Modality-specific bidirectional RNNs encode temporal dynamics;
their hidden states are fused and passed to a second recurrent layer, and
lightweight subject-specific heads output responses for 1000 cortical parcels.
Training relies on a composite MSE-correlation loss and a curriculum that
gradually shifts emphasis from early sensory to late association regions.
Averaging 100 model variants further boosts robustness. The resulting system
ranked third on the competition leaderboard, achieving an overall Pearson r =
0.2094 and the highest single-parcel peak score (mean r = 0.63) among all
participants, with particularly strong gains for the most challenging subject
(Subject 5). The approach establishes a simple, extensible baseline for future
multimodal brain-encoding benchmarks.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable CCA in online, high-dimensional, and real-time settings for analyzing correlated features in streaming datasets.

Method: Developed the SWICCA methodology by employing a streaming PCA backend combined with a sliding window of samples. Theoretical guarantees and simulations were also provided.

Result: SWICCA demonstrated scalable performance in extremely high-dimensional data and was validated through a real-data example.

Conclusion: SWICCA is a scalable, effective extension of CCA to online, streaming scenarios and performs well in real-time, high-dimensional applications.

Abstract: Canonical correlation analysis (CCA) is a technique for finding correlated
sets of features between two datasets. In this paper, we propose a novel
extension of CCA to the online, streaming data setting: Sliding Window
Informative Canonical Correlation Analysis (SWICCA). Our method uses a
streaming principal component analysis (PCA) algorithm as a backend and uses
these outputs combined with a small sliding window of samples to estimate the
CCA components in real time. We motivate and describe our algorithm, provide
numerical simulations to characterize its performance, and provide a
theoretical performance guarantee. The SWICCA method is applicable and scalable
to extremely high dimensions, and we provide a real-data example that
demonstrates this capability.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a two-armed bandit framework for A/B testing designed to improve existing approaches, validated through theoretical, numerical, and real-world experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With A/B testing widely used to compare new policies against controls, there is a need to enhance existing causal inference and reinforcement learning methods for better reliability and performance.

Method: The approach involves three steps: (i) using doubly robust estimation for pseudo-outcomes, (ii) using a two-armed bandit framework to construct the test statistic, and (iii) employing a permutation-based method to compute the p-value.

Result: The proposed method demonstrates superior efficacy compared to existing methods, as proven through asymptotic theories, simulations, and application to real-world data from a ridesharing company.

Conclusion: The two-armed bandit framework offers an improved methodology for A/B testing, combining statistical robustness with practical utility in real-world applications.

Abstract: A/B testing is widely used in modern technology companies for policy
evaluation and product deployment, with the goal of comparing the outcomes
under a newly-developed policy against a standard control. Various causal
inference and reinforcement learning methods developed in the literature are
applicable to A/B testing. This paper introduces a two-armed bandit framework
designed to improve the power of existing approaches. The proposed procedure
consists of three main steps: (i) employing doubly robust estimation to
generate pseudo-outcomes, (ii) utilizing a two-armed bandit framework to
construct the test statistic, and (iii) applying a permutation-based method to
compute the $p$-value. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method
through asymptotic theories, numerical experiments and real-world data from a
ridesharing company, showing its superior performance in comparison to existing
methods.

*Stefan Klus,Jason J. Bramburger*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper links stochastic signal processes to random walks on graphons and develops methods to estimate operator properties for clustering and reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to connect stochastic time-evolving signals with graphon theory to enable advanced spectral clustering and reconstruction techniques.

Method: The study employs transfer operators like the Koopman and Perron-Frobenius operators on graphons, estimating their properties from signal data and extending clustering methods from graphs to graphons.

Result: The authors show methods for cluster detection, transition probability density reconstruction, and reversible graphon estimation using synthetic and real-world data.

Conclusion: This work broadens the scope of graph-based analysis to graphons, offering tools for processing stochastic signals while showcasing practical applications.

Abstract: Many signals evolve in time as a stochastic process, randomly switching
between states over discretely sampled time points. Here we make an explicit
link between the underlying stochastic process of a signal that can take on a
bounded continuum of values and a random walk process on a graphon. Graphons
are infinite-dimensional objects that represent the limit of convergent
sequences of graphs whose size tends to infinity. We introduce transfer
operators, such as the Koopman and Perron--Frobenius operators, associated with
random walk processes on graphons and then illustrate how these operators can
be estimated from signal data and how their eigenvalues and eigenfunctions can
be used for detecting clusters, thereby extending conventional spectral
clustering methods from graphs to graphons. Furthermore, we show that it is
also possible to reconstruct transition probability densities and, if the
random walk process is reversible, the graphon itself using only the signal.
The resulting data-driven methods are applied to a variety of synthetic and
real-world signals, including daily average temperatures and stock index
values.

TL;DR: The paper discusses vulnerabilities in machine learning models related to training data reconstruction attacks and proposes a mathematical framework to address this issue.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the vulnerability of releasing trained model specifications and parameters, which can lead to training data reconstruction attacks.

Method: The paper uses a mathematical framework, maximum mean discrepancy equivalence, and a score matching framework to assess and reconstruct training data from both Bayesian and non-Bayesian models.

Result: It characterizes features of training data vulnerable to reconstruction and provides tools for data reconstruction in both model types.

Conclusion: This study contributes to understanding and mitigating training data reconstruction vulnerabilities, with a novel approach in Bayesian models.

Abstract: Publicly releasing the specification of a model with its trained parameters
means an adversary can attempt to reconstruct information about the training
data via training data reconstruction attacks, a major vulnerability of modern
machine learning methods. This paper makes three primary contributions:
establishing a mathematical framework to express the problem, characterising
the features of the training data that are vulnerable via a maximum mean
discrepancy equivalance and outlining a score matching framework for
reconstructing data in both Bayesian and non-Bayesian models, the former is a
first in the literature.

*Miguel Aspis,Sebastián A. Cajas Ordónez,Andrés L. Suárez-Cetrulo,Ricardo Simón Carbajo*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces DriftMoE, an online Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) model designed for efficiently handling concept drift in non-stationary data streams.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to create a resource-efficient, adaptable model that improves on previous ensemble methods, which often rely on coarse-grained adaptations and simple voting mechanisms.

Method: The method involves a co-training framework where a neural router works alongside incrementally trained Hoeffding tree experts. The router selects the best expert for predictions, while a symbiotic learning loop refines both the router and expert specialization driven by feedback signals.

Result: DriftMoE was tested on nine state-of-the-art benchmarks and showed competitive performance against existing adaptive ensemble methods. Two configurations were assessed: a multi-class and task-based single-class specialization mode.

Conclusion: DriftMoE offers a principled and efficient strategy for dealing with concept drift, advancing the state-of-the-art in stream learning. Code and data for replication are publicly available on GitHub.

Abstract: Learning from non-stationary data streams subject to concept drift requires
models that can adapt on-the-fly while remaining resource-efficient. Existing
adaptive ensemble methods often rely on coarse-grained adaptation mechanisms or
simple voting schemes that fail to optimally leverage specialized knowledge.
This paper introduces DriftMoE, an online Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture
that addresses these limitations through a novel co-training framework.
DriftMoE features a compact neural router that is co-trained alongside a pool
of incremental Hoeffding tree experts. The key innovation lies in a symbiotic
learning loop that enables expert specialization: the router selects the most
suitable expert for prediction, the relevant experts update incrementally with
the true label, and the router refines its parameters using a multi-hot
correctness mask that reinforces every accurate expert. This feedback loop
provides the router with a clear training signal while accelerating expert
specialization. We evaluate DriftMoE's performance across nine state-of-the-art
data stream learning benchmarks spanning abrupt, gradual, and real-world drifts
testing two distinct configurations: one where experts specialize on data
regimes (multi-class variant), and another where they focus on single-class
specialization (task-based variant). Our results demonstrate that DriftMoE
achieves competitive results with state-of-the-art stream learning adaptive
ensembles, offering a principled and efficient approach to concept drift
adaptation. All code, data pipelines, and reproducibility scripts are available
in our public GitHub repository: https://github.com/miguel-ceadar/drift-moe.

*Keyi Li,Yuval Kluger,Boris Landa*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper proposes a method to estimate noise magnitudes and correct pairwise Euclidean distances under heteroskedastic noise, achieving accuracy even in high-dimensional, noisy data scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Heteroskedastic noise distorts pairwise Euclidean distances and misrepresents data geometry, leading to challenges in analysis and downstream tasks.

Method: The authors introduce a hyperparameter-free, principled approach to jointly estimate noise magnitudes and correct distances, with theoretical guarantees of convergence and error bounds.

Result: Their method performs robustly under challenging noise conditions, accurately estimating distances on synthetic datasets and improving tasks such as nearest neighbor identification in single-cell RNA sequencing data.

Conclusion: The method enables enhanced robustness in distance-based computations, making it a valuable tool for noise-prone, high-dimensional applications.

Abstract: Pairwise Euclidean distance calculation is a fundamental step in many machine
learning and data analysis algorithms. In real-world applications, however,
these distances are frequently distorted by heteroskedastic
noise$\unicode{x2014}$a prevalent form of inhomogeneous corruption
characterized by variable noise magnitudes across data observations. Such noise
inflates the computed distances in a nontrivial way, leading to
misrepresentations of the underlying data geometry. In this work, we address
the tasks of estimating the noise magnitudes per observation and correcting the
pairwise Euclidean distances under heteroskedastic noise. Perhaps surprisingly,
we show that in general high-dimensional settings and without assuming prior
knowledge on the clean data structure or noise distribution, both tasks can be
performed reliably, even when the noise levels vary considerably. Specifically,
we develop a principled, hyperparameter-free approach that jointly estimates
the noise magnitudes and corrects the distances. We provide theoretical
guarantees for our approach, establishing probabilistic bounds on the
estimation errors of both noise magnitudes and distances. These bounds,
measured in the normalized $\ell_1$ norm, converge to zero at polynomial rates
as both feature dimension and dataset size increase. Experiments on synthetic
datasets demonstrate that our method accurately estimates distances in
challenging regimes, significantly improving the robustness of subsequent
distance-based computations. Notably, when applied to single-cell RNA
sequencing data, our method yields noise magnitude estimates consistent with an
established prototypical model, enabling accurate nearest neighbor
identification that is fundamental to many downstream analyses.

*Takumi Kato,Zhi Li Hu*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: The paper introduces a lightweight simulator to reduce modeling time for designing industrial systems, achieving a 78.3% time reduction compared to conventional simulators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Industrial system design often requires critical decisions with limited early-phase information, leading to inaccuracies that are hard to correct later.

Method: The authors propose a Rapid Modeling Architecture (RMA) and build a prototype simulator aimed at reducing modeling time while retaining essential details.

Result: The prototype achieved a significant reduction in modeling time (78.3%) compared to existing simulators while addressing real factory layout design challenges.

Conclusion: The RMA-based simulator effectively accelerates early-phase decision-making in industrial system design, highlighting potential for widespread application.

Abstract: Designing industrial systems, such as building, improving, and automating
distribution centers and manufacturing plants, involves critical
decision-making with limited information in the early phases. The lack of
information leads to less accurate designs of the systems, which are often
difficult to resolve later. It is effective to use simulators to model the
designed system and find out the issues early. However, the modeling time
required by conventional simulators is too long to allow for rapid model
creation to meet decision-making demands. In this paper, we propose a Rapid
Modeling Architecture (RMA) for a lightweight industrial simulator that
mitigates the modeling burden while maintaining the essential details in order
to accelerate and improve decision-making. We have prototyped a simulator based
on the RMA and applied it to the actual factory layout design problem. We also
compared the modeling time of our simulator to that of an existing simulator,
and as a result, our simulator achieved a 78.3% reduction in modeling time
compared to conventional simulators.

Motivation: The motivation is to explore the under-researched implications of different GNN architectures (GCNs, GATs, and GINs) in applying geometric deep learning to AI-driven cheminformatics, particularly for toxicological datasets with differing data abundances and binary classification tasks.

Method: The study involves preprocessing molecular graphs, balancing and stratifying seven diverse toxicological datasets, performing Bayesian optimizations for each of the 21 combinations of GNNs and datasets, and comparing their optimized performances based on AUC scores.

Result: GINs consistently outperformed GCNs and GATs for the top 5 data-abundant assays, whereas GATs excelled in the 2 data-scarce assays. AUC scores across models ranged from 0.728 to 0.849 post-optimization.

Conclusion: GINs are optimal for data-rich scenarios, and GATs are better suited to data-scarce conditions. Additional analysis highlighted the distinct optimization behavior and uniqueness of these architectures, particularly for GINs.

to perform binary classification of assay activation. Following pre-processing
of molecular graphs, enforcement of class-balance and stratification of all
datasets across 5 folds, Bayesian optimisations were carried out, for each GNN
applied to each assay dataset (resulting in 21 unique Bayesian optimisations).
Optimised GNNs performed at Area Under the Curve (AUC) scores ranging from
0.728-0.849 (averaged across all folds), naturally varying between specific
assays and GNNs. GINs were found to consistently outperform GCNs and GATs, for
the top 5 of 7 most data-abundant toxicological assays. GATs however
significantly outperformed over the remaining 2 most data-scarce assays. This
indicates that GINs are a more optimal architecture for data-abundant
environments, whereas GATs are a more optimal architecture for data-scarce
environments. Subsequent analysis of the explored higher-dimensional
hyperparameter spaces, as well as optimised hyperparameter states, found that
GCNs and GATs reached measurably closer optimised states with each other,
compared to GINs, further indicating the unique nature of GINs as a GNN
algorithm.

*Camille Challier,Xiaowu Sun,Thabo Mahendiran,Ortal Senouf,Bernard De Bruyne,Denise Auberson,Olivier Müller,Stephane Fournier,Pascal Frossard,Emmanuel Abbé,Dorina Thanou*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: The paper introduces CM-UNet, a model leveraging self-supervised pre-training and transfer learning to improve coronary artery segmentation accuracy with limited annotated data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurately segmenting coronary arteries is difficult due to a lack of large, annotated datasets, limiting the development of automated diagnostic tools.

Method: The method involves self-supervised pre-training on unannotated datasets combined with transfer learning on small annotated datasets, requiring only 18 annotated images for fine-tuning.

Result: CM-UNet showed a Dice score decrease of 15.2% with only 18 annotated images compared to a larger 46.5% drop for baseline models without pre-training.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the potential of self-supervised learning in improving coronary artery segmentation, reducing manual annotation needs, improving diagnostic accuracy, and optimizing clinical workflows.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of coronary arteries remains a significant challenge in
clinical practice, hindering the ability to effectively diagnose and manage
coronary artery disease. The lack of large, annotated datasets for model
training exacerbates this issue, limiting the development of automated tools
that could assist radiologists. To address this, we introduce CM-UNet, which
leverages self-supervised pre-training on unannotated datasets and transfer
learning on limited annotated data, enabling accurate disease detection while
minimizing the need for extensive manual annotations. Fine-tuning CM-UNet with
only 18 annotated images instead of 500 resulted in a 15.2% decrease in Dice
score, compared to a 46.5% drop in baseline models without pre-training. This
demonstrates that self-supervised learning can enhance segmentation performance
and reduce dependence on large datasets. This is one of the first studies to
highlight the importance of self-supervised learning in improving coronary
artery segmentation from X-ray angiography, with potential implications for
advancing diagnostic accuracy in clinical practice. By enhancing segmentation
accuracy in X-ray angiography images, the proposed approach aims to improve
clinical workflows, reduce radiologists' workload, and accelerate disease
detection, ultimately contributing to better patient outcomes. The source code

*Andrew Jeyathasan,Swati Banerjee*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The paper discusses multisensory integration (MSI) and highlights the need to study interactions involving three or more sensory modalities, considering factors such as cross-modal correspondence, congruence, cognitive load, and timing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the gap in understanding multisensory integration involving three or more modalities, which is essential for cohesive perception and immersive technologies.

Method: The authors explore key factors influencing MSI studies, such as cross-modal correspondence, congruence, cognitive load, and stimulus timing, and propose considerations for designing effective MSI study protocols.

Result: The paper identifies the complexity in MSI as modalities multiply and provides insights on addressing these complexities in research.

Conclusion: The authors emphasize the importance of incorporating multiple sensory modalities in MSI studies and present guidelines for effective protocol designs to advance understanding in this field.

Abstract: We experience the world through multiple senses that work together to create
a cohesive perception, whether in daily life or immersive technologies.
Understanding this multisensory integration (MSI) requires examining the
interactions between sensory modalities, each with unique temporal dynamics and
characteristics. While most research focuses on unimodal or bimodal cues, the
integration of three or more modalities remains underexplored. MSI studies must
account for factors like cross-modal correspondence, congruence, cognitive
load, and stimulus timing, which become increasingly complex as modalities
multiply. This article examines these key factors and how they can be applied
to 8 design effective MSI study protocols.

### [293] [Automated Brake Onset Detection in Naturalistic Driving Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17943)
*Shu-Yuan Liu,Johan Engström,Gustav Markkula*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The paper proposes an algorithm to estimate brake onset for evaluating response timing in driving scenarios without relying on vehicle control signals, useful for large-scale ADS log data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods of determining response timing often involve manual annotation or control signals, which are impractical for large datasets or ADS log data without vehicle control signals.

Method: The authors developed a piecewise linear acceleration algorithm to estimate brake onset automatically. They also introduced a manual annotation method to validate the algorithm against naturalistic collision avoidance data.

Result: The algorithm demonstrated efficient performance and its accuracy was validated against human manual annotations with confidence measured by R2 values.

Conclusion: The proposed algorithm is applicable across various road users and scenarios, offering a scalable and configurable solution despite certain limitations.

Abstract: Response timing measures play a crucial role in the assessment of automated
driving systems (ADS) in collision avoidance scenarios, including but not
limited to establishing human benchmarks and comparing ADS to human driver
response performance. For example, measuring the response time (of a human
driver or ADS) to a conflict requires the determination of a stimulus onset and
a response onset. In existing studies, response onset relies on manual
annotation or vehicle control signals such as accelerator and brake pedal
movements. These methods are not applicable when analyzing large scale data
where vehicle control signals are not available. This holds in particular for
the rapidly expanding sets of ADS log data where the behavior of surrounding
road users is observed via onboard sensors. To advance evaluation techniques
for ADS and enable measuring response timing when vehicle control signals are
not available, we developed a simple and efficient algorithm, based on a
piecewise linear acceleration model, to automatically estimate brake onset that
can be applied to any type of driving data that includes vehicle longitudinal
time series data. We also proposed a manual annotation method to identify brake
onset and used it as ground truth for validation. R2 was used as a confidence
metric to measure the accuracy of the algorithm, and its classification
performance was analyzed using naturalistic collision avoidance data of both
ADS and humans, where our method was validated against human manual annotation.
Although our algorithm is subject to certain limitations, it is efficient,
generalizable, applicable to any road user and scenario types, and is highly
configurable.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: This paper evaluates four communication strategies among AI agents in a math problem-solving environment, finding peer-to-peer collaboration to be most effective.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how AI communication strategies can optimize collaborative problem-solving in educational settings.

Method: Assessment of four interaction modes (teacher-student, peer-to-peer, reciprocal teaching, critical debate) using dual GPT-4o agents on the MATH dataset.

Result: Dual-agent setups generally perform better, with peer-to-peer collaboration yielding the highest performance.

Conclusion: Effective communication strategies enhance multi-agent framework performance for complex educational tasks.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents are increasingly utilized in AI-aided
education to support tutoring and learning. Effective communication strategies
among LLM agents improve collaborative problem-solving efficiency and
facilitate cost-effective adoption in education. However, little research has
systematically evaluated the impact of different communication strategies on
agents' problem-solving. Our study examines four communication modes,
\textit{teacher-student interaction}, \textit{peer-to-peer collaboration},
\textit{reciprocal peer teaching}, and \textit{critical debate}, in a
dual-agent, chat-based mathematical problem-solving environment using the
OpenAI GPT-4o model. Evaluated on the MATH dataset, our results show that
dual-agent setups outperform single agents, with \textit{peer-to-peer
collaboration} achieving the highest accuracy. Dialogue acts like statements,
acknowledgment, and hints play a key role in collaborative problem-solving.
While multi-agent frameworks enhance computational tasks, effective
communication strategies are essential for tackling complex problems in AI
education.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The paper introduces an AI-powered ambient scribe application that creates SOAP notes for clinicians, reducing their cognitive and documentation burden while improving note quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing clinician burnout and administrative burdens in telehealth settings by automating documentation tasks.

Method: The application integrates Whisper for transcription and uses a GPT-4o pipeline for generating notes, supported by fine-tuned BART for post-processing.

Result: The AI-generated notes are better than expert-written notes, and clinicians report reduced cognitive load (94%) and documentation burden (97%). The app has over 540 users.

Conclusion: AI systems can significantly alleviate administrative tasks and enhance healthcare quality, as demonstrated by the widespread adoption and effectiveness of the system.

Abstract: Clinician burnout has motivated the growing adoption of ambient medical
scribes in the clinic. In this work, we introduce a custom-built ambient scribe
application integrated into the EHR system at Included Health, a personalized
all-in-one healthcare company offering telehealth services. The application
uses Whisper for transcription and a modular in-context learning pipeline with
GPT-4o to automatically generate SOAP notes and patient instructions. Testing
on mock visit data shows that the notes generated by the application exceed the
quality of expert-written notes as determined by an LLM-as-a-judge. The
application has been widely adopted by the clinical practice, with over 540
clinicians at Included Health using the application at least once. 94% (n = 63)
of surveyed clinicians report reduced cognitive load during visits and 97% (n =
66) report less documentation burden when using the application. Additionally,
we show that post-processing notes with a fine-tuned BART model improves
conciseness. These findings highlight the potential for AI systems to ease
administrative burdens and support clinicians in delivering efficient,
high-quality care.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how emerging AI tools can redefine traditional human-centered design workflows by integrating AI as an active creative collaborator.

Method: Examination of iterative interactions between designers and AI models (e.g., LLMs and diffusion models) focusing on ideation, visualization, and decision-making processes.

Result: Findings highlight how AI models like GPT-4 and Stable Diffusion enhance creativity and collaboration in the design process.

Conclusion: AI can serve as an active participant in early-stage design, shifting the role of AI from automation to co-creation.

Abstract: As artificial intelligence (AI) continues to evolve from a back-end
computational tool into an interactive, generative collaborator, its
integration into early-stage design processes demands a rethinking of
traditional workflows in human-centered design. This paper explores the
emergent paradigm of human-AI co-creation, where AI is not merely used for
automation or efficiency gains, but actively participates in ideation, visual
conceptualization, and decision-making. Specifically, we investigate the use of
large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 and multimodal diffusion models such as
Stable Diffusion as creative agents that engage designers in iterative cycles
of proposal, critique, and revision.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The paper explores how educators use generative AI in teaching through a large-scale analysis of over 140,000 teacher-AI interactions, showing that tools like Claude 3.5 Haiku can enhance teacher support and professional development.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to understand how educators integrate generative AI into their teaching practices and to develop scalable methods to study these interactions at a large scale.

Method: The study employed a four-phase human-AI collaborative coding process involving theme discovery, codebook development, structured annotation, and model benchmarking for analyzing educator-AI messages.

Result: The study found that teachers used AI extensively for instructional planning (79.7%), content creation/adaptation (76.1%), and other professional tasks, while demonstrating that Claude 3.5 Haiku excelled at qualitative coding against open-weight models.

Conclusion: Generative AI, such as Claude 3.5 Haiku, can effectively support educators' instructional needs and professional development, offering a scalable model for AI-augmented qualitative research in education.

Abstract: The integration of large language models (LLMs) into educational tools has
the potential to substantially impact how teachers plan instruction, support
diverse learners, and engage in professional reflection. Yet little is known
about how educators actually use these tools in practice and how their
interactions with AI can be meaningfully studied at scale. This paper presents
a human-AI collaborative methodology for large-scale qualitative analysis of
over 140,000 educator-AI messages drawn from a generative AI platform used by
K-12 teachers. Through a four-phase coding pipeline, we combined inductive
theme discovery, codebook development, structured annotation, and model
benchmarking to examine patterns of educator engagement and evaluate the
performance of LLMs in qualitative coding tasks. We developed a hierarchical
codebook aligned with established teacher evaluation frameworks, capturing
educators' instructional goals, contextual needs, and pedagogical strategies.
Our findings demonstrate that LLMs, particularly Claude 3.5 Haiku, can reliably
support theme identification, extend human recognition in complex scenarios,
and outperform open-weight models in both accuracy and structural reliability.
The analysis also reveals substantive patterns in how educators inquire AI to
enhance instructional practices (79.7 percent of total conversations), create
or adapt content (76.1 percent), support assessment and feedback loop (46.9
percent), attend to student needs for tailored instruction (43.3 percent), and
assist other professional responsibilities (34.2 percent), highlighting
emerging AI-related competencies that have direct implications for teacher
preparation and professional development. This study offers a scalable,
transparent model for AI-augmented qualitative research and provides
foundational insights into the evolving role of generative AI in educational
practice.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: PosterMate is a generative AI-powered tool that facilitates poster designing by simulating diverse audience feedback and collaborative discussions among persona agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address challenges in gathering and reconciling feedback from diverse audiences for poster design by leveraging generative AI.

Method: PosterMate uses generative AI to construct audience persona agents based on marketing documents. These agents provide feedback and engage in moderated discussions to suggest edits.

Result: User studies showed PosterMate effectively captures overlooked viewpoints and serves as a useful prototyping tool. Online evaluation confirmed the feedback aligns with persona identities and discussions synthesize diverse perspectives.

Conclusion: PosterMate demonstrates potential as a practical and innovative tool for improving design processes through simulated audience feedback and collaboration.

Abstract: Poster designing can benefit from synchronous feedback from target audiences.
However, gathering audiences with diverse perspectives and reconciling them on
design edits can be challenging. Recent generative AI models present
opportunities to simulate human-like interactions, but it is unclear how they
may be used for feedback processes in design. We introduce PosterMate, a poster
design assistant that facilitates collaboration by creating audience-driven
persona agents constructed from marketing documents. PosterMate gathers
feedback from each persona agent regarding poster components, and stimulates
discussion with the help of a moderator to reach a conclusion. These
agreed-upon edits can then be directly integrated into the poster design.
Through our user study (N=12), we identified the potential of PosterMate to
capture overlooked viewpoints, while serving as an effective prototyping tool.
Additionally, our controlled online evaluation (N=100) revealed that the
feedback from an individual persona agent is appropriate given its persona
identity, and the discussion effectively synthesizes the different persona
agents' perspectives.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Eye-tracking data provides valuable insights into users' cognitive states but poses analysis challenges due to its structured and non-linguistic nature, necessitating new approaches.

Method: The framework incorporates multi-stage segmentation, expert-and-model co-scoring, and hybrid anomaly detection by combining LSTM modeling with LLM-enhanced analysis.

Result: Experiments across various LLMs and prompts demonstrated improvements in accuracy, consistency, and interpretability, achieving a 50% accuracy in difficulty prediction tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed multimodal framework effectively integrates eye-tracking analysis with LLM reasoning, offering scalable insights with applications in learning, HCI, and educational fields.

Abstract: Eye-tracking data reveals valuable insights into users' cognitive states but
is difficult to analyze due to its structured, non-linguistic nature. While
large language models (LLMs) excel at reasoning over text, they struggle with
temporal and numerical data. This paper presents a multimodal human-AI
collaborative framework designed to enhance cognitive pattern extraction from
eye-tracking signals. The framework includes: (1) a multi-stage pipeline using
horizontal and vertical segmentation alongside LLM reasoning to uncover latent
gaze patterns; (2) an Expert-Model Co-Scoring Module that integrates expert
judgment with LLM output to generate trust scores for behavioral
interpretations; and (3) a hybrid anomaly detection module combining LSTM-based
temporal modeling with LLM-driven semantic analysis. Our results across several
LLMs and prompt strategies show improvements in consistency, interpretability,
and performance, with up to 50% accuracy in difficulty prediction tasks. This
approach offers a scalable, interpretable solution for cognitive modeling and
has broad potential in adaptive learning, human-computer interaction, and

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of multi-dimensional data visualization in terms of losslessness, occlusion, computational capability, and interpretability.

Method: The paper proposes the use of Concentric Coordinates, a generalization of Parallel and Circular Coordinates, as a visualization method capable of supporting machine learning algorithm interpretation and human interaction.

Result: The proposed method provides an alternative high-dimensional visualization framework that is compact, interpretable, and capable of losslessly representing data.

Conclusion: Concentric Coordinates offer an effective and computationally efficient solution for visualizing high-dimensional data while mitigating challenges like occlusion and loss of detail.

Abstract: The visualization of multi-dimensional data with interpretable methods
remains limited by capabilities for both high-dimensional lossless

that are a more compact generalization of Parallel Coordinates along with
former Circular Coordinates. These are forms of the General Line Coordinate
visualizations that can directly support machine learning algorithm
visualization and facilitate human interaction.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a variational deep learning framework to calculate the equation of state for hydrogen in warm dense matter using three generative models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address discrepancies in theoretical and experimental results for hydrogen's thermodynamic properties in warm dense matter, particularly on the deuterium Hugoniot curve.

Method: Employ three advanced generative models: a normalizing flow for hydrogen nuclei, a transformer for excited electron states, and a permutational equivariant flow for electron backflow coordinates. These models are jointly optimized by minimizing variational free energy.

Result: Obtained the equation of state and related properties of dense hydrogen, matching experimental and theoretical benchmarks, and reducing many discrepancies.

Conclusion: The proposed framework not only resolves certain inaccuracies in theoretical vs experimental data but also provides a reliable benchmark for studying hydrogen's warm dense matter properties.

Abstract: We develop a deep variational free energy framework to compute the equation
of state of hydrogen in the warm dense matter region. This method parameterizes
the variational density matrix of hydrogen nuclei and electrons at finite
temperature using three deep generative models: a normalizing flow model that
represents the Boltzmann distribution of the classical nuclei, an
autoregressive transformer that models the distribution of electrons in excited
states, and a permutational equivariant flow model that constructs backflow
coordinates for electrons in Hartree-Fock orbitals. By jointly optimizing the
three neural networks to minimize the variational free energy, we obtain the
equation of state and related thermodynamic properties of dense hydrogen. We
compare our results with other theoretical and experimental results on the
deuterium Hugoniot curve, aiming to resolve existing discrepancies. The
calculated results provide a valuable benchmark for deuterium in the warm dense
matter region.

Main category: math.LO

TL;DR: Kit Fine's work on ignorance and Rumsfeld ignorance revealed logical properties, but definability issues arose because they shared accessibility relations. This paper modifies these relations and provides axiomatizations to resolve those issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clarify and address the definability issue in Kit Fine's logical framework regarding ignorance and Rumsfeld ignorance due to identical accessibility relations.

Method: Assume different accessibility relations for implicit knowledge operators, making one a subset of the other, and develop axiomatizations over proper bi-frame classes.

Result: Presented axiomatizations that maintain previous validities while avoiding definability issues caused by shared accessibility relations.

Conclusion: The proposed modifications resolve definability issues, preserve existing results, and analyze Fine's framework more effectively.

Abstract: In a recent paper, Kit Fine presents some striking results concerning the
logical properties of (first-order) ignorance, second-order ignorance and
Rumsfeld ignorance. However, Rumsfeld ignorance is definable in terms of
ignorance, which makes some existing results and the axiomatization problem
trivial. A main reason is that the accessibility relations for the implicit
knowledge operator contained in the packaged operators of ignorance and
Rumsfeld ignorance are the same. In this work, we assume the two accessibility
relations to be different so that one of them is an arbitrary subset of the
other. This will avoid the definability issue and retain most of the previous
validities. The main results are axiomatizations over various proper bi-frame
classes. Finally we apply our framework to analyze Fine's results.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a nonconvex optimization framework for designing group-sparse feedback controllers in distributed and sparse feedback LQ problems, using a penalty-based PALM algorithm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of designing scalable and structure-aware controllers in large-scale systems with specific sparsity patterns in infinite-horizon LQ problems.

Method: The study formulates the controller synthesis as a nonconvex optimization problem with group $\ell_0$-norm regularization and introduces the penalty-based proximal alternating linearized minimization (PALM) algorithm with convergence guarantees.

Result: The unified framework connects distributed and sparse feedback LQ problems, solving them without relying on convex relaxations or predefined block-diagonal structures, and guarantees global convergence to critical points.

Conclusion: The proposed framework provides a robust and efficient solution for group-sparse feedback design, filling a gap in the literature with theoretical guarantees and without conventional restrictive assumptions.

Abstract: This paper develops a unified nonconvex optimization framework for the design
of group-sparse feedback controllers in infinite-horizon linear-quadratic (LQ)
problems. We address two prominent extensions of the classical LQ problem: the
distributed LQ problem with fixed communication topology (DFT-LQ) and the
sparse feedback LQ problem (SF-LQ), both of which are motivated by the need for
scalable and structure-aware control in large-scale systems. Unlike existing
approaches that rely on convex relaxations or are limited to block-diagonal
structures, we directly formulate the controller synthesis as a
finite-dimensional nonconvex optimization problem with group $\ell_0$-norm
regularization, capturing general sparsity patterns. We establish a connection
between DFT-LQ and SF-LQ problems, showing that both can be addressed within
our unified framework. Furthermore, we propose a penalty-based proximal
alternating linearized minimization (PALM) algorithm and provide a rigorous
convergence analysis under mild assumptions, overcoming the lack of coercivity
in the objective function. The proposed method admits efficient solvers for all
subproblems and guarantees global convergence to critical points. Our results
fill a key gap in the literature by enabling the direct design of group-sparse
feedback gains with theoretical guarantees, without resorting to convex
surrogates or restrictive structural assumptions.

Motivation: Traditional Bayesian methods for entity resolution are computationally expensive, and there is a need to balance model accuracy with efficiency.

Result: The modified model allows the size of the largest cluster to grow sub-linearly while the number of clusters grows linearly. It delivers a computational speed-up by three orders of magnitude compared to existing Bayesian approaches.

Conclusion: The microclustering Ewens-Pitman model offers a practical balance between computational efficiency and empirical performance for tasks like entity resolution.

Abstract: We introduce the microclustering Ewens--Pitman model for random partitions,
obtained by scaling the strength parameter of the Ewens--Pitman model linearly
with the sample size. The resulting random partition is shown to have the
microclustering property, namely: the size of the largest cluster grows
sub-linearly with the sample size, while the number of clusters grows linearly.
By leveraging the interplay between the Ewens--Pitman random partition with the
Pitman--Yor process, we develop efficient variational inference schemes for
posterior computation in entity resolution. Our approach achieves a speed-up of
three orders of magnitude over existing Bayesian methods for entity resolution,
while maintaining competitive empirical performance.

### [307] [Action-List Reinforcement Learning Syndrome Decoding for Binary Linear Block Codes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17893)
*Milad Taghipour,Bane Vasic*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: This paper uses reinforcement learning to improve decoding of linear block codes by applying methods like action-list decoding and truncated Markov Decision Processes, achieving better performance for LDPC codes over Binary Symmetric Channels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhancing the decoding performance of linear block codes by leveraging reinforcement learning methods to tackle limitations in traditional decoders.

Method: The authors frame the decoding process as Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), employ state-reduction through a truncated MDP, design action-list decoders, and use feedback-based RL approaches to refine existing high-performing decoders.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed reinforcement learning-based decoding techniques improve the performance of LDPC codes over Binary Symmetric Channels significantly.

Conclusion: Reinforcement learning methods can boost the efficiency and performance of linear block code decoders, making them suitable for a wide range of applications, including both improvement of existing decoders and design of new ones.

Abstract: This paper explores the application of reinforcement learning techniques to
enhance the performance of decoding of linear block codes based on flipping
bits and finding optimal decisions. We describe the methodology for mapping the
iterative decoding process into Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) and propose
different methods to reduce the number of states in the MDP. A truncated MDP is
proposed to reduce the number of states in the MDP by learning a Hamming ball
with a specified radius around codewords. We then propose a general scheme for
reinforcement learning based decoders applicable to any class of codes to
improve the performance of decoders. We call this scheme an action-list
decoding. We design an action-list decoder based on the Deep-Q network values
that substantially enhance performance. We also get benefit of automorphism
group of code to further improve the code performance. Additionally, we propose
a feedback-based method to exploit and enhance the performance of existing
high-performing decoders by applying reinforcement learning algorithms after
the existing decoders. These approaches effectively reduces the complexity of
the reinforcement learning block. Finally, we present experimental results for
the Low-Density Parity Check (LDPC) codes over the Binary Symmetric Channel
(BSC) to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed methods.

### [308] [Minimax Data Sanitization with Distortion Constraint and Adversarial Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17942)
*Amirarsalan Moatazedian,Yauhen Yakimenka,Rémi A. Chou,Jörg Kliewer*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: This paper addresses privacy-preserving data-sharing through a constrained minimax optimization problem where a privatizer balances between distortion for authorized reconstructor and maximizing loss for adversaries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to develop a framework where individual adversaries cannot accurately reconstruct private data but collaborative reconstruction is possible under confidentiality constraints.

Method: The paper introduces a minimax optimization approach, alternating between optimizing the privatizer, reconstructor, and adversaries, with theoretical analysis for Gaussian and binary scenarios.

Result: Results include benchmarks derived from theoretically optimal solutions for special cases, like Gaussian and binary setups, used to validate the proposed minimax training procedure.

Conclusion: The study reinforces privacy principles, proposing secret-sharing-inspired yet lossy data recovery mechanisms for controlled data sharing under adversarial influences.

Abstract: We study a privacy-preserving data-sharing setting where a privatizer
transforms private data into a sanitized version observed by an authorized
reconstructor and two unauthorized adversaries, each with access to side
information correlated with the private data.
  The reconstructor is evaluated under a distortion function, while each
adversary is evaluated using a separate loss function. The privatizer ensures
the reconstructor distortion remains below a fixed threshold while maximizing
the minimum loss across the two adversaries. This two-adversary setting models
cases where individual users cannot reconstruct the data accurately, but their
combined side information enables estimation within the distortion threshold.
The privatizer maximizes individual loss while permitting accurate
reconstruction only through collaboration. This echoes secret-sharing
principles, but with lossy rather than perfect recovery. We frame this as a
constrained data-driven minimax optimization problem and propose a data-driven
training procedure that alternately updates the privatizer, reconstructor, and
adversaries. We also analyze the Gaussian and binary cases as special scenarios
where optimal solutions can be obtained. These theoretical optimal results are
benchmarks for evaluating the proposed minimax training approach.

### [309] [AI/ML Life Cycle Management for Interoperable AI Native RAN](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18538)
*Chu-Hsiang Huang,Chao-Kai Wen,Geoffrey Ye Li*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: The paper underscores how AI/ML models are transforming 5G RAN while addressing challenges like model drift and vendor lock-in through standardized life-cycle management frameworks in 3GPP Releases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges holding back the widespread adoption of AI/ML in 5G RAN, such as model drift and lack of standardization for interoperability.

Method: The paper reviews the evolution of 3GPP standards (Rel-16-20) for AI/ML in RAN, focusing on lifecycle management, performance monitoring, and inter-vendor schemes.

Result: It outlines a five-block lifecycle architecture involving KPIs, monitoring mechanisms, and strategies for vendor collaboration, culminating in Rel-20's vendor-agnostic management framework.

Conclusion: The standards pave the way for AI-native transceivers and establish foundational elements for advancing toward 6G networks.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) models are rapidly
permeating the 5G Radio Access Network (RAN), powering beam management, channel
state information (CSI) feedback, positioning, and mobility prediction.
However, without a standardized life-cycle management (LCM) framework,
challenges, such as model drift, vendor lock-in, and limited transparency,
hinder large-scale adoption. 3GPP Releases 16-20 progressively evolve AI/ML
from experimental features to managed, interoperable network functions.
Beginning with the Network Data Analytics Function (NWDAF) in Rel-16,
subsequent releases introduced standardized interfaces for model transfer,
execution, performance monitoring, and closed-loop control, culminating in
Rel-20's two-sided CSI-compression Work Item and vendor-agnostic LCM profile.
This article reviews the resulting five-block LCM architecture, KPI-driven
monitoring mechanisms, and inter-vendor collaboration schemes, while
identifying open challenges in resource-efficient monitoring, environment drift
detection, intelligent decision-making, and flexible model training. These
developments lay the foundation for AI-native transceivers as a key enabler for
6G.

### [310] [VERIRAG: Healthcare Claim Verification via Statistical Audit in Retrieval-Augmented Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17948)
*Shubham Mohole,Hongjun Choi,Shusen Liu,Christine Klymko,Shashank Kushwaha,Derek Shi,Wesam Sakla,Sainyam Galhotra,Ruben Glatt*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: VERIRAG is a framework to enhance clinical RAG systems by introducing methodological rigor assessment, aiming to distinguish the quality of scientific evidence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RAG systems in clinical decision support lack the ability to assess the scientific quality of retrieved evidence, risking the use of low-quality or retracted scientific claims.

Method: The framework introduces the 'Veritable' 11-point checklist, a 'Hard-to-Vary' score for evidence quality, and a 'Dynamic Acceptance Threshold' that adjusts required evidence stringency based on claim impact.

Result: The VERIRAG framework performs strongly across four datasets, achieving F1 scores between 0.53 and 0.65, a significant improvement over existing methods.

Conclusion: VERIRAG improves the reliability of clinical decision support systems by incorporating evidence quality assessment and outperforms baseline methods.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems are increasingly adopted in
clinical decision support, yet they remain methodologically blind-they retrieve
evidence but cannot vet its scientific quality. A paper claiming "Antioxidant
proteins decreased after alloferon treatment" and a rigorous multi-laboratory
replication study will be treated as equally credible, even if the former
lacked scientific rigor or was even retracted. To address this challenge, we
introduce VERIRAG, a framework that makes three notable contributions: (i) the
Veritable, an 11-point checklist that evaluates each source for methodological
rigor, including data integrity and statistical validity; (ii) a Hard-to-Vary
(HV) Score, a quantitative aggregator that weights evidence by its quality and
diversity; and (iii) a Dynamic Acceptance Threshold, which calibrates the
required evidence based on how extraordinary a claim is. Across four
datasets-comprising retracted, conflicting, comprehensive, and settled science
corpora-the VERIRAG approach consistently outperforms all baselines, achieving
absolute F1 scores ranging from 0.53 to 0.65, representing a 10 to 14 point
improvement over the next-best method in each respective dataset. We will
release all materials necessary for reproducing our results.

### [311] [LLM-based Embedders for Prior Case Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18455)
*Damith Premasiri,Tharindu Ranasinghe,Ruslan Mitkov*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: Legal professionals rely on precedents for arguments, but retrieving relevant cases is challenging due to growing volume. Using BM25 is common, but researchers propose LLM-based text embedders to overcome limitations in text length and training data, outperforming traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges legal professionals face in retrieving relevant prior cases due to limitations in traditional IR systems and advancements in deep learning methods.

Method: The authors leverage LLM-based text embedders capable of handling longer input lengths and usable in an unsupervised manner, bypassing the need for extensive training datasets.

Result: LLM-based embedders were evaluated on four PCR benchmark datasets and achieved superior performance compared to BM25 and supervised transformer-based models.

Conclusion: LLM-based text embedders effectively address retrieval challenges and outperform existing methods, advancing the state-of-the-art for PCR in legal contexts.

Abstract: In common law systems, legal professionals such as lawyers and judges rely on
precedents to build their arguments. As the volume of cases has grown massively
over time, effectively retrieving prior cases has become essential. Prior case
retrieval (PCR) is an information retrieval (IR) task that aims to
automatically identify the most relevant court cases for a specific query from
a large pool of potential candidates. While IR methods have seen several
paradigm shifts over the last few years, the vast majority of PCR methods
continue to rely on traditional IR methods, such as BM25. The state-of-the-art
deep learning IR methods have not been successful in PCR due to two key
challenges: i. Lengthy legal text limitation; when using the powerful
BERT-based transformer models, there is a limit of input text lengths, which
inevitably requires to shorten the input via truncation or division with a loss
of legal context information. ii. Lack of legal training data; due to data
privacy concerns, available PCR datasets are often limited in size, making it
difficult to train deep learning-based models effectively. In this research, we
address these challenges by leveraging LLM-based text embedders in PCR.
LLM-based embedders support longer input lengths, and since we use them in an
unsupervised manner, they do not require training data, addressing both
challenges simultaneously. In this paper, we evaluate state-of-the-art
LLM-based text embedders in four PCR benchmark datasets and show that they
outperform BM25 and supervised transformer-based models.

### [312] [Fashion-AlterEval: A Dataset for Improved Evaluation of Conversational Recommendation Systems with Alternative Relevant Items](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18017)
*Maria Vlachou*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper introduces Fashion-AlterEval, a dataset enhancing Conversational Recommendation Systems (CRS) evaluations by adding alternative item judgments, and proposes advanced simulators that account for changing user preferences and patience.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing user simulators in CRS evaluations are limited by focusing only on single target items, lacking variability in user patience and preferences.

Method: Fashion-AlterEval dataset was developed with human judgment annotations for alternative items, alongside creating two meta-user simulators accommodating dynamic user preferences and patience.

Result: Tests with Shoes and Fashion IQ datasets demonstrated that using alternative judgments improved CRS evaluation accuracy and responsiveness to user needs.

Conclusion: Considering alternative items in CRS evaluations enhances system responsiveness and highlights the underestimated effectiveness of current models under single-target evaluations.

Abstract: In Conversational Recommendation Systems (CRS), a user provides feedback on
recommended items at each turn, leading the CRS towards improved
recommendations. Due to the need for a large amount of data, a user simulator
is employed for both training and evaluation. Such user simulators critique the
current retrieved item based on knowledge of a single target item. However,
system evaluation in offline settings with simulators is limited by the focus
on a single target item and their unlimited patience over a large number of
turns. To overcome these limitations of existing simulators, we propose
Fashion-AlterEval, a new dataset that contains human judgments for a selection
of alternative items by adding new annotations in common fashion CRS datasets.
Consequently, we propose two novel meta-user simulators that use the collected
judgments and allow simulated users not only to express their preferences about
alternative items to their original target, but also to change their mind and
level of patience. In our experiments using the Shoes and Fashion IQ as the
original datasets and three CRS models, we find that using the knowledge of
alternatives by the simulator can have a considerable impact on the evaluation
of existing CRS models, specifically that the existing single-target evaluation
underestimates their effectiveness, and when simulatedusers are allowed to
instead consider alternative relevant items, the system can rapidly respond to
more quickly satisfy the user.

### [313] [DR.EHR: Dense Retrieval for Electronic Health Record with Knowledge Injection and Synthetic Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18583)
*Zhengyun Zhao,Huaiyuan Ying,Yue Zhong,Sheng Yu*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper introduces DR.EHR, dense retrieval models tailored for Electronic Health Records retrieval, achieving state-of-the-art results using a two-stage training pipeline with MIMIC-IV summaries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EHR retrieval is challenging due to semantic gaps and limitations in existing models—either lacking medical knowledge or not being trained effectively for the domain.

Method: The proposed model, DR.EHR, employs a two-stage training pipeline with MIMIC-IV data: first extracting medical entities with a knowledge graph and second generating diverse data via large language models. The models, in 110M and 7B variants, are trained and tested rigorously.

Result: DR.EHR significantly outperforms other dense retrievers on the CliniQ benchmark, particularly excelling in challenging query types like implications and abbreviations. It also generalizes well on EHR QA tasks.

Conclusion: DR.EHR is a robust model for EHR retrieval, combining medical knowledge injection and large-scale data training to provide an advanced solution for clinical applications.

Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHRs) are pivotal in clinical practices, yet their
retrieval remains a challenge mainly due to semantic gap issues. Recent
advancements in dense retrieval offer promising solutions but existing models,
both general-domain and biomedical-domain, fall short due to insufficient
medical knowledge or mismatched training corpora. This paper introduces
\texttt{DR.EHR}, a series of dense retrieval models specifically tailored for
EHR retrieval. We propose a two-stage training pipeline utilizing MIMIC-IV
discharge summaries to address the need for extensive medical knowledge and
large-scale training data. The first stage involves medical entity extraction
and knowledge injection from a biomedical knowledge graph, while the second
stage employs large language models to generate diverse training data. We train
two variants of \texttt{DR.EHR}, with 110M and 7B parameters, respectively.
Evaluated on the CliniQ benchmark, our models significantly outperforms all
existing dense retrievers, achieving state-of-the-art results. Detailed
analyses confirm our models' superiority across various match and query types,
particularly in challenging semantic matches like implication and abbreviation.
Ablation studies validate the effectiveness of each pipeline component, and
supplementary experiments on EHR QA datasets demonstrate the models'
generalizability on natural language questions, including complex ones with
multiple entities. This work significantly advances EHR retrieval, offering a
robust solution for clinical applications.

*Jaechul Roh,Zachary Novack,Yuefeng Peng,Niloofar Mireshghallah,Taylor Berg-Kirkpatrick,Amir Houmansadr*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper investigates the vulnerability of Lyrics-to-Song generation models to training data memorization using a novel method called Adversarial PhoneTic Prompting (APT), revealing critical issues in multimodal generative systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study is motivated by the need to understand the risks of training data memorization in end-to-end music synthesis models and their potential copyright, safety, and content provenance implications.

Method: The authors develop Adversarial PhoneTic Prompting (APT), which semantically distorts lyrics through homophonic substitutions while preserving acoustic structure, and evaluate its effects on multimodal generative systems.

Result: The study finds that Lyrics-to-Song models exhibit sub-lexical memorization, producing audio content matching training data with high similarity. Additionally, text-to-video models surprisingly reconstruct visual elements (phonetic-to-visual regurgitation) triggered by phoneme-altered lyrics.

Conclusion: The findings highlight a critical vulnerability in transcript-conditioned multimodal systems, where phonetic prompts can retrieve memorized content, warranting further scrutiny into data usage and ethical considerations for generative AI.

Abstract: Lyrics-to-Song (LS2) generation models promise end-to-end music synthesis
from text, yet their vulnerability to training data memorization remains
underexplored. We introduce Adversarial PhoneTic Prompting (APT), a novel
attack where lyrics are semantically altered while preserving their acoustic
structure through homophonic substitutions (e.g., Eminem's famous "mom's
spaghetti" $\rightarrow$ "Bob's confetti"). Despite these distortions, we
uncover a powerful form of sub-lexical memorization: models like SUNO and YuE
regenerate outputs strikingly similar to known training content, achieving high
similarity across audio-domain metrics, including CLAP, AudioJudge, and
CoverID. This vulnerability persists across multiple languages and genres. More
surprisingly, we discover that phoneme-altered lyrics alone can trigger visual
memorization in text-to-video models. When prompted with phonetically modified
lyrics from Lose Yourself, Veo 3 reconstructs visual elements from the original
music video -- including character appearance and scene composition -- despite
no visual cues in the prompt. We term this phenomenon phonetic-to-visual
regurgitation. Together, these findings expose a critical vulnerability in
transcript-conditioned multimodal generation: phonetic prompting alone can
unlock memorized audiovisual content, raising urgent questions about copyright,
safety, and content provenance in modern generative systems. Example
generations are available on our demo page (jrohsc.github.io/music_attack/).

*Sizhe Ma,Katherine A. Flanigan,Mario Bergés*

Main category: cs.CE

TL;DR: The paper proposes integrating a Reality Gap Analysis (RGA) module into Digital Twin (DT) frameworks to improve knowledge transfer between simulations and real-world operations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for standardized frameworks to bridge the gap between academic research and industrial applications of Digital Twin technology, especially regarding the transferability of knowledge between simulations and real-world scenarios.

Method: The authors integrated an RGA module into an existing DT framework, enabling both sim-to-real and real-to-sim transfers, supported by data pipelines linking various components such as the historical repository and simulation models.

Result: A tested case study on a pedestrian bridge demonstrated the effective bidirectional knowledge transfer facilitated by full implementation of the RGA module and data pipeline, achieving efficient lifecycle management.

Conclusion: The proposed approach successfully manages the reality gap, enabling practical implementation of Digital Twins with enhanced lifecycle management and efficient bidirectional transferability between real-world and simulated environments.

Abstract: The advancement of the Internet of Things (IoT) and Artificial Intelligence
has catalyzed the evolution of Digital Twins (DTs) from conceptual ideas to
more implementable realities. Yet, transitioning from academia to industry is
complex due to the absence of standardized frameworks. This paper builds upon
the authors' previously established functional and informational requirements
supporting standardized DT development, focusing on a crucial aspect:
transferability. While existing DT research primarily centers on asset
transfer, the significance of "sim-to-real transfer" and "real-to-sim
transfer"--transferring knowledge between simulations and real-world
operations--is vital for comprehensive lifecycle management in DTs. A key
challenge in this process is calibrating the "reality gap," the discrepancy
between simulated predictions and actual outcomes. Our research investigates
the impact of integrating a single Reality Gap Analysis (RGA) module into an
existing DT framework to effectively manage both sim-to-real and real-to-sim
transfers. This integration is facilitated by data pipelines that connect the
RGA module with the existing components of the DT framework, including the
historical repository and the simulation model. A case study on a pedestrian
bridge at Carnegie Mellon University showcases the performance of different
levels of integration of our approach with an existing framework. With full
implementation of an RGA module and a complete data pipeline, our approach is
capable of bidirectional knowledge transfer between simulations and real-world
operations without compromising efficiency.

TL;DR: This paper significantly advances SNOW, an LPWAN technology, to achieve massive scalability by enabling concurrent data reception and transmission on the same subcarrier through Gold code-based PN sequences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of massive scalability in LPWANs, where numerous sensors need to transmit data efficiently with low latency for emerging IoT and CPS applications.

Method: The method involves using Gold code-based pseudorandom noise sequences to allow non-interfering communication within and across subcarriers, enabling sensors to transmit and receive concurrently even on the same subcarrier.

Result: The evaluation showed approximately 9x improvement in scalability in SNOW, with timely data collection at the base station and energy efficiency at the sensors.

Conclusion: Advancing SNOW through these methods supports the needs of IoT and CPS applications requiring large-scale sensor networks with low power consumption, timeliness, and high scalability.

Abstract: LPWANs have become ubiquitous due to their ability to connect sensors over
large geographic areas in a single hop. It is, however, very challenging to
achieve massive scalability in LPWANs, where numerous sensors can transmit data
efficiently and with low latency, which emerging IoT and CPS applications may
require. In this paper, we address the above challenges by significantly
advancing an LPWAN technology called SNOW. SNOW exploits distributed orthogonal
frequency division multiplexing, D-OFDM, subcarriers to enable parallel
reception of data to a BS from multiple asynchronous sensors, each using a
different subcarrier. In this paper, we achieve massive scalability in SNOW by
enabling the BS to decode concurrent data from numerous asynchronous sensors on
the same subcarrier while parallelly decoding from other subcarriers as well.
Additionally, we enable numerous asynchronous sensors to receive distinct data
from the BS on the same subcarrier while other sensors also receive data
parallelly on other subcarriers. To do this, we develop a set of Gold
code-based pseudorandom noise or PN sequences that are mutually non-interfering
within and across the subcarriers. Each sensor uses its PN sequence from the
set for encoding or decoding data on its subcarriers, enabling massive
concurrency. Our evaluation results demonstrate that we can achieve
approximately 9x more scalability in SNOW while being timely in data collection
at the BS and energy efficient at the sensors. This may enable emerging IoT and
CPS applications requiring tens of thousands of sensors with longer battery
life and making data-driven, time-sensitive decisions.

Main category: physics.acc-ph

TL;DR: The study explores using machine learning models to predict multipactor susceptibility in RF systems, providing a promising approach but with limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multipactor is a critical and computationally complex issue in high-power RF devices and accelerators. The study aims to improve prediction accuracy across different materials.

Method: Machine learning regression models, including Random Forest, Extra Trees, XGBoost, and Multilayer Perceptrons, are trained on a simulation-derived dataset. Performance metrics like IoU, SSIM, and Pearson correlation are used.

Result: Tree-based models outperform MLPs. MLPs optimized with combined metrics improve their predictive accuracy. PCA highlights dataset limitations.

Conclusion: The study showcases ML's potential for multipactor prediction but emphasizes the need for more comprehensive datasets to overcome feature-space challenges.

Abstract: Multipactor is a nonlinear electron avalanche phenomenon that can severely
impair the performance of high-power radio frequency (RF) devices and
accelerator systems. Accurate prediction of multipactor susceptibility across
different materials and operational regimes remains a critical yet
computationally intensive challenge in accelerator component design and RF
engineering. This study presents the first application of supervised machine
learning (ML) for predicting multipactor susceptibility in two-surface planar
geometries. A simulation-derived dataset spanning six distinct secondary
electron yield (SEY) material profiles is used to train regression models -
including Random Forest (RF), Extra Trees (ET), Extreme Gradient Boosting
(XGBoost), and funnel-structured Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs) - to predict the
time-averaged electron growth rate, ${\delta}_{avg}$. Performance is evaluated
using Intersection over Union (IoU), Structural Similarity Index (SSIM), and
Pearson correlation coefficient. Tree-based models consistently outperform MLPs
in generalizing across disjoint material domains. MLPs trained using a
scalarized objective function that combines IoU and SSIM during Bayesian
hyperparameter optimization with 5-fold cross-validation outperform those
trained with single-objective loss functions. Principal Component Analysis
reveals that performance degradation for certain materials stems from disjoint
feature-space distributions, underscoring the need for broader dataset
coverage. This study demonstrates both the promise and limitations of ML-based
multipactor prediction and lays the groundwork for accelerated, data-driven
modeling in advanced RF and accelerator system design.

Motivation: To address the challenges of resource provisioning and performance maintenance in large-scale 5G core deployments amidst chaotic workloads.

Method: The study analyzes the impact of chaotic workloads like DDoS attacks on Network Functions and evaluates kernel-based monitoring systems for scalable security.

Result: The results show how chaotic workloads affect network performance and demonstrate the practicality of diverse resource profiles and kernel-based monitoring for SLA compliance and threat defense.

Conclusion: Effective resource provisioning along with advanced monitoring techniques are crucial for optimizing 5G core deployments in complex environments.

Abstract: The deployment of large-scale software-based 5G core functions presents
significant challenges due to their reliance on optimized and intelligent
resource provisioning for their services. Many studies have focused on
analyzing the impact of resource allocation for complex deployments using
mathematical models, queue theories, or even Artificial Intelligence (AI). This
paper elucidates the effects of chaotic workloads, generated by Distributed
Denial of Service (DDoS) on different Network Functions (NFs) on User Equipment
registration performance. Our findings highlight the necessity of diverse
resource profiles to ensure Service-Level Agreement (SLA) compliance in
large-scale 5G core deployments. Additionally, our analysis of packet capture
approaches demonstrates the potential of kernel-based monitoring for scalable
security threat defense. Finally, our empirical evaluation provides insights
into the effective deployment of 5G NFs in complex scenarios.

TL;DR: RECALLED exploits visual inputs to execute unbounded Resource Consumption Attacks on large vision-language models, escalating computational costs and exposing vulnerabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the overlooked threat of RCAs in LVLMs due to visual input vulnerabilities in existing studies.

Method: It employs Vision Guided Optimization for pixel-level adversarial perturbations combined with Multi-Objective Parallel Losses for universal attack template generation.

Result: RECALLED caused over 26% increase in latency, 20% higher GPU usage, and elevated memory consumption during attacks.

Conclusion: This paper highlights LVLM vulnerabilities and provides a framework for developing RCA defenses targeted at visual input attack surfaces.

Abstract: Resource Consumption Attacks (RCAs) have emerged as a significant threat to
the deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs). With the integration of vision
modalities, additional attack vectors exacerbate the risk of RCAs in large
vision-language models (LVLMs). However, existing red-teaming studies have
largely overlooked visual inputs as a potential attack surface, resulting in
insufficient mitigation strategies against RCAs in LVLMs. To address this gap,
we propose RECALLED (\textbf{RE}source \textbf{C}onsumption \textbf{A}ttack on
\textbf{L}arge Vision-\textbf{L}anguag\textbf{E} Mo\textbf{D}els), the first
approach for exploiting visual modalities to trigger unbounded RCAs
red-teaming. First, we present \textit{Vision Guided Optimization}, a
fine-grained pixel-level optimization, to obtain \textit{Output Recall}
adversarial perturbations, which can induce repeating output. Then, we inject
the perturbations into visual inputs, triggering unbounded generations to
achieve the goal of RCAs. Additionally, we introduce \textit{Multi-Objective
Parallel Losses} to generate universal attack templates and resolve
optimization conflicts when intending to implement parallel attacks. Empirical
results demonstrate that RECALLED increases service response latency by over 26
$\uparrow$, resulting in an additional 20\% increase in GPU utilization and
memory consumption. Our study exposes security vulnerabilities in LVLMs and
establishes a red-teaming framework that can facilitate future defense
development against RCAs.

Method: Development of MeAJOR, a dataset combining 135,894 phishing and legitimate email samples with engineered features, tested on four ML classifiers.

Result: Experiments showed the dataset's utility, with XGB achieving a 98.34% F1 score for phishing detection.

Conclusion: MeAJOR addresses key challenges in phishing detection research such as class imbalance and provides a reusable resource for consistent evaluation.

Abstract: Phishing emails continue to pose a significant threat to cybersecurity by
exploiting human vulnerabilities through deceptive content and malicious
payloads. While Machine Learning (ML) models are effective at detecting
phishing threats, their performance largely relies on the quality and diversity
of the training data. This paper presents MeAJOR (Merged email Assets from
Joint Open-source Repositories) Corpus, a novel, multi-source phishing email
dataset designed to overcome critical limitations in existing resources. It
integrates 135894 samples representing a broad number of phishing tactics and
legitimate emails, with a wide spectrum of engineered features. We evaluated
the dataset's utility for phishing detection research through systematic
experiments with four classification models (RF, XGB, MLP, and CNN) across
multiple feature configurations. Results highlight the dataset's effectiveness,
achieving 98.34% F1 with XGB. By integrating broad features from multiple
categories, our dataset provides a reusable and consistent resource, while
addressing common challenges like class imbalance, generalisability and
reproducibility.

### [321] [LoRA-Leak: Membership Inference Attacks Against LoRA Fine-tuned Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18302)
*Delong Ran,Xinlei He,Tianshuo Cong,Anyu Wang,Qi Li,Xiaoyun Wang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper develops LoRA-Leak, a framework assessing privacy risks of LoRA-based fine-tuning on language models (LMs), showing susceptibility to membership inference attacks (MIAs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to understand privacy risks associated with LoRA fine-tuning in LMs, as prior methods underestimated the information leakage caused by using pre-trained models.

Method: The authors created the LoRA-Leak framework with fifteen MIAs, including ten existing attacks and five improved ones utilizing pre-trained model references, and conducted experiments across multiple LMs and tasks.

Result: LoRA-based fine-tuned LMs are vulnerable to MIAs, achieving 0.775 AUC under conservative settings; dropout and excluding specific layers during fine-tuning mitigate risks effectively.

Conclusion: LoRA fine-tuning with pre-trained models heightens privacy risks despite efficiency; specialized LM providers should prioritize methods to protect fine-tuning data from MIAs.

Abstract: Language Models (LMs) typically adhere to a "pre-training and fine-tuning"
paradigm, where a universal pre-trained model can be fine-tuned to cater to
various specialized domains. Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has gained the most
widespread use in LM fine-tuning due to its lightweight computational cost and
remarkable performance. Because the proportion of parameters tuned by LoRA is
relatively small, there might be a misleading impression that the LoRA
fine-tuning data is invulnerable to Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs).
However, we identify that utilizing the pre-trained model can induce more
information leakage, which is neglected by existing MIAs. Therefore, we
introduce LoRA-Leak, a holistic evaluation framework for MIAs against the
fine-tuning datasets of LMs. LoRA-Leak incorporates fifteen membership
inference attacks, including ten existing MIAs, and five improved MIAs that
leverage the pre-trained model as a reference. In experiments, we apply
LoRA-Leak to three advanced LMs across three popular natural language
processing tasks, demonstrating that LoRA-based fine-tuned LMs are still
vulnerable to MIAs (e.g., 0.775 AUC under conservative fine-tuning settings).
We also applied LoRA-Leak to different fine-tuning settings to understand the
resulting privacy risks. We further explore four defenses and find that only
dropout and excluding specific LM layers during fine-tuning effectively
mitigate MIA risks while maintaining utility. We highlight that under the
"pre-training and fine-tuning" paradigm, the existence of the pre-trained model
makes MIA a more severe risk for LoRA-based LMs. We hope that our findings can
provide guidance on data privacy protection for specialized LM providers.

Abstract: Information security is facing increasingly severe challenges, and
traditional protection means are difficult to cope with complex and changing
threats. In recent years, as an emerging intelligent technology, large language
models (LLMs) have shown a broad application prospect in the field of
information security. In this paper, we focus on the key role of LLM in
information security, systematically review its application progress in
malicious behavior prediction, network threat analysis, system vulnerability
detection, malicious code identification, and cryptographic algorithm
optimization, and explore its potential in enhancing security protection
performance. Based on neural networks and Transformer architecture, this paper
analyzes the technical basis of large language models and their advantages in
natural language processing tasks. It is shown that the introduction of large
language modeling helps to improve the detection accuracy and reduce the false
alarm rate of security systems. Finally, this paper summarizes the current
application results and points out that it still faces challenges in model
transparency, interpretability, and scene adaptability, among other issues. It
is necessary to explore further the optimization of the model structure and the
improvement of the generalization ability to realize a more intelligent and
accurate information security protection system.

### [323] [NWaaS: Nonintrusive Watermarking as a Service for X-to-Image DNN](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18036)
*Haonan An,Guang Hua,Yu Guo,Hangcheng Cao,Susanto Rahardja,Yuguang Fang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: Nonintrusive Watermarking as a Service (NWaaS) introduces a novel approach to DNN watermarking without altering models, ensuring a robust and practical solution for various X-to-Image tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing DNN watermarking methods are intrusive, modifying model parameters or structure, which raises concerns about behavior shifts and increased fine-tuning costs, discouraging practical adoption.

Method: The authors propose NWaaS and implement ShadowMark, a nonintrusive DNN watermarking technique that uses a robust side channel created through a key encoder and a watermark decoder, leaving the protected model untouched.

Result: ShadowMark achieves absolute fidelity and robustness, applicable across various DNN architectures and resistant to existing attacks. Experiments demonstrate its efficacy in image-to-image, noise-to-image, and other X-to-Image tasks.

Conclusion: ShadowMark provides a practical and effective nonintrusive watermarking solution, making DNN ownership verification feasible without compromising models.

Abstract: The intellectual property of deep neural network (DNN) models can be
protected with DNN watermarking, which embeds copyright watermarks into model
parameters (white-box), model behavior (black-box), or model outputs
(box-free), and the watermarks can be subsequently extracted to verify model
ownership or detect model theft. Despite recent advances, these existing
methods are inherently intrusive, as they either modify the model parameters or
alter the structure. This natural intrusiveness raises concerns about
watermarking-induced shifts in model behavior and the additional cost of
fine-tuning, further exacerbated by the rapidly growing model size. As a
result, model owners are often reluctant to adopt DNN watermarking in practice,
which limits the development of practical Watermarking as a Service (WaaS)
systems. To address this issue, we introduce Nonintrusive Watermarking as a
Service (NWaaS), a novel trustless paradigm designed for X-to-Image models, in
which we hypothesize that with the model untouched, an owner-defined watermark
can still be extracted from model outputs. Building on this concept, we propose
ShadowMark, a concrete implementation of NWaaS which addresses critical
deployment challenges by establishing a robust and nonintrusive side channel in
the protected model's black-box API, leveraging a key encoder and a watermark
decoder. It is significantly distinctive from existing solutions by attaining
the so-called absolute fidelity and being applicable to different DNN
architectures, while being also robust against existing attacks, eliminating
the fidelity-robustness trade-off. Extensive experiments on image-to-image,
noise-to-image, noise-and-text-to-image, and text-to-image models, demonstrate
the efficacy and practicality of ShadowMark for real-world deployment of
nonintrusive DNN watermarking.

Main category: cs.CG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework employing mapper graphs and LLM-based agents to semi-automatically explore linguistic properties in large language model embeddings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the complex topological structures in large language model embedding spaces is challenging and requires significant human effort.

Method: The paper uses mapper graphs to summarize the topological structure of embedding spaces and introduces LLM-based agents employing perturbation techniques for scalable and automated exploration.

Result: The framework successfully organizes exploration within a visual analytics workspace, validates findings from prior studies on BERT embeddings, and reveals detailed linguistic properties of the embedding space.

Conclusion: This work provides an effective methodology for analyzing LLM embedding spaces by combining topology, perturbation-driven analytics, and semi-automation, offering new insights into linguistic properties of embeddings.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) produce high-dimensional embeddings that capture
rich semantic and syntactic relationships between words, sentences, and
concepts. Investigating the topological structures of LLM embedding spaces via
mapper graphs enables us to understand their underlying structures.
Specifically, a mapper graph summarizes the topological structure of the
embedding space, where each node represents a topological neighborhood
(containing a cluster of embeddings), and an edge connects two nodes if their
corresponding neighborhoods overlap. However, manually exploring these
embedding spaces to uncover encoded linguistic properties requires considerable
human effort. To address this challenge, we introduce a framework for
semi-automatic annotation of these embedding properties. To organize the
exploration process, we first define a taxonomy of explorable elements within a
mapper graph such as nodes, edges, paths, components, and trajectories. The
annotation of these elements is executed through two types of customizable
LLM-based agents that employ perturbation techniques for scalable and automated
analysis. These agents help to explore and explain the characteristics of
mapper elements and verify the robustness of the generated explanations. We
instantiate the framework within a visual analytics workspace and demonstrate
its effectiveness through case studies. In particular, we replicate findings
from prior research on BERT's embedding properties across various layers of its
architecture and provide further observations into the linguistic properties of
topological neighborhoods.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a model counter called 'pact' for hybrid SMT formulas, achieving significant performance improvement in approximate model counting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend SMT solvers towards model counting for hybrid formulas, addressing the challenge of counting solutions in the discrete domain.

Method: The method introduces pact, which uses hashing-based approximate model counting with a logarithmic number of SMT solver calls, utilizing optimized hash functions.

Result: pact outperformed baselines, successfully completing 603 out of 14,202 instances, as compared to only 13 instances completed by the baseline.

Conclusion: The proposed pact model is a robust and efficient counter for hybrid SMT formulas, backed by theoretical guarantees and clear performance advantages.

Abstract: Satisfiability Modulo Theory (SMT) solvers have advanced automated reasoning,
solving complex formulas across discrete and continuous domains. Recent
progress in propositional model counting motivates extending SMT capabilities
toward model counting, especially for hybrid SMT formulas. Existing approaches,
like bit-blasting, are limited to discrete variables, highlighting the
challenge of counting solutions projected onto the discrete domain in hybrid
formulas.
  We introduce pact, an SMT model counter for hybrid formulas that uses
hashing-based approximate model counting to estimate solutions with theoretical
guarantees. pact makes a logarithmic number of SMT solver calls relative to the
projection variables, leveraging optimized hash functions. pact achieves
significant performance improvements over baselines on a large suite of
benchmarks. In particular, out of 14,202 instances, pact successfully finished
on 603 instances, while Baseline could only finish on 13 instances.

*Florian List,Yujin Park,Nicholas L. Rodd,Eve Schoen,Florian Wolf*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The study explores the Galactic Center Excess (GCE) using machine learning to incorporate spectral and spatial data, finding that it is either diffuse emission or involves a far higher number of point sources than previously believed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To better understand whether the Galactic Center Excess (GCE) is caused by dark matter annihilation or dim point sources, overcoming the technical limitation of past analyses that excluded spectral data.

Method: The authors used a neural network-based simulation-driven inference approach to integrate both spatial and spectral information for assessing the origins of the GCE.

Result: The analysis shows that the GCE point sources are significantly dimmer, requiring either diffuse emission or an exceptionally large number of point sources—more than 35,000 at 90% confidence—far exceeding prior estimates.

Conclusion: The findings challenge earlier assumptions about the GCE's origins, favoring either diffuse dark matter-related emission or an unexpectedly large population of dim sources and complicating point-source-based models.

Abstract: The Galactic Center Excess (GCE) remains one of the defining mysteries
uncovered by the Fermi $\gamma$-ray Space Telescope. Although it may yet herald
the discovery of annihilating dark matter, weighing against that conclusion are
analyses showing the spatial structure of the emission appears more consistent
with a population of dim point sources. Technical limitations have restricted
prior analyses to studying the point-source hypothesis purely spatially. All
spectral information that could help disentangle the GCE from the complex and
uncertain astrophysical emission was discarded. We demonstrate that a neural
network-aided simulation-based inference approach can overcome such limitations
and thereby confront the point source explanation of the GCE with spatial and
spectral data. The addition is profound: energy information drives the putative
point sources to be significantly dimmer, indicating either the GCE is truly
diffuse in nature or made of an exceptionally large number of sources.
Quantitatively, for our best fit background model, the excess is essentially
consistent with Poisson emission as predicted by dark matter. If the excess is
instead due to point sources, our median prediction is ${\cal O}(10^5)$ sources
in the Galactic Center, or more than 35,000 sources at 90% confidence, both
significantly larger than the hundreds of sources preferred by earlier
point-source analyses of the GCE.

Main category: econ.GN

TL;DR: The paper explores conflicts between Reinforcement Learning (RL) and economic equilibrium theory, proposing a new RL framework for consistency with economic models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how reinforcement learning (RL) systems interact with economic modeling frameworks and resolving inconsistencies between emergent RL behaviors and equilibrium theory.

Method: Developed a calibrated Mean-Field Reinforcement Learning framework, making RL agents act in alignment with competitive equilibrium through modifications like embedding a representative agent in a macroeconomic field and adjusting the cost function.

Result: Demonstrated that the proposed RL framework converges to policies consistent with competitive equilibrium, resolving the bias and manipulative tendencies observed in naive RL setups.

Conclusion: The proposed framework serves as a tractable and theoretically sound method for modeling the behavior of learning agents in economic systems, eliminating the conflict with equilibrium theory.

Abstract: The application of Reinforcement Learning (RL) to economic modeling reveals a
fundamental conflict between the assumptions of equilibrium theory and the
emergent behavior of learning agents. While canonical economic models assume
atomistic agents act as `takers' of aggregate market conditions, a naive
single-agent RL simulation incentivizes the agent to become a `manipulator' of
its environment. This paper first demonstrates this discrepancy within a
search-and-matching model with concave production, showing that a standard RL
agent learns a non-equilibrium, monopsonistic policy. Additionally, we identify
a parametric bias arising from the mismatch between economic discounting and
RL's treatment of intertemporal costs. To address both issues, we propose a
calibrated Mean-Field Reinforcement Learning framework that embeds a
representative agent in a fixed macroeconomic field and adjusts the cost
function to reflect economic opportunity costs. Our iterative algorithm
converges to a self-consistent fixed point where the agent's policy aligns with
the competitive equilibrium. This approach provides a tractable and
theoretically sound methodology for modeling learning agents in economic
systems within the broader domain of computational social science.

*Arindam Ghosh,Mark Fuhs,Bongjun Kim,Anurag Chowdhury,Monika Woszczyna*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: The paper extends the joint ASR + SD frameworks to perform speaker-role diarization (RD) with improved model design for better role-specific outputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Speaker-role diarization (RD) provides more context-specific labeling (e.g., doctor vs. patient) compared to generic speaker diarization (SD), making it more useful in real-world applications.

Method: The framework introduces three advancements: simplifying training via forced alignment, using separate predictors for RD and ASR tasks, and utilizing RD posterior activity to enhance ASR decoding accuracy.

Result: Separate task-specific predictors handle RD and ASR tasks more effectively, reducing small-word deletion errors and improving role-specific labeling.

Conclusion: Extending SD frameworks to perform RD with these enhancements results in context-specific diarization and improved ASR decoding performance.

Abstract: From an application standpoint, speaker-role diarization (RD), such as doctor
vs. patient, host vs. guest, etc. is often more useful than traditional speaker
diarization (SD), which assigns generic labels like speaker-1, speaker-2 etc.
In the context of joint automatic speech recognition (ASR) + SD (who spoke
what?), recent end-to-end models employ an auxiliary SD transducer,
synchronized with the ASR transducer, to predict speakers per word. In this
paper, we extend this framework to RD with three key contributions: (1) we
simplify the training via forced alignment and cross-entropy loss instead of
RNNT loss, (2) we show that word prediction and role prediction require
different amounts of predictor's context, leading to separate task-specific
predictors, unlike existing shared-predictor models, and (3) we propose a way
to leverage RD posterior activity to influence ASR decoding and reduce
small-word deletion errors.

TL;DR: The CHiME-7 and 8 challenges focus on improving distant multi-channel speech recognition, highlighting transitions to end-to-end ASR systems and challenges in speech separation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To advance the research in distant speech recognition by addressing diarization and transcription of conversational speech, and to identify trends and bottlenecks in the current methodologies.

Method: The study analyzed participant systems from CHiME-7 and 8 challenges, focusing on evaluation metrics, baseline systems, and technical trends like the shift towards end-to-end ASR and diarization techniques.

Result: Key findings include a shift to end-to-end ASR, limitations of neural speech separation techniques, importance of accurate diarization, and the resilience of meeting summarization to transcription errors.

Conclusion: Despite state-of-the-art advancements, challenges remain in achieving accurate transcription for spontaneous, noisy environments, even with intensive systems.

Abstract: The CHiME-7 and 8 distant speech recognition (DASR) challenges focus on
multi-channel, generalizable, joint automatic speech recognition (ASR) and
diarization of conversational speech. With participation from 9 teams
submitting 32 diverse systems, these challenges have contributed to
state-of-the-art research in the field. This paper outlines the challenges'
design, evaluation metrics, datasets, and baseline systems while analyzing key
trends from participant submissions. From this analysis it emerges that: 1)
Most participants use end-to-end (e2e) ASR systems, whereas hybrid systems were
prevalent in previous CHiME challenges. This transition is mainly due to the
availability of robust large-scale pre-trained models, which lowers the data
burden for e2e-ASR. 2) Despite recent advances in neural speech separation and
enhancement (SSE), all teams still heavily rely on guided source separation,
suggesting that current neural SSE techniques are still unable to reliably deal
with complex scenarios and different recording setups. 3) All best systems
employ diarization refinement via target-speaker diarization techniques.
Accurate speaker counting in the first diarization pass is thus crucial to
avoid compounding errors and CHiME-8 DASR participants especially focused on
this part. 4) Downstream evaluation via meeting summarization can correlate
weakly with transcription quality due to the remarkable effectiveness of
large-language models in handling errors. On the NOTSOFAR-1 scenario, even
systems with over 50\% time-constrained minimum permutation WER can perform
roughly on par with the most effective ones (around 11\%). 5) Despite recent
progress, accurately transcribing spontaneous speech in challenging acoustic
environments remains difficult, even when using computationally intensive
system ensembles.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Voice disorders impact many individuals, and automated, interpretable diagnostic methods could revolutionize healthcare outcomes.

Method: The paper evaluates concept-based explainable AI models, including Concept Bottleneck Model (CBM) and Concept Embedding Model (CEM), for their ability to match traditional DNNs' performance while offering transparency.

Result: Concept-based models are found to achieve comparable performance to standard DNNs, while improving interpretability and trust in clinical decision-making.

Conclusion: Explainable AI provides a promising path to diagnose voice disorders in a clinically trustworthy and transparent manner, without sacrificing performance.

Abstract: Voice disorders affect a significant portion of the population, and the
ability to diagnose them using automated, non-invasive techniques would
represent a substantial advancement in healthcare, improving the quality of
life of patients. Recent studies have demonstrated that artificial intelligence
models, particularly Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), can effectively address this
task. However, due to their complexity, the decision-making process of such
models often remain opaque, limiting their trustworthiness in clinical
contexts. This paper investigates an alternative approach based on Explainable
AI (XAI), a field that aims to improve the interpretability of DNNs by
providing different forms of explanations. Specifically, this works focuses on
concept-based models such as Concept Bottleneck Model (CBM) and Concept
Embedding Model (CEM) and how they can achieve performance comparable to
traditional deep learning methods, while offering a more transparent and
interpretable decision framework.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to explore how key opinion leaders influence public perceptions and narratives around emerging technologies during uncertain times.

Method: Researchers mined social media posts using advanced text-mining techniques like BERTopic modeling, sentiment, emotion, and attitude analysis to identify 100 distinct discussion topics.

Result: The study found that key opinion leaders often frame technologies as solutions to societal challenges, with emotions like Hope dominating positively and Anxiety arising in geopolitical contexts.

Conclusion: Key opinion leaders play a crucial role in shaping public discourse surrounding emerging technologies, blending imagined futures with current challenges and debates.

Abstract: The volatility and unpredictability of emerging technologies, such as
artificial intelligence (AI), generate significant uncertainty, which is widely
discussed on social media. This study examines anticipatory discourse
surrounding technological futures by analysing 1.5 million posts from 400 key
opinion leaders (KOLs) published on the X platform (from 2021 to 2023). Using
advanced text mining techniques, including BERTopic modelling, sentiment,
emotion, and attitude analyses, the research identifies 100 distinct topics
reflecting anticipated tech-driven futures. Our findings emphasize the dual
role of KOLs in framing \textit{present futures} -- optimistic visions of
transformative technologies like AI and IoT -- and influencing \textit{future
presents}, where these projections shape contemporary societal and geopolitical
debates. Positive emotions such as Hope dominate, outweighing Anxiety,
particularly in topics like ``Machine Learning, Data Science, and Deep
Learning,'' while discussions around ``Climate Change'' and ``War, Ukraine, and
Trump People'' elicit \textit{Anxiety}. By framing technologies as solutions to
societal challenges, KOLs act as mediators of societal narratives, bridging
imagined futures and current realities. These insights underscore their pivotal
role in directing public attention with emerging technologies during periods of
heightened uncertainty, advancing our understanding of anticipatory discourse
in technology-mediated contexts.

regulatory compliance, and data privacy. These challenges have spurred the
emergence of Financial Foundation Models (FFMs) - a new class of models
explicitly designed for finance. This survey presents a comprehensive overview
of FFMs, with a taxonomy spanning three key modalities: Financial Language
Foundation Models (FinLFMs), Financial Time-Series Foundation Models
(FinTSFMs), and Financial Visual-Language Foundation Models (FinVLFMs). We
review their architectures, training methodologies, datasets, and real-world
applications. Furthermore, we identify critical challenges in data
availability, algorithmic scalability, and infrastructure constraints, and
offer insights into future research opportunities. We hope this survey serves
as both a comprehensive reference for understanding FFMs and a practical
roadmap for future innovation. An updated collection of FFM-related
publications and resources will be maintained on our website

### [335] [A Foundation Model for Massive MIMO Precoding with an Adaptive per-User Rate-Power Tradeoff](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18587)
*Jérôme Emery,Ali Hasanzadeh Karkan,Jean-François Frigon,François Leduc-Primeau*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: The paper proposes a transformer-based foundation model for mMIMO precoding, enhancing energy efficiency and rate adaptability, and introduces data augmentation to address data scarcity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome challenges in mMIMO precoding, such as data scarcity and high training complexity, and to improve energy and spectral efficiency with adaptable user rates.

Method: A transformer-based foundation model is used for precoding and paired with a novel data augmentation strategy that utilizes cosine similarity for training sample selection in data-scarce scenarios.

Result: The model achieves zero-shot deployment with superior energy efficiency compared to traditional methods and approaches high-performance benchmarks with lower complexity.

Conclusion: The approach makes DL-based mMIMO precoding practical by addressing data and training challenges, providing dynamic rate configuration for improved efficiency and fairness.

Abstract: Deep learning (DL) has emerged as a solution for precoding in massive
multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) systems due to its capacity to learn the
characteristics of the propagation environment. However, training such a model
requires high-quality, local datasets at the deployment site, which are often
difficult to collect. We propose a transformer-based foundation model for mMIMO
precoding that seeks to minimize the energy consumption of the transmitter
while dynamically adapting to per-user rate requirements. At equal energy
consumption, zero-shot deployment of the proposed foundation model
significantly outperforms zero forcing, and approaches weighted minimum mean
squared error performance with 8x less complexity. To address model adaptation
in data-scarce settings, we introduce a data augmentation method that finds
training samples similar to the target distribution by computing the cosine
similarity between the outputs of the pre-trained feature extractor. Our work
enables the implementation of DL-based solutions in practice by addressing
challenges of data availability and training complexity. Moreover, the ability
to dynamically configure per-user rate requirements can be leveraged by higher
level resource allocation and scheduling algorithms for greater control over
energy efficiency, spectral efficiency and fairness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current database systems are complex and challenging for non-technical users to interact with, leading to usability issues.

### [337] [Zero-Shot Dynamic Concept Personalization with Grid-Based LoRA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17963)
*Rameen Abdal,Or Patashnik,Ekaterina Deyneka,Hao Chen,Aliaksandr Siarohin,Sergey Tulyakov,Daniel Cohen-Or,Kfir Aberman*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: The paper introduces a zero-shot framework for personalizing dynamic concepts in text-to-video generation without per-instance fine-tuning, using Grid-LoRA adapters and a Grid Fill module for efficient and scalable synthesis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text-to-video generation methods enable high-quality synthesis but are limited by the need for per-instance fine-tuning, making them inefficient and less scalable for dynamic concept personalization.

Method: The proposed method uses structured 2x2 video grids to organize input-output pairs, lightweight Grid-LoRA adapters for editing, and a Grid Fill module to ensure temporally coherent outputs, enabling zero-shot generalization to unseen concepts.

Result: The framework achieves high-quality, consistent results across various subjects and editing scenarios, without requiring test-time optimization.

Conclusion: The introduced approach provides an efficient, scalable, and zero-shot capable solution for personalizing dynamic concepts in text-to-video generation, eliminating the need for fine-tuning on individual instances.

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-video generation have enabled high-quality
synthesis from text and image prompts. While the personalization of dynamic
concepts, which capture subject-specific appearance and motion from a single
video, is now feasible, most existing methods require per-instance fine-tuning,
limiting scalability. We introduce a fully zero-shot framework for dynamic
concept personalization in text-to-video models. Our method leverages
structured 2x2 video grids that spatially organize input and output pairs,
enabling the training of lightweight Grid-LoRA adapters for editing and
composition within these grids. At inference, a dedicated Grid Fill module
completes partially observed layouts, producing temporally coherent and
identity preserving outputs. Once trained, the entire system operates in a
single forward pass, generalizing to previously unseen dynamic concepts without
any test-time optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate high-quality and
consistent results across a wide range of subjects beyond trained concepts and
editing scenarios.

### [338] [GeoAvatar: Adaptive Geometrical Gaussian Splatting for 3D Head Avatar](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18155)
*SeungJun Moon,Hah Min Lew,Seungeun Lee,Ji-Su Kang,Gyeong-Moon Park*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: GeoAvatar introduces innovative methods in 3D head avatar generation, offering improvements in identity reconstruction and animation fidelity through adaptive geometrical Gaussian Splatting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges persist in balancing identity preservation and animation fidelity in 3D head avatars due to difficulties in adapting Gaussians to different facial regions.

Method: GeoAvatar employs an Adaptive Pre-allocation Stage (APS) for segmenting and regularizing Gaussians, introduces a novel mouth structure for animation fidelity, and utilizes regularization loss for accurate rigging.

Result: Experimental findings highlight GeoAvatar's effectiveness in both reconstruction quality and animation realism, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: GeoAvatar establishes advancements in 3D avatar generation, demonstrating improved animation and identity preservation, while also providing a new expressive facial motion dataset.

Abstract: Despite recent progress in 3D head avatar generation, balancing identity
preservation, i.e., reconstruction, with novel poses and expressions, i.e.,
animation, remains a challenge. Existing methods struggle to adapt Gaussians to
varying geometrical deviations across facial regions, resulting in suboptimal
quality. To address this, we propose GeoAvatar, a framework for adaptive
geometrical Gaussian Splatting. GeoAvatar leverages Adaptive Pre-allocation
Stage (APS), an unsupervised method that segments Gaussians into rigid and
flexible sets for adaptive offset regularization. Then, based on mouth anatomy
and dynamics, we introduce a novel mouth structure and the part-wise
deformation strategy to enhance the animation fidelity of the mouth. Finally,
we propose a regularization loss for precise rigging between Gaussians and 3DMM
faces. Moreover, we release DynamicFace, a video dataset with highly expressive
facial motions. Extensive experiments show the superiority of GeoAvatar
compared to state-of-the-art methods in reconstruction and novel animation
scenarios.

*Zhen Han,Mattias Teye,Derek Yadgaroff,Judith Bütepage*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: This paper presents a method for creating small, real-time models for speech-driven 3D facial animation using knowledge distillation and pseudo-labeling, enabling on-device inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for high-quality, robust speech-driven facial animation in game development, alongside constraints like limited datasets and on-device inference.

Method: Hybrid knowledge distillation using pseudo-labeling: a large teacher model generates labels for training compact student models composed of convolutional and fully-connected layers.

Result: Achieved model memory footprints as small as 3.4 MB and audio context requirements down to 81 ms while maintaining quality animations.

Conclusion: The work enables real-time, on-device facial animation models suitable for creating realistic digital characters in game development.

Abstract: The training of high-quality, robust machine learning models for
speech-driven 3D facial animation requires a large, diverse dataset of
high-quality audio-animation pairs. To overcome the lack of such a dataset,
recent work has introduced large pre-trained speech encoders that are robust to
variations in the input audio and, therefore, enable the facial animation model
to generalize across speakers, audio quality, and languages. However, the
resulting facial animation models are prohibitively large and lend themselves
only to offline inference on a dedicated machine. In this work, we explore
on-device, real-time facial animation models in the context of game
development. We overcome the lack of large datasets by using hybrid knowledge
distillation with pseudo-labeling. Given a large audio dataset, we employ a
high-performing teacher model to train very small student models. In contrast
to the pre-trained speech encoders, our student models only consist of
convolutional and fully-connected layers, removing the need for attention
context or recurrent updates. In our experiments, we demonstrate that we can
reduce the memory footprint to up to 3.4 MB and required future audio context
to up to 81 ms while maintaining high-quality animations. This paves the way
for on-device inference, an important step towards realistic, model-driven
digital characters.

*Yixiao Chen,Bin Liang,Hanzhi Guo,Yongqing Cheng,Jiayi Zhao,Dongdong Weng*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: The paper proposes an efficient method called PS-GS for inverse rendering with multi-view photometric stereo, achieving superior 3D reconstruction accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of efficient inverse rendering with multi-view photometric stereo for accurate 3D reconstructions.

Method: Introduces PS-GS, which uses a 2D Gaussian splatting model for initial geometry and performs deferred inverse rendering with a lighting-computing MLP and photometric stereo regularization.

Result: Achieves superior reconstruction accuracy and computational efficiency compared to prior works on synthetic and real datasets.

Conclusion: PS-GS successfully integrates multi-view photometric stereo and inverse rendering, enabling applications like novel-view synthesis, relighting, and shape editing.

Abstract: Integrating inverse rendering with multi-view photometric stereo (MVPS)
yields more accurate 3D reconstructions than the inverse rendering approaches
that rely on fixed environment illumination. However, efficient inverse
rendering with MVPS remains challenging. To fill this gap, we introduce the
Gaussian Splatting for Multi-view Photometric Stereo (PS-GS), which efficiently
and jointly estimates the geometry, materials, and lighting of the object that
is illuminated by diverse directional lights (multi-light). Our method first
reconstructs a standard 2D Gaussian splatting model as the initial geometry.
Based on the initialization model, it then proceeds with the deferred inverse
rendering by the full rendering equation containing a lighting-computing
multi-layer perceptron. During the whole optimization, we regularize the
rendered normal maps by the uncalibrated photometric stereo estimated normals.
We also propose the 2D Gaussian ray-tracing for single directional light to
refine the incident lighting. The regularizations and the use of multi-view and
multi-light images mitigate the ill-posed problem of inverse rendering. After
optimization, the reconstructed object can be used for novel-view synthesis,
relighting, and material and shape editing. Experiments on both synthetic and
real datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms prior works in terms of
reconstruction accuracy and computational efficiency.

TL;DR: Biomedical Foundation Models (FMs) have robustness issues due to non-biological features, impacting their clinical usability. PathoROB benchmark aims to evaluate and improve FM robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The susceptibility of Biomedical Foundation Models to non-biological technical features risks their safe deployment in clinical settings.

Method: The authors designed PathoROB, a benchmark with novel robustness metrics and datasets from diverse medical centers to quantify FM robustness, evaluate models, and propose robustification strategies.

Result: Experiments on 20 FMs revealed widespread robustness deficits, diagnostic errors due to non-robust representations, and effective but partial mitigation using robustification strategies.

Conclusion: Robustness evaluation is crucial for clinical adoption of pathology FMs, and robustness must be prioritized in future FM design and development to ensure safer AI systems.

Abstract: Biomedical Foundation Models (FMs) are rapidly transforming AI-enabled
healthcare research and entering clinical validation. However, their
susceptibility to learning non-biological technical features -- including
variations in surgical/endoscopic techniques, laboratory procedures, and
scanner hardware -- poses risks for clinical deployment. We present the first
systematic investigation of pathology FM robustness to non-biological features.
Our work (i) introduces measures to quantify FM robustness, (ii) demonstrates
the consequences of limited robustness, and (iii) proposes a framework for FM
robustification to mitigate these issues. Specifically, we developed PathoROB,
a robustness benchmark with three novel metrics, including the robustness
index, and four datasets covering 28 biological classes from 34 medical
centers. Our experiments reveal robustness deficits across all 20 evaluated
FMs, and substantial robustness differences between them. We found that
non-robust FM representations can cause major diagnostic downstream errors and
clinical blunders that prevent safe clinical adoption. Using more robust FMs
and post-hoc robustification considerably reduced (but did not yet eliminate)
the risk of such errors. This work establishes that robustness evaluation is
essential for validating pathology FMs before clinical adoption and
demonstrates that future FM development must integrate robustness as a core
design principle. PathoROB provides a blueprint for assessing robustness across
biomedical domains, guiding FM improvement efforts towards more robust,
representative, and clinically deployable AI systems that prioritize biological
information over technical artifacts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to overcome limitations in parameter-efficient representations of 3D convolution operations for fine-tuning MRI image generation models.

Method: The paper proposes TenVOO, which leverages tensor network modeling to reduce 3D convolution kernels into lower-dimensional tensors for efficient fine-tuning.

Result: TenVOO demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in MS-SSIM on brain MRI datasets while using only 0.3% of the trainable parameters compared to the original model.

Conclusion: TenVOO successfully balances performance and parameter efficiency, offering advancements in 3D convolutional fine-tuning for MRI image generation.

Abstract: We address the challenge of parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) for
three-dimensional (3D) U-Net-based denoising diffusion probabilistic models
(DDPMs) in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) image generation. Despite its
practical significance, research on parameter-efficient representations of 3D
convolution operations remains limited. To bridge this gap, we propose Tensor
Volumetric Operator (TenVOO), a novel PEFT method specifically designed for
fine-tuning DDPMs with 3D convolutional backbones. Leveraging tensor network
modeling, TenVOO represents 3D convolution kernels with lower-dimensional
tensors, effectively capturing complex spatial dependencies during fine-tuning
with few parameters. We evaluate TenVOO on three downstream brain MRI
datasets-ADNI, PPMI, and BraTS2021-by fine-tuning a DDPM pretrained on 59,830
T1-weighted brain MRI scans from the UK Biobank. Our results demonstrate that
TenVOO achieves state-of-the-art performance in multi-scale structural
similarity index measure (MS-SSIM), outperforming existing approaches in
capturing spatial dependencies while requiring only 0.3% of the trainable
parameters of the original model. Our code is available at:

TL;DR: The paper introduces a deep learning model to improve glioblastoma diagnosis through fine-tuning a pre-trained model on the BraTS-Path dataset, achieving mixed performance metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Glioblastoma diagnosis is challenging due to the tumor's heterogeneity, and traditional diagnostic methods are insufficient for accurate assessments, prompting the exploration of deep learning approaches.

Method: A pre-trained deep learning model is fine-tuned using the BraTS-Path training dataset, and its performance is assessed on the validation set through metrics like accuracy, recall, F1-score, specificity, and MCC.

Result: The model achieved suboptimal performance with an accuracy, recall, and F1-score of 0.392229, but showed strong specificity (0.898704) and moderate MCC (0.255267).

Conclusion: Despite poor overall accuracy, the model demonstrates notable specificity and ranks second during the testing phase, suggesting room for improvement and potential in glioblastoma diagnosis.

Abstract: Glioblastoma, a highly aggressive brain tumor with diverse molecular and
pathological features, poses a diagnostic challenge due to its heterogeneity.
Accurate diagnosis and assessment of this heterogeneity are essential for
choosing the right treatment and improving patient outcomes. Traditional
methods rely on identifying specific features in tissue samples, but deep
learning offers a promising approach for improved glioblastoma diagnosis. In
this paper, we present our approach to the BraTS-Path Challenge 2024. We
leverage a pre-trained model and fine-tune it on the BraTS-Path training
dataset. Our model demonstrates poor performance on the challenging BraTS-Path
validation set, as rigorously assessed by the Synapse online platform. The
model achieves an accuracy of 0.392229, a recall of 0.392229, and a F1-score of
0.392229, indicating a consistent ability to correctly identify instances under
the target condition. Notably, our model exhibits perfect specificity of
0.898704, showing an exceptional capacity to correctly classify negative cases.
Moreover, a Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) of 0.255267 is calculated,
to signify a limited positive correlation between predicted and actual values
and highlight our model's overall predictive power. Our solution also achieves
the second place during the testing phase.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper investigates hyperspectral imaging and machine learning models to predict nitrogen concentration in grapevine leaves and canopies, achieving moderate predictive accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the necessity of precision nitrogen management in vineyards due to its high spatial and temporal variability, ensuring optimal growth and product quality.

Method: Hyperspectral imaging was utilized to collect spectral data from grapevine leaves and canopies. Feature selection methods identified key spectral bands, which were then used to train Gradient Boosting and XGBoost ML models for nitrogen concentration prediction.

Result: The study identified overlapping key spectral bands and achieved predictive accuracies with R square values of 0.49 for canopy-level and 0.57 for leaf-level nitrogen concentration predictions.

Conclusion: In-field hyperspectral imaging, combined with feature selection and ML techniques, shows promising potential for monitoring nitrogen levels in vineyards to support precision agriculture.

Abstract: Nitrogen (N) is one of the most crucial nutrients in vineyards, affecting
plant growth and subsequent products such as wine and juice. Because soil N has
high spatial and temporal variability, it is desirable to accurately estimate
the N concentration of grapevine leaves and manage fertilization at the
individual plant level to optimally meet plant needs. In this study, we used
in-field hyperspectral images with wavelengths ranging from $400 to 1000nm of
four different grapevine cultivars collected from distinct vineyards and over
two growth stages during two growing seasons to develop models for predicting N
concentration at the leaf-level and canopy-level. After image processing, two
feature selection methods were employed to identify the optimal set of spectral
bands that were responsive to leaf N concentrations. The selected spectral
bands were used to train and test two different Machine Learning (ML) models,
Gradient Boosting and XGBoost, for predicting nitrogen concentrations. The
comparison of selected bands for both leaf-level and canopy-level datasets
showed that most of the spectral regions identified by the feature selection
methods were across both methods and the dataset types (leaf- and canopy-level
datasets), particularly in the key regions, 500-525nm, 650-690nm, 750-800nm,
and 900-950nm. These findings indicated the robustness of these spectral
regions for predicting nitrogen content. The results for N prediction
demonstrated that the ML model achieved an R square of 0.49 for canopy-level
data and an R square of 0.57 for leaf-level data, despite using different sets
of selected spectral bands for each analysis level. The study demonstrated the
potential of using in-field hyperspectral imaging and the use of spectral data
in integrated feature selection and ML techniques to monitor N status in
vineyards.

Result: The dataset was successfully validated through benchmarks and shown to be suitable for advancing AI tools for TCM diagnosis.

Conclusion: This dataset overcomes key barriers in TCM tongue diagnosis, enabling the integration of AI into TCM research and clinical practice.

Abstract: Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) tongue diagnosis, while clinically
valuable, faces standardization challenges due to subjective interpretation and
inconsistent imaging protocols, compounded by the lack of large-scale,

multiple annotation formats (COCO, TXT, XML) for broad usability and has been
benchmarked using nine deep learning models (YOLOv5/v7/v8 variants, SSD, and
MobileNetV2) to demonstrate its utility for AI development. This resource
provides a critical foundation for advancing reliable computational tools in

TL;DR: The paper introduces MEP-Diffusion, a diffusion model trained on crystal structures, to improve multislice electron ptychography (MEP) image reconstruction quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the shortcomings of current iterative algorithms for reconstructing multislice electron ptychography (MEP) images, which are time-consuming and provide suboptimal solutions.

Method: The authors developed MEP-Diffusion, a generative diffusion model using Diffusion Posterior Sampling (DPS) and trained it on a large database of crystal structures.

Result: MEP-Diffusion improves the quality of reconstructed 3D volumes, achieving a notable 90.50% improvement in SSIM compared to existing iterative solutions.

Conclusion: Integrating the MEP-Diffusion model significantly enhances the imaging accuracy and efficiency of MEP reconstruction methods.

Abstract: Multislice electron ptychography (MEP) is an inverse imaging technique that
computationally reconstructs the highest-resolution images of atomic crystal
structures from diffraction patterns. Available algorithms often solve this
inverse problem iteratively but are both time consuming and produce suboptimal
solutions due to their ill-posed nature. We develop MEP-Diffusion, a diffusion
model trained on a large database of crystal structures specifically for MEP to
augment existing iterative solvers. MEP-Diffusion is easily integrated as a
generative prior into existing reconstruction methods via Diffusion Posterior
Sampling (DPS). We find that this hybrid approach greatly enhances the quality
of the reconstructed 3D volumes, achieving a 90.50% improvement in SSIM over
existing methods.

*Dou Hoon Kwark,Shirui Luo,Xiyue Zhu,Yudu Li,Zhi-Pei Liang,Volodymyr Kindratenko*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel hierarchical diffusion framework for pseudo-healthy image inpainting to balance realism, volumetric consistency, and data efficiency by combining two perpendicular coarse-to-fine 2D stages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing medical image inpainting methods which either suffer from discontinuities (2D methods) or require extensive datasets (3D methods).

Method: The study replaces direct 3D modeling with a hierarchical diffusion framework consisting of axial and coronal 2D diffusion models that work in perpendicular spatial views and employ adaptive resampling.

Result: The proposed method outperformed state-of-the-art baselines in both realism of the images and volumetric consistency.

Conclusion: The hierarchical diffusion framework is an effective, data-efficient solution for producing volumetrically consistent pseudo-healthy MRI images, promising for pathological brain MRI analysis.

Abstract: Pseudo-healthy image inpainting is an essential preprocessing step for
analyzing pathological brain MRI scans. Most current inpainting methods favor
slice-wise 2D models for their high in-plane fidelity, but their independence
across slices produces discontinuities in the volume. Fully 3D models alleviate
this issue, but their high model capacity demands extensive training data for
reliable, high-fidelity synthesis -- often impractical in medical settings. We
address these limitations with a hierarchical diffusion framework by replacing
direct 3D modeling with two perpendicular coarse-to-fine 2D stages. An axial
diffusion model first yields a coarse, globally consistent inpainting; a
coronal diffusion model then refines anatomical details. By combining

*Deepa Krishnaswamy,Cosmin Ciausu,Steve Pieper,Ron Kikinis,Benjamin Billot,Andrey Fedorov*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The study benchmarks three MRI abdominal segmentation models and introduces ABDSynth, a model trained solely on CT segmentations, evaluating them on three extensive public datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual MRI abdominal segmentation is costly and challenging due to signal variability and annotation effort, urging the exploration of robust and generalizable automated tools for diverse MRI settings.

Method: The study benchmarks three state-of-the-art models and proposes ABDSynth, a CT-trained segmentation model, by testing their performance on unseen public datasets covering multiple MRI sequences and conditions.

Result: MRSegmentator performs best overall, while ABDSynth is less accurate but offers a cost-effective alternative for scenarios with limited annotation resources.

Conclusion: MRSegmentator is the most reliable for MRI abdominal segmentation, but ABDSynth serves as a viable option in annotation-constrained scenarios, providing a useful trade-off between cost and accuracy.

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have led to robust automated tools for
segmentation of abdominal computed tomography (CT). Meanwhile, segmentation of
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is substantially more challenging due to the
inherent signal variability and the increased effort required for annotating
training datasets. Hence, existing approaches are trained on limited sets of
MRI sequences, which might limit their generalizability. To characterize the
landscape of MRI abdominal segmentation tools, we present here a comprehensive
benchmarking of the three state-of-the-art and open-source models:
MRSegmentator, MRISegmentator-Abdomen, and TotalSegmentator MRI. Since these
models are trained using labor-intensive manual annotation cycles, we also
introduce and evaluate ABDSynth, a SynthSeg-based model purely trained on
widely available CT segmentations (no real images). More generally, we assess
accuracy and generalizability by leveraging three public datasets (not seen by
any of the evaluated methods during their training), which span all major
manufacturers, five MRI sequences, as well as a variety of subject conditions,
voxel resolutions, and fields-of-view. Our results reveal that MRSegmentator
achieves the best performance and is most generalizable. In contrast, ABDSynth
yields slightly less accurate results, but its relaxed requirements in training
data make it an alternative when the annotation budget is limited. The
evaluation code and datasets are given for future benchmarking at
https://github.com/deepakri201/AbdoBench, along with inference code and weights

*Hang Xu,Alexandre Bousse,Alessandro Perelli*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: This paper proposes DEcomp-MoD, a deep learning method for directly converting DECT projection data into material images, addressing beam-hardening effects and offering superior accuracy compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods in material decomposition for DECT often neglect beam-hardening effects and introduce inaccuracies by relying on post-processed image domain techniques.

Method: DEcomp-MoD utilizes a spectral DECT model within the loss function combined with a score-based denoising diffusion prior, enabling direct conversion of sinogram data into material images.

Result: DEcomp-MoD outperformed state-of-the-art unsupervised score-based models and supervised networks in both quantitative and qualitative tests using low-dose AAPM dataset synthetics.

Conclusion: DEcomp-MoD offers improved accuracy by addressing physical modeling directly in the projection domain, showcasing clinical deployment potential for material decomposition in DECT imaging.

Abstract: Dual-energy X-ray Computed Tomography (DECT) constitutes an advanced
technology which enables automatic decomposition of materials in clinical
images without manual segmentation using the dependency of the X-ray linear
attenuation with energy. However, most methods perform material decomposition
in the image domain as a post-processing step after reconstruction but this
procedure does not account for the beam-hardening effect and it results in
sub-optimal results. In this work, we propose a deep learning procedure called
Dual-Energy Decomposition Model-based Diffusion (DEcomp-MoD) for quantitative
material decomposition which directly converts the DECT projection data into
material images. The algorithm is based on incorporating the knowledge of the
spectral DECT model into the deep learning training loss and combining a
score-based denoising diffusion learned prior in the material image domain.
Importantly the inference optimization loss takes as inputs directly the
sinogram and converts to material images through a model-based conditional
diffusion model which guarantees consistency of the results. We evaluate the
performance with both quantitative and qualitative estimation of the proposed
DEcomp-MoD method on synthetic DECT sinograms from the low-dose AAPM dataset.
Finally, we show that DEcomp-MoD outperform state-of-the-art unsupervised
score-based model and supervised deep learning networks, with the potential to
be deployed for clinical diagnosis.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: This paper introduces UniSegDiff, a diffusion model framework, to address issues in medical image lesion segmentation with improved training strategies for better performance across modalities and organs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of current diffusion models in uneven attention distribution during training and inference for lesion segmentation tasks, and to achieve unified segmentation across multiple modalities and organs.

Method: The authors propose UniSegDiff, incorporating staged training and inference that dynamically adjusts prediction targets at different stages. Additionally, the framework pre-trains a feature extraction network to improve segmentation tasks.

Result: UniSegDiff was evaluated on six organs across multiple imaging modalities and achieved superior performance compared to previous state-of-the-art approaches.

Conclusion: UniSegDiff offers a significant advancement in lesion segmentation via a unified framework, enhancing attention distribution across timesteps and improving multi-modal and multi-organ segmentation results.

Abstract: The Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DPM) has demonstrated remarkable
performance across a variety of generative tasks. The inherent randomness in
diffusion models helps address issues such as blurring at the edges of medical
images and labels, positioning Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DPMs) as a
promising approach for lesion segmentation. However, we find that the current
training and inference strategies of diffusion models result in an uneven
distribution of attention across different timesteps, leading to longer
training times and suboptimal solutions. To this end, we propose UniSegDiff, a
novel diffusion model framework designed to address lesion segmentation in a
unified manner across multiple modalities and organs. This framework introduces
a staged training and inference approach, dynamically adjusting the prediction
targets at different stages, forcing the model to maintain high attention
across all timesteps, and achieves unified lesion segmentation through
pre-training the feature extraction network for segmentation. We evaluate
performance on six different organs across various imaging modalities.
Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that UniSegDiff significantly
outperforms previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches. The code is available

TL;DR: This paper presents a new method to enhance diagnostic text generation in gastrointestinal pathology by addressing data quality issues and improving reasoning transparency via a better dataset, prompt design, and a novel post-training pipeline.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal models for gastrointestinal pathology struggle with poor data quality, incomplete annotations, and lack of explicit reasoning, leading to errors and lack of trust in clinical practice.

Method: The paper introduces a new gastrointestinal pathology dataset and a prompt argumentation strategy that uses lesion classification and anatomical site information. It also includes a novel post-training pipeline combining supervised fine-tuning and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO).

Result: The proposed method notably improves diagnostic text generation, achieving a 18.7% increase in clinical relevance, a 32.4% improvement in structural completeness, and a 41.2% reduction in diagnostic errors compared to baseline models.

Conclusion: This approach offers a more accurate, reliable, and clinically useful solution for automating pathology reporting through improved multimodal reasoning and structured text generation.

Abstract: Multimodal large models have shown great potential in automating pathology
image analysis. However, current multimodal models for gastrointestinal
pathology are constrained by both data quality and reasoning transparency:
pervasive noise and incomplete annotations in public datasets predispose vision
language models to factual hallucinations when generating diagnostic text,
while the absence of explicit intermediate reasoning chains renders the outputs
difficult to audit and thus less trustworthy in clinical practice. To address
these issues, we construct a large scale gastrointestinal pathology dataset
containing both microscopic descriptions and diagnostic conclusions, and
propose a prompt argumentation strategy that incorporates lesion classification
and anatomical site information. This design guides the model to better capture
image specific features and maintain semantic consistency in generation.
Furthermore, we employ a post training pipeline that combines supervised fine
tuning with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to improve reasoning
quality and output structure. Experimental results on real world pathology
report generation tasks demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms
state of the art open source and proprietary baselines in terms of generation
quality, structural completeness, and clinical relevance. Our solution
outperforms state of the art models with 18.7% higher clinical relevance, 32.4%
improved structural completeness, and 41.2% fewer diagnostic errors,
demonstrating superior accuracy and clinical utility compared to existing
solutions.

Main category: physics.flu-dyn

TL;DR: The paper introduces Hi-π, a method combining dimensional analysis and symbolic regression to automatically identify fundamental dimensionless parameters in high-dimensional systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of extracting meaningful dimensionless parameters from complex, high-dimensional physical systems.

Method: The authors propose Hi-π, a hybrid method combining physics-based dimensional analysis with symbolic regression to automate the discovery of key dimensionless parameters.

Result: Hi-π successfully identified fundamental parameters in different fluid mechanics examples, such as Rayleigh and Prandtl numbers in Rayleigh-Bénard convection, Reynolds number and relative roughness in pipe flows, and compressibility corrections in subsonic flow.

Conclusion: Hi-π demonstrates its effectiveness by discovering essential dimensionless parameters while achieving a balance between accuracy and complexity, making it a powerful tool across multiple physics contexts.

Abstract: Dimensional analysis provides a universal framework for reducing physical
complexity and reveal inherent laws. However, its application to
high-dimensional systems still generates redundant dimensionless parameters,
making it challenging to establish physically meaningful descriptions. Here, we
introduce Hierarchical Dimensionless Learning (Hi-{\pi}), a physics-data
hybrid-driven method that combines dimensional analysis and symbolic regression
to automatically discover key dimensionless parameter combination(s). We
applied this method to classic examples in various research fields of fluid
mechanics. For the Rayleigh-B\'enard convection, this method accurately
extracted two intrinsic dimensionless parameters: the Rayleigh number and the
Prandtl number, validating its unified representation advantage across
multiscale data. For the viscous flows in a circular pipe, the method
automatically discovers two optimal dimensionless parameters: the Reynolds
number and relative roughness, achieving a balance between accuracy and
complexity. For the compressibility correction in subsonic flow, the method
effectively extracts the classic compressibility correction formulation, while
demonstrating its capability to discover hierarchical structural expressions
through optimal parameter transformations.

TL;DR: The paper presents a reinforcement learning framework to efficiently construct quantum circuits for desired quantum states, utilizing Q-learning and hybrid rewards to optimize circuit depth and gates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the challenge of efficiently synthesizing quantum circuits to generate specified quantum states, a crucial problem in quantum computing.

Method: The framework combines tabular Q-learning with state-space discretization and a hybrid reward system to optimize quantum circuit structures.

Result: The algorithm achieves the discovery of minimal-depth circuits with optimized gate counts, scaling well with up to seven qubits and handling arbitrary quantum states.

Conclusion: The RL-based approach provides an efficient foundation for quantum circuit synthesis, demonstrating scalability, robustness, and resource efficiency.

Abstract: A reinforcement learning (RL) framework is introduced for the efficient
synthesis of quantum circuits that generate specified target quantum states
from a fixed initial state, addressing a central challenge in both the NISQ era
and future fault-tolerant quantum computing. The approach utilizes tabular
Q-learning, based on action sequences, within a discretized quantum state
space, to effectively manage the exponential growth of the space dimension. The
framework introduces a hybrid reward mechanism, combining a static,
domain-informed reward that guides the agent toward the target state with
customizable dynamic penalties that discourage inefficient circuit structures
such as gate congestion and redundant state revisits. By leveraging sparse
matrix representations and state-space discretization, the method enables
scalable navigation of high-dimensional environments while minimizing
computational overhead. Benchmarking on graph-state preparation tasks for up to
seven qubits, we demonstrate that the algorithm consistently discovers
minimal-depth circuits with optimized gate counts. Moreover, extending the
framework to a universal gate set for arbitrary quantum states, it still
produces minimal depth circuits, highlighting the algorithm's robustness and
adaptability. The results confirm that this RL-driven approach efficiently
explores the complex quantum state space and synthesizes near-optimal quantum
circuits, providing a resource-efficient foundation for quantum circuit
optimization.

TL;DR: This paper introduces Quantum Bayesian Reinforcement Learning (QBRL), a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm for reinforcement learning in partially observable environments, leveraging quantum advantage in belief updates to achieve computational speedups.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enhance decision-making efficiency in partially observable environments by leveraging quantum computing to accelerate the inference process within Bayesian reinforcement learning.

Method: The method involves developing QBRL, a hybrid quantum-classical look-ahead algorithm, using quantum rejection sampling and amplitude amplification for speeding up belief updates in sparse Bayesian networks, and performing a detailed time complexity analysis without relying on black-box oracles.

Result: QBRL shows computational improvements over classical reinforcement learning methods in estimating acceptance probabilities and horizon-based planning tasks, validated through numerical benchmarks.

Conclusion: Quantum computational advantages in belief updates enable faster near-optimal planning in specific settings, but the performance gain varies across tasks, underlining the context-dependent benefits of QBRL.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) provides a principled framework for
decision-making in partially observable environments, which can be modeled as
Markov decision processes and compactly represented through dynamic decision
Bayesian networks. Recent advances demonstrate that inference on sparse
Bayesian networks can be accelerated using quantum rejection sampling combined
with amplitude amplification, leading to a computational speedup in estimating
acceptance probabilities.\\ Building on this result, we introduce Quantum
Bayesian Reinforcement Learning (QBRL), a hybrid quantum-classical look-ahead
algorithm for model-based RL in partially observable environments. We present a
rigorous, oracle-free time complexity analysis under fault-tolerant assumptions
for the quantum device. Unlike standard treatments that assume a black-box
oracle, we explicitly specify the inference process, allowing our bounds to
more accurately reflect the true computational cost. We show that, for
environments whose dynamics form a sparse Bayesian network, horizon-based
near-optimal planning can be achieved sub-quadratically faster through
quantum-enhanced belief updates.
  Furthermore, we present numerical experiments benchmarking QBRL against its
classical counterpart on simple yet illustrative decision-making tasks. Our
results offer a detailed analysis of how the quantum computational advantage
translates into decision-making performance, highlighting that the magnitude of
the advantage can vary significantly across different deployment settings.

Main category: physics.comp-ph

TL;DR: The paper introduces a machine learning workflow to accurately quantify crystallinity in polymers, using low-dimensional embeddings and clustering to define crystallization labels and minimal order parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for identifying crystallization in polymers rely heavily on preset thresholds and single order parameters, which introduce systematic biases and lack robust sensitivity.

Method: The authors employed atomistic molecular dynamics data along with machine learning techniques, combining high-dimensional feature vectors, low-dimensional embeddings, unsupervised clustering, and supervised learning to identify accurate crystallization labels and reduced order parameters.

Result: The study demonstrated that crystallization labels could be recreated using just three order parameters, achieving over 0.98 classification performance (AUC). The crystallinity index remains bimodal and tracks structural transformations during crystallization.

Conclusion: This work establishes a robust, data-driven strategy for order parameter selection and introduces the crystallinity index as an efficient metric to monitor polymer structures during simulations.

Abstract: Currently, identification of crystallization pathways in polymers is being
carried out using molecular simulation-based data on a preset cut-off point on
a single order parameter (OP) to define nucleated or crystallized regions.
Aside from sensitivity to cut-off, each of these OPs introduces its own
systematic biases. In this study, an integrated machine learning workflow is
presented to accurately quantify crystallinity in polymeric systems using
atomistic molecular dynamics data. Each atom is represented by a
high-dimensional feature vector that combines geometric, thermodynamic-like,
and symmetry-based descriptors. Low dimensional embeddings are employed to
expose latent structural fingerprints within atomic environments. Subsequently,
unsupervised clustering on the embeddings identified crystalline and amorphous
atoms with high fidelity. After generating high quality labels with
multidimensional data, we use supervised learning techniques to identify a
minimal set of order parameters that can fully capture this label. Various
tests were conducted to reduce the feature set, demonstrating that using only
three order parameters is sufficient to recreate the crystallization labels.
Based on these observed OPs, the crystallinity index (C-index) is defined as
the logistic regression model's probability of crystallinity, remaining bimodal
throughout the process and achieving over 0.98 classification performance
(AUC). Notably, a model trained on one or a few snapshots enables efficient
on-the-fly computation of crystallinity. Lastly, we demonstrate how the optimal
C-index fit evolves during various stages of crystallization, supporting the
hypothesis that entropy dominates early nucleation, while symmetry gains
relevance later. This workflow provides a data-driven strategy for OP selection
and a metric to monitor structural transformations in large-scale polymer
simulations.

*Nils Sturma,Mathias Drton*

Main category: math.ST

TL;DR: The paper presents a graphical criterion for identifying causal effects in linear structural equation models (LSEMs) with latent variables. The method diverges from prior approaches by not limiting latent variables to independent latent factors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for identifying causal effects in LSEMs with latent variables are limited. This paper aims to overcome such restrictions, such as requiring latent variables as independent latent factors.

Method: The authors introduce the latent-subgraph criterion, a graphical condition that determines identifiability. Additionally, they propose an algorithm using an integer linear program to verify the criterion, targeting causal effects between observed and latent variables.

Result: The latent-subgraph criterion is established as sufficient for causal identifiability using the covariance matrix. The algorithm enables practical certification. This work also simplifies existing measurement models for further analysis.

Conclusion: The latent-subgraph criterion extends the capability to identify causal effects in more general LSEMs, facilitating efficient analysis and transformations of models with latent variables.

Abstract: We develop a criterion to certify whether causal effects are identifiable in
linear structural equation models with latent variables. Linear structural
equation models correspond to directed graphs whose nodes represent the random
variables of interest and whose edges are weighted with linear coefficients
that correspond to direct causal effects. In contrast to previous
identification methods, we do not restrict ourselves to settings where the
latent variables constitute independent latent factors (i.e., to source nodes
in the graphical representation of the model). Our novel latent-subgraph
criterion is a purely graphical condition that is sufficient for
identifiability of causal effects by rational formulas in the covariance
matrix. To check the latent-subgraph criterion, we provide a sound and complete
algorithm that operates by solving an integer linear program. While it targets
effects involving observed variables, our new criterion is also useful for
identifying effects between latent variables, as it allows one to transform the
given model into a simpler measurement model for which other existing tools
become applicable.

TL;DR: The paper studies the zeroth-order query complexity for log-concave sampling and introduces a proximal sampler variant achieving efficient uniform sampling with R\'enyi divergence guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the efficiency and theoretical guarantees for zeroth-order uniform sampling from convex bodies using membership oracles, a common problem in optimization and statistics.

Method: Proposed a proximal sampler variant utilizing R\'enyi divergence for warm start initialization and introduced an annealing scheme for warm start generation. Results were achieved through hypercontractivity under heat flow and leveraging Sobolev inequalities.

Result: Achieved a query complexity of $\widetilde{O}(qM_{q}^{q/(q-1)}d^{2}\,\lVert\operatorname{cov}\pi\rVert\log\frac{1}{\varepsilon})$ for uniform sampling, and a warm-start query complexity of $\widetilde{O}(qd^{2}R^{3/2}\,\lVert\operatorname{cov}\pi\rVert^{1/4})$. Extended results to general log-concave distributions.

Conclusion: The proposed method improves the efficiency of uniform and log-concave sampling, offering advancements for applications in high-dimensional settings. Notable extensions include optimization with evaluation oracles.

Abstract: We study the zeroth-order query complexity of log-concave sampling,
specifically uniform sampling from convex bodies using membership oracles. We
propose a simple variant of the proximal sampler that achieves the query
complexity with matched R\'enyi orders between the initial warmness and output
guarantee. Specifically, for any $\varepsilon>0$ and $q\geq2$, the sampler,
initialized at $\pi_{0}$, outputs a sample whose law is $\varepsilon$-close in
$q$-R\'enyi divergence to $\pi$, the uniform distribution over a convex body in
$\mathbb{R}^{d}$, using
$\widetilde{O}(qM_{q}^{q/(q-1)}d^{2}\,\lVert\operatorname{cov}\pi\rVert\log\frac{1}{\varepsilon})$
membership queries, where
$M_{q}=\lVert\text{d}\pi_{0}/\text{d}\pi\rVert_{L^{q}(\pi)}$.
  We further introduce a simple annealing scheme that produces a warm start in
$q$-R\'enyi divergence (i.e., $M_{q}=O(1)$) using
$\widetilde{O}(qd^{2}R^{3/2}\,\lVert\operatorname{cov}\pi\rVert^{1/4})$
queries, where $R^{2}=\mathbb{E}_{\pi}[|\cdot|^{2}]$. This interpolates between
known complexities for warm-start generation in total variation and
R\'enyi-infinity divergence. To relay a R\'enyi warmness across the annealing
scheme, we establish hypercontractivity under simultaneous heat flow and
translate it into an improved mixing guarantee for the proximal sampler under a
logarithmic Sobolev inequality. These results extend naturally to general
log-concave distributions accessible via evaluation oracles, incurring
additional quadratic queries.

Conclusion: By adopting ISO C++ parallel constructs and utilizing NVIDIA GPUs, OpenFOAM's performance can be significantly enhanced, paving the way for modern software optimization in HPC.

Abstract: The modern trend in High-Performance Computing (HPC) involves the use of
accelerators such as Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) alongside Central
Processing Units (CPUs) to speed up numerical operations in various
applications. Leading manufacturers such as NVIDIA, Intel, and AMD are
constantly advancing these architectures, augmenting them with features such as
mixed precision, enhanced memory hierarchies, and specialised accelerator
silicon blocks (e.g., Tensor Cores on GPU or AMX/SME engines on CPU) to enhance
compute performance. At the same time, significant efforts in software
development are aimed at optimizing the use of these innovations, seeking to
improve usability and accessibility. This work contributes to the
state-of-the-art of OpenFOAM development by presenting a working
Proof-Of-Concept application built using modern ISO C++ parallel constructs.
This approach, combined with an appropriate compiler runtime stack, like the
one provided by the NVIDIA HPC SDK, makes it possible to accelerate
well-defined kernels, allowing multi-core execution and GPU offloading using a
single codebase. The study demonstrates that it is possible to increase the
performance of the OpenFOAM laplacianFoam application by offloading the
computations on NVIDIA GPUs using the C++ parallel construct.

TL;DR: This study investigates how personalized support and different sequences of instruction, particularly I-PS and PS-I approaches, impact diagnostic reasoning in scenario-based learning, finding PS-I to significantly enhance transfer task performance.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to help students overcome cognitive biases and improve diagnostic reasoning using Scenario-Based Learning (SBL), particularly by identifying effective instructional sequencing.

Method: A between-groups experimental design was used with an online SBL environment, PharmaSim, to test two instructional sequences: instruction before problem-solving (I-PS) and instruction after problem-solving (PS-I).

Result: Both instructional approaches (I-PS and PS-I) were beneficial, but the PS-I approach led to significantly better performance in transfer tasks.

Conclusion: Providing explicit diagnostic strategy instruction after problem-solving (PS-I) is more effective in enhancing the transfer of learning compared to instruction provided before problem-solving (I-PS).

Abstract: Supporting students in developing effective diagnostic reasoning is a key
challenge in various educational domains. Novices often struggle with cognitive
biases such as premature closure and over-reliance on heuristics.
Scenario-based learning (SBL) can address these challenges by offering
realistic case experiences and iterative practice, but the optimal sequencing
of instruction and problem-solving activities remains unclear. This study
examines how personalized support can be incorporated into different
instructional sequences and whether providing explicit diagnostic strategy
instruction before (I-PS) or after problem-solving (PS-I) improves learning and
its transfer. We employ a between-groups design in an online SBL environment
called PharmaSim, which simulates real-world client interactions for pharmacy
technician apprentices. Results indicate that while both instruction types are
beneficial, PS-I leads to significantly higher performance in transfer tasks.

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: The paper presents a two-stage fine-tuning process to enable scalable adaptation of self-driving capabilities across diverse environments and vehicle configurations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for efficient scalability in automated driving systems to achieve broad deployment across different vehicles, environments, regulations, and cultural contexts.

Method: A two-stage fine-tuning approach: (1) country-specific reward models to integrate socio-political requirements, and (2) vehicle-specific transfer learning to adapt systems.

Result: The proposed method ensures scalable adaptation by addressing both technological and socio-political aspects.

Conclusion: The method provides a data-driven framework facilitating effective scalability of automated driving systems across diverse and complex real-world conditions.

Abstract: Efficient scalability of automated driving (AD) is key to reducing costs,
enhancing safety, conserving resources, and maximizing impact. However,
research focuses on specific vehicles and context, while broad deployment
requires scalability across various configurations and environments.
Differences in vehicle types, sensors, actuators, but also traffic regulations,
legal requirements, cultural dynamics, or even ethical paradigms demand high
flexibility of data-driven developed capabilities. In this paper, we address
the challenge of scalable adaptation of generic capabilities to desired systems
and environments. Our concept follows a two-stage fine-tuning process. In the
first stage, fine-tuning to the specific environment takes place through a
country-specific reward model that serves as an interface between technological
adaptations and socio-political requirements. In the second stage,
vehicle-specific transfer learning facilitates system adaptation and governs
the validation of design decisions. In sum, our concept offers a data-driven
process that integrates both technological and socio-political aspects,
enabling effective scalability across technical, legal, cultural, and ethical
differences.
