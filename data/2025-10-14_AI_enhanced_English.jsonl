Both of these processes are\nslow, costly, and difficult to scale. World models offer a promising, scalable\nalternative by enabling policies to rollout within imagination space. However,\na key challenge is building a controllable world model that can handle\nmulti-step interactions with generalist robot policies. This requires a world\nmodel compatible with modern generalist policies by supporting multi-view\nprediction, fine-grained action control, and consistent long-horizon\ninteractions, which is not achieved by previous works. In this paper, we make a\nstep forward by introducing a controllable multi-view world model that can be\nused to evaluate and improve the instruction-following ability of generalist\nrobot policies. Our model maintains long-horizon consistency with a\npose-conditioned memory retrieval mechanism and achieves precise action control\nthrough frame-level action conditioning. Trained on the DROID dataset (95k\ntrajectories, 564 scenes), our model generates spatially and temporally\nconsistent trajectories under novel scenarios and new camera placements for\nover 20 seconds. We show that our method can accurately rank policy performance\nwithout real-world robot rollouts. Moreover, by synthesizing successful\ntrajectories in imagination and using them for supervised fine-tuning, our\napproach can improve policy success by 44.7\\%.", "AI": {"tldr": "This paper addresses challenges in evaluating and improving the adaptability of generalist robot policies to unfamiliar scenarios by introducing a controllable multi-view world model that supports long-horizon interactions and action precision.", "motivation": "Generalist robot policies face difficulties when tested with unfamiliar objects and instructions due to the inefficiencies of real-world evaluations and improvements.

Among all\nthe reasoning paradigms, inductive reasoning is one of the fundamental types,\nwhich is characterized by its particular-to-general thinking process and the\nnon-uniqueness of its answers. The inductive mode is crucial for knowledge\ngeneralization and aligns better with human cognition, so it is a fundamental\nmode of learning, hence attracting increasing interest. Despite the importance\nof inductive reasoning, there is no systematic summary of it. Therefore, this\npaper presents the first comprehensive survey of inductive reasoning for LLMs.\nFirst, methods for improving inductive reasoning are categorized into three\nmain areas: post-training, test-time scaling, and data augmentation. Then,\ncurrent benchmarks of inductive reasoning are summarized, and a unified\nsandbox-based evaluation approach with the observation coverage metric is\nderived. Finally, we offer some analyses regarding the source of inductive\nability and how simple model architectures and data help with inductive tasks,\nproviding a solid foundation for future research.", "AI": {"tldr": "This paper presents the first comprehensive survey of inductive reasoning in large language models (LLMs), outlining key methods, benchmarks, and evaluation approaches, while offering future research insights.", "motivation": "Inductive reasoning is crucial for knowledge generalization and human-like cognition, but lacks a systematic summary, motivating a comprehensive survey.", "method": "The paper categorizes methods to improve inductive reasoning into post-training, test-time scaling, and data augmentation; summarizes benchmarks; and introduces a unified evaluation approach with the observation coverage metric.", "result": "It provides foundational analyses on the sources of inductive ability and how model architectures and data impact inductive reasoning tasks.", "conclusion": "This work establishes a solid basis for advancing the understanding and improvement of inductive reasoning in LLMs, promoting further research in this area."}}

A backdoored VLA agent can be covertly\ntriggered by a pre-injected backdoor to execute adversarial actions,\npotentially causing system failures or even physical harm. Although backdoor\nattacks on VLA models have been explored, prior work has focused only on\nuntargeted attacks, leaving the more practically threatening scenario of\ntargeted manipulation unexamined. In this paper, we study targeted backdoor\nattacks on VLA models and introduce TabVLA, a novel framework that enables such\nattacks via black-box fine-tuning. TabVLA explores two deployment-relevant\ninference-time threat models: input-stream editing and in-scene triggering. It\nformulates poisoned data generation as an optimization problem to improve\nattack effectivess. Experiments with OpenVLA-7B on the LIBERO benchmark reveal\nthat the vision channel is the principal attack surface: targeted backdoors\nsucceed with minimal poisoning, remain robust across variations in trigger\ndesign, and are degraded only by positional mismatches between fine-tuning and\ninference triggers. We also investigate a potential detection-based defense\nagainst TabVLA, which reconstructs latent visual triggers from the input stream\nto flag activation-conditioned backdoor samples. Our work highlights the\nvulnerability of VLA models to targeted backdoor manipulation and underscores\nthe need for more advanced defenses.", "AI": {"tldr": "This paper introduces TabVLA, a framework for targeted backdoor attacks on Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, highlighting their vulnerability to such threats and evaluating defenses.", "motivation": "VLA models are increasingly used in real-world embodied AI systems, but their susceptibility to targeted backdoor attacks poses significant safety risks.", "method": "TabVLA uses black-box fine-tuning to implement targeted backdoor attacks.

ImpMIA is a white-box attack -- a\nsetting which assumes access to model weights and is becoming increasingly\nrealistic given that many models are publicly available (e.g., via Hugging\nFace). Building on maximum-margin implicit bias theory, ImpMIA uses the\nKarush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) optimality conditions to identify training samples.\nThis is done by finding the samples whose gradients most strongly reconstruct\nthe trained model's parameters. As a result, ImpMIA achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance compared to both black and white box attacks in realistic settings\nwhere only the model weights and a superset of the training data are available.", "AI": {"tldr": "This paper introduces ImpMIA, a white-box Membership Inference Attack leveraging the implicit bias of neural networks, achieving state-of-the-art performance without relying on restrictive assumptions of black-box methods.", "motivation": "The motivation is to address the limitations of black-box Membership Inference Attacks, which depend on unrealistic assumptions and struggle in real-world scenarios.", "method": "ImpMIA leverages the implicit bias of neural networks.

This paper addresses the challenge of reliably delivering packets\nwithin application-imposed deadlines by leveraging recent advancements in\nMulti-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning (MA-DRL). After introducing the\nDelay-Constrained Maximum-Throughput (DCMT) dynamic network control problem,\nand highlighting the limitations of current solutions, we present a novel\nMA-DRL network control framework that leverages a centralized routing and\ndistributed scheduling architecture.
