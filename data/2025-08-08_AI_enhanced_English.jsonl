As AI systems begin to exhaust\nhigh-quality training data and rely on increasingly large human workforces for\nreward design, the current paradigm faces significant scalability challenges\nthat could impede progress toward genuinely autonomous intelligence. The\nproposal for an ``Era of Experience,'' where agents learn from self-generated\ndata, is a promising step forward. However, this vision still depends on\nextensive human engineering of reward functions, effectively shifting the\nbottleneck from data curation to reward curation. This highlights what we\nidentify as the \\textbf{grounded-agency gap}: the inability of contemporary AI\nsystems to autonomously formulate, adapt, and pursue objectives in response to\nchanging circumstances. We propose that AIF can bridge this gap by replacing\nexternal reward signals with an intrinsic drive to minimize free energy,\nallowing agents to naturally balance exploration and exploitation through a\nunified Bayesian objective. By integrating Large Language Models as generative\nworld models with AIF's principled decision-making framework, we can create\nagents that learn efficiently from experience while remaining aligned with\nhuman values. This synthesis offers a compelling path toward AI systems that\ncan develop autonomously while adhering to both computational and physical\nconstraints.", "AI": {"tldr": "This paper advocates using Active Inference (AIF) to create autonomous AI systems that learn from experience without extensive human reward engineering, addressing key scalability challenges.", "motivation": "The current AI paradigm struggles with scalability due to its dependence on curated training data and human-designed reward systems, hindering progress toward autonomous intelligence.", "method": "The authors propose using Active Inference (AIF), which replaces external rewards with an intrinsic drive to minimize free energy, enabling adaptive and exploratory behavior.

These features enable\nmore realistic simulation of dynamic candidate items and better modeling of\nuser and streamer behaviors. We conduct a thorough analysis of KuaiLive from\nmultiple perspectives and evaluate several representative recommendation\nmethods on it, establishing a strong benchmark for future research. KuaiLive\ncan support a wide range of tasks in the live streaming domain, such as top-K\nrecommendation, click-through rate prediction, watch time prediction, and gift\nprice prediction. Moreover, its fine-grained behavioral data also enables\nresearch on multi-behavior modeling, multi-task learning, and fairness-aware\nrecommendation.
