### [1] [Topos Theory for Generative AI and LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08293)
*Sridhar Mahadevan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new design for generative AI architectures using topos theory to improve large language models (LLMs) by leveraging universal constructions in category theory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Past research has focused on linear architectures and mixture-of-experts for LLMs without addressing their higher-order compositionality and set-like characteristics.

Method: The study utilizes universal constructions from category theory such as pushouts, pullbacks, and subobject classifiers to propose novel architectures for LLMs.

Result: It is theoretically shown that the category of LLM functions is (co)complete and forms a topos.

Conclusion: The paper validates the proposed architecture conceptually, showing its potential through universal constructions and suggests using functorial backpropagation for implementation.

Abstract: We propose the design of novel categorical generative AI architectures
(GAIAs) using topos theory, a type of category that is ``set-like": a topos has
all (co)limits, is Cartesian closed, and has a subobject classifier. Previous
theoretical results on the Transformer model have shown that it is a universal
sequence-to-sequence function approximator, and dense in the space of all
continuous functions with compact support on the Euclidean space of embeddings
of tokens. Building on this theoretical result, we explore novel architectures
for LLMs that exploit the property that the category of LLMs, viewed as
functions, forms a topos. Previous studies of large language models (LLMs) have
focused on daisy-chained linear architectures or mixture-of-experts. In this
paper, we use universal constructions in category theory to construct novel LLM
architectures based on new types of compositional structures. In particular,
these new compositional structures are derived from universal properties of LLM
categories, and include pullback, pushout, (co) equalizers, exponential
objects, and subobject classifiers. We theoretically validate these new
compositional structures by showing that the category of LLMs is (co)complete,
meaning that all diagrams have solutions in the form of (co)limits. Building on
this completeness result, we then show that the category of LLMs forms a topos,
a ``set-like" category, which requires showing the existence of exponential
objects as well as subobject classifiers. We use a functorial characterization
of backpropagation to define a potential implementation of an LLM topos
architecture.

### [2] [Topos Causal Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08295)
*Sridhar Mahadevan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces topos causal models (TCMs), leveraging the mathematical properties of topos categories to improve causal inference, enabling better modeling, reasoning, and approximation of causal relationships.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing causal models have limitations when handling complex structures and reasoning about equivalence classes of interventions, prompting the need for a more generalized framework like topos causal models.

Method: The authors define TCMs using the properties of topos categories, such as subobject classifiers, limits, colimits, and exponential objects, and then demonstrate how these properties enable various causal inference processes, including approximation and intervention modeling.

Result: TCMs provide a complete and precise framework for causal inference, encompassing solving diagrams of any complexity, formalizing causal interventions, and reasoning about equivalence classes in causal relationships.

Conclusion: Topos causal models form a robust categorical framework for causal reasoning, improving the capabilities of traditional methods and introducing an internal logic for rigorous reasoning about causal systems.

Abstract: We propose topos causal models (TCMs), a novel class of causal models that
exploit the key properties of a topos category: they are (co)complete, meaning
all (co)limits exist, they admit a subobject classifier, and allow exponential
objects. The main goal of this paper is to show that these properties are
central to many applications in causal inference. For example, subobject
classifiers allow a categorical formulation of causal intervention, which
creates sub-models. Limits and colimits allow causal diagrams of arbitrary
complexity to be ``solved", using a novel interpretation of causal
approximation. Exponential objects enable reasoning about equivalence classes
of operations on causal models, such as covered edge reversal and causal
homotopy. Analogous to structural causal models (SCMs), TCMs are defined by a
collection of functions, each defining a ``local autonomous" causal mechanism
that assemble to induce a unique global function from exogenous to endogenous
variables. Since the category of TCMs is (co)complete, which we prove in this
paper, every causal diagram has a ``solution" in the form of a (co)limit: this
implies that any arbitrary causal model can be ``approximated" by some global
function with respect to the morphisms going into or out of the diagram.
Natural transformations are crucial in measuring the quality of approximation.
In addition, we show that causal interventions are modeled by subobject
classifiers: any sub-model is defined by a monic arrow into its parent model.
Exponential objects permit reasoning about entire classes of causal
equivalences and interventions. Finally, as TCMs form a topos, they admit an
internal logic defined as a Mitchell-Benabou language with an associated
Kripke-Joyal semantics. We show how to reason about causal models in TCMs using
this internal logic.

### [3] [An Efficient Application of Goal Programming to Tackle Multiobjective Problems with Recurring Fitness Landscapes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08297)
*Rodrigo Lankaites Pinheiro,Dario Landa-Silva,Wasakorn Laesanklang,Ademir Aparecido Constantino*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a methodology combining multiobjective and single-objective algorithms to efficiently solve problem scenarios with similar fitness landscapes, using the multiobjective vehicle routing problem as an example.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the difficulty of solving highly constrained many-objective problems by leveraging similarities in the fitness landscapes of multiple problem instances.

Method: Use computationally expensive multiobjective algorithms to solve one problem instance, then apply Goal Programming with efficient single-objective algorithms to other similar instances.

Result: The methodology produced good results with reduced computation time on benchmark instances of the multiobjective vehicle routing problem with time windows.

Conclusion: The combination of multiobjective algorithms' effectiveness and goal programming's efficiency enables finding good solutions quickly in scenarios with recurring fitness landscape features.

Abstract: Many real-world applications require decision-makers to assess the quality of
solutions while considering multiple conflicting objectives. Obtaining good
approximation sets for highly constrained many-objective problems is often a
difficult task even for modern multiobjective algorithms. In some cases,
multiple instances of the problem scenario present similarities in their
fitness landscapes. That is, there are recurring features in the fitness
landscapes when searching for solutions to different problem instances. We
propose a methodology to exploit this characteristic by solving one instance of
a given problem scenario using computationally expensive multiobjective
algorithms to obtain a good approximation set and then using Goal Programming
with efficient single-objective algorithms to solve other instances of the same
problem scenario. We use three goal-based objective functions and show that on
benchmark instances of the multiobjective vehicle routing problem with time
windows, the methodology is able to produce good results in short computation
time. The methodology allows to combine the effectiveness of state-of-the-art
multiobjective algorithms with the efficiency of goal programming to find good
compromise solutions in problem scenarios where instances have similar fitness
landscapes.

### [4] [LLM-BI: Towards Fully Automated Bayesian Inference with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08300)
*Yongchao Huang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper explores using Large Language Models (LLMs) to simplify Bayesian inference by automating prior and model specification through a conceptual pipeline called LLM-BI.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The complexity of defining prior distributions and likelihoods in Bayesian inference acts as a significant barrier for non-specialists.

Method: The paper proposed LLM-BI and demonstrated its feasibility through two experiments involving Bayesian linear regression: eliciting priors from natural language and specifying full model structures from high-level descriptions.

Result: LLMs successfully elicited priors and modeled complete structures in Bayesian workflows, showing promise for automating the process.

Conclusion: LLMs have the potential to lower accessibility barriers in Bayesian modeling by automating key stages, opening pathways for broader usage in probabilistic programming.

Abstract: A significant barrier to the widespread adoption of Bayesian inference is the
specification of prior distributions and likelihoods, which often requires
specialized statistical expertise. This paper investigates the feasibility of
using a Large Language Model (LLM) to automate this process. We introduce
LLM-BI (Large Language Model-driven Bayesian Inference), a conceptual pipeline
for automating Bayesian workflows. As a proof-of-concept, we present two
experiments focused on Bayesian linear regression. In Experiment I, we
demonstrate that an LLM can successfully elicit prior distributions from
natural language. In Experiment II, we show that an LLM can specify the entire
model structure, including both priors and the likelihood, from a single
high-level problem description. Our results validate the potential of LLMs to
automate key steps in Bayesian modeling, enabling the possibility of an
automated inference pipeline for probabilistic programming.

### [5] [First Ask Then Answer: A Framework Design for AI Dialogue Based on Supplementary Questioning with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08308)
*Chuanruo Fu,Yuncheng Du*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new interaction paradigm, First Ask Then Answer (FATA), for improving the accuracy and relevance of responses from Large Language Models (LLMs) by generating multidimensional supplementary questions before answering queries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle to provide accurate responses to incomplete or ill-specified user queries, necessitating a framework to improve query specification and response quality.

Method: The FATA framework prompts LLMs to generate supplementary questions ahead of answering, integrates user-provided details into the query, and uses single-turn clarification to streamline the process.

Result: FATA outperforms baseline and expert prompts by improving response quality by about 40% and delivering more stable results with an 8% lower coefficient of variation than the expert prompt.

Conclusion: FATA enables LLMs to assist non-expert users in forming comprehensive queries and achieves increased efficiency and response accuracy through proactive questioning.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle to deliver accurate and
actionable answers when user-provided information is incomplete or
ill-specified. We propose a new interaction paradigm, First Ask Then Answer
(FATA), in which, through prompt words, LLMs are guided to proactively generate
multidimensional supplementary questions for users prior to response
generation. Subsequently, by integrating user-provided supplementary
information with the original query through sophisticated prompting techniques,
we achieve substantially improved response quality and relevance. In contrast
to existing clarification approaches -- such as the CLAM framework oriented to
ambiguity and the self-interrogation Self-Ask method -- FATA emphasizes
completeness (beyond mere disambiguation) and user participation (inviting
human input instead of relying solely on model-internal reasoning). It also
adopts a single-turn strategy: all clarifying questions are produced at once,
thereby reducing dialogue length and improving efficiency. Conceptually, FATA
uses the reasoning power of LLMs to scaffold user expression, enabling
non-expert users to formulate more comprehensive and contextually relevant
queries. To evaluate FATA, we constructed a multi-domain benchmark and compared
it with two controls: a baseline prompt (B-Prompt) and a context-enhanced
expert prompt (C-Prompt). Experimental results show that FATA outperforms
B-Prompt by approximately 40% in aggregate metrics and exhibits a coefficient
of variation 8% lower than C-Prompt, indicating superior stability.

### [6] [What Breaks Knowledge Graph based RAG? Empirical Insights into Reasoning under Incomplete Knowledge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08344)
*Dongzhuoran Zhou,Yuqicheng Zhu,Xiaxia Wang,Hongkuan Zhou,Yuan He,Jiaoyan Chen,Evgeny Kharlamov,Steffen Staab*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes better benchmarks and evaluation protocols for assessing Knowledge Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (KG-RAG) under incomplete knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address shortcomings in current KG-RAG evaluation practices, such as reliance on direct retrieval, inconsistent metrics, and unclear reasoning assessment under incomplete knowledge.

Method: The authors introduce a general method for constructing more effective benchmarks and an evaluation protocol to test KG-RAG performance under knowledge incompleteness.

Result: Empirical results show that current KG-RAG models struggle with reasoning when knowledge is incomplete, rely heavily on memorization, and vary in generalization ability depending on their design.

Conclusion: Improved benchmarks and evaluations are needed to truly assess and enhance the reasoning capabilities of KG-RAG models in scenarios of incomplete knowledge.

Abstract: Knowledge Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (KG-RAG) is an
increasingly explored approach for combining the reasoning capabilities of
large language models with the structured evidence of knowledge graphs.
However, current evaluation practices fall short: existing benchmarks often
include questions that can be directly answered using existing triples in KG,
making it unclear whether models perform reasoning or simply retrieve answers
directly. Moreover, inconsistent evaluation metrics and lenient answer matching
criteria further obscure meaningful comparisons. In this work, we introduce a
general method for constructing benchmarks, together with an evaluation
protocol, to systematically assess KG-RAG methods under knowledge
incompleteness. Our empirical results show that current KG-RAG methods have
limited reasoning ability under missing knowledge, often rely on internal
memorization, and exhibit varying degrees of generalization depending on their
design.

### [7] [UrzaGPT: LoRA-Tuned Large Language Models for Card Selection in Collectible Card Games](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08382)
*Timo Bertram*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces UrzaGPT, a fine-tuned large language model for real-time drafting in collectible card game "Magic: The Gathering," demonstrating its feasibility and potential for general AI applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the challenges faced by AI in collectible card games, such as partial observability, long-term strategy, and dynamic card sets, which hinder performance in tasks like deckbuilding and gameplay.

Method: The paper introduces UrzaGPT, which adapts an open-weight large language model to the domain using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) fine-tuning on annotated draft logs from Magic: The Gathering.

Result: UrzaGPT achieves 66.2% drafting accuracy with just 10,000 training steps, outperforming zero-shot LLMs like GPT-4o (43%) but falling short of specialized domain models.

Conclusion: LLMs can serve as the foundation for drafting AIs that are efficient, adaptable to updates, and capable of general application, emphasizing their viability for complex CCG tasks.

Abstract: Collectible card games (CCGs) are a difficult genre for AI due to their
partial observability, long-term decision-making, and evolving card sets. Due
to this, current AI models perform vastly worse than human players at CCG tasks
such as deckbuilding and gameplay. In this work, we introduce UrzaGPT, a
domain-adapted large language model that recommends real-time drafting
decisions in Magic: The Gathering. Starting from an open-weight LLM, we use
Low-Rank Adaptation fine-tuning on a dataset of annotated draft logs. With
this, we leverage the language modeling capabilities of LLM, and can quickly
adapt to different expansions of the game. We benchmark UrzaGPT in comparison
to zero-shot LLMs and the state-of-the-art domain-specific model. Untuned,
small LLMs like Llama-3-8B are completely unable to draft, but the larger
GPT-4o achieves a zero-shot performance of 43%. Using UrzaGPT to fine-tune
smaller models, we achieve an accuracy of 66.2% using only 10,000 steps.
Despite this not reaching the capability of domain-specific models, we show
that solely using LLMs to draft is possible and conclude that using LLMs can
enable performant, general, and update-friendly drafting AIs in the future.

### [8] [Bilevel MCTS for Amortized O(1) Node Selection in Classical Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08385)
*Masataro Asai*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces an optimization for MCTS used in classical planning, addressing its inefficiency in node selection during search. The proposed bilevel approach and tree collapsing enhancements aim to improve this bottleneck.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the significant computational time spent on node selection by MCTS in classical planning, which is problematic due to the large search depth in this domain.

Method: The authors propose a bilevel modification to MCTS, incorporating a best-first search from each leaf node with an expansion budget proportional to the search depth, achieving amortized O(1) runtime. Additionally, they introduce a Tree Collapsing method to enhance action selection speed.

Result: The proposed methods reduce the runtime complexity of node selection and improve the efficiency of MCTS in classical planning tasks.

Conclusion: These modifications optimize MCTS for classical planning, making it computationally more scalable while maintaining performance.

Abstract: We study an efficient implementation of Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB)-based
Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) for classical planning. One weakness of MCTS is
that it spends a significant time deciding which node to expand next. While
selecting a node from an OPEN list with $N$ nodes has $O(1)$ runtime complexity
with traditional array-based priority-queues for dense integer keys, the
tree-based OPEN list used by MCTS requires $O(\log N)$, which roughly
corresponds to the search depth $d$. In classical planning, $d$ is arbitrarily
large (e.g., $2^k-1$ in $k$-disk Tower-of-Hanoi) and the runtime for node
selection is significant, unlike in game tree search, where the cost is
negligible compared to the node evaluation (rollouts) because $d$ is inherently
limited by the game (e.g., $d\leq 361$ in Go). To improve this bottleneck, we
propose a bilevel modification to MCTS that runs a best-first search from each
selected leaf node with an expansion budget proportional to $d$, which achieves
amortized $O(1)$ runtime for node selection, equivalent to the traditional
queue-based OPEN list. In addition, we introduce Tree Collapsing, an
enhancement that reduces action selection steps and further improves the
performance.

### [9] [Solver-Aided Expansion of Loops to Avoid Generate-and-Test](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08442)
*Niklas Dewally,Özgür Akgün*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to optimize constraint modelling language compilation by avoiding full loop enumeration, making it faster.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The inefficiency in current methods for compiling constraint modelling languages, especially when induction variables have wide-ranging domains with specific conditions, motivated this research.

Method: The authors introduce a method where a solver calculates only the necessary combinations for generating constraints, bypassing the need for full enumeration.

Result: The proposed method significantly speeds up the compilation process while producing a model identical to conventional methods.

Conclusion: The approach enhances the efficiency of translating high-level user models into solver-ready forms, particularly for complex problems.

Abstract: Constraint modelling languages like MiniZinc and Essence rely on unrolling
loops (in the form of quantified expressions and comprehensions) during
compilation. Standard approaches generate all combinations of induction
variables and use partial evaluation to discard those that simplify to identity
elements of associative-commutative operators (e.g. true for conjunction, 0 for
summation). This can be inefficient for problems where most combinations are
ultimately irrelevant. We present a method that avoids full enumeration by
using a solver to compute only the combinations required to generate the final
set of constraints. The resulting model is identical to that produced by
conventional flattening, but compilation can be significantly faster. This
improves the efficiency of translating high-level user models into solver-ready
form, particularly when induction variables range over large domains with
selective preconditions.

### [10] [OverFill: Two-Stage Models for Efficient Language Model Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08446)
*Woojeong Kim,Junxiong Wang,Jing Nathan Yan,Mohamed Abdelfattah,Alexander M. Rush*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'OverFill,' an approach to decouple prefill and decode stages in large language models (LLMs) to enhance efficiency without compromising quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs face challenges in deployment due to high inference costs, especially during the decode stage, which significantly impacts latency.

Method: OverFill uses a full model for prefill to handle inputs in parallel, then switches to a dense pruned model for sequential token generation.

Result: The approach improves efficiency, achieving significant quality gains (e.g., 83.2% improvement for 3B-to-1B configuration) while matching the performance of same-sized models trained from scratch.

Conclusion: OverFill optimizes LLM inference by balancing quality and efficiency, making it a promising solution for resource-constrained deployments.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel across diverse tasks but face significant
deployment challenges due to high inference costs. LLM inference comprises
prefill (compute-bound) and decode (memory-bound) stages, with decode
dominating latency particularly for long sequences. Current decoder-only models
handle both stages uniformly, despite their distinct computational profiles. We
propose OverFill, which decouples these stages to optimize accuracy-efficiency
tradeoffs. OverFill begins with a full model for prefill, processing system and
user inputs in parallel. It then switches to a dense pruned model, while
generating tokens sequentially. Leveraging more compute during prefill,
OverFill improves generation quality with minimal latency overhead. Our
3B-to-1B OverFill configuration outperforms 1B pruned models by 83.2%, while
the 8B-to-3B configuration improves over 3B pruned models by 79.2% on average
across standard benchmarks. OverFill matches the performance of same-sized
models trained from scratch, while using significantly less training data. Our
code is available at https://github.com/friendshipkim/overfill.

### [11] [A Fast GRASP Metaheuristic for the Trigger Arc TSP with MIP-Based Construction and Multi-Neighborhood Local Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08477)
*Joan Salvà Soler,Grégoire de Lambertye*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper extends the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) by introducing dynamic arc costs and proposes a GRASP-based metaheuristic to address it. The method achieves competitive results in computational experiments and competitions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address routing problems with dynamic, state-dependent arc costs, such as those found in warehouse operations with compactable storage systems.

Method: Introduces a GRASP-based method combining multiple construction heuristics and multi-neighborhood local search. Uses mixed-integer programming for construction and 2-Opt, Swap, and Relocate operators for optimization.

Result: Achieved 0.77% and 0.40% optimality gaps on competition instances. On synthetic datasets, outperformed Gurobi solver by 11.3%. Finished in the top three at MESS 2024 competition.

Conclusion: The proposed method is effective for solving state-dependent routing problems and is suitable for real-time applications.

Abstract: The Trigger Arc Traveling Salesman Problem (TA-TSP) extends the classical TSP
by introducing dynamic arc costs that change when specific \textit{trigger}
arcs are traversed, modeling scenarios such as warehouse operations with
compactable storage systems. This paper introduces a GRASP-based metaheuristic
that combines multiple construction heuristics with a multi-neighborhood local
search. The construction phase uses mixed-integer programming (MIP) techniques
to transform the TA-TSP into a sequence of tailored TSP instances, while the
improvement phase applies 2-Opt, Swap, and Relocate operators. Computational
experiments on MESS 2024 competition instances achieved average optimality gaps
of 0.77\% and 0.40\% relative to the best-known solutions within a 60-second
limit. On smaller, synthetically generated datasets, the method produced
solutions 11.3\% better than the Gurobi solver under the same time constraints.
The algorithm finished in the top three at MESS 2024, demonstrating its
suitability for real-time routing applications with state-dependent travel
costs.

### [12] [Beyond Ordinal Preferences: Why Alignment Needs Cardinal Human Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08486)
*Parker Whitfill,Stewy Slocum*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Ordinal comparisons are insufficient to determine the optimal model, necessitating cardinal feedback; introducing a dataset of 25,000 cardinal judgments improved model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing alignment techniques using ordinal or binary feedback fail to adequately resolve trade-offs between model responses.

Method: The authors collected 25,000 cardinal judgments using willingness-to-pay elicitation and incorporated them into preference fine-tuning methods.

Result: Models with cardinal feedback prioritized impactful improvements and outperformed those relying on ordinal feedback in benchmarks like Arena-Hard.

Conclusion: Cardinal feedback overcomes limitations of ordinal comparisons, making it instrumental for optimizing model performance and aligning with user preferences.

Abstract: Alignment techniques for LLMs rely on optimizing preference-based objectives
-- where these preferences are typically elicited as ordinal, binary choices
between responses. Recent work has focused on improving label quality or
mitigating particular biases, but we identify a more fundamental limitation:
these methods collect the wrong kind of data. We prove an impossibility result:
no algorithm relying solely on ordinal comparisons can systematically recover
the most preferred model. Intuitively, ordinal data lacks the information
needed to resolve tradeoffs -- e.g., fixing a factual error on one prompt
versus improving style on another. We show that selecting the optimal model
requires recovering preferences over \emph{models} (rather than just
responses), which can only be identified given cardinal feedback about response
quality. To address this, we collect and publicly release a dataset of 25,000
cardinal judgments using willingness-to-pay elicitations, a well-established
tool from experimental economics. Empirically, we find that incorporating
cardinal feedback into preference fine-tuning allows models to prioritize
high-impact improvements and outperform ordinal-only methods on downstream
benchmarks, such as Arena-Hard.

*Szymon Jakubicz,Karol Kuźniak,Jan Wawszczak,Paweł Gora*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces POMO+, an enhanced reinforcement learning-based method for combinatorial problems, achieving faster convergence and better results compared to POMO.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve the performance of reinforcement learning-based models, like POMO, for solving combinatorial tasks including Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP).

Method: The method introduces POMO+, an RL model that leverages the initial nodes in the problem to find solutions more efficiently.

Result: Experiments demonstrated that POMO+ achieved faster convergence and better results on the CVRPLIB dataset, particularly for problems with up to 100 customers.

Conclusion: POMO+ outperforms POMO in terms of efficiency and accuracy, offering a more effective RL approach for combinatorial problems.

Abstract: In recent years, reinforcement learning (RL) methods have emerged as a
promising approach for solving combinatorial problems. Among RL-based models,
POMO has demonstrated strong performance on a variety of tasks, including
variants of the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP). However, there is room for
improvement for these tasks. In this work, we improved POMO, creating a method
(\textbf{POMO+}) that leverages the initial nodes to find a solution in a more
informed way. We ran experiments on our new model and observed that our
solution converges faster and achieves better results. We validated our models
on the CVRPLIB dataset and noticed improvements in problem instances with up to
100 customers. We hope that our research in this project can lead to further
advancements in the field.

### [14] [Large Language Models as Oracles for Ontology Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08500)
*Sviatoslav Lushnei,Dmytro Shumskyi,Severyn Shykula,Ernesto Jimenez-Ruiz,Artur d'Avila Garcez*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper investigates using Large Language Models (LLMs) to validate ontology alignment correspondences, focusing on uncertain mappings in large ontologies, and compares LLM performance with human-like oracles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current ontology alignment systems struggle with highly accurate correspondences, and involving humans is expensive. The authors aim to explore whether LLMs can substitute domain experts for validating uncertain correspondence subsets.

Method: The researchers employed state-of-the-art LLMs to validate ontology alignment correspondences by testing different ontology-driven template prompts. They evaluated the LLMs' performance on matching tasks from the Ontology Alignment Evaluation Initiative (OAEI) and compared this performance to oracles with varying error rates.

Result: The paper provides an extensive evaluation of LLM capabilities, analyzing their precision in validating correspondences for different tasks and templates, and comparing their results to simulated experts.

Conclusion: LLMs show promise in substituting domain experts in ontology alignment, particularly in scenarios with uncertain mappings, but their performance varies based on the task and templates used.

Abstract: Ontology alignment plays a crucial role in integrating diverse data sources
across domains. There is a large plethora of systems that tackle the ontology
alignment problem, yet challenges persist in producing highly quality
correspondences among a set of input ontologies. Human-in-the-loop during the
alignment process is essential in applications requiring very accurate
mappings. User involvement is, however, expensive when dealing with large
ontologies. In this paper, we explore the feasibility of using Large Language
Models (LLM) as an alternative to the domain expert. The use of the LLM focuses
only on the validation of the subset of correspondences where an ontology
alignment system is very uncertain. We have conducted an extensive evaluation
over several matching tasks of the Ontology Alignment Evaluation Initiative
(OAEI), analysing the performance of several state-of-the-art LLMs using
different ontology-driven prompt templates. The LLM results are also compared
against simulated Oracles with variable error rates.

*Yuchen Li,Cong Lin,Muhammad Umair Nasir,Philip Bontrager,Jialin Liu,Julian Togelius*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GVGAI-LLM is a video game benchmark to test reasoning and problem-solving of language models using diverse arcade-style games. Current models struggle with spatial reasoning and planning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate LLMs in tasks beyond traditional benchmarks, focusing on reasoning, problem-solving, and agentic behavior.

Method: Leverages the General Video Game AI framework with compact ASCII-based game scenes and specific metrics (e.g., meaningful step ratio) to assess LLM performance.

Result: Zero-shot evaluations show persistent LLM limitations in spatial reasoning and planning. Structured prompting improves performance but doesn't solve the benchmark.

Conclusion: The benchmark highlights gaps in LLM capabilities, serving as a tool for further research in advancing language model reasoning skills.

Abstract: We introduce GVGAI-LLM, a video game benchmark for evaluating the reasoning
and problem-solving capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Built on the
General Video Game AI framework, it features a diverse collection of
arcade-style games designed to test a model's ability to handle tasks that
differ from most existing LLM benchmarks. The benchmark leverages a game
description language that enables rapid creation of new games and levels,
helping to prevent overfitting over time. Each game scene is represented by a
compact set of ASCII characters, allowing for efficient processing by language
models. GVGAI-LLM defines interpretable metrics, including the meaningful step
ratio, step efficiency, and overall score, to assess model behavior. Through
zero-shot evaluations across a broad set of games and levels with diverse
challenges and skill depth, we reveal persistent limitations of LLMs in spatial
reasoning and basic planning. Current models consistently exhibit spatial and
logical errors, motivating structured prompting and spatial grounding
techniques. While these interventions lead to partial improvements, the
benchmark remains very far from solved. GVGAI-LLM provides a reproducible
testbed for advancing research on language model capabilities, with a
particular emphasis on agentic behavior and contextual reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the scarcity of access to real-world medical data in healthcare research due to privacy regulations, by generating synthetic data that is realistic and privacy-conscious.

Method: SynLLM leverages 20 open-source LLMs with structured prompts that encode schema, metadata, and domain knowledge for generating synthetic medical data without fine-tuning, coupled with a robust, multi-dimensional evaluation framework assessing statistical fidelity, clinical consistency, and privacy preservation.

Result: The evaluation on three public medical datasets (Diabetes, Cirrhosis, Stroke) reveals that structured prompts, specifically rule-based ones, improve the balance between data quality and privacy risks.

Conclusion: SynLLM demonstrates the ability of well-structured prompts and robust evaluations to enable LLMs in generating clinically valid and privacy-safe synthetic medical data for more effective healthcare research data sharing.

Abstract: Access to real-world medical data is often restricted due to privacy
regulations, posing a significant barrier to the advancement of healthcare
research. Synthetic data offers a promising alternative; however, generating
realistic, clinically valid, and privacy-conscious records remains a major
challenge. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) offer new
opportunities for structured data generation; however, existing approaches
frequently lack systematic prompting strategies and comprehensive,
multi-dimensional evaluation frameworks.
  In this paper, we present SynLLM, a modular framework for generating
high-quality synthetic medical tabular data using 20 state-of-the-art
open-source LLMs, including LLaMA, Mistral, and GPT variants, guided by
structured prompts. We propose four distinct prompt types, ranging from
example-driven to rule-based constraints, that encode schema, metadata, and
domain knowledge to control generation without model fine-tuning. Our framework
features a comprehensive evaluation pipeline that rigorously assesses generated
data across statistical fidelity, clinical consistency, and privacy
preservation.
  We evaluate SynLLM across three public medical datasets, including Diabetes,
Cirrhosis, and Stroke, using 20 open-source LLMs. Our results show that prompt
engineering significantly impacts data quality and privacy risk, with
rule-based prompts achieving the best privacy-quality balance. SynLLM
establishes that, when guided by well-designed prompts and evaluated with
robust, multi-metric criteria, LLMs can generate synthetic medical data that is
both clinically plausible and privacy-aware, paving the way for safer and more
effective data sharing in healthcare research.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces UGM2N, an unsupervised network for mesh movement that achieves efficient adaptation across diverse PDEs and mesh geometries without relying on pre-adapted meshes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of traditional mesh movement techniques and address generalization issues in existing supervised learning approaches for solving PDEs.

Method: Introduce UGM2N, employing localized geometric feature learning and a physics-constrained M-Uniform loss to ensure mesh equidistribution.

Result: Experimental results show UGM2N performs robustly across various PDEs and geometries, improves efficiency, reduces errors, and avoids mesh tangling.

Conclusion: UGM2N provides a generalizable, efficient solution for mesh movement, outperforming traditional and supervised methods in simulation accuracy and computational scalability.

Abstract: Partial differential equations (PDEs) form the mathematical foundation for
modeling physical systems in science and engineering, where numerical solutions
demand rigorous accuracy-efficiency tradeoffs. Mesh movement techniques address
this challenge by dynamically relocating mesh nodes to rapidly-varying regions,
enhancing both simulation accuracy and computational efficiency. However,
traditional approaches suffer from high computational complexity and geometric
inflexibility, limiting their applicability, and existing supervised
learning-based approaches face challenges in zero-shot generalization across
diverse PDEs and mesh topologies.In this paper, we present an Unsupervised and
Generalizable Mesh Movement Network (UGM2N). We first introduce unsupervised
mesh adaptation through localized geometric feature learning, eliminating the
dependency on pre-adapted meshes. We then develop a physics-constrained loss
function, M-Uniform loss, that enforces mesh equidistribution at the nodal
level.Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed network exhibits
equation-agnostic generalization and geometric independence in efficient mesh
adaptation. It demonstrates consistent superiority over existing methods,
including robust performance across diverse PDEs and mesh geometries,
scalability to multi-scale resolutions and guaranteed error reduction without
mesh tangling.

TL;DR: This paper proposes AgriGPT, a specialized AI ecosystem for agriculture with a new dataset, improved reasoning framework, and evaluation benchmark, significantly outperforming general-purpose language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the limitations of applying Large Language Models (LLMs) in agriculture due to the lack of domain-specific models, datasets, and evaluation frameworks.

Method: The approach includes the development of AgriGPT with a scalable data engine to create a high-quality dataset (Agri-342K), training on this dataset, and employing a Tri-RAG framework for enhanced reasoning. A benchmark suite (AgriBench-13K) is also introduced for evaluation.

Result: Experiments show that AgriGPT significantly outperforms general-purpose LLMs in both domain adaptation and reasoning within agricultural contexts.

Conclusion: AgriGPT provides a modular, scalable ecosystem for developing domain-specific LLMs, addressing critical gaps in agricultural AI, while releasing resources to assist agricultural communities and promote open research.

Abstract: Despite the rapid progress of Large Language Models (LLMs), their application
in agriculture remains limited due to the lack of domain-specific models,
curated datasets, and robust evaluation frameworks. To address these
challenges, we propose AgriGPT, a domain-specialized LLM ecosystem for
agricultural usage. At its core, we design a multi-agent scalable data engine
that systematically compiles credible data sources into Agri-342K, a
high-quality, standardized question-answer (QA) dataset. Trained on this
dataset, AgriGPT supports a broad range of agricultural stakeholders, from
practitioners to policy-makers. To enhance factual grounding, we employ
Tri-RAG, a three-channel Retrieval-Augmented Generation framework combining
dense retrieval, sparse retrieval, and multi-hop knowledge graph reasoning,
thereby improving the LLM's reasoning reliability. For comprehensive
evaluation, we introduce AgriBench-13K, a benchmark suite comprising 13 tasks
with varying types and complexities. Experiments demonstrate that AgriGPT
significantly outperforms general-purpose LLMs on both domain adaptation and
reasoning. Beyond the model itself, AgriGPT represents a modular and extensible
LLM ecosystem for agriculture, comprising structured data construction,
retrieval-enhanced generation, and domain-specific evaluation. This work
provides a generalizable framework for developing scientific and
industry-specialized LLMs. All models, datasets, and code will be released to
empower agricultural communities, especially in underserved regions, and to
promote open, impactful research.

*HuanYu Yang,Fengming Zhu,YangFan Wu,Jianmin Ji*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces the concept of diminution to alleviate the grounding bottleneck in Answer Set Programming (ASP) and reports significant performance improvements in grounding and file size reduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ASP suffers from the grounding bottleneck caused by large Herbrand universes, prompting the need for a generalizable solution to improve grounding and solving performance.

Method: The authors propose a formal definition of diminution—a selected subset of the Herbrand universe—and employ an encoding to evaluate candidate subsets using off-the-shelf ASP solvers, integrating with existing grounders via domain predicates.

Result: Experiments on five benchmarks show up to 70% reduction in grounding time and 85% reduction in grounding file size due to the introduction of diminution.

Conclusion: Diminution is an effective and general-purpose strategy to mitigate the grounding bottleneck in ASP, boosting performance and maintaining compatibility with existing tools.

Abstract: Answer Set Programming (ASP) is often hindered by the grounding bottleneck:
large Herbrand universes generate ground programs so large that solving becomes
difficult. Many methods employ ad-hoc heuristics to improve grounding
performance, motivating the need for a more formal and generalizable strategy.
We introduce the notion of diminution, defined as a selected subset of the
Herbrand universe used to generate a reduced ground program before solving. We
give a formal definition of diminution, analyze its key properties, and study
the complexity of identifying it. We use a specific encoding that enables
off-the-shelf ASP solver to evaluate candidate subsets. Our approach integrates
seamlessly with existing grounders via domain predicates. In extensive
experiments on five benchmarks, applying diminutions selected by our strategy
yields significant performance improvements, reducing grounding time by up to
70% on average and decreasing the size of grounding files by up to 85%. These
results demonstrate that leveraging diminutions constitutes a robust and
general-purpose approach for alleviating the grounding bottleneck in ASP.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extracting insights from complex EHR datasets is challenging due to sparsity, heterogeneity, and patient-specific variations, especially under budget constraints.

Method: The framework acquires features online for individual patients, accounting for cost variability and managing multimodal data to support efficient decision-making.

Result: It ensures robust and scalable performance in various healthcare settings, optimizing diagnostic confidence and resource usage.

Conclusion: The proposed approach supports physicians in patient screening by prioritizing informative features within budget constraints, enhancing resource allocation and clinical outcomes.

Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHR) have revolutionized healthcare by digitizing
patient data, improving accessibility, and streamlining clinical workflows.
However, extracting meaningful insights from these complex and multimodal
datasets remains a significant challenge for researchers. Traditional feature
selection methods often struggle with the inherent sparsity and heterogeneity
of EHR data, especially when accounting for patient-specific variations and
feature costs in clinical applications. To address these challenges, we propose
a novel personalized, online and cost-aware feature selection framework
tailored specifically for EHR datasets. The features are aquired in an online
fashion for individual patients, incorporating budgetary constraints and
feature variability costs. The framework is designed to effectively manage
sparse and multimodal data, ensuring robust and scalable performance in diverse
healthcare contexts. A primary application of our proposed method is to support
physicians' decision making in patient screening scenarios. By guiding
physicians toward incremental acquisition of the most informative features
within budget constraints, our approach aims to increase diagnostic confidence
while optimizing resource utilization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve compliance evaluation in simulation training for safety-critical domains by leveraging accessible AI technologies.

Method: Context-rich prompts are fed into open-source LLMs like LLama 2, LLama 3, and Mistral, to evaluate checklists based on transcribed verbal exchanges.

Result: Prompting enables effective context-aware reasoning with high classification accuracy and agreement scores against expert-annotated data.

Conclusion: Open-source LLMs running on consumer-grade GPUs demonstrate practical utility in debriefing and automated assessment for training environments.

Abstract: Accurate evaluation of procedural communication compliance is essential in
simulation-based training, particularly in safety-critical domains where
adherence to compliance checklists reflects operational competence. This paper
explores a lightweight, deployable approach using prompt-based inference with
open-source large language models (LLMs) that can run efficiently on
consumer-grade GPUs. We present Prompt-and-Check, a method that uses
context-rich prompts to evaluate whether each checklist item in a protocol has
been fulfilled, solely based on transcribed verbal exchanges. We perform a case
study in the maritime domain with participants performing an identical
simulation task, and experiment with models such as LLama 2 7B, LLaMA 3 8B and
Mistral 7B, running locally on an RTX 4070 GPU. For each checklist item, a
prompt incorporating relevant transcript excerpts is fed into the model, which
outputs a compliance judgment. We assess model outputs against expert-annotated
ground truth using classification accuracy and agreement scores. Our findings
demonstrate that prompting enables effective context-aware reasoning without
task-specific training. This study highlights the practical utility of LLMs in
augmenting debriefing, performance feedback, and automated assessment in
training environments.

Motivation: Existing metaheuristic approaches face challenges in scaling and resolving the optimization complexities of large-scale CVRP instances effectively.

Method: The researchers developed an iterative hybrid solver incorporating a Node-Destroyer Model based on GNNs to identify customer nodes and guide Large Neighborhood Search (LNS) operators in metaheuristic frameworks.

Result: The hybrid mechanism improved baseline metaheuristic algorithms, delivering superior solutions for standard CVRP benchmarks and scaling up to large instances with 30,000 nodes.

Conclusion: The proposed hybrid approach increases solution quality while maintaining scalability across varying sizes of CVRP instances without retraining.

Abstract: In this research, we propose an iterative learning hybrid optimization solver
developed to strengthen the performance of metaheuristic algorithms in solving
the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP). The iterative hybrid mechanism
integrates the proposed Node-Destroyer Model, a machine learning hybrid model
that utilized Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) such identifies and selects customer
nodes to guide the Large Neighborhood Search (LNS) operator within the
metaheuristic optimization frameworks. This model leverages the structural
properties of the problem and solution that can be represented as a graph, to
guide strategic selections concerning node removal. The proposed approach
reduces operational complexity and scales down the search space involved in the
optimization process. The hybrid approach is applied specifically to the CVRP
and does not require retraining across problem instances of different sizes.
The proposed hybrid mechanism is able to improve the performance of baseline
metaheuristic algorithms. Our approach not only enhances the solution quality
for standard CVRP benchmarks but also proves scalability on very large-scale
instances with up to 30,000 customer nodes. Experimental evaluations on
benchmark datasets show that the proposed hybrid mechanism is capable of
improving different baseline algorithms, achieving better quality of solutions
under similar settings.

*Chen Li,Han Zhang,Zhantao Yang,Fangyi Chen,Zihan Wang,Anudeepsekhar Bolimera,Marios Savvides*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: STELAR-Vision is introduced to address limitations in Vision-language models (VLMs) by enhancing topological reasoning and improving both accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs struggle with complex multimodal tasks and produce overly verbose outputs due to reliance on chain-of-thought reasoning.

Method: The study incorporates TopoAug synthetic data, supervised fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning to train models with topological awareness. Frugal Learning is implemented to reduce output verbosity.

Result: STELAR-Vision demonstrated improved accuracy on multiple benchmarks, surpassing baseline and competing models by significant margins.

Conclusion: The framework enhances reasoning capabilities, generalization, and efficiency in VLMs, addressing core limitations. Datasets are released, and code is forthcoming.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have made significant strides in reasoning, yet
they often struggle with complex multimodal tasks and tend to generate overly
verbose outputs. A key limitation is their reliance on chain-of-thought (CoT)
reasoning, despite many tasks benefiting from alternative topologies like trees
or graphs. To address this, we introduce STELAR-Vision, a training framework
for topology-aware reasoning. At its core is TopoAug, a synthetic data pipeline
that enriches training with diverse topological structures. Using supervised
fine-tuning and reinforcement learning, we post-train Qwen2VL models with both
accuracy and efficiency in mind. Additionally, we propose Frugal Learning,
which reduces output length with minimal accuracy loss. On MATH-V and VLM-S2H,
STELAR-Vision improves accuracy by 9.7% over its base model and surpasses the
larger Qwen2VL-72B-Instruct by 7.3%. On five out-of-distribution benchmarks, it
outperforms Phi-4-Multimodal-Instruct by up to 28.4% and
LLaMA-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct by up to 13.2%, demonstrating strong
generalization. Compared to Chain-Only training, our approach achieves 4.3%
higher overall accuracy on in-distribution datasets and consistently
outperforms across all OOD benchmarks. We have released datasets, and code will
be available.

*Yuwei Yan,Jinghua Piao,Xiaochong Lan,Chenyang Shao,Pan Hui,Yong Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces a unified framework for designing social agents using large language models (LLMs), grounded in Social Cognition Theory, resulting in more realistic human-like behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the limitations of current scenario-tailored social agents by creating a general framework to enable realistic and generalized social behaviors across contexts.

Method: The authors propose a theory-informed framework based on Social Cognition Theory with three modules: motivation, action planning, and learning. These modules help agents reason, plan, and adapt their behaviors.

Result: Experiments show that the proposed agents achieve up to 75% lower deviation from real-world behavior data compared to traditional models, and ablation studies validate the crucial roles of the framework's modules.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully enhances the realism and contextual adaptability of LLM-based social agents, achieving significant improvements in simulating human behaviors.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models have demonstrated strong reasoning
and role-playing capabilities, opening new opportunities for agent-based social
simulations. However, most existing agents' implementations are
scenario-tailored, without a unified framework to guide the design. This lack
of a general social agent limits their ability to generalize across different
social contexts and to produce consistent, realistic behaviors. To address this
challenge, we propose a theory-informed framework that provides a systematic
design process for LLM-based social agents. Our framework is grounded in
principles from Social Cognition Theory and introduces three key modules:
motivation, action planning, and learning. These modules jointly enable agents
to reason about their goals, plan coherent actions, and adapt their behavior
over time, leading to more flexible and contextually appropriate responses.
Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our theory-driven agents reproduce
realistic human behavior patterns under complex conditions, achieving up to 75%
lower deviation from real-world behavioral data across multiple fidelity
metrics compared to classical generative baselines. Ablation studies further
show that removing motivation, planning, or learning modules increases errors
by 1.5 to 3.2 times, confirming their distinct and essential contributions to
generating realistic and coherent social behaviors.

*Dongwook Choi,Taeyoon Kwon,Dongil Yang,Hyojun Kim,Jinyoung Yeo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes a framework for memory-augmented AR agents that integrate with multimodal models to provide personalized and context-aware assistance based on users' long-term experiences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AR systems, despite integrating foundation models, struggle with multi-step, context-rich tasks due to their inability to leverage and reason over historical user interactions.

Method: The paper introduces a framework with four interconnected modules—Perception, Memory, Spatiotemporal Reasoning, and Actuator—to enable AR systems to adapt based on spatiotemporal user data and preferences.

Result: The study outlines an implementation roadmap with strategies for evaluation and practical application, as well as specific use cases, to demonstrate the feasibility of their proposed framework.

Conclusion: The work aims to inspire further research into adaptive AR systems that incorporate historical user interactions to enhance personalized task assistance.

Abstract: Augmented Reality (AR) systems are increasingly integrating foundation
models, such as Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), to provide more
context-aware and adaptive user experiences. This integration has led to the
development of AR agents to support intelligent, goal-directed interactions in
real-world environments. While current AR agents effectively support immediate
tasks, they struggle with complex multi-step scenarios that require
understanding and leveraging user's long-term experiences and preferences. This
limitation stems from their inability to capture, retain, and reason over
historical user interactions in spatiotemporal contexts. To address these
challenges, we propose a conceptual framework for memory-augmented AR agents
that can provide personalized task assistance by learning from and adapting to
user-specific experiences over time. Our framework consists of four
interconnected modules: (1) Perception Module for multimodal sensor processing,
(2) Memory Module for persistent spatiotemporal experience storage, (3)
Spatiotemporal Reasoning Module for synthesizing past and present contexts, and
(4) Actuator Module for effective AR communication. We further present an
implementation roadmap, a future evaluation strategy, a potential target
application and use cases to demonstrate the practical applicability of our
framework across diverse domains. We aim for this work to motivate future
research toward developing more intelligent AR systems that can effectively
bridge user's interaction history with adaptive, context-aware task assistance.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper surveys knowledge editing for large language models, emphasizing a function-based taxonomy to classify different types of knowledge and approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Knowledge in large language models can become outdated or inaccurate, requiring efficient updating methods to avoid costly retraining.

Method: The paper introduces a function-based taxonomy to evaluate knowledge editing mechanisms across various knowledge types, in addition to reviewing evaluation tasks and datasets.

Result: It provides an organized review of current methods, their effectiveness based on knowledge type, and identifies existing challenges in knowledge editing for LLMs.

Conclusion: The study outlines the strengths and limitations of current methods and offers future directions for enhancing knowledge editing in LLMs beyond retraining.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) acquire vast knowledge from large text corpora,
but this information can become outdated or inaccurate. Since retraining is
computationally expensive, knowledge editing offers an efficient alternative --
modifying internal knowledge without full retraining. These methods aim to
update facts precisely while preserving the model's overall capabilities. While
existing surveys focus on the mechanism of editing (e.g., parameter changes vs.
external memory), they often overlook the function of the knowledge being
edited. This survey introduces a novel, complementary function-based taxonomy
to provide a more holistic view. We examine how different mechanisms apply to
various knowledge types -- factual, temporal, conceptual, commonsense, and
social -- highlighting how editing effectiveness depends on the nature of the
target knowledge. By organizing our review along these two axes, we map the
current landscape, outline the strengths and limitations of existing methods,
define the problem formally, survey evaluation tasks and datasets, and conclude
with open challenges and future directions.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces GRainsaCK, a reusable software for streamlining and standardizing link prediction explanation benchmarking in knowledge graphs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Knowledge Graphs often have incomplete information, requiring link prediction methods. However, the explanations for these predictions lack standard evaluation protocols, making it challenging to assess or compare them.

Method: The authors propose GRainsaCK, a modular software tool that standardizes end-to-end benchmarking of link prediction explanations. The framework allows for model training, standardized evaluation, and ease of customization.

Result: GRainsaCK streamlines explanation benchmarking and is user-friendly due to its modularity. It includes comprehensive documentation and a tutorial, promoting extensibility and ease of use.

Conclusion: GRainsaCK addresses the missing standard evaluation protocol in link prediction explanations, providing an effective and extensible platform to benchmark such methods.

Abstract: Since Knowledge Graphs are often incomplete, link prediction methods are
adopted for predicting missing facts. Scalable embedding based solutions are
mostly adopted for this purpose, however, they lack comprehensibility, which
may be crucial in several domains. Explanation methods tackle this issue by
identifying supporting knowledge explaining the predicted facts. Regretfully,
evaluating/comparing quantitatively the resulting explanations is challenging
as there is no standard evaluation protocol and overall benchmarking resource.
We fill this important gap by proposing GRainsaCK, a reusable software resource
that fully streamlines all the tasks involved in benchmarking explanations,
i.e., from model training to evaluation of explanations along the same
evaluation protocol. Moreover, GRainsaCK furthers modularity/extensibility by
implementing the main components as functions that can be easily replaced.
Finally, fostering its reuse, we provide extensive documentation including a
tutorial.

E-Agent, an agent framework featuring two key innovations: a mRAG planner
trained to dynamically orchestrate multimodal tools based on contextual
reasoning, and a task executor employing tool-aware execution sequencing to
implement optimized mRAG workflows. E-Agent adopts a one-time mRAG planning
strategy that enables efficient information retrieval while minimizing
redundant tool invocations. To rigorously assess the planning capabilities of
mRAG systems, we introduce the Real-World mRAG Planning (RemPlan) benchmark.
This novel benchmark contains both retrieval-dependent and
retrieval-independent question types, systematically annotated with essential
retrieval tools required for each instance. The benchmark's explicit mRAG
planning annotations and diverse question design enhance its practical
relevance by simulating real-world scenarios requiring dynamic mRAG decisions.
Experiments across RemPlan and three established benchmarks demonstrate
E-Agent's superiority: 13% accuracy gain over state-of-the-art mRAG methods
while reducing redundant searches by 37%.

### [30] [Silicon Minds versus Human Hearts: The Wisdom of Crowds Beats the Wisdom of AI in Emotion Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08830)
*Mustafa Akben,Vinayaka Gude,Haya Ajjan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper evaluates the emotion recognition ability of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) using Reading the Mind in the Eyes Tests and finds that while MLLMs outperform humans individually, human collective intelligence and human-AI collaboration exceed MLLM performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study seeks to address whether AI, particularly multimodal large language models, can recognize and respond to human emotions as effectively as humans, a capability crucial for improving human-AI interactions.

Method: The research evaluates MLLMs' emotion recognition capabilities using the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test (RMET) and its multiracial variant (MRMET), comparing results against human performance, both individually and collectively.

Result: MLLMs surpass human individuals in emotion recognition but are outperformed by human collective intelligence. Collaborative models combining human and MLLM predictions achieve the highest accuracy.

Conclusion: MLLMs show strong individual performance in emotion recognition, but combining AI predictions with human intelligence offers the greatest potential for creating emotionally intelligent AI systems.

Abstract: The ability to discern subtle emotional cues is fundamental to human social
intelligence. As artificial intelligence (AI) becomes increasingly common, AI's
ability to recognize and respond to human emotions is crucial for effective
human-AI interactions. In particular, whether such systems can match or surpass
human experts remains to be seen. However, the emotional intelligence of AI,
particularly multimodal large language models (MLLMs), remains largely
unexplored. This study evaluates the emotion recognition abilities of MLLMs
using the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test (RMET) and its multiracial
counterpart (MRMET), and compares their performance against human participants.
Results show that, on average, MLLMs outperform humans in accurately
identifying emotions across both tests. This trend persists even when comparing
performance across low, medium, and expert-level performing groups. Yet when we
aggregate independent human decisions to simulate collective intelligence,
human groups significantly surpass the performance of aggregated MLLM
predictions, highlighting the wisdom of the crowd. Moreover, a collaborative
approach (augmented intelligence) that combines human and MLLM predictions
achieves greater accuracy than either humans or MLLMs alone. These results
suggest that while MLLMs exhibit strong emotion recognition at the individual
level, the collective intelligence of humans and the synergistic potential of
human-AI collaboration offer the most promising path toward effective emotional
AI. We discuss the implications of these findings for the development of
emotionally intelligent AI systems and future research directions.

### [31] [Reducing Cognitive Load in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Mathematical Problem Solving: Decoupling Reasoning and Code Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08882)
*Dayu Wang,Jiaye Yang,Weikang Li,Jiahui Liang,Yang Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a dual-agent framework to handle mathematical reasoning tasks, separating reasoning and coding for improved accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is cognitive load interference in single-agent systems that handle reasoning and coding simultaneously, leading to reduced performance.

Method: The authors use a dual-agent system where the Reasoning Agent focuses on problem decomposition and the Code Agent manages code generation and execution. Training is enhanced with distinct reward mechanisms.

Result: Controlled experiments show that the dual-agent design performs significantly better in creating correct reasoning paths compared to single-agent models.

Conclusion: Separating reasoning and coding tasks into distinct agents mitigates cognitive interference and enhances the system’s efficacy in mathematical reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Current tool-integrated mathematical reasoning systems often adopt a
single-agent paradigm, where one large language model handles problem
reasoning, code generation, and code execution in an integrated workflow. While
this design eases coordination, we hypothesize that it imposes cognitive load
interference, as the agent must interleave long-horizon reasoning with precise
program synthesis. We validate this hypothesis through a controlled comparison
between a reasoning-only agent and a reasoning-plus-code agent, finding that
the latter produces significantly fewer correct reasoning paths despite having
tool-calling capabilities. To address this, we propose a dual-agent hybrid
framework: a Reasoning Agent performs stepwise problem decomposition, and a
Code Agent handles code generation and execution. Training combines imitation
learning and reinforcement learning: the Code Agent receives strong rewards for
matching intermediate ground-truth programs and weaker rewards for valid
execution, while the Reasoning Agent is optimized chiefly via final-answer
accuracy using advantage estimation to credit intermediate steps. This
decoupled role design reduces cognitive interference and promotes stable
reasoning-coding coordination.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the high computational costs and risks of conducting Reinforcement Learning experiments on hyperscale language models, and to explore scalable approaches for reasoning tasks.

Method: The authors create Compass-Thinker-7B using a specialized RL pipeline trained on a curated dataset of 30k verifiable mathematics problems, with staged difficulty distributions to optimize training efficiency.

Result: Extensive evaluations demonstrate the model's exceptional reasoning abilities, outperforming equivalent-sized RL models, with a notable 40% accuracy on the challenging AIME2024 evaluation.

Conclusion: Compass-Thinker-7B showcases the feasibility of leveraging RL for reasoning without requiring hyperscale computational resources, paving the way for further research in efficient RL for large-scale models.

Abstract: Recent R1-Zero-like research further demonstrates that reasoning extension
has given large language models (LLMs) unprecedented reasoning capabilities,
and Reinforcement Learning is the core technology to elicit its complex
reasoning. However, conducting RL experiments directly on hyperscale models
involves high computational costs and resource demands, posing significant
risks. We propose the Compass-Thinker-7B model, which aims to explore the
potential of Reinforcement Learning with less computational resources and
costs, and provides insights for further research into RL recipes for larger
models. Compass-Thinker-7B is trained from an open source model through a
specially designed Reinforcement Learning Pipeline. we curate a dataset of 30k
verifiable mathematics problems for the Reinforcement Learning Pipeline. By
configuring data and training settings with different difficulty distributions
for different stages, the potential of the model is gradually released and the
training efficiency is improved. Extensive evaluations show that
Compass-Thinker-7B possesses exceptional reasoning potential, and achieves
superior performance on mathematics compared to the same-sized RL
model.Especially in the challenging AIME2024 evaluation, Compass-Thinker-7B
achieves 40% accuracy.

*Wei Cai,Jian Zhao,Yuchu Jiang,Tianle Zhang,Xuelong Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper highlights a safety weakness in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), introducing a dataset and demonstrating a mitigation approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address implicit reasoning vulnerabilities in LVLMs that lead to unsafe outputs from benign inputs.

Method: The paper introduces the dataset Safe Semantics, Unsafe Interpretations, and employs In-Context Learning to counter these multimodal vulnerabilities.

Result: In-Context Learning with the SSUI dataset significantly reduces implicit multimodal safety risks.

Conclusion: Cross-modal implicit reasoning in LVLMs needs immediate improvement to manage evolving multimodal safety challenges.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models face growing safety challenges with multimodal
inputs. This paper introduces the concept of Implicit Reasoning Safety, a
vulnerability in LVLMs. Benign combined inputs trigger unsafe LVLM outputs due
to flawed or hidden reasoning. To showcase this, we developed Safe Semantics,
Unsafe Interpretations, the first dataset for this critical issue. Our
demonstrations show that even simple In-Context Learning with SSUI
significantly mitigates these implicit multimodal threats, underscoring the
urgent need to improve cross-modal implicit reasoning.

*Rui Wang,Qihan Lin,Jiayu Liu,Qing Zong,Tianshi Zheng,Weiqi Wang,Yangqiu Song*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper investigates the applicability of Prospect Theory (PT) in modeling decision-making behavior in Large Language Models (LLMs) under uncertainty, factoring in epistemic markers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understand whether LLMs exhibit decision-making behaviors akin to human patterns when faced with uncertainty, especially against linguistic expressions such as epistemic markers.

Method: A three-stage experimental framework is designed using economic questionnaires to evaluate LLMs under PT. Uncertainty is introduced using empirical probability values tied to epistemic markers.

Result: Modeling LLMs’ decision-making with PT proves inconsistent, especially when diverse linguistic markers expressing uncertainty are included.

Conclusion: LLMs do not reliably align with Prospect Theory for decision-making, particularly when uncertainty is linguistically nuanced and variable.

Abstract: Prospect Theory (PT) models human decision-making under uncertainty, while
epistemic markers (e.g., maybe) serve to express uncertainty in language.
However, it remains largely unexplored whether Prospect Theory applies to
contemporary Large Language Models and whether epistemic markers, which express
human uncertainty, affect their decision-making behaviour. To address these
research gaps, we design a three-stage experiment based on economic
questionnaires. We propose a more general and precise evaluation framework to
model LLMs' decision-making behaviour under PT, introducing uncertainty through
the empirical probability values associated with commonly used epistemic
markers in comparable contexts. We then incorporate epistemic markers into the
evaluation framework based on their corresponding probability values to examine
their influence on LLM decision-making behaviours. Our findings suggest that
modelling LLMs' decision-making with PT is not consistently reliable,
particularly when uncertainty is expressed in diverse linguistic forms. Our
code is released in https://github.com/HKUST-KnowComp/MarPT.

TL;DR: This paper proposes Intrinsic Memory Agents that tackle memory limitations in multi-agent systems using LLMs, achieving significant gains in performance and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing memory-related issues such as context window limitations, memory consistency, role adherence, and procedural integrity in multi-agent systems built on LLMs.

Method: A framework employing agent-specific, structured, and intrinsic evolving memories that focus on role-aligned templates and task-relevant information.

Result: An improvement of 38.6% in token efficiency over state-of-the-art methods on the PDDL dataset, and better performance on qualitative and quantitative metrics in a complex data pipeline design task.

Conclusion: Structured intrinsic memory approaches enhance the memory capabilities, efficiency, and output quality of multi-agent systems in structured planning tasks.

Abstract: Multi-agent systems built on Large Language Models (LLMs) show exceptional
promise for complex collaborative problem-solving, yet they face fundamental
challenges stemming from context window limitations that impair memory
consistency, role adherence, and procedural integrity. This paper introduces
Intrinsic Memory Agents, a novel framework that addresses these limitations
through structured agent-specific memories that evolve intrinsically with agent
outputs. Specifically, our method maintains role-aligned memory templates that
preserve specialized perspectives while focusing on task-relevant information.
We benchmark our approach on the PDDL dataset, comparing its performance to
existing state-of-the-art multi-agentic memory approaches and showing an
improvement of 38.6\% with the highest token efficiency. An additional
evaluation is performed on a complex data pipeline design task, we demonstrate
that our approach produces higher quality designs when comparing 5 metrics:
scalability, reliability, usability, cost-effectiveness and documentation with
additional qualitative evidence of the improvements. Our findings suggest that
addressing memory limitations through structured, intrinsic approaches can
improve the capabilities of multi-agent LLM systems on structured planning
tasks.

### [36] [Activation Steering for Bias Mitigation: An Interpretable Approach to Safer LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09019)
*Shivam Dubey*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces an end-to-end bias mitigation system for large language models using mechanistic interpretability, enabling real-time steering of models' outputs to more neutral alternatives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this paper is to address the critical safety concern of large language models amplifying harmful biases, as traditional methods like data filtering treat models as opaque systems.

Method: The method involves training linear probes to detect latent bias representations in a model's activations and using steering vectors to counteract biased generative outputs during inference.

Result: Experiments with GPT-2 large show that probes can detect biases with high accuracy, and steering vectors effectively reduce biased completions.

Conclusion: This work provides a direct and interpretable system for mitigating biases in large language models, enhancing their safety and accountability.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become more integrated into societal systems,
the risk of them perpetuating and amplifying harmful biases becomes a critical
safety concern. Traditional methods for mitigating bias often rely on data
filtering or post-hoc output moderation, which treat the model as an opaque
black box. In this work, we introduce a complete, end-to-end system that uses
techniques from mechanistic interpretability to both identify and actively
mitigate bias directly within a model's internal workings. Our method involves
two primary stages. First, we train linear "probes" on the internal activations
of a model to detect the latent representations of various biases (e.g.,
gender, race, age). Our experiments on \texttt{gpt2-large} demonstrate that
these probes can identify biased content with near-perfect accuracy, revealing
that bias representations become most salient in the model's later layers.
Second, we leverage these findings to compute "steering vectors" by contrasting
the model's activation patterns for biased and neutral statements. By adding
these vectors during inference, we can actively steer the model's generative
process away from producing harmful, stereotypical, or biased content in
real-time. We demonstrate the efficacy of this activation steering technique,
showing that it successfully alters biased completions toward more neutral
alternatives. We present our work as a robust and reproducible system that
offers a more direct and interpretable approach to building safer and more
accountable LLMs.

*Jie Wang,Guang Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper addresses the problem of predicting pre-request passenger waiting time in ridesharing systems, using a novel feature-interaction-based XGBoost model, achieving high accuracy and explainability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance passenger trip planning and improve user experience by addressing the lack of research on pre-request waiting time prediction in ridesharing systems.

Method: Performed a data-driven analysis of demand-supply dynamics and introduced FiXGBoost, a feature-interaction-based XGBoost model for predicting waiting time without requiring matched driver information.

Result: The proposed FiXGBoost model demonstrated strong predictive accuracy and improved explainability in experiments using a large dataset of over 30 million trip records.

Conclusion: FiXGBoost effectively predicts pre-request passenger waiting time, paving the way for enhanced ridesharing experiences and greater operational efficiency.

Abstract: Passenger waiting time prediction plays a critical role in enhancing both
ridesharing user experience and platform efficiency. While most existing
research focuses on post-request waiting time prediction with knowing the
matched driver information, pre-request waiting time prediction (i.e., before
submitting a ride request and without matching a driver) is also important, as
it enables passengers to plan their trips more effectively and enhance the
experience of both passengers and drivers. However, it has not been fully
studied by existing works. In this paper, we take the first step toward
understanding the predictability and explainability of pre-request passenger
waiting time in ridesharing systems. Particularly, we conduct an in-depth
data-driven study to investigate the impact of demand&supply dynamics on
passenger waiting time. Based on this analysis and feature engineering, we
propose FiXGBoost, a novel feature interaction-based XGBoost model designed to
predict waiting time without knowing the assigned driver information. We
further perform an importance analysis to quantify the contribution of each
factor. Experiments on a large-scale real-world ridesharing dataset including
over 30 million trip records show that our FiXGBoost can achieve a good
performance for pre-request passenger waiting time prediction with high
explainability.

*Debdeep Mukherjee,Eduardo Di Santi,Clément Lefebvre,Nenad Mijatovic,Victor Martin,Thierry Josse,Jonathan Brown,Kenza Saiah*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a deep learning-based framework to predict and classify anomalies in Continuous Variable Current Modulation railway systems, achieving high accuracy and early detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The aim is to tackle the challenge of early detection of subtle anomalies in track circuits, which are crucial for railway operations, to reduce failures, downtime, and revenue loss.

Method: The paper introduces a predictive maintenance framework based on deep neural networks and includes conformal prediction for uncertainty estimation. The method complies with ISO-17359 standards and leverages data from 10 failure cases.

Result: The proposed method outperforms traditional techniques with 99.31% accuracy and can detect anomalies within 1% of their onset, providing robust confidence intervals through conformal prediction.

Conclusion: This framework greatly improves anomaly detection in CVCM systems, is scalable, and can enhance the overall reliability of railway operations globally.

Abstract: Track circuits are critical for railway operations, acting as the main
signalling sub-system to locate trains. Continuous Variable Current Modulation
(CVCM) is one such technology. Like any field-deployed, safety-critical asset,
it can fail, triggering cascading disruptions. Many failures originate as
subtle anomalies that evolve over time, often not visually apparent in
monitored signals. Conventional approaches, which rely on clear signal changes,
struggle to detect them early. Early identification of failure types is
essential to improve maintenance planning, minimising downtime and revenue
loss. Leveraging deep neural networks, we propose a predictive maintenance
framework that classifies anomalies well before they escalate into failures.
Validated on 10 CVCM failure cases across different installations, the method
is ISO-17359 compliant and outperforms conventional techniques, achieving
99.31% overall accuracy with detection within 1% of anomaly onset. Through
conformal prediction, we provide uncertainty estimates, reaching 99% confidence
with consistent coverage across classes. Given CVCMs global deployment, the
approach is scalable and adaptable to other track circuits and railway systems,
enhancing operational reliability.

*Shixuan Sun,Siyuan Liang,Ruoyu Chen,Jianjie Huang,Jingzhi Li,Xiaochun Cao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper presents Source-aware Membership Audit (SMA), a method to attribute generated content to its source in retrieval-augmented systems, addressing privacy and provenance challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing generative models with retrieval functionalities, such as RAG and MRAG, introduce challenges in tracing generated content to its source, impacting privacy accountability.

Method: SMA employs zero-order optimization for source attribution through perturbation sampling and ridge regression. It also incorporates cross-modal attribution by converting image inputs into textual descriptions for token-level analysis.

Result: The approach enables fine-grained content source attribution in semi-black-box settings, providing privacy accountability and facilitating membership inference for multimodal systems.

Conclusion: SMA offers a novel framework to audit the provenance of generated data, shifting focus in membership inference research and improving reliability in complex generative systems.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and its Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (MRAG) significantly improve the knowledge coverage and contextual
understanding of Large Language Models (LLMs) by introducing external knowledge
sources. However, retrieval and multimodal fusion obscure content provenance,
rendering existing membership inference methods unable to reliably attribute
generated outputs to pre-training, external retrieval, or user input, thus
undermining privacy leakage accountability
  To address these challenges, we propose the first Source-aware Membership
Audit (SMA) that enables fine-grained source attribution of generated content
in a semi-black-box setting with retrieval control capabilities.To address the
environmental constraints of semi-black-box auditing, we further design an
attribution estimation mechanism based on zero-order optimization, which
robustly approximates the true influence of input tokens on the output through
large-scale perturbation sampling and ridge regression modeling. In addition,
SMA introduces a cross-modal attribution technique that projects image inputs
into textual descriptions via MLLMs, enabling token-level attribution in the
text modality, which for the first time facilitates membership inference on
image retrieval traces in MRAG systems. This work shifts the focus of
membership inference from 'whether the data has been memorized' to 'where the
content is sourced from', offering a novel perspective for auditing data
provenance in complex generative systems.

Motivation: As CUAs become crucial for managing digital interactions and executing impactful decisions, the lack of accessible systems hampers research into their risks, limitations, and capabilities.

Method: The authors developed a framework that includes a human annotation infrastructure, a large dataset (AgentNet), and a pipeline that processes demonstrations into state-action pairs using Chain-of-Thought reasoning.

Result: OpenCUA-32B achieves a new state-of-the-art average success rate of 34.8% on benchmarks, outperforming OpenAI's GPT-4o in open-source CUA systems.

Conclusion: OpenCUA’s open-source tools and models establish strong benchmarks and provide the research community with essential resources to advance studies on CUAs and their impacts.

Abstract: Vision-language models have demonstrated impressive capabilities as
computer-use agents (CUAs) capable of automating diverse computer tasks. As
their commercial potential grows, critical details of the most capable CUA
systems remain closed. As these agents will increasingly mediate digital
interactions and execute consequential decisions on our behalf, the research
community needs access to open CUA frameworks to study their capabilities,
limitations, and risks. To bridge this gap, we propose OpenCUA, a comprehensive
open-source framework for scaling CUA data and foundation models. Our framework
consists of: (1) an annotation infrastructure that seamlessly captures human
computer-use demonstrations; (2) AgentNet, the first large-scale computer-use
task dataset spanning 3 operating systems and 200+ applications and websites;
(3) a scalable pipeline that transforms demonstrations into state-action pairs
with reflective long Chain-of-Thought reasoning that sustain robust performance
gains as data scales. Our end-to-end agent models demonstrate strong
performance across CUA benchmarks. In particular, OpenCUA-32B achieves an
average success rate of 34.8% on OSWorld-Verified, establishing a new
state-of-the-art (SOTA) among open-source models and surpassing OpenAI CUA
(GPT-4o). Further analysis confirms that our approach generalizes well across
domains and benefits significantly from increased test-time computation. We
release our annotation tool, datasets, code, and models to build open

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: BrowseMaster introduces a scalable framework for effective information seeking by combining strategic planning and efficient retrieval, outperforming existing agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-based agents struggle with balancing broad search and deep reasoning in digital information seeking tasks.

Method: BrowseMaster utilizes a planner-executor agent pair: the planner formulates adaptable strategies, and the executor performs targeted retrieval for coherent reasoning.

Result: BrowseMaster achieved high scores on English and Chinese benchmarks, surpassing both open-source and proprietary baselines.

Conclusion: BrowseMaster demonstrates marked improvement in reasoning-heavy information-seeking tasks, overcoming limitations of existing agents.

Abstract: Effective information seeking in the vast and ever-growing digital landscape
requires balancing expansive search with strategic reasoning. Current large
language model (LLM)-based agents struggle to achieve this balance due to
limitations in search breadth and reasoning depth, where slow, serial querying
restricts coverage of relevant sources and noisy raw inputs disrupt the
continuity of multi-step reasoning. To address these challenges, we propose
BrowseMaster, a scalable framework built around a programmatically augmented
planner-executor agent pair. The planner formulates and adapts search
strategies based on task constraints, while the executor conducts efficient,
targeted retrieval to supply the planner with concise, relevant evidence. This
division of labor preserves coherent, long-horizon reasoning while sustaining
broad and systematic exploration, overcoming the trade-off that limits existing
agents. Extensive experiments on challenging English and Chinese benchmarks
show that BrowseMaster consistently outperforms open-source and proprietary
baselines, achieving scores of 30.0 on BrowseComp-en and 46.5 on BrowseComp-zh,
which demonstrates its strong capability in complex, reasoning-heavy
information-seeking tasks at scale.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AI systems for endoscopic diagnosis struggle with multi-step clinical workflows and flexible task integration.

Method: EndoAgent employs a dual-memory architecture for logical reasoning and experiential learning, incorporating expert-designed tools in a unified process.

Result: EndoAgent consistently surpasses traditional models in visual understanding and linguistic tasks, as validated by the EndoAgentBench benchmark.

Conclusion: EndoAgent demonstrates enhanced flexibility and reasoning for complex medical tasks, marking a step forward in endoscopic AI systems.

Abstract: Developing general artificial intelligence (AI) systems to support endoscopic
image diagnosis is an emerging research priority. Existing methods based on
large-scale pretraining often lack unified coordination across tasks and
struggle to handle the multi-step processes required in complex clinical
workflows. While AI agents have shown promise in flexible instruction parsing
and tool integration across domains, their potential in endoscopy remains
underexplored. To address this gap, we propose EndoAgent, the first
memory-guided agent for vision-to-decision endoscopic analysis that integrates
iterative reasoning with adaptive tool selection and collaboration. Built on a
dual-memory design, it enables sophisticated decision-making by ensuring
logical coherence through short-term action tracking and progressively
enhancing reasoning acuity through long-term experiential learning. To support
diverse clinical tasks, EndoAgent integrates a suite of expert-designed tools
within a unified reasoning loop. We further introduce EndoAgentBench, a
benchmark of 5,709 visual question-answer pairs that assess visual
understanding and language generation capabilities in realistic scenarios.
Extensive experiments show that EndoAgent consistently outperforms both general

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: XDMA is a distributed DMA architecture designed to optimize data movement in heterogeneous accelerator systems, achieving high performance and flexibility in memory operations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address inefficiencies in data movement and layout transformations in heterogeneous accelerators, especially the limitations of traditional DMA engines.

Method: Introduces XDMA, featuring a data streaming engine, a distributed architecture for high link utilization, and flexible plugins for on-the-fly data transformations.

Result: XDMA achieves up to 151.2x/8.2x higher link utilization than traditional approaches and offers a 2.3x speedup in real-world workloads, with minimal area and power overhead.

Conclusion: XDMA emphasizes the importance of co-optimizing memory access, layout transformations, and interconnects, proving its potential to enhance performance in heterogeneous multi-accelerator systems.

Abstract: As modern AI workloads increasingly rely on heterogeneous accelerators,
ensuring high-bandwidth and layout-flexible data movements between accelerator
memories has become a pressing challenge. Direct Memory Access (DMA) engines
promise high bandwidth utilization for data movements but are typically optimal
only for contiguous memory access, thus requiring additional software loops for
data layout transformations. This, in turn, leads to excessive control overhead
and underutilized on-chip interconnects. To overcome this inefficiency, we
present XDMA, a distributed and extensible DMA architecture that enables
layout-flexible data movements with high link utilization. We introduce three
key innovations: (1) a data streaming engine as XDMA Frontend, replacing
software address generators with hardware ones; (2) a distributed DMA
architecture that maximizes link utilization and separates configuration from
data transfer; (3) flexible plugins for XDMA enabling on-the-fly data
manipulation during data transfers. XDMA demonstrates up to 151.2x/8.2x higher
link utilization than software-based implementations in synthetic workloads and
achieves 2.3x average speedup over accelerators with SoTA DMA in real-world
applications. Our design incurs <2% area overhead over SoTA DMA solutions while
consuming 17% of system power. XDMA proves that co-optimizing memory access,
layout transformation, and interconnect protocols is key to unlocking
heterogeneous multi-accelerator SoC performance.

Method: A novel architecture combining packing-prefetch scheduling with monolithic 3D (M3D) back-end-of-line (BEOL) compatible embedded memories for ultra-large on-chip storage was proposed.

Result: The approach achieved an 8.06x decode speedup, 1.83x latency reduction on Llama3.1-8B, and 1.7x-2.4x throughput improvement alongside significant reductions in HBM bandwidth for various workloads.

Conclusion: This co-design of packing, prefetching, and BEOL memories reduces HBM constraints and enables more efficient long-context LLM inference on TPU-like architectures.

Abstract: Long-context Large Language Model (LLM) inference faces increasing compute
bottlenecks as attention calculations scale with context length, primarily due
to the growing KV-cache transfer overhead that saturates High Bandwidth Memory
(HBM). While prefetching techniques mitigate cache misses by fetching KV data
in advance, their spatial and temporal benefits present new opportunities to
exploit. This work proposes a packing-prefetch scheduling architecture with
monolithic 3D (M3D) back-end-of-line (BEOL) compatible embedded memories with
ultra-large on-chip capacity to accelerate long-context LLM inference. Our
optimizations demonstrate 8.06x decode speedup and 1.83x overall latency
reduction on Llama3.1-8B using TPUv6e-like hardware with additional 512MB BEOL
memories over the serial execution. Evaluations of multi-request workloads on
TPU-like architectures show 1.7x-2.4x throughput improvement and 1.5x-2.4x HBM
bandwidth reduction compared to packing-only methods on Llama3.1-8B and
Llama3.1-70B models. With the co-design of packing, prefetching, and BEOL
memories, our approach alleviates HBM constraints and enables efficient
long-context LLM inference.

### [45] [JSPIM: A Skew-Aware PIM Accelerator for High-Performance Databases Join and Select Operations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08503)
*Sabiha Tajdari,Anastasia Ailamaki,Sandhya Dwarkadas*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: JSPIM, a specialized PIM module, addresses inefficiencies in database join queries, achieving significant performance improvements with minimal hardware overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Join queries in database applications are bottlenecked by memory bandwidth and data movement inefficiencies, compounded by challenges like data skew.

Method: JSPIM employs hardware-algorithm co-design, featuring parallel search engines, redesigned hash tables for O(1) lookups, and integration of subarray-level and rank-level parallelism.

Result: Tests indicate JSPIM speeds up join queries by 400x–1000x over DuckDB and improves overall SSB benchmark throughput by 2.5x, with limited hardware costs.

Conclusion: JSPIM demonstrates the potential of optimized PIM designs to address database bottlenecks, providing substantial speedups and scalability improvement for analytical workloads.

Abstract: Database applications are increasingly bottlenecked by memory bandwidth and
latency due to the memory wall and the limited scalability of DRAM. Join
queries, central to analytical workloads, require intensive memory access and
are particularly vulnerable to inefficiencies in data movement. While
Processing-in-Memory (PIM) offers a promising solution, existing designs
typically reuse CPU-oriented join algorithms, limiting parallelism and
incurring costly inter-chip communication. Additionally, data skew, a main
challenge in CPU-based joins, remains unresolved in current PIM architectures.
  We introduce JSPIM, a PIM module that accelerates hash join and, by
extension, corresponding select queries through algorithm-hardware co-design.
JSPIM deploys parallel search engines within each subarray and redesigns hash
tables to achieve O(1) lookups, fully exploiting PIM's fine-grained
parallelism. To mitigate skew, our design integrates subarray-level parallelism
with rank-level processing, eliminating redundant off-chip transfers.
Evaluations show JSPIM delivers 400x to 1000x speedup on join queries versus
DuckDB. When paired with DuckDB for the full SSB benchmark, JSPIM achieves an
overall 2.5x throughput improvement (individual query gains of 1.1x to 28x), at
just a 7% data overhead and 2.1% per-rank PIM-enabled chip area increase.

### [46] [OISMA: On-the-fly In-memory Stochastic Multiplication Architecture for Matrix-Multiplication Workloads](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08822)
*Shady Agwa,Yihan Pan,Georgios Papandroulidakis,Themis Prodromakis*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: This work introduces OISMA, a novel quasi-stochastic in-memory computing architecture that enhances matrix multiplication's accuracy and efficiency, boasting energy efficiency of 0.891 TOPS/W and area efficiency of 3.98 GOPS/mm2, with significant improvements when scaled to advanced technology nodes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitations of current in-memory computing architectures and improve computational efficiency in artificial intelligence models, which rely heavily on massive matrix multiplication workloads.

Method: Introduced OISMA, leveraging the quasi-stochastic Bent-Pyramid system for in-memory stochastic multiplication while maintaining digital memory efficiency. Benchmarked matrix multiplication accuracy across diverse dimensions and implemented real-world hardware using a 180nm node.

Result: Achieved a decrease in average Frobenius error from 9.42% to 1.81%, with a 1T1R OISMA array demonstrating 0.891 TOPS/W energy efficiency and 3.98 GOPS/mm2 area efficiency. Scaling to newer technology nodes showed significant improvements.

Conclusion: OISMA demonstrates superior energy and area efficiency compared to traditional in-memory computing architectures, with potential for further scalability and application in various AI workloads.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence models are currently driven by a significant
up-scaling of their complexity, with massive matrix multiplication workloads
representing the major computational bottleneck. In-memory computing
architectures are proposed to avoid the Von Neumann bottleneck. However, both
digital/binary-based and analogue in-memory computing architectures suffer from
various limitations, which significantly degrade the performance and energy
efficiency gains. This work proposes OISMA, a novel in-memory computing
architecture that utilizes the computational simplicity of a quasi-stochastic
computing domain (Bent-Pyramid system), while keeping the same efficiency,
scalability, and productivity of digital memories. OISMA converts normal memory
read operations into in-situ stochastic multiplication operations with a
negligible cost. An accumulation periphery then accumulates the output
multiplication bitstreams, achieving the matrix multiplication functionality.
Extensive matrix multiplication benchmarking was conducted to analyze the
accuracy of the Bent-Pyramid system, using matrix dimensions ranging from 4x4
to 512x512. The accuracy results show a significant decrease in the average
relative Frobenius error, from 9.42% (for 4x4) to 1.81% (for 512x512), compared
to 64-bit double precision floating-point format. A 1T1R OISMA array of 4 KB
capacity was implemented using a commercial 180nm technology node and in-house
RRAM technology. At 50 MHz, OISMA achieves 0.891 TOPS/W and 3.98 GOPS/mm2 for
energy and area efficiency, respectively, occupying an effective computing area
of 0.804241 mm2. Scaling OISMA from 180nm to 22nm technology shows a
significant improvement of two orders of magnitude in energy efficiency and one
order of magnitude in area efficiency, compared to dense matrix multiplication
in-memory computing architectures.

### [47] [Argument Quality Annotation and Gender Bias Detection in Financial Communication through Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08262)
*Alaa Alhamzeh,Mays Al Rebdawi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates three LLMs for their ability to annotate argument quality in financial contexts, revealing better consistency than humans but persistent gender bias.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve the assessment of argument quality in financial communications and to examine the reliability and fairness of AI-based systems compared to human annotations.

Method: The study tests three LLMs (GPT-4o, Llama 3.1, and Gemma 2) using the FinArgQuality dataset, analyzing annotation consistency, benchmarking against human performance, and introducing gender bias via adversarial attacks.

Result: LLMs showed higher agreement in annotations compared to humans but still demonstrated gender bias. Experiments also evaluated the effect of three temperature settings.

Conclusion: LLM annotations are more consistent but not free from bias. The study recommends bias-aware and cost-efficient methodologies for future research.

Abstract: Financial arguments play a critical role in shaping investment decisions and
public trust in financial institutions. Nevertheless, assessing their quality
remains poorly studied in the literature. In this paper, we examine the
capabilities of three state-of-the-art LLMs GPT-4o, Llama 3.1, and Gemma 2 in
annotating argument quality within financial communications, using the
FinArgQuality dataset. Our contributions are twofold. First, we evaluate the
consistency of LLM-generated annotations across multiple runs and benchmark
them against human annotations. Second, we introduce an adversarial attack
designed to inject gender bias to analyse models responds and ensure model's
fairness and robustness. Both experiments are conducted across three
temperature settings to assess their influence on annotation stability and
alignment with human labels. Our findings reveal that LLM-based annotations
achieve higher inter-annotator agreement than human counterparts, though the
models still exhibit varying degrees of gender bias. We provide a multifaceted
analysis of these outcomes and offer practical recommendations to guide future
research toward more reliable, cost-effective, and bias-aware annotation
methodologies.

### [48] [Putnam-AXIOM: A Functional and Static Benchmark](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08292)
*Aryan Gulati,Brando Miranda,Eric Chen,Emily Xia,Kai Fronsdal,Bruno Dumont,Elyas Obbad,Sanmi Koyejo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Putnam-AXIOM, a dynamic and contamination-resilient benchmarking framework for evaluating advanced mathematical reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks for assessing LLMs in mathematical reasoning are reaching saturation and are increasingly affected by training data contamination, making it difficult to evaluate their true reasoning capabilities.

Method: The authors developed Putnam-AXIOM and Putnam-AXIOM Variation, a set of 522 competition problems and 100 programmatically generated variants respectively, offering an unlimited and contamination-free test environment. The benchmarks evaluate reasoning capability with metrics like accuracy and Teacher-Forced Accuracy (TFA) to score natural language proof evaluations.

Result: OpenAI's o1-preview model achieved 41.9% accuracy on the Original set but experienced a 19.6% drop in accuracy on the Variations, revealing potential issues with memorization. A similar performance drop was observed across 18 other models, with 10 models showing statistically significant reductions.

Conclusion: Putnam-AXIOM serves as a robust and dynamic benchmarking tool for evaluating the reasoning capabilities of LLMs, highlighting the importance of adaptive tests and contamination-resilient metrics.

Abstract: Current mathematical reasoning benchmarks for large language models (LLMs)
are approaching saturation, with some achieving > 90% accuracy, and are
increasingly compromised by training-set contamination. We introduce
Putnam-AXIOM, a benchmark of 522 university-level competition problems drawn
from the prestigious William Lowell Putnam Mathematical Competition, and
Putnam-AXIOM Variation, an unseen companion set of 100 functional variants
generated by programmatically perturbing variables and constants. The variation
protocol produces an unlimited stream of equally difficult, unseen instances --
yielding a contamination-resilient test bed. On the Original set, OpenAI's
o1-preview -- the strongest evaluated model -- scores 41.9%, but its accuracy
drops by 19.6% (46.8% relative decrease) on the paired Variations. The
remaining eighteen models show the same downward trend, ten of them with
non-overlapping 95% confidence intervals. These gaps suggest memorization and
highlight the necessity of dynamic benchmarks. We complement "boxed" accuracy
with Teacher-Forced Accuracy (TFA), a lightweight metric that directly scores
reasoning traces and automates natural language proof evaluations. Putnam-AXIOM
therefore provides a rigorous, contamination-resilient evaluation framework for
assessing advanced mathematical reasoning of LLMs. Data and evaluation code are
publicly available at https://github.com/brando90/putnam-axiom.

*Tarık Saraç,Selin Mergen,Mucahid Kutlu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study proposes a council debate method using large language models (LLMs) for classifying tweets based on scientific discourse, achieving first place in detecting references to scientific studies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to enhance the ability to detect different aspects of scientific discourse, such as claims and references, using innovative methods involving large language models.

Method: Three debating strategies among LLMs are explored: single debate, team debate, and the preferred council debate method, where multiple expert models deliberate together, moderated by a chairperson.

Result: The council debate method outperformed alternative methods in detecting references to scientific studies (ranked 1st) but performed less effectively in identifying scientific claims and entities (ranked 8th and 9th, respectively).

Conclusion: The proposed council debate model shows promise in certain aspects of scientific discourse classification but requires further optimization for broader applicability.

Abstract: In this paper, we present our work developed for the scientific web discourse
detection task (Task 4a) of CheckThat! 2025. We propose a novel council debate
method that simulates structured academic discussions among multiple large
language models (LLMs) to identify whether a given tweet contains (i) a
scientific claim, (ii) a reference to a scientific study, or (iii) mentions of
scientific entities. We explore three debating methods: i) single debate, where
two LLMs argue for opposing positions while a third acts as a judge; ii) team
debate, in which multiple models collaborate within each side of the debate;
and iii) council debate, where multiple expert models deliberate together to
reach a consensus, moderated by a chairperson model. We choose council debate
as our primary model as it outperforms others in the development test set.
Although our proposed method did not rank highly for identifying scientific
claims (8th out of 10) or mentions of scientific entities (9th out of 10), it
ranked first in detecting references to scientific studies.

### [50] [Heartificial Intelligence: Exploring Empathy in Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08271)
*Victoria Williams,Benjamin Rosman*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates empathy in language models, revealing strong cognitive but weak affective empathy, suggesting their role as effective yet unbiased virtual companions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to understand how well small and large language models emulate aspects of human empathy, given their increasing use as virtual assistants and companions.

Method: Standardized psychological tests were applied to assess cognitive and affective empathy in different-sized language models, comparing their results to human participants.

Result: Large models exceeded humans in cognitive empathy but fell short in affective empathy, while smaller models also struggled with affective empathy.

Conclusion: Although language models excel in simulating cognitive empathy, their lack of affective empathy provides them with the advantage of delivering unbiased and constant emotional support.

Abstract: Large language models have become increasingly common, used by millions of
people worldwide in both professional and personal contexts. As these models
continue to advance, they are frequently serving as virtual assistants and
companions. In human interactions, effective communication typically involves
two types of empathy: cognitive empathy (understanding others' thoughts and
emotions) and affective empathy (emotionally sharing others' feelings). In this
study, we investigated both cognitive and affective empathy across several
small (SLMs) and large (LLMs) language models using standardized psychological
tests. Our results revealed that LLMs consistently outperformed humans -
including psychology students - on cognitive empathy tasks. However, despite
their cognitive strengths, both small and large language models showed
significantly lower affective empathy compared to human participants. These
findings highlight rapid advancements in language models' ability to simulate
cognitive empathy, suggesting strong potential for providing effective virtual
companionship and personalized emotional support. Additionally, their high
cognitive yet lower affective empathy allows objective and consistent emotional
support without running the risk of emotional fatigue or bias.

*Tadej Škvorc,Nikola Ivačič,Sebastjan Hribar,Marko Robnik-Šikonja*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a real-time story identification method for assigning news articles to specific stories based on events, places, and people, rather than general text similarity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enhance the organization of online news for improved reading experiences by assigning articles to topical collections or stories.

Method: The authors combine text representation techniques, clustering algorithms, and online topic modeling methods, using approaches like BERTopic, DBStream, and TextClust to identify specific events and entities.

Result: The approach was evaluated on Slovene news data over a month and produced results deemed sensible by human evaluators.

Conclusion: The proposed real-time system efficiently organizes news articles into meaningful stories, proving practical for online monitoring systems.

Abstract: To improve the reading experience, many news sites organize news into topical
collections, called stories. In this work, we present an approach for
implementing real-time story identification for a news monitoring system that
automatically collects news articles as they appear online and processes them
in various ways. Story identification aims to assign each news article to a
specific story that the article is covering. The process is similar to text
clustering and topic modeling, but requires that articles be grouped based on
particular events, places, and people, rather than general text similarity (as
in clustering) or general (predefined) topics (as in topic modeling). We
present an approach to story identification that is capable of functioning in
real time, assigning articles to stories as they are published online. In the
proposed approach, we combine text representation techniques, clustering
algorithms, and online topic modeling methods. We combine various text
representation methods to extract specific events and named entities necessary
for story identification, showing that a mixture of online topic-modeling
approaches such as BERTopic, DBStream, and TextClust can be adapted for story
discovery. We evaluate our approach on a news dataset from Slovene media
covering a period of 1 month. We show that our real-time approach produces
sensible results as judged by human evaluators.

*Kristian Miok,Blaz Škrlj,Daniela Zaharie,Marko Robnik Šikonja*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces TT-XAI, a framework that improves clinical language model performance and interpretability using domain-aware keyword distillation and reasoning with LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clinical language models often lack trustworthy predictions and explanations when dealing with unstructured, lengthy EHRs.

Method: The framework uses keyword distillation to refine raw discharge notes and facilitates reasoning by employing keyword-guided prompts for chain-of-thought explanations via LLMs.

Result: TT-XAI significantly enhances BERT classifier performance, explanation fidelity, and produces clinically relevant reasoning, as validated by multiple metrics including human expert evaluation.

Conclusion: TT-XAI presents an effective and scalable approach to improve interpretability and trustworthiness in clinical decision support systems.

Abstract: Clinical language models often struggle to provide trustworthy predictions
and explanations when applied to lengthy, unstructured electronic health
records (EHRs). This work introduces TT-XAI, a lightweight and effective
framework that improves both classification performance and interpretability
through domain-aware keyword distillation and reasoning with large language
models (LLMs). First, we demonstrate that distilling raw discharge notes into
concise keyword representations significantly enhances BERT classifier
performance and improves local explanation fidelity via a focused variant of
LIME. Second, we generate chain-of-thought clinical explanations using
keyword-guided prompts to steer LLMs, producing more concise and clinically
relevant reasoning. We evaluate explanation quality using deletion-based
fidelity metrics, self-assessment via LLaMA-3 scoring, and a blinded human
study with domain experts. All evaluation modalities consistently favor the
keyword-augmented method, confirming that distillation enhances both machine
and human interpretability. TT-XAI offers a scalable pathway toward
trustworthy, auditable AI in clinical decision support.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Speech Concept Bottleneck Model (SCBM) for automated hate and counter speech detection using adjectives as interpretable concepts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the rising impact of hate speech on social media and improve detection with an interpretable, effective method.

Method: Proposes SCBM, which uses adjectives as bottleneck concepts, leveraging large language models (LLMs) and a light-weight classifier for downstream tasks.

Result: SCBM shows high accuracy with a macro-F1 score of 0.69 across multiple datasets and demonstrates both local and global interpretability; combining it with transformer embeddings boosts performance.

Conclusion: Adjective-based concept representations are compact, interpretable, and effective for hate speech recognition and adaptable to other NLP tasks.

Abstract: The rapid increase in hate speech on social media has exposed an
unprecedented impact on society, making automated methods for detecting such
content important. Unlike prior black-box models, we propose a novel
transparent method for automated hate and counter speech recognition, i.e.,
"Speech Concept Bottleneck Model" (SCBM), using adjectives as
human-interpretable bottleneck concepts. SCBM leverages large language models
(LLMs) to map input texts to an abstract adjective-based representation, which
is then sent to a light-weight classifier for downstream tasks. Across five
benchmark datasets spanning multiple languages and platforms (e.g., Twitter,
Reddit, YouTube), SCBM achieves an average macro-F1 score of 0.69 which
outperforms the most recently reported results from the literature on four out
of five datasets. Aside from high recognition accuracy, SCBM provides a high
level of both local and global interpretability. Furthermore, fusing our
adjective-based concept representation with transformer embeddings, leads to a
1.8% performance increase on average across all datasets, showing that the
proposed representation captures complementary information. Our results
demonstrate that adjective-based concept representations can serve as compact,
interpretable, and effective encodings for hate and counter speech recognition.
With adapted adjectives, our method can also be applied to other NLP tasks.

TL;DR: The paper introduces MLLM-CTBench, a benchmark designed for evaluating Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in continual instruction tuning, focusing on dimensions like reasoning, algorithm performance, and dataset coverage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for rigorous, systematic benchmarks to evaluate the continual instruction tuning of MLLMs and improve their adaptability to real-world applications.

Method: Introduced a benchmark (MLLM-CTBench) combining multiple evaluation dimensions, comprehensive assessment of learning algorithms and paradigms, and carefully curated tasks across challenging domains.

Result: The study reveals that stronger models show better robustness to forgetting, reasoning degrades slower than answers, algorithm effectiveness varies with model capability and task order, and KL-divergence constraints are crucial in reinforcement learning.

Conclusion: MLLM-CTBench provides a robust framework for the systematic evaluation and improvement of MLLMs, addressing gaps in continual instruction tuning and aiding future algorithm development.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) rely on continual instruction tuning
to adapt to the evolving demands of real-world applications. However, progress
in this area is hindered by the lack of rigorous and systematic benchmarks. To
address this gap, we present MLLM-CTBench, a comprehensive evaluation benchmark
with three key contributions: (1) Multidimensional Evaluation: We combine final
answer accuracy with fine-grained CoT reasoning quality assessment, enabled by
a specially trained CoT evaluator; (2) Comprehensive Evaluation of Algorithms
and Training Paradigms: We benchmark eight continual learning algorithms across
four major categories and systematically compare reinforcement learning with
supervised fine-tuning paradigms; (3) Carefully Curated Tasks: We select and
organize 16 datasets from existing work, covering six challenging domains. Our
key findings include: (i) Models with stronger general capabilities exhibit
greater robustness to forgetting during continual learning; (ii) Reasoning
chains degrade more slowly than final answers, supporting the hierarchical
forgetting hypothesis; (iii) The effectiveness of continual learning algorithms
is highly dependent on both model capability and task order; (iv) In
reinforcement learning settings, incorporating KL-divergence constraints helps
maintain policy stability and plays a crucial role in mitigating forgetting.
MLLM-CTBench establishes a rigorous standard for continual instruction tuning
of MLLMs and offers practical guidance for algorithm design and evaluation.

*Yassine Jamaa,Badr AlKhamissi,Satrajit Ghosh,Martin Schrimpf*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper investigates the causal relevance of specific units in LLMs and VLMs for tasks like Theory of Mind (ToM) and mathematical reasoning, assessing their impact through activation analysis and ablations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to identify and understand the specific units in large-scale models responsible for specific cognitive tasks, leveraging neuroscientific methods to enhance task-specific accuracy and model interpretability.

Method: Using contrastive stimulus sets and targeted ablations, the authors localized and evaluated highly activated units in 16 models (ranging from 3B to 90B parameters) and studied their effect on downstream ToM and mathematical reasoning benchmarks.

Result: Surprisingly, low-activation units sometimes led to greater performance declines than high-activation units. Additionally, units identified for mathematical reasoning often disrupted ToM tasks more than ToM-specific units.

Conclusion: The study questions the reliability of current contrast-based localizers and calls for richer stimulus sets to better identify task-relevant units in large models.

Abstract: This work adapts a neuroscientific contrast localizer to pinpoint causally
relevant units for Theory of Mind (ToM) and mathematical reasoning tasks in
large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs). Across 11 LLMs
and 5 VLMs ranging in size from 3B to 90B parameters, we localize top-activated
units using contrastive stimulus sets and assess their causal role via targeted
ablations. We compare the effect of lesioning functionally selected units
against low-activation and randomly selected units on downstream accuracy
across established ToM and mathematical benchmarks. Contrary to expectations,
low-activation units sometimes produced larger performance drops than the
highly activated ones, and units derived from the mathematical localizer often
impaired ToM performance more than those from the ToM localizer. These findings
call into question the causal relevance of contrast-based localizers and
highlight the need for broader stimulus sets and more accurately capture
task-specific units.

TL;DR: AutoCodeGen and AutoCodeBench address limitations in current code generation benchmarks by providing diverse, high-difficulty multilingual datasets, evaluated against >30 LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for LLM-based code generation are restricted by manual annotations, Python-centric focus, and limited multilingual capabilities.

Method: AutoCodeGen automates multilingual dataset creation using LLMs for test cases and a sandbox for validation, ensuring quality via reverse-order problem generation and filtering.

Result: AutoCodeBench comprises 3,920 problems across 20 languages, revealing difficulties for advanced LLMs in handling multilingual, complex coding tasks.

Conclusion: AutoCodeBench redefines code generation evaluation by focusing on practical, diverse, high-difficulty tasks, encouraging further development in multilingual scenarios.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
various domains, with code generation emerging as a key area of focus. While
numerous benchmarks have been proposed to evaluate their code generation
abilities, these benchmarks face several critical limitations. First, they
often rely on manual annotations, which are time-consuming and difficult to
scale across different programming languages and problem complexities. Second,
most existing benchmarks focus primarily on Python, while the few multilingual
benchmarks suffer from limited difficulty and uneven language distribution. To
address these challenges, we propose AutoCodeGen, an automated method for
generating high-difficulty multilingual code generation datasets without manual
annotations. AutoCodeGen ensures the correctness and completeness of test cases
by generating test inputs with LLMs and obtaining test outputs through a
multilingual sandbox, while achieving high data quality through reverse-order
problem generation and multiple filtering steps. Using this novel method, we
introduce AutoCodeBench, a large-scale code generation benchmark comprising
3,920 problems evenly distributed across 20 programming languages. It is
specifically designed to evaluate LLMs on challenging, diverse, and practical
multilingual tasks. We evaluate over 30 leading open-source and proprietary
LLMs on AutoCodeBench and its simplified version AutoCodeBench-Lite. The
results show that even the most advanced LLMs struggle with the complexity,
diversity, and multilingual nature of these tasks. Besides, we introduce
AutoCodeBench-Complete, specifically designed for base models to assess their
few-shot code generation capabilities. We hope the AutoCodeBench series will
serve as a valuable resource and inspire the community to focus on more
challenging and practical multilingual code generation scenarios.

Motivation: The sequential nature of autoregressive (AR) text generation in large language models creates a bottleneck in speed and efficiency, necessitating exploration into parallel generation techniques.

Method: The authors systematically categorize and analyze parallel text generation techniques, dividing them into AR-based and Non-AR-based paradigms. They examine theoretical trade-offs in speed, quality, and efficiency, and consider combinations with other acceleration strategies.

Result: The survey offers a taxonomy of parallel text generation methods, assessing their trade-offs and potential to optimize inference performance. It also identifies open challenges and recent advancements.

Conclusion: This work fills the expertise gap by providing a structured analysis of parallel text generation methods, helping to guide future research in improving text generation efficiency.

Abstract: As text generation has become a core capability of modern Large Language
Models (LLMs), it underpins a wide range of downstream applications. However,
most existing LLMs rely on autoregressive (AR) generation, producing one token
at a time based on previously generated context-resulting in limited generation
speed due to the inherently sequential nature of the process. To address this
challenge, an increasing number of researchers have begun exploring parallel
text generation-a broad class of techniques aimed at breaking the
token-by-token generation bottleneck and improving inference efficiency.
Despite growing interest, there remains a lack of comprehensive analysis on
what specific techniques constitute parallel text generation and how they
improve inference performance. To bridge this gap, we present a systematic
survey of parallel text generation methods. We categorize existing approaches
into AR-based and Non-AR-based paradigms, and provide a detailed examination of
the core techniques within each category. Following this taxonomy, we assess
their theoretical trade-offs in terms of speed, quality, and efficiency, and
examine their potential for combination and comparison with alternative
acceleration strategies. Finally, based on our findings, we highlight recent
advancements, identify open challenges, and outline promising directions for
future research in parallel text generation.

*Andres Garcia Rincon,Eliseo Ferrante*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces MinionsLLM, combining large language models with behavior trees and formal grammars to control multi-agent systems via natural language. Fine-tuning with synthetic datasets enhances performance, especially for smaller models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable natural language control of multi-agent systems in varied environments, improving syntactic validity and semantic task relevance of LLM outputs.

Method: Integrated LLMs with behavior trees and formal grammars, introduced synthetic dataset methods for fine-tuning, and tested on Google's Gemma 3 models at 1B, 4B, and 12B parameter scales.

Result: Fine-tuning with Method B improved syntactic validity to 92.6% and increased task performance by 33%, with smaller models seeing the most benefit.

Conclusion: MinionsLLM advances multi-agent control using refined LLMs, demonstrating the potential for compact models in resource-limited settings; resources are shared for further exploration.

Abstract: This paper presents MinionsLLM, a novel framework that integrates Large
Language Models (LLMs) with Behavior Trees (BTs) and Formal Grammars to enable
natural language control of multi-agent systems within arbitrary, user-defined
environments. MinionsLLM provides standardized interfaces for defining
environments, agents, and behavioral primitives, and introduces two synthetic
dataset generation methods (Method A and Method B) to fine-tune LLMs for
improved syntactic validity and semantic task relevance. We validate our
approach using Google's Gemma 3 model family at three parameter scales (1B, 4B,
and 12B) and demonstrate substantial gains: Method B increases syntactic
validity to 92.6% and achieves a mean task performance improvement of 33% over
baseline. Notably, our experiments show that smaller models benefit most from
fine-tuning, suggesting promising directions for deploying compact, locally
hosted LLMs in resource-constrained multi-agent control scenarios. The
framework and all resources are released open-source to support reproducibility
and future research.

*Denis Janiak,Jakub Binkowski,Albert Sawczyn,Bogdan Gabrys,Ravid Schwartz-Ziv,Tomasz Kajdanowicz*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper critiques the reliance on ROUGE in evaluating hallucination detection methods for LLMs, showing that it misaligns with human judgment and calls for semantic-aware metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issue of unreliable evaluation metrics like ROUGE in measuring the effectiveness of hallucination detection methods for LLMs.

Method: Conducted human studies comparing ROUGE with human-aligned metrics like LLM-as-Judge and analyzed performance reductions with alternative evaluation frameworks.

Result: Discover ROUGE's low precision in alignment with human judgments, showing up to a 45.9% performance drop for methods when switching to metrics like LLM-as-Judge.

Conclusion: Semantic-aware and robust evaluation frameworks should replace ROUGE to ensure meaningful, trustworthy assessments of hallucination detection methods for LLMs.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing,
yet their tendency to hallucinate poses serious challenges for reliable
deployment. Despite numerous hallucination detection methods, their evaluations
often rely on ROUGE, a metric based on lexical overlap that misaligns with
human judgments. Through comprehensive human studies, we demonstrate that while
ROUGE exhibits high recall, its extremely low precision leads to misleading
performance estimates. In fact, several established detection methods show
performance drops of up to 45.9\% when assessed using human-aligned metrics
like LLM-as-Judge. Moreover, our analysis reveals that simple heuristics based
on response length can rival complex detection techniques, exposing a
fundamental flaw in current evaluation practices. We argue that adopting
semantically aware and robust evaluation frameworks is essential to accurately
gauge the true performance of hallucination detection methods, ultimately
ensuring the trustworthiness of LLM outputs.

*Farah Atif,Nursultan Askarbekuly,Kareem Darwish,Monojit Choudhury*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces FiqhQA, a benchmark to evaluate LLMs' accuracy and abstention behavior in generating Islamic jurisprudence across Sunni schools of thought, finding limitations in Arabic and highlighting GPT-4o's accuracy and abstention superiorities in other models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the reliability and accuracy of LLMs in the domain of Islamic jurisprudence, particularly in addressing the nuanced differences among the four major Sunni schools of thought, and to evaluate their ability to abstain from answering when uncertain.

Method: A novel benchmark, FiqhQA, was created for fine-grained assessments of Islamic rulings generated by LLMs, with experiments conducted to measure model accuracy and abstention behavior across both Arabic and English languages and multiple Sunni schools of thought.

Result: The study revealed performance variations among models, with GPT-4o achieving the highest accuracy overall, while alternative models like Gemini and Fanar were more effective at abstention to avoid confident incorrect responses. All models showcased reduced performance for Arabic text.

Conclusion: This study highlights the importance of task-specific evaluation for LLMs in sensitive applications like religious jurisprudence, emphasizing their linguistic limitations and advocating cautious deployment.

Abstract: Despite the increasing usage of Large Language Models (LLMs) in answering
questions in a variety of domains, their reliability and accuracy remain
unexamined for a plethora of domains including the religious domains. In this
paper, we introduce a novel benchmark FiqhQA focused on the LLM generated
Islamic rulings explicitly categorized by the four major Sunni schools of
thought, in both Arabic and English. Unlike prior work, which either overlooks
the distinctions between religious school of thought or fails to evaluate
abstention behavior, we assess LLMs not only on their accuracy but also on
their ability to recognize when not to answer. Our zero-shot and abstention
experiments reveal significant variation across LLMs, languages, and legal
schools of thought. While GPT-4o outperforms all other models in accuracy,
Gemini and Fanar demonstrate superior abstention behavior critical for
minimizing confident incorrect answers. Notably, all models exhibit a
performance drop in Arabic, highlighting the limitations in religious reasoning
for languages other than English. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first study to benchmark the efficacy of LLMs for fine-grained Islamic school
of thought specific ruling generation and to evaluate abstention for Islamic
jurisprudence queries. Our findings underscore the need for task-specific
evaluation and cautious deployment of LLMs in religious applications.

*Shuzhou Yuan,William LaCroix,Hardik Ghoshal,Ercong Nie,Michael Färber*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces the CoDAE framework that enhances large language models (LLMs) for educational contexts, using Chain-of-Thought (CoT) data augmentation to improve reasoning, adaptivity, and mitigate compliance issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Off-the-shelf LLMs used in educational settings underperform by revealing answers too soon, failing to adapt to student uncertainty, and being prone to emotional manipulation.

Method: CoDAE framework applies Chain-of-Thought (CoT) data augmentation on real-world student-AI dialogues to improve step-by-step reasoning and adaptiveness. Targeted dialogue cases are also designed to address compliance, adaptivity, and vulnerability issues.

Result: Fine-tuning LLMs with CoDAE demonstrated improved pedagogical guidance, reasoning support, and resistance to premature answer disclosure.

Conclusion: The CoDAE framework enhances LLMs' performance as AI tutors, making them more educationally effective and resistant to key limitations.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly employed as AI tutors due to
their scalability and potential for personalized instruction. However,
off-the-shelf LLMs often underperform in educational settings: they frequently
reveal answers too readily, fail to adapt their responses to student
uncertainty, and remain vulnerable to emotionally manipulative prompts. To
address these challenges, we introduce CoDAE, a framework that adapts LLMs for
educational use through Chain-of-Thought (CoT) data augmentation. We collect
real-world dialogues between students and a ChatGPT-based tutor and enrich them
using CoT prompting to promote step-by-step reasoning and pedagogically aligned
guidance. Furthermore, we design targeted dialogue cases to explicitly mitigate
three key limitations: over-compliance, low response adaptivity, and threat
vulnerability. We fine-tune four open-source LLMs on different variants of the
augmented datasets and evaluate them in simulated educational scenarios using
both automatic metrics and LLM-as-a-judge assessments. Our results show that
models fine-tuned with CoDAE deliver more pedagogically appropriate guidance,
better support reasoning processes, and effectively resist premature answer
disclosure.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Mol-R1 leverages curated datasets and advanced training strategies to enable more effective molecular reasoning in LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Long-CoT models lack precision and efficiency in handling knowledge-intensive domains, like molecular discovery.

Method: Mol-R1 employs Prior Regulation via In-context Distillation (PRID) to create reasoning data, and Molecular Iterative Adaptation (MoIA) to enhance reasoning through supervised fine-tuning and policy optimization.

Result: Mol-R1 outperforms existing baselines in text-based molecule reasoning generation tasks.

Conclusion: Mol-R1 addresses limitations in Long-CoT reasoning models by combining high-quality datasets and adaptive training, advancing text-based molecular discovery.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs), especially Explicit Long Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
reasoning models like DeepSeek-R1 and QWQ, have demonstrated powerful reasoning
capabilities, achieving impressive performance in commonsense reasoning and
mathematical inference. Despite their effectiveness, Long-CoT reasoning models
are often criticized for their limited ability and low efficiency in
knowledge-intensive domains such as molecule discovery. Success in this field
requires a precise understanding of domain knowledge, including molecular
structures and chemical principles, which is challenging due to the inherent
complexity of molecular data and the scarcity of high-quality expert
annotations. To bridge this gap, we introduce Mol-R1, a novel framework
designed to improve explainability and reasoning performance of R1-like
Explicit Long-CoT reasoning LLMs in text-based molecule generation. Our
approach begins with a high-quality reasoning dataset curated through Prior
Regulation via In-context Distillation (PRID), a dedicated distillation
strategy to effectively generate paired reasoning traces guided by prior
regulations. Building upon this, we introduce MoIA, Molecular Iterative
Adaptation, a sophisticated training strategy that iteratively combines
Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT) with Reinforced Policy Optimization (RPO),
tailored to boost the reasoning performance of R1-like reasoning models for
molecule discovery. Finally, we examine the performance of Mol-R1 in the
text-based molecule reasoning generation task, showing superior performance
against existing baselines.

*Saketh Reddy Vemula,Dipti Mishra Sharma,Parameswari Krishnamurthy*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study evaluates the impact of morphological alignment and tokenizer algorithms on language model performance for typologically diverse languages, finding that Unigram tokenizers outperform others and morphological alignment moderately benefits syntax-based tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to clarify conflicting findings about the benefit of morphologically aligned tokenization approaches, especially for languages with complex morphology, by examining a diverse set of languages.

Method: The authors trained tokenizers and language models for Telugu, Hindi, and English, assessed morphological alignment with a new dataset for Telugu, and systematically evaluated their impact on downstream tasks like POS tagging, NER, and dependency parsing.

Result: Morphological alignment moderately improves syntax-based tasks, but tokenizer algorithm choices have greater influence. Naive Unigram tokenizers perform best overall, and hybrid morphological segmentation enhances BPE tokenizers.

Conclusion: Tokenization approaches should prioritize the tokenizer algorithm for language modeling tasks, with morphological alignment offering secondary benefits for specific tasks.

Abstract: Prior work on language modeling showed conflicting findings about whether
morphologically aligned approaches to tokenization improve performance,
particularly for languages with complex morphology. To investigate this, we
select a typologically diverse set of languages: Telugu (agglutinative), Hindi
(primarily fusional with some agglutination), and English (fusional). We
conduct a comprehensive evaluation of language models -- starting from
tokenizer training and extending through the finetuning and downstream task
evaluation. To account for the consistent performance differences observed
across tokenizer variants, we focus on two key factors: morphological alignment
and tokenization quality. To assess morphological alignment of tokenizers in
Telugu, we create a dataset containing gold morpheme segmentations of 600
derivational and 7000 inflectional word forms.
  Our experiments reveal that better morphological alignment correlates
positively -- though moderately -- with performance in syntax-based tasks such
as Parts-of-Speech tagging, Named Entity Recognition and Dependency Parsing.
However, we also find that the tokenizer algorithm (Byte-pair Encoding vs.
Unigram) plays a more significant role in influencing downstream performance
than morphological alignment alone. Naive Unigram tokenizers outperform others
across most settings, though hybrid tokenizers that incorporate morphological
segmentation significantly improve performance within the BPE framework. In
contrast, intrinsic metrics like Corpus Token Count (CTC) and R\'enyi entropy
showed no correlation with downstream performance.

*Daren Yao,Jinsong Yuan,Ruike Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces two lightweight variants of Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to improve alignment in small large language models (LLMs) under resource constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Small LLMs often struggle to align outputs to human preferences, particularly when faced with significant performance gaps. The study aims to address this challenge to improve practical deployment of these models.

Method: The authors propose two methods: Adaptive Margin-Sigmoid Loss and APO-hinge-zero. These methods use margin-based objectives and selective update mechanisms to improve alignment, focusing on hard-example mining and chosen-focused optimization.

Result: The APO-hinge-zero method improved metrics such as win rate by 2.0 points and length-controlled win rate by 1.4 points in AlpacaEval. It also demonstrated strong performance across various categories, excelling in STEM and Humanities tasks in MT-Bench.

Conclusion: Marginal adjustments to preference-based optimization objectives can significantly enhance small LLM alignment, making such models more viable under resource constraints.

Abstract: Small large language models (LLMs) often face difficulties in aligning output
to human preferences, particularly when operating under severe performance
gaps. In this work, we propose two lightweight DPO-based variants -- Adaptive
Margin-Sigmoid Loss and APO-hinge-zero -- to better address underperformance
scenarios by introducing margin-based objectives and selective update
mechanisms.
  Our APO-hinge-zero method, which combines hinge-induced hard-example mining
with the chosen-focused optimization of APO-zero, achieves strong results. In
AlpacaEval, APO-hinge-zero improves the win rate by +2.0 points and the
length-controlled win rate by +1.4 points compared to the APO-zero baseline. In
MT-Bench, our methods maintain competitive performance in diverse categories,
particularly excelling in STEM and Humanities tasks.
  These results demonstrate that simple modifications to preference-based
objectives can significantly enhance small LLM alignment under resource
constraints, offering a practical path toward more efficient deployment.

*Lorenzo Tomaz,Judd Rosenblatt,Thomas Berry Jones,Diogo Schwerz de Lucena*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper studies how internal states of large language models change during inference, identifying a conserved quantity akin to energy that aids interpretability and steering of model outputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate the internal mechanics of transformer models to improve interpretability, anomaly detection, and alignment with human intent.

Method: Analyzed token-to-token internal state changes across transformer models and derived the "log-Lagrangian" framework for control using Jacobian steering.

Result: Found conservation of an 'energy-like' quantity and demonstrated that Jacobian steering improved semantic quality of model outputs while maintaining constant energy.

Conclusion: Viewing transformers through a physics-inspired lens provides insights for better predictability, interpretability, and alignment of models' outputs with human intent.

Abstract: We take a physics-based approach to studying how the internal hidden states
of large language models change from token to token during inference. Across 20
open-source transformer models (135M-3B parameters), we find that a quantity
combining the rate of change in hidden states and the model's next-token
certainty, analogous to energy in physics, remains nearly constant.
Random-weight models conserve this "energy" more tightly than pre-trained ones,
while training shifts models into a faster, more decisive regime with greater
variability. Using this "log-Lagrangian" view, we derive a control method
called Jacobian steering, which perturbs hidden states in the minimal way
needed to favor a target token. This approach maintained near-constant energy
in two tested models and produced continuations rated higher in semantic
quality than the models' natural outputs. Viewing transformers through this
mechanics lens offers a principled basis for interpretability, anomaly
detection, and low-risk steering. This could help make powerful models more
predictable and aligned with human intent.

*Jadie Adams,Brian Hu,Emily Veenhuis,David Joy,Bharadwaj Ravichandran,Aaron Bray,Anthony Hoogs,Arslan Basharat*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a steerable model using few-shot comparative regression for pluralistic alignment of language models, addressing diverse user preferences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current alignment techniques like RLHF use scalar rewards that fail to reflect diverse user preferences, requiring more flexible methods for better alignment.

Method: The authors leverage in-context learning and reasoning grounded in fine-grained attributes, using few-shot comparative regression to adapt the model to diverse preferences.

Result: The approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods and provides new benchmarks (adapted MIC and HelpSteer2 datasets) for evaluating pluralistic alignment.

Conclusion: The method advances fair and representative alignment of LLMs, contributing to ethical AI and pluralistic value modeling.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are currently aligned using techniques such as
reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). However, these methods use
scalar rewards that can only reflect user preferences on average. Pluralistic
alignment instead seeks to capture diverse user preferences across a set of
attributes, moving beyond just helpfulness and harmlessness. Toward this end,
we propose a steerable pluralistic model based on few-shot comparative
regression that can adapt to individual user preferences. Our approach
leverages in-context learning and reasoning, grounded in a set of fine-grained
attributes, to compare response options and make aligned choices. To evaluate
our algorithm, we also propose two new steerable pluralistic benchmarks by
adapting the Moral Integrity Corpus (MIC) and the HelpSteer2 datasets,
demonstrating the applicability of our approach to value-aligned
decision-making and reward modeling, respectively. Our few-shot comparative
regression approach is interpretable and compatible with different attributes
and LLMs, while outperforming multiple baseline and state-of-the-art methods.
Our work provides new insights and research directions in pluralistic
alignment, enabling a more fair and representative use of LLMs and advancing
the state-of-the-art in ethical AI.

*Sameer Panwar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DeCAL is a method for tokenwise compression using pretrained encoder-decoder models, balancing compression quality with computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to create a high-quality compression method for language models that minimizes the computational burden of handling large representations without significantly sacrificing task performance.

Method: The method applies small modifications to a denoising-pretrained encoder-decoder language model, emphasizing compression quality over computational cost, and produces dense compressed token representations.

Result: DeCAL achieves up to 2x compression with equivalent performance to uncompressed models on tasks including question answering, summarization, and retrieval, with minor performance drops up to 8x compression.

Conclusion: DeCAL demonstrates the feasibility of creating high-quality compressed representations for language tasks and provides potential for resource savings in scenarios utilizing pre-computed dense data.

Abstract: This paper introduces DeCAL, a new method for tokenwise compression. DeCAL
uses an encoder-decoder language model pretrained with denoising to learn to
produce high-quality, general-purpose compressed representations by the
encoder. DeCAL applies small modifications to the encoder, with the emphasis on
maximizing compression quality, even at the expense of compute. We show that
DeCAL at 2x compression can match uncompressed on many downstream tasks, with
usually only minor dropoff in metrics up to 8x compression, among
question-answering, summarization, and multi-vector retrieval tasks. DeCAL
offers significant savings where pre-computed dense representations can be
utilized, and we believe the approach can be further developed to be more
broadly applicable.

TL;DR: DepressLLM leverages autobiographical narratives to interpretably predict depression, achieving high confidence and superior classification performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of depression prediction hindered by insufficient annotated datasets.

Method: A newly introduced corpus containing 3,699 autobiographical narratives was used to train DepressLLM. It utilizes the Score-guided Token Probability Summation (SToPS) module for improving classification accuracy and generating confidence estimates.

Result: DepressLLM achieved an AUC of 0.789, which improved to 0.904 for samples with confidence ≥ 0.95. It was validated on various datasets including EMA corpus and public clinical interview data.

Conclusion: The approach highlights the potential of interpretable AI in the early diagnosis of depression and suggests refinements based on a psychiatric review of misclassifications.

Abstract: Advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled a wide range of
applications. However, depression prediction is hindered by the lack of
large-scale, high-quality, and rigorously annotated datasets. This study
introduces DepressLLM, trained and evaluated on a novel corpus of 3,699
autobiographical narratives reflecting both happiness and distress. DepressLLM
provides interpretable depression predictions and, via its Score-guided Token
Probability Summation (SToPS) module, delivers both improved classification
performance and reliable confidence estimates, achieving an AUC of 0.789, which
rises to 0.904 on samples with confidence $\geq$ 0.95. To validate its
robustness to heterogeneous data, we evaluated DepressLLM on in-house datasets,
including an Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) corpus of daily stress and
mood recordings, and on public clinical interview data. Finally, a psychiatric
review of high-confidence misclassifications highlighted key model and data
limitations that suggest directions for future refinements. These findings
demonstrate that interpretable AI can enable earlier diagnosis of depression
and underscore the promise of medical AI in psychiatry.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper reviews advancements in Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) focusing on Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) for optimizing Retrieval-Augmented Generation systems in understanding Cantonese colloquial expressions under limited data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in linguistic variability and limited data for Cantonese, studying PEFT methods like LoRA to improve retrieval and generative tasks in RAG systems.

Method: Evaluates LoRA integration, benchmarks PEFT methods, explores domain adaptation strategies, and systematically analyzes LoRA variants, synthetic data use, and user feedback inclusion.

Result: Findings show dynamic and ensemble LoRA reduce trainable parameters while maintaining accuracy but struggle with preserving nuanced linguistic details in low-resource settings.

Conclusion: PEFT-enhanced RAG systems show potential in domain-specific tasks, but future work needs to focus on dialect authenticity, dynamic adaptation, and scalable fine-tuning solutions.

Abstract: This review examines recent advances in Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning
(PEFT), with a focus on Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), to optimize
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems like Qwen3, DeepSeek, and Kimi.
These systems face challenges in understanding and generating authentic
Cantonese colloquial expressions due to limited annotated data and linguistic
variability. The review evaluates the integration of LoRA within RAG
frameworks, benchmarks PEFT methods for retrieval and generation accuracy,
identify domain adaptation strategies under limited data, and compares
fine-tuning techniques aimed at improving semantic fidelity under data-scarce
conditions. A systematic analysis of recent studies employing diverse LoRA
variants, synthetic data generation, user feedback integration, and adaptive
parameter allocation was conducted to assess their impact on computational
efficiency, retrieval precision, linguistic authenticity, and scalability.
Findings reveal that dynamic and ensemble LoRA adaptations significantly reduce
trainable parameters without sacrificing retrieval accuracy and generation
quality in dialectal contexts. However, limitations remain in fully preserving
fine-grained linguistic nuances, especially for low-resource settings like
Cantonese. The integration of real-time user feedback and domain-specific data
remains underdeveloped, limiting model adaptability and personalization. While
selective parameter freezing and nonlinear adaptation methods offer better
trade-offs between efficiency and accuracy, their robustness at scale remains
an open challenge. This review highlights the promise of PEFT-enhanced RAG
systems for domain-specific language tasks and calls for future work targeting
dialectal authenticity, dynamic adaptation, and scalable fine-tuning pipelines.

TL;DR: This paper introduces InternBootcamp, an open-source framework for enhancing large language models (LLMs) in domain-diverse reasoning tasks, with features for automated task generation and evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recent advancements in reinforcement learning focus on narrow domains, leaving a gap in developing LLMs for diverse, real-world reasoning tasks. Cross-domain benchmarks are needed.

Method: The authors created InternBootcamp, which automates task generation and evaluation. It integrates with RL-based optimization and uses a scalable, automated agent workflow, supplemented by manual validations.

Result: The study shows LLMs' limitations in reasoning tasks but demonstrates significant performance improvements when models are trained using InternBootcamp. Their 32B model achieves state-of-the-art results on Bootcamp-EVAL.

Conclusion: InternBootcamp is an effective framework for advancing reasoning capabilities in LLMs, with its task-scaling methodology demonstrating great potential for creating generalist reasoning models.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized artificial intelligence by
enabling complex reasoning capabilities. While recent advancements in
reinforcement learning (RL) have primarily focused on domain-specific reasoning
tasks (e.g., mathematics or code generation), real-world reasoning scenarios
often require models to handle diverse and complex environments that
narrow-domain benchmarks cannot fully capture. To address this gap, we present
InternBootcamp, an open-source framework comprising 1000+ domain-diverse task
environments specifically designed for LLM reasoning research. Our codebase
offers two key functionalities: (1) automated generation of unlimited
training/testing cases with configurable difficulty levels, and (2) integrated
verification modules for objective response evaluation. These features make
InternBootcamp fundamental infrastructure for RL-based model optimization,
synthetic data generation, and model evaluation. Although manually developing
such a framework with enormous task coverage is extremely cumbersome, we
accelerate the development procedure through an automated agent workflow
supplemented by manual validation protocols, which enables the task scope to
expand rapidly. % With these bootcamps, we further establish Bootcamp-EVAL, an
automatically generated benchmark for comprehensive performance assessment.
Evaluation reveals that frontier models still underperform in many reasoning
tasks, while training with InternBootcamp provides an effective way to
significantly improve performance, leading to our 32B model that achieves
state-of-the-art results on Bootcamp-EVAL and excels on other established
benchmarks. In particular, we validate that consistent performance gains come
from including more training tasks, namely \textbf{task scaling}, over two
orders of magnitude, offering a promising route towards capable reasoning
generalist.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces IFRAgent, a framework for improving the intention alignment of mobile-use agents with human users by recognizing both explicit and implicit intention flows.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the limitation of existing mobile-use agents, which primarily focus on explicit human intention flows and neglect personal preferences, making personalized mobile-use agents difficult to achieve.

Method: The authors collect the MobileIAR dataset of human-intent-aligned actions before proposing IFRAgent. This framework uses human demonstrations to analyze intention flows and combines standard operating procedures (SOP) analysis, user habits, and query rewriting to improve alignment and understanding of human intent.

Result: Experimental tests show that IFRAgent improves human intention alignment rates by 32.06% and step completion rates by 26.34% compared to baseline methods.

Conclusion: IFRAgent successfully enhances the alignment between mobile-use agents and human intent. Its design and performance demonstrate significant improvements in both intention alignment and task step completion.

Abstract: As multimodal large language models advance rapidly, the automation of mobile
tasks has become increasingly feasible through the use of mobile-use agents
that mimic human interactions from graphical user interface. To further enhance
mobile-use agents, previous studies employ demonstration learning to improve
mobile-use agents from human demonstrations. However, these methods focus
solely on the explicit intention flows of humans (e.g., step sequences) while
neglecting implicit intention flows (e.g., personal preferences), which makes
it difficult to construct personalized mobile-use agents. In this work, to
evaluate the \textbf{I}ntention \textbf{A}lignment \textbf{R}ate between
mobile-use agents and humans, we first collect \textbf{MobileIAR}, a dataset
containing human-intent-aligned actions and ground-truth actions. This enables
a comprehensive assessment of the agents' understanding of human intent. Then
we propose \textbf{IFRAgent}, a framework built upon \textbf{I}ntention
\textbf{F}low \textbf{R}ecognition from human demonstrations. IFRAgent analyzes
explicit intention flows from human demonstrations to construct a query-level
vector library of standard operating procedures (SOP), and analyzes implicit
intention flows to build a user-level habit repository. IFRAgent then leverages
a SOP extractor combined with retrieval-augmented generation and a query
rewriter to generate personalized query and SOP from a raw ambiguous query,
enhancing the alignment between mobile-use agents and human intent.
Experimental results demonstrate that IFRAgent outperforms baselines by an
average of 6.79\% (32.06\% relative improvement) in human intention alignment
rate and improves step completion rates by an average of 5.30\% (26.34\%
relative improvement). The codes are available at

*Jakub Šmíd,Pavel Přibáň,Pavel Král*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper demonstrates that fine-tuned LLaMA-based models for ABSA outperform state-of-the-art results across several tasks and datasets but face challenges in zero-shot and few-shot scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate whether fine-tuned large language models (LLMs) can close the performance gap in ABSA tasks compared to existing fine-tuned models.

Method: Fine-tune open-source LLaMA-based large language models (LLMs) for sentiment analysis tasks and evaluate their performance on various datasets.

Result: The Orca~2 model exceeds state-of-the-art performance on four tasks and eight datasets but struggles in zero-shot and few-shot settings.

Conclusion: Fine-tuning enhances the utility of LLaMA-based models for ABSA tasks, yet these models require further improvement in generalized or few-shot applications.

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) show promise for various tasks, their
performance in compound aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) tasks lags
behind fine-tuned models. However, the potential of LLMs fine-tuned for ABSA
remains unexplored. This paper examines the capabilities of open-source LLMs
fine-tuned for ABSA, focusing on LLaMA-based models. We evaluate the
performance across four tasks and eight English datasets, finding that the
fine-tuned Orca~2 model surpasses state-of-the-art results in all tasks.
However, all models struggle in zero-shot and few-shot scenarios compared to
fully fine-tuned ones. Additionally, we conduct error analysis to identify
challenges faced by fine-tuned models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address cross-lingual emotion detection challenges, focusing on emotion classification and trigger word prediction tasks.

Method: They employ fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs) with LoRA, alongside multilingual models like XLM-R and mT5, incorporating machine translation and trigger word switching enhancements.

Result: Their system ranks 1st for numerical trigger word detection, 3rd for binary trigger words detection, and 7th for emotion detection.

Conclusion: The proposed methods effectively enhance multilingual emotion detection, showcasing competitive performance across the shared task's subtasks.

Abstract: This paper presents our system built for the WASSA-2024 Cross-lingual Emotion
Detection Shared Task. The task consists of two subtasks: first, to assess an
emotion label from six possible classes for a given tweet in one of five
languages, and second, to predict words triggering the detected emotions in
binary and numerical formats. Our proposed approach revolves around fine-tuning
quantized large language models, specifically Orca~2, with low-rank adapters
(LoRA) and multilingual Transformer-based models, such as XLM-R and mT5. We
enhance performance through machine translation for both subtasks and trigger
word switching for the second subtask. The system achieves excellent
performance, ranking 1st in numerical trigger words detection, 3rd in binary
trigger words detection, and 7th in emotion detection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance Czech aspect-based sentiment analysis and sentiment classification by overcoming limitations of traditional fine-tuning approaches.

Method: Using sequence-to-sequence models with prompt-based methods to address sentiment tasks, alongside zero-shot and few-shot learning experiments.

Result: Prompting outperforms traditional fine-tuning, especially in limited data scenarios, and pre-training on domain-specific data improves zero-shot performance.

Conclusion: Prompt-based approaches are effective for Czech sentiment analysis and achieve tangible benefits in low-resource settings.

Abstract: This paper introduces the first prompt-based methods for aspect-based
sentiment analysis and sentiment classification in Czech. We employ the
sequence-to-sequence models to solve the aspect-based tasks simultaneously and
demonstrate the superiority of our prompt-based approach over traditional
fine-tuning. In addition, we conduct zero-shot and few-shot learning
experiments for sentiment classification and show that prompting yields
significantly better results with limited training examples compared to
traditional fine-tuning. We also demonstrate that pre-training on data from the
target domain can lead to significant improvements in a zero-shot scenario.

*Rajmohan C,Sarthak Harne,Arvind Agarwal*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces an efficient system for Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate structured tables from unstructured text, utilizing novel prompting techniques and iterative self-feedback to enhance performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the challenges LLMs face in text-to-table generation, such as ambiguity, structural comprehension, handling long inputs, and numerical reasoning.

Method: The method employs novel prompting techniques involving task decomposition into manageable sub-tasks and iterative self-feedback for refining table generation.

Result: The proposed system shows improved table generation performance and achieves strong results when compared to baseline models on two publicly available datasets.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the effectiveness of task decomposition and iterative self-feedback for improving structured data generation, while discussing performance trade-offs and computational costs.

Abstract: Transforming unstructured text into structured data is a complex task,
requiring semantic understanding, reasoning, and structural comprehension.
While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer potential, they often struggle with
handling ambiguous or domain-specific data, maintaining table structure,
managing long inputs, and addressing numerical reasoning. This paper proposes
an efficient system for LLM-driven text-to-table generation that leverages
novel prompting techniques. Specifically, the system incorporates two key
strategies: breaking down the text-to-table task into manageable, guided
sub-tasks and refining the generated tables through iterative self-feedback. We
show that this custom task decomposition allows the model to address the
problem in a stepwise manner and improves the quality of the generated table.
Furthermore, we discuss the benefits and potential risks associated with
iterative self-feedback on the generated tables while highlighting the
trade-offs between enhanced performance and computational cost. Our methods
achieve strong results compared to baselines on two complex text-to-table
generation datasets available in the public domain.

### [77] [TopXGen: Topic-Diverse Parallel Data Generation for Low-Resource Machine Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08680)
*Armel Zebaze,Benoît Sagot,Rachel Bawden*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces \textsc{TopXGen}, an LLM-based approach to generate high-quality and diverse synthetic parallel data for low-resource languages (LRLs), improving in-context learning and fine-tuning translation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Low-resource languages (LRLs) suffer from limited improvements in machine translation performance due to inadequate parallel datasets. Existing techniques like backtranslation and fine-tuning are constrained by the availability of good quality target-side texts.

Method: \textsc{TopXGen} leverages large language models' (LLMs) ability to translate well into high-resource languages (HRLs) and their multilingual capabilities to generate natural, high-quality texts in multiple LRLs. These texts are then backtranslated to create diverse and effective parallel datasets.

Result: \textsc{TopXGen} enhances the quality of translation in LRLs during both fine-tuning and in-context learning compared to traditional methods.

Conclusion: The proposed approach demonstrates that LLMs, despite their difficulty translating into LRLs, can produce valuable synthetic parallel data, improving overall translation performance. Code is made available for public use to encourage further research.

Abstract: LLMs have been shown to perform well in machine translation (MT) with the use
of in-context learning (ICL), rivaling supervised models when translating into
high-resource languages (HRLs). However, they lag behind when translating into
low-resource language (LRLs). Example selection via similarity search and
supervised fine-tuning help. However the improvements they give are limited by
the size, quality and diversity of existing parallel datasets. A common
technique in low-resource MT is synthetic parallel data creation, the most
frequent of which is backtranslation, whereby existing target-side texts are
automatically translated into the source language. However, this assumes the
existence of good quality and relevant target-side texts, which are not readily
available for many LRLs. In this paper, we present \textsc{TopXGen}, an
LLM-based approach for the generation of high quality and topic-diverse data in
multiple LRLs, which can then be backtranslated to produce useful and diverse
parallel texts for ICL and fine-tuning. Our intuition is that while LLMs
struggle to translate into LRLs, their ability to translate well into HRLs and
their multilinguality enable them to generate good quality, natural-sounding
target-side texts, which can be translated well into a high-resource source
language. We show that \textsc{TopXGen} boosts LLM translation performance
during fine-tuning and in-context learning. Code and outputs are available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study evaluates ASR models for older Dutch adults interacting with a chatbot and finds that generic multilingual models outperform fine-tuned ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of reliable ASR for underrepresented groups like older adults in clinical contexts.

Method: State-of-the-art ASR models were benchmarked, including multilingual ones and those fine-tuned for older adult Dutch speakers, while also evaluating processing speed.

Result: Generic multilingual models generalized better to realistic datasets, balancing accuracy and processing speed with some issues of hallucinations.

Conclusion: Modern multilingual ASR models are viable for applications in underrepresented demographics, but further work is needed to handle specific issues like high WER in certain cases.

Abstract: Voice-controlled interfaces can support older adults in clinical contexts,
with chatbots being a prime example, but reliable Automatic Speech Recognition
(ASR) for underrepresented groups remains a bottleneck. This study evaluates
state-of-the-art ASR models on language use of older Dutch adults, who
interacted with the Welzijn.AI chatbot designed for geriatric contexts. We
benchmark generic multilingual ASR models, and models fine-tuned for Dutch
spoken by older adults, while also considering processing speed. Our results
show that generic multilingual models outperform fine-tuned models, which
suggests recent ASR models can generalise well out of the box to realistic
datasets. Furthermore, our results suggest that truncating existing
architectures is helpful in balancing the accuracy-speed trade-off, though we
also identify some cases with high WER due to hallucinations.

### [79] [IROTE: Human-like Traits Elicitation of Large Language Model via In-Context Self-Reflective Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08719)
*Yuzhuo Bai,Shitong Duan,Muhua Huang,Jing Yao,Zhenghao Liu,Peng Zhang,Tun Lu,Xiaoyuan Yi,Maosong Sun,Xing Xie*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: IROTE is a novel method enabling stable and transferable human-trait elicitation in large language models (LLMs) using optimized self-reflections.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM methods inadequately mimic human traits, presenting superficial and unstable results across tasks.

Method: IROTE uses psychological theories of identity-related reflection to generate and optimize textual self-reflections within prompts. Optimization relies on an information-theoretic objective without fine-tuning.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate stable impersonation of human traits across tasks using a single generated self-reflection, outperforming baselines.

Conclusion: IROTE provides a robust approach for inducing consistent human-like traits in LLMs, improving their adaptability in various applications.

Abstract: Trained on various human-authored corpora, Large Language Models (LLMs) have
demonstrated a certain capability of reflecting specific human-like traits
(e.g., personality or values) by prompting, benefiting applications like
personalized LLMs and social simulations. However, existing methods suffer from
the superficial elicitation problem: LLMs can only be steered to mimic shallow
and unstable stylistic patterns, failing to embody the desired traits precisely
and consistently across diverse tasks like humans. To address this challenge,
we propose IROTE, a novel in-context method for stable and transferable trait
elicitation. Drawing on psychological theories suggesting that traits are
formed through identity-related reflection, our method automatically generates
and optimizes a textual self-reflection within prompts, which comprises
self-perceived experience, to stimulate LLMs' trait-driven behavior. The
optimization is performed by iteratively maximizing an information-theoretic
objective that enhances the connections between LLMs' behavior and the target
trait, while reducing noisy redundancy in reflection without any fine-tuning,
leading to evocative and compact trait reflection. Extensive experiments across
three human trait systems manifest that one single IROTE-generated
self-reflection can induce LLMs' stable impersonation of the target trait
across diverse downstream tasks beyond simple questionnaire answering,
consistently outperforming existing strong baselines.

*Weibin Liao,Tianlong Wang,Yinghao Zhu,Yasha Wang,Junyi Gao,Liantao Ma*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses the limitations of standard LoRA in medical lay language generation (MLLG) for handling multi-source heterogeneous datasets, proposing an asymmetric architecture called Magical to improve semantic fidelity and diversity in generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To make complex medical content accessible to broader audiences through MLLG, overcoming challenges like semantic fidelity and diverse lay-style generation in heterogeneous datasets.

Method: The authors propose Magical, an asymmetric LoRA architecture with a shared matrix for summarization and isolated matrices for diverse language generation, along with a Semantic Invariance Constraint and a Recommendation-guided Switch.

Result: Experimental evaluation shows Magical consistently outperforms prompt-based methods, vanilla LoRA, and variants in semantic and style fidelity while reducing trainable parameters by 31.66%.

Conclusion: Magical offers an effective and efficient solution for MLLG tasks under heterogeneous data scenarios, improving both semantic understanding and style diversity in lay-language generation.

Abstract: Medical Lay Language Generation (MLLG) plays a vital role in improving the
accessibility of complex scientific content for broader audiences. Recent
literature to MLLG commonly employ parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods such
as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) using
paired expert-lay language datasets. However, LoRA struggles with the
challenges posed by multi-source heterogeneous MLLG datasets. Specifically,
through a series of exploratory experiments, we reveal that standard LoRA fail
to meet the requirement for semantic fidelity and diverse lay-style generation
in MLLG task. To address these limitations, we propose Magical, an asymmetric
LoRA architecture tailored for MLLG under heterogeneous data scenarios. Magical
employs a shared matrix $A$ for abstractive summarization, along with multiple
isolated matrices $B$ for diverse lay-style generation. To preserve semantic
fidelity during the lay language generation process, Magical introduces a
Semantic Invariance Constraint to mitigate semantic subspace shifts on matrix
$A$. Furthermore, to better adapt to diverse lay-style generation, Magical
incorporates the Recommendation-guided Switch, an externally interface to
prompt the LLM to switch between different matrices $B$. Experimental results
on three real-world lay language generation datasets demonstrate that Magical
consistently outperforms prompt-based methods, vanilla LoRA, and its recent
variants, while also reducing trainable parameters by 31.66%.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces SciRerankBench, a benchmark to evaluate the performance of rerankers within Retrieval-Augmented Generated Large Language Models (RAG-LLMs) in answering scientific literature questions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scientific question answering depends heavily on correctly identifying relevant scientific contexts, especially as scientific terminology may vary subtly but significantly. Existing RAG-LLMs show promise but lack systematic tools to assess their reranking mechanisms within scientific domains.

Method: The authors propose SciRerankBench, a benchmark spanning five scientific subjects. They developed three types of test sets - Noisy Contexts (NC), Semantically Similar but Logically Irrelevant Contexts (SSLI), and Counterfactual Contexts (CC), and evaluated 13 rerankers and five categories of LLMs for systematic analysis.

Result: The evaluation demonstrated reranker performance variations concerning resilience to noise, context relevance, and factual consistency. It also pointed out the strengths and weaknesses of 13 rerankers across different scientific question categories.

Conclusion: SciRerankBench is the first benchmark specifically designed to evaluate rerankers in RAG-LLMs for scientific domains, presenting insights that can aid the improvement of reranking strategies and contribute to future advancements in scientific question answering.

Abstract: Scientific literature question answering is a pivotal step towards new
scientific discoveries. Recently, \textit{two-stage} retrieval-augmented
generated large language models (RAG-LLMs) have shown impressive advancements
in this domain. Such a two-stage framework, especially the second stage
(reranker), is particularly essential in the scientific domain, where subtle
differences in terminology may have a greatly negative impact on the final
factual-oriented or knowledge-intensive answers. Despite this significant
progress, the potential and limitations of these works remain unexplored. In
this work, we present a Scientific Rerank-oriented RAG Benchmark
(SciRerankBench), for evaluating rerankers within RAG-LLMs systems, spanning
five scientific subjects. To rigorously assess the reranker performance in
terms of noise resilience, relevance disambiguation, and factual consistency,
we develop three types of question-context-answer (Q-C-A) pairs, i.e., Noisy
Contexts (NC), Semantically Similar but Logically Irrelevant Contexts (SSLI),
and Counterfactual Contexts (CC). Through systematic evaluation of 13 widely
used rerankers on five families of LLMs, we provide detailed insights into
their relative strengths and limitations. To the best of our knowledge,
SciRerankBench is the first benchmark specifically developed to evaluate
rerankers within RAG-LLMs, which provides valuable observations and guidance
for their future development.

*Stavros Doropoulos,Stavros Vologiannidis,Ioannis Magnisalis*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper presents DevNous, an LLM-based multi-agent system that automates IT governance processes by translating unstructured team dialogues into structured artifacts, achieving promising benchmark results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual translation of unstructured team dialogues into structured IT governance artifacts is time-consuming and a bottleneck in modern systems.

Method: DevNous uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to identify intents in team chats and manage structured workflows for administering tasks. The approach is validated through a benchmark dataset of conversational turns.

Result: DevNous achieves an 81.3% exact match turn accuracy and a multiset F1-score of 0.845 on the newly introduced benchmark dataset.

Conclusion: The study introduces an effective architectural framework for ambient administrative agents and provides an empirical benchmark for future research in automating unstructured-to-structured dialogue translation.

Abstract: The manual translation of unstructured team dialogue into the structured
artifacts required for Information Technology (IT) project governance is a
critical bottleneck in modern information systems management. We introduce
DevNous, a Large Language Model-based (LLM) multi-agent expert system, to
automate this unstructured-to-structured translation process. DevNous
integrates directly into team chat environments, identifying actionable intents
from informal dialogue and managing stateful, multi-turn workflows for core
administrative tasks like automated task formalization and progress summary
synthesis. To quantitatively evaluate the system, we introduce a new benchmark
of 160 realistic, interactive conversational turns. The dataset was manually
annotated with a multi-label ground truth and is publicly available. On this
benchmark, DevNous achieves an exact match turn accuracy of 81.3\% and a
multiset F1-Score of 0.845, providing strong evidence for its viability. The
primary contributions of this work are twofold: (1) a validated architectural
pattern for developing ambient administrative agents, and (2) the introduction
of the first robust empirical baseline and public benchmark dataset for this
challenging problem domain.

*Yunfeng Ning,Mayi Xu,Jintao Wen,Qiankun Pi,Yuanyuan Zhu,Ming Zhong,Jiawei Jiang,Tieyun Qian*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses privacy risks in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems using private Knowledge Graphs (KGs) by introducing the ARoG framework, overcoming challenges from entity anonymity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle privacy risks when using private KGs in RAG systems while maintaining retrieval performance despite anonymized entities.

Method: Proposes the ARoG framework with two strategies: relation-centric abstraction for supplementing entity semantics, and structure-oriented abstraction to align question paths with concepts in KGs.

Result: Experiments show that ARoG achieves high retrieval performance while ensuring privacy robustness on three datasets.

Conclusion: ARoG successfully balances privacy protection in RAG systems while optimizing knowledge retrieval, addressing key challenges posed by anonymized entities in KGs.

Abstract: LLMs often suffer from hallucinations and outdated or incomplete knowledge.
RAG is proposed to address these issues by integrating external knowledge like
that in KGs into LLMs. However, leveraging private KGs in RAG systems poses
significant privacy risks due to the black-box nature of LLMs and potential
insecure data transmission, especially when using third-party LLM APIs lacking
transparency and control. In this paper, we investigate the privacy-protected
RAG scenario for the first time, where entities in KGs are anonymous for LLMs,
thus preventing them from accessing entity semantics. Due to the loss of
semantics of entities, previous RAG systems cannot retrieve question-relevant
knowledge from KGs by matching questions with the meaningless identifiers of
anonymous entities. To realize an effective RAG system in this scenario, two
key challenges must be addressed: (1) How can anonymous entities be converted
into retrievable information. (2) How to retrieve question-relevant anonymous
entities. Hence, we propose a novel ARoG framework including relation-centric
abstraction and structure-oriented abstraction strategies. For challenge (1),
the first strategy abstracts entities into high-level concepts by dynamically
capturing the semantics of their adjacent relations. It supplements meaningful
semantics which can further support the retrieval process. For challenge (2),
the second strategy transforms unstructured natural language questions into
structured abstract concept paths. These paths can be more effectively aligned
with the abstracted concepts in KGs, thereby improving retrieval performance.
To guide LLMs to effectively retrieve knowledge from KGs, the two strategies
strictly protect privacy from being exposed to LLMs. Experiments on three
datasets demonstrate that ARoG achieves strong performance and
privacy-robustness.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposed a reinforcement learning framework for tool use in large language models, overcoming obstacles in training environment stability and reward mechanism design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of efficient RL frameworks for enabling effective tool use in LLMs, necessary for meaningful interactions with their environment.

Method: Develop an automated environment pipeline, verifiable reward mechanism, and integrate with RL algorithms to enhance tool-use performance.

Result: Experiments show significant improvements in tool-use performance of LLMs without degrading general capabilities, evident across varying model scales.

Conclusion: Improved tool-use stems from enhanced context understanding and reasoning, facilitated by updates in the models' lower-layer parameters.

Abstract: Effective tool use is essential for large language models (LLMs) to interact
meaningfully with their environment. However, progress is limited by the lack
of efficient reinforcement learning (RL) frameworks specifically designed for
tool use, due to challenges in constructing stable training environments and
designing verifiable reward mechanisms. To address this, we propose an
automated environment construction pipeline, incorporating scenario
decomposition, document generation, function integration, complexity scaling,
and localized deployment. This enables the creation of high-quality training
environments that provide detailed and measurable feedback without relying on
external tools. Additionally, we introduce a verifiable reward mechanism that
evaluates both the precision of tool use and the completeness of task
execution. When combined with trajectory data collected from the constructed
environments, this mechanism integrates seamlessly with standard RL algorithms
to facilitate feedback-driven model training. Experiments on LLMs of varying
scales demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances the models'
tool-use performance without degrading their general capabilities, regardless
of inference modes or training algorithms. Our analysis suggests that these
gains result from improved context understanding and reasoning, driven by
updates to the lower-layer MLP parameters in models.

*Robin Faro,Dongyang Fan,Tamar Alphaidze,Martin Jaggi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a modular approach for training large language models (LLMs) to address knowledge staleness and temporal leakage by using time-segmented pre-training and causal routing with TiMoE.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To mitigate the problem of temporal leakage in LLMs, where models use information from the future relative to a query, and to ensure models stay chronologically reliable without degrading overall performance.

Method: Researchers segmented the corpus into disjoint two-year slices and trained GPT-style experts on each slice. They introduced TiMoE, a Time-aware Mixture of Language Experts framework, which masks experts trained on future data relative to a query and combines the rest to produce predictions.

Result: Tests on eight NLP tasks and the newly created TSQA benchmark reveal that the TiMoE framework matches or surpasses the best GPT-style experts trained on single-period data, cutting future-knowledge errors by up to 15%.

Conclusion: The modular, time-segmented pre-training paired with TiMoE causal routing is an efficient approach for maintaining chronological grounding in LLMs while preserving general model performance. The work provides a path toward more reliable knowledge representation in time-sensitive contexts.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are typically trained on fixed snapshots of the
web, which means that their knowledge becomes stale and their predictions risk
temporal leakage: relying on information that lies in the future relative to a
query. We tackle this problem by pre-training from scratch a set of GPT-style
experts on disjoint two-year slices of a 2013-2024 corpus and combining them
through TiMoE, a Time-aware Mixture of Language Experts. At inference time,
TiMoE masks all experts whose training window ends after the query timestamp
and merges the remaining log-probabilities in a shared space, guaranteeing
strict causal validity while retaining the breadth of multi-period knowledge.
We also release TSQA, a 10k-question benchmark whose alternatives are
explicitly labelled as past, future or irrelevant, allowing fine-grained
measurement of temporal hallucinations. Experiments on eight standard NLP tasks
plus TSQA show that a co-adapted TiMoE variant matches or exceeds the best
single-period expert and cuts future-knowledge errors by up to 15%. Our results
demonstrate that modular, time-segmented pre-training paired with causal
routing is a simple yet effective path toward LLMs that stay chronologically
grounded without sacrificing general performance much. We open source our code
at TiMoE (Github): https://github.com/epfml/TiMoE

*Yuren Hao,Xiang Wan,Chengxiang Zhai*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The authors propose a framework to evaluate large language models (LLMs) on their mathematical reasoning robustness by testing them on equivalent math problems with variations, creating a benchmark (PutnamGAP) to assess their resilience to linguistic and parametric changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the current limitations in evaluating the sensitivity and robustness of LLMs' mathematical reasoning by exposing them to perturbations that do not alter the underlying mathematical structure.

Method: Developed a new evaluation methodology involving mathematically equivalent problems with linguistic and parameter-based variations. Created the PutnamGAP benchmark dataset to test these variations across multiple LLMs.

Result: Performance of 18 LLMs, including OpenAI's O3 model (which showed significant drops in accuracy on perturbed versions of problems), demonstrated a clear vulnerability to non-mathematical perturbations.

Conclusion: The proposed evaluation framework and benchmark effectively reveal gaps in the robustness of LLMs' mathematical reasoning and offer insights for enhancing their capabilities.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a systematic framework beyond conventional method
to assess LLMs' mathematical-reasoning robustness by stress-testing them on
advanced math problems that are mathematically equivalent but with linguistic
and parametric variation. These transformations allow us to measure the
sensitivity of LLMs to non-mathematical perturbations, thereby enabling a more
accurate evaluation of their mathematical reasoning capabilities. Using this
new evaluation methodology, we created PutnamGAP, a new benchmark dataset with
multiple mathematically-equivalent variations of competition-level math
problems. With the new dataset, we evaluate multiple families of representative
LLMs and examine their robustness. Across 18 commercial and open-source models
we observe sharp performance degradation on the variants. OpenAI's flagship
reasoning model, O3, scores 49 % on the originals but drops by 4 percentage
points on surface variants, and by 10.5 percentage points on core-step-based
variants, while smaller models fare far worse. Overall, the results show that
the proposed new evaluation methodology is effective for deepening our
understanding of the robustness of LLMs and generating new insights for further
improving their mathematical reasoning capabilities.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents a framework to analyze and address ideological biases, such as political biases, in large language models (LLMs) by examining internal model representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There are ongoing concerns about LLMs embodying and perpetuating ideological biases, especially on political and economic dimensions, despite their growing usage in real-world applications.

Method: The authors use the Political Compass Test framework and contrastive pairs to analyze internal hidden layer activations in LLMs like Mistral and DeepSeek. They introduce a pipeline for layer-wise evaluations and explore representational biases for mitigation via steering vectors.

Result: The study finds that decoder LLMs systematically encode political biases in their representations across layers, which can be exploited to mitigate biases effectively using targeted interventions.

Conclusion: The paper highlights the presence of encoded political biases in LLMs and proposes a principled, representation-level approach to debiasing that goes beyond mere surface-level fixes.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have enabled their
widespread use across diverse real-world applications. However, concerns remain
about their tendency to encode and reproduce ideological biases, particularly
along political and economic dimensions. In this paper, we propose a framework
for probing and mitigating such biases in decoder-based LLMs through analysis
of internal model representations. Grounded in the Political Compass Test
(PCT), our method uses contrastive pairs to extract and compare hidden layer
activations from models like Mistral and DeepSeek. We introduce a comprehensive
activation extraction pipeline capable of layer-wise analysis across multiple
ideological axes, revealing meaningful disparities linked to political framing.
Our results show that decoder LLMs systematically encode representational bias
across layers, which can be leveraged for effective steering vector-based
mitigation. This work provides new insights into how political bias is encoded
in LLMs and offers a principled approach to debiasing beyond surface-level
output interventions.

*Sekh Mainul Islam,Nadav Borenstein,Siddhesh Milind Pawar,Haeun Yu,Arnav Arora,Isabelle Augenstein*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces BiasGym, a framework for injecting, analyzing, and mitigating biases in Large Language Models (LLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically understand and mitigate biases encoded in LLMs, which are difficult to isolate and analyze.

Method: BiasGym consists of two components: BiasInject (to introduce specific biases) and BiasScope (to identify and mitigate biased behavior), leveraging token-based fine-tuning with a frozen model.

Result: BiasGym effectively reduces biases and stereotypes in LLMs while maintaining their performance on unrelated tasks. It works for both real-world and fictional associations.

Conclusion: BiasGym is a generalizable and reliable framework for bias elicitation, analysis, and mitigation, supporting safety interventions and furthering interpretability research.

Abstract: Understanding biases and stereotypes encoded in the weights of Large Language
Models (LLMs) is crucial for developing effective mitigation strategies. Biased
behaviour is often subtle and non-trivial to isolate, even when deliberately
elicited, making systematic analysis and debiasing particularly challenging. To
address this, we introduce BiasGym, a simple, cost-effective, and generalizable
framework for reliably injecting, analyzing, and mitigating conceptual
associations within LLMs. BiasGym consists of two components: BiasInject, which
injects specific biases into the model via token-based fine-tuning while
keeping the model frozen, and BiasScope, which leverages these injected signals
to identify and steer the components responsible for biased behavior. Our
method enables consistent bias elicitation for mechanistic analysis, supports
targeted debiasing without degrading performance on downstream tasks, and
generalizes to biases unseen during training. We demonstrate the effectiveness
of BiasGym in reducing real-world stereotypes (e.g., people from a country
being `reckless drivers') and in probing fictional associations (e.g., people
from a country having `blue skin'), showing its utility for both safety
interventions and interpretability research.

*Kaiyu Wang,Lin Mu,Zhiyao Yang,Ximing Li,Xiaotang Zhou Wanfu Gao,Huimao Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces Sqator, a method for automated quality assurance (QA) scoring of radiology reports.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce labor costs and address inaccuracies in QA scoring of radiology reports, which currently rely on senior doctors’ manual judgments.

Method: Proposed Sqator, which evaluates QA scores by analyzing semantic differences using fine-grained text span revisions between junior and senior doctor reports.

Result: Sqator demonstrated competitive QA scoring performance on 12,013 radiology reports, with span importance scores aligning closely with senior doctors’ judgments.

Conclusion: Sqator offers a viable automated solution for QA in radiology reporting, reducing dependence on labor-intensive and potentially biased manual evaluations.

Abstract: Quality Assurance (QA) for radiology reports refers to judging whether the
junior reports (written by junior doctors) are qualified. The QA scores of one
junior report are given by the senior doctor(s) after reviewing the image and
junior report. This process requires intensive labor costs for senior doctors.
Additionally, the QA scores may be inaccurate for reasons like diagnosis bias,
the ability of senior doctors, and so on. To address this issue, we propose a
Span-level Quality Assurance EvaluaTOR (Sqator) to mark QA scores
automatically. Unlike the common document-level semantic comparison method, we
try to analyze the semantic difference by exploring more fine-grained text
spans. Unlike the common document-level semantic comparison method, we try to
analyze the semantic difference by exploring more fine-grained text spans.
Specifically, Sqator measures QA scores by measuring the importance of revised
spans between junior and senior reports, and outputs the final QA scores by
merging all revised span scores. We evaluate Sqator using a collection of
12,013 radiology reports. Experimental results show that Sqator can achieve
competitive QA scores. Moreover, the importance scores of revised spans can be
also consistent with the judgments of senior doctors.

### [90] [Entangled in Representations: Mechanistic Investigation of Cultural Biases in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08879)
*Haeun Yu,Seogyeong Jeong,Siddhesh Pawar,Jisu Shin,Jiho Jin,Junho Myung,Alice Oh,Isabelle Augenstein*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Culturescope, a mechanistic method to analyze cultural biases in large language models, revealing tendencies like Western-dominance bias and cultural flattening.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Growing deployment of LLMs across diverse cultures requires understanding their often biased cultural representation.

Method: Culturescope uses patching to probe internal representations of LLMs and introduces a cultural flattening score for bias measurement.

Result: Experiments show LLMs encode Western-dominance bias and cultural flattening, with low-resource cultures being less affected due to insufficient training data.

Conclusion: Findings emphasize the need for enhancing LLMs' cultural understanding and mitigating innate biases in their knowledge space.

Abstract: The growing deployment of large language models (LLMs) across diverse
cultural contexts necessitates a better understanding of how the
overgeneralization of less documented cultures within LLMs' representations
impacts their cultural understanding. Prior work only performs extrinsic
evaluation of LLMs' cultural competence, without accounting for how LLMs'
internal mechanisms lead to cultural (mis)representation. To bridge this gap,
we propose Culturescope, the first mechanistic interpretability-based method
that probes the internal representations of LLMs to elicit the underlying
cultural knowledge space. CultureScope utilizes a patching method to extract
the cultural knowledge. We introduce a cultural flattening score as a measure
of the intrinsic cultural biases. Additionally, we study how LLMs internalize
Western-dominance bias and cultural flattening, which allows us to trace how
cultural biases emerge within LLMs. Our experimental results reveal that LLMs
encode Western-dominance bias and cultural flattening in their cultural
knowledge space. We find that low-resource cultures are less susceptible to
cultural biases, likely due to their limited training resources. Our work
provides a foundation for future research on mitigating cultural biases and
enhancing LLMs' cultural understanding. Our codes and data used for experiments
are publicly available.

### [91] [ASPD: Unlocking Adaptive Serial-Parallel Decoding by Exploring Intrinsic Parallelism in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08895)
*Keyu Chen,Zhifeng Shen,Daohai Yu,Haoqian Wu,Wei Wen,Jianfeng He,Ruizhi Qiao,Xing Sun*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces Adaptive Serial-Parallel Decoding (ASPD) for faster inference in large language models (LLMs), demonstrating substantial speed improvements without sacrificing accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the high inference latency in large language models caused by the sequential nature of autoregressive decoding, seeking to exploit inherent parallelism in model outputs.

Method: The authors propose ASPD, a non-invasive pipeline that identifies parallelizable structures in model outputs and enables a seamless transition between serial and parallel decoding modes using a Hybrid Decoding Engine.

Result: ASPD achieves up to 3.19x speedups (average 1.85x) on evaluations like Vicuna Bench, with a response quality difference of less than 1%, significantly enhancing inference speed without affecting output quality.

Conclusion: ASPD sets a new benchmark for efficient LLM inference, offering a practical and high-performing solution for latency-sensitive applications like AI bots and retrieval engines.

Abstract: The increasing scale and complexity of large language models (LLMs) pose
significant inference latency challenges, primarily due to their autoregressive
decoding paradigm characterized by the sequential nature of next-token
prediction. By re-examining the outputs of autoregressive models, we observed
that some segments exhibit parallelizable structures, which we term intrinsic
parallelism. Decoding each parallelizable branch simultaneously (i.e. parallel
decoding) can significantly improve the overall inference speed of LLMs. In
this paper, we propose an Adaptive Serial-Parallel Decoding (ASPD), which
addresses two core challenges: automated construction of parallelizable data
and efficient parallel decoding mechanism. More specifically, we introduce a
non-invasive pipeline that automatically extracts and validates parallelizable
structures from the responses of autoregressive models. To empower efficient
adaptive serial-parallel decoding, we implement a Hybrid Decoding Engine which
enables seamless transitions between serial and parallel decoding modes while
maintaining a reusable KV cache, maximizing computational efficiency. Extensive
evaluations across General Tasks, Retrieval-Augmented Generation, Mathematical
Reasoning, demonstrate that ASPD achieves unprecedented performance in both
effectiveness and efficiency. Notably, on Vicuna Bench, our method achieves up
to 3.19x speedup (1.85x on average) while maintaining response quality within
1% difference compared to autoregressive models, realizing significant
acceleration without compromising generation quality. Our framework sets a
groundbreaking benchmark for efficient LLM parallel inference, paving the way
for its deployment in latency-sensitive applications such as AI-powered
customer service bots and answer retrieval engines.

### [92] [Munsit at NADI 2025 Shared Task 2: Pushing the Boundaries of Multidialectal Arabic ASR with Weakly Supervised Pretraining and Continual Supervised Fine-tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08912)
*Mahmoud Salhab,Shameed Sait,Mohammad Abusheikh,Hasan Abusheikh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes a training pipeline using weak supervision and supervised fine-tuning to develop a state-of-the-art Arabic ASR system.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of accurate Arabic ASR development amidst limited labeled data and linguistic diversity caused by dialects.

Method: The authors pretrain on 15,000 hours of weakly labeled speech from various dialects and later fine-tune the model using a mix of filtered weakly labeled data and high-quality annotated samples.

Result: The approach secures first place in the multi-dialectal Arabic ASR challenge, setting a benchmark for low-resource language ASR.

Conclusion: Weak supervision coupled with fine-tuning effectively overcomes data scarcity, enabling robust performance in dialect-rich, low-resource languages.

Abstract: Automatic speech recognition (ASR) plays a vital role in enabling natural
human-machine interaction across applications such as virtual assistants,
industrial automation, customer support, and real-time transcription. However,
developing accurate ASR systems for low-resource languages like Arabic remains
a significant challenge due to limited labeled data and the linguistic
complexity introduced by diverse dialects. In this work, we present a scalable
training pipeline that combines weakly supervised learning with supervised
fine-tuning to develop a robust Arabic ASR model. In the first stage, we
pretrain the model on 15,000 hours of weakly labeled speech covering both
Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) and various Dialectal Arabic (DA) variants. In the
subsequent stage, we perform continual supervised fine-tuning using a mixture
of filtered weakly labeled data and a small, high-quality annotated dataset.
Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results, ranking first in the
multi-dialectal Arabic ASR challenge. These findings highlight the
effectiveness of weak supervision paired with fine-tuning in overcoming data
scarcity and delivering high-quality ASR for low-resource, dialect-rich
languages.

*Khondoker Ittehadul Islam,Gabriele Sarti*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper evaluates multilingual language models on a new Bangla multi-step reasoning dataset and highlights challenges in using Bangla reasoning steps effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess how multilingual language models perform on multi-step reasoning tasks in a low-resource language like Bangla and to address the limited evaluation of these models outside high-resource languages like English.

Method: A Bangla multi-step reasoning dataset was manually translated from the English Reveal dataset. The authors performed controlled evaluations of multilingual language models on this dataset, comparing their performance on binary and non-binary questions.

Result: Models showed difficulty effectively using Bangla reasoning for non-binary questions, despite reasoning context being helpful for challenging questions across languages.

Conclusion: The study sheds light on variations in reasoning capabilities across languages and emphasizes the challenges multilingual models face in utilizing reasoning steps in low-resource languages like Bangla.

Abstract: Language models have demonstrated remarkable performance on complex
multi-step reasoning tasks. However, their evaluation has been predominantly
confined to high-resource languages such as English. In this paper, we
introduce a manually translated Bangla multi-step reasoning dataset derived
from the English Reveal dataset, featuring both binary and non-binary question
types. We conduct a controlled evaluation of English-centric and Bangla-centric
multilingual small language models on the original dataset and our translated
version to compare their ability to exploit relevant reasoning steps to produce
correct answers. Our results show that, in comparable settings, reasoning
context is beneficial for more challenging non-binary questions, but models
struggle to employ relevant Bangla reasoning steps effectively. We conclude by
exploring how reasoning steps contribute to models' predictions, highlighting
different trends across models and languages.

*Hasan Abed Al Kader Hammoud,Kumail Alhamoud,Abed Hammoud,Elie Bou-Zeid,Marzyeh Ghassemi,Bernard Ghanem*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a curriculum learning method using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) that progressively reduces token budgets during training for reasoning tasks, achieving better accuracy and token efficiency compared to fixed-length approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches use fixed-length token budgets for reasoning tasks, which limit models' ability to adapt and transition naturally from exploration to concise reasoning during the training process.

Method: A curriculum learning strategy using GRPO, where token budgets start generously and are gradually reduced. The method balances three reward signals during training: task correctness, token efficiency, and formatting adherence.

Result: The proposed strategy consistently outperforms fixed-budget baselines across datasets like GSM8K and MATH500, showing higher accuracy and improved reasoning token efficiency.

Conclusion: Gradually tightening token budgets during training acts as an effective inductive bias, leading to efficient reasoning models. The released code and checkpoints support reproducibility and extendability.

Abstract: Recent work on enhancing the reasoning abilities of large language models
(LLMs) has introduced explicit length control as a means of constraining
computational cost while preserving accuracy. However, existing approaches rely
on fixed-length training budgets, which do not take advantage of the natural
progression from exploration to compression during learning. In this work, we
propose a curriculum learning strategy for length-controlled reasoning using
Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Our method starts with generous
token budgets and gradually tightens them over training, encouraging models to
first discover effective solution strategies and then distill them into more
concise reasoning traces. We augment GRPO with a reward function that balances
three signals: task correctness (via verifier feedback), length efficiency, and
formatting adherence (via structural tags). Experiments on GSM8K, MATH500,
SVAMP, College Math, and GSM+ demonstrate that curriculum-based training
consistently outperforms fixed-budget baselines at the same final budget,
achieving higher accuracy and significantly improved token efficiency. We
further ablate the impact of reward weighting and decay schedule design,
showing that progressive constraint serves as a powerful inductive bias for
training efficient reasoning models. Our code and checkpoints are released at:

### [95] [Jointly Generating and Attributing Answers using Logits of Document-Identifier Tokens](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08942)
*Lucas Albarede,Jose Moreno,Lynda Tamine,Luce Lefeuvre*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces LoDIT, a method to improve answer faithfulness and attribution in LLMs by jointly generating and attributing answers, surpassing state-of-the-art models in trustworthiness-focused benchmarks while maintaining efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Language Models (LLMs) suffer from hallucinations, affecting their trustworthiness. Existing methods either focus on answer correctness or struggle to align token generation with attribution generation effectively.

Method: LoDIT works in two steps: (1) marks documents with specific token identifiers and uses token logits to estimate document contributions during answer generation, and (2) aggregates these contributions into document attributions.

Result: LoDIT outperforms state-of-the-art models on a trustworthiness-focused benchmark called Trust-Align and is shown to be efficient in latency and robust in various settings.

Conclusion: LoDIT enhances faithfulness in LLMs during answer generation, showing significant improvements in trustworthiness while being efficient and robust.

Abstract: Despite their impressive performances, Large Language Models (LLMs) remain
prone to hallucination, which critically undermines their trustworthiness.
While most of the previous work focused on tackling answer and attribution
correctness, a recent line of work investigated faithfulness, with a focus on
leveraging internal model signals to reflect a model's actual decision-making
process while generating the answer. Nevertheless, these methods induce
additional latency and have shown limitations in directly aligning token
generation with attribution generation. In this paper, we introduce LoDIT, a
method that jointly generates and faithfully attributes answers in RAG by
leveraging specific token logits during generation. It consists of two steps:
(1) marking the documents with specific token identifiers and then leveraging
the logits of these tokens to estimate the contribution of each document to the
answer during generation, and (2) aggregating these contributions into document
attributions. Experiments on a trustworthiness-focused attributed
text-generation benchmark, Trust-Align, show that LoDIT significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art models on several metrics. Finally, an in-depth
analysis of LoDIT shows both its efficiency in terms of latency and its
robustness in different settings.

*Seonghwan Choi,Beomseok Kang,Dongwon Jo,Jae-Joon Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces RetroAttention, enhancing long-context tasks in Large Language Models (LLMs) by revising past attention outputs with newer information. It outperforms existing Key-Value (KV) cache compression methods in accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the inefficiency of long-context tasks in LLMs caused by linear memory growth and cumulative attention errors during decoding.

Method: RetroAttention revises previous attention outputs with new Key-Value entries using an output cache for efficient context accessibility, minimizing latency overhead.

Result: The method improves effective KV exposure by up to 1.6 times and accuracy by up to 21.9% compared to state-of-the-art compression methods.

Conclusion: RetroAttention provides a significant advancement in KV cache update techniques, enhancing performance in long-context tasks with minimal latency trade-offs.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in long-context tasks
such as reasoning, code generation, and multi-turn dialogue. However, inference
over extended contexts is bottlenecked by the Key-Value (KV) cache, whose
memory footprint grows linearly with sequence length and dominates latency at
each decoding step. While recent KV cache compression methods identify and load
important tokens, they focus predominantly on input contexts and fail to
address the cumulative attention errors that arise during long decoding. In
this paper, we introduce RetroAttention, a novel KV cache update technique that
retrospectively revises past attention outputs using newly arrived KV entries
from subsequent decoding steps. By maintaining a lightweight output cache,
RetroAttention enables past queries to efficiently access more relevant
context, while incurring minimal latency overhead. This breaks the
fixed-attention-output paradigm and allows continual correction of prior
approximations. Extensive experiments on long-generation benchmarks show that
RetroAttention consistently outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) KV compression
methods, increasing effective KV exposure by up to 1.6$\times$ and accuracy by
up to 21.9\%.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The authors developed a zero-shot pipeline for Tabular Question Answering using a Large Language Model to generate code for extracting relevant data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address Tabular Question Answering without task-specific fine-tuning by leveraging zero-shot code generation capabilities with a more iterative and robust method.

Method: A modular pipeline was built with a primary code generator module, supported by components for column relevance identification and data type analysis. Iterative refinement was used to correct errors in the code generation process.

Result: Achieved rank 33 out of 53 in SemEval 2025 Task 8 without task-specific tuning, validating zero-shot code generation as an effective baseline.

Conclusion: Zero-shot code generation shows promise for Tabular QA tasks and can perform reasonably well without fine-tuning, though improvements are needed for higher rankings.

Abstract: This paper describes our participation in SemEval 2025 Task 8, focused on
Tabular Question Answering. We developed a zero-shot pipeline that leverages an
Large Language Model to generate functional code capable of extracting the
relevant information from tabular data based on an input question. Our approach
consists of a modular pipeline where the main code generator module is
supported by additional components that identify the most relevant columns and
analyze their data types to improve extraction accuracy. In the event that the
generated code fails, an iterative refinement process is triggered,
incorporating the error feedback into a new generation prompt to enhance
robustness. Our results show that zero-shot code generation is a valid approach
for Tabular QA, achieving rank 33 of 53 in the test phase despite the lack of
task-specific fine-tuning.

*Birong Pan,Yongqi Li,Weiyu Zhang,Wenpeng Lu,Mayi Xu,Shen Zhou,Yuanyuan Zhu,Ming Zhong,Tieyun Qian*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper systematically reviews training-free (TF) alignment methods for large language models (LLMs), categorizing their mechanisms and limitations, and highlights challenges and future directions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of traditional alignment methods (e.g., fine-tuning) which are resource-intensive and may degrade knowledge, particularly under constrained accessibility and computational environments.

Method: The paper categorizes TF alignment methods into pre-decoding, in-decoding, and post-decoding stages, analyzing their application in LLMs and multimodal LLMs (MLLMs), along with their respective challenges and future research directions.

Result: By organizing existing TF alignment methods and critically examining their mechanisms, the paper provides insights into how these methods can enable alignment, especially within both open and closed-source tools, without heavy retraining costs.

Conclusion: TF alignment offers a flexible and resource-efficient alternative to traditional alignment methods for LLMs, and the paper's comprehensive review serves as a guide for developing safer, more reliable models while identifying opportunities for improvement.

Abstract: The alignment of large language models (LLMs) aims to ensure their outputs
adhere to human values, ethical standards, and legal norms. Traditional
alignment methods often rely on resource-intensive fine-tuning (FT), which may
suffer from knowledge degradation and face challenges in scenarios where the
model accessibility or computational resources are constrained. In contrast,
training-free (TF) alignment techniques--leveraging in-context learning,
decoding-time adjustments, and post-generation corrections--offer a promising
alternative by enabling alignment without heavily retraining LLMs, making them
adaptable to both open-source and closed-source environments. This paper
presents the first systematic review of TF alignment methods, categorizing them
by stages of pre-decoding, in-decoding, and post-decoding. For each stage, we
provide a detailed examination from the viewpoint of LLMs and multimodal LLMs
(MLLMs), highlighting their mechanisms and limitations. Furthermore, we
identify key challenges and future directions, paving the way for more
inclusive and effective TF alignment techniques. By synthesizing and organizing
the rapidly growing body of research, this survey offers a guidance for
practitioners and advances the development of safer and more reliable LLMs.

*Chen Xu,Zhenyu Lv,Tian Lan,Xianyang Wang,Luyao Ji,Leyang Cui,Minqiang Yang,Jian Shen,Qunxi Dong,Xiuling Liu,Juan Wang,Bin Hu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes developing large language models (LLMs) as supervisors to train human therapists, addressing ethical concerns in direct patient-facing applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ethical and safety concerns prevent the direct use of LLMs in psychotherapy with patients. Thus, the focus shifts to employing LLMs for training therapists.

Method: The framework involves (1) defining guidelines for identifying mistakes and corrective strategies, (2) constructing a dataset with intentional therapeutic mistakes and feedback from a supervisor agent, and (3) fine-tuning the LLM on this dataset to act as a supervisor model for therapist training.

Result: Through experiments, the fine-tuned model, MATE, demonstrated its ability to provide high-quality feedback aligned with clinical guidelines, showcasing promise in therapist training.

Conclusion: The approach presented is effective in developing LLMs as supervisors, paving the way for their application in improving therapist training without compromising ethical concerns.

Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) hold significant promise in
psychotherapy, their direct application in patient-facing scenarios raises
ethical and safety concerns. Therefore, this work shifts towards developing an
LLM as a supervisor to train real therapists. In addition to the privacy of
clinical therapist training data, a fundamental contradiction complicates the
training of therapeutic behaviors: clear feedback standards are necessary to
ensure a controlled training system, yet there is no absolute "gold standard"
for appropriate therapeutic behaviors in practice. In contrast, many common
therapeutic mistakes are universal and identifiable, making them effective
triggers for targeted feedback that can serve as clearer evidence. Motivated by
this, we create a novel therapist-training paradigm: (1) guidelines for
mistaken behaviors and targeted correction strategies are first established as
standards; (2) a human-in-the-loop dialogue-feedback dataset is then
constructed, where a mistake-prone agent intentionally makes standard mistakes
during interviews naturally, and a supervisor agent locates and identifies
mistakes and provides targeted feedback; (3) after fine-tuning on this dataset,
the final supervisor model is provided for real therapist training. The
detailed experimental results of automated, human and downstream assessments
demonstrate that models fine-tuned on our dataset MATE, can provide
high-quality feedback according to the clinical guideline, showing significant
potential for the therapist training scenario.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces "MVISU-Bench," a bilingual benchmark with 404 tasks across 137 mobile apps to improve Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs). Additionally, it presents "Aider," a plug-and-play module boosting the success rate of mobile agents by 19.55%, particularly in addressing unethical and interactive instructions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluation benchmarks for mobile agents are disconnected from real-world complexities and fail to address diverse user needs.

Method: The authors developed "MVISU-Bench," consisting of 404 tasks categorized into five types: Multi-App, Vague, Interactive, Single-App, and Unethical Instructions. They also introduced "Aider," a dynamic prompt module for better user intent clarification and risk mitigation.

Result: Aider improved the success rates of mobile agents by 19.55% overall, with specific boosts of 53.52% for unethical instructions and 29.41% for interactive instructions on the MVISU-Bench.

Conclusion: There is a significant gap between current mobile agents and user expectations; the proposed benchmark and module effectively address these gaps, enhancing LVLMs in diverse, real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Given the significant advances in Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) in
reasoning and visual understanding, mobile agents are rapidly emerging to meet
users' automation needs. However, existing evaluation benchmarks are
disconnected from the real world and fail to adequately address the diverse and
complex requirements of users. From our extensive collection of user
questionnaire, we identified five tasks: Multi-App, Vague, Interactive,
Single-App, and Unethical Instructions. Around these tasks, we present
\textbf{MVISU-Bench}, a bilingual benchmark that includes 404 tasks across 137
mobile applications. Furthermore, we propose Aider, a plug-and-play module that
acts as a dynamic prompt prompter to mitigate risks and clarify user intent for
mobile agents. Our Aider is easy to integrate into several frameworks and has
successfully improved overall success rates by 19.55\% compared to the current
state-of-the-art (SOTA) on MVISU-Bench. Specifically, it achieves success rate
improvements of 53.52\% and 29.41\% for unethical and interactive instructions,
respectively. Through extensive experiments and analysis, we highlight the gap
between existing mobile agents and real-world user expectations.

TL;DR: The paper introduces READER, a new method for accelerating LLM inference by leveraging text self-repetitions, achieving significant performance improvement without requiring additional training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deployment of LLMs faces challenges due to their sequential token generation, which is difficult to accelerate, especially for large batch sizes.

Method: READER combines speculative decoding with statistical token searches and optimizes key-value cache size during inference to enhance speed without loss.

Result: READER achieves more than 40% speedup compared to existing methods, exceeding 10x speedup in retrieval-based tasks, and requires no additional training.

Conclusion: READER presents a lossless, efficient method for accelerating LLM inference, making it suitable for industrial applications with significant performance gains.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) generate tokens autoregressively, with each
token depending on the preceding context. This sequential nature makes the
inference process inherently difficult to accelerate, posing a significant
challenge for efficient deployment. In recent years, various methods have been
proposed to address this issue, with the most effective approaches often
involving the training of additional draft models. In this paper, we introduce
READER (Retrieval-Assisted Drafter for Efficient LLM Inference), a novel
lossless speculative decoding method that enhances model-based approaches by
leveraging self-repetitions in the text. Our algorithm expands the speculative
decoding tree using tokens obtained through statistical search. This work
focuses on large batch sizes (>= 8), an underexplored yet important area for
industrial applications. We also analyze the key-value (KV) cache size during
speculative decoding and propose an optimization to improve performance for
large batches. As a result, READER outperforms existing speculative decoding
methods. Notably, READER requires no additional training and can reuse
pre-trained speculator models, increasing the speedup by over 40\%. Our method
demonstrates particularly strong performance on search-based tasks, such as
retrieval-augmented generation, where we achieve more than 10x speedup.

### [102] [CPO: Addressing Reward Ambiguity in Role-playing Dialogue via Comparative Policy Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09074)
*Xinge Ye,Rui Wang,Yuchuan Wu,Victor Ma,Feiteng Fang,Fei Huang,Yongbin Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Comparative Policy Optimization (CPO) to improve performance in subjective tasks like role-playing dialogue, focusing on comparative evaluations rather than purely independent reward scoring.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional RLFT techniques excel in objective tasks but fail in open-ended tasks due to subjective evaluation criteria and unstable reward signals.

Method: The authors propose CPO and CharacterArena evaluation framework to shift reward evaluation from sample-wise scoring to comparative, group-wise and trajectory-level scoring.

Result: Experiments show that CPO reduces reward ambiguity and significantly enhances dialogue quality across various benchmark tests.

Conclusion: CPO and CharacterArena achieve more robust and fair evaluation mechanisms for subjective dialogue tasks, bridging a gap in RLFT performance for open-ended scenarios.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning Fine-Tuning (RLFT) has achieved notable success in
tasks with objectively verifiable answers (e.g., code generation, mathematical
reasoning), yet struggles with open-ended subjective tasks like role-playing
dialogue. Traditional reward modeling approaches, which rely on independent
sample-wise scoring, face dual challenges: subjective evaluation criteria and
unstable reward signals.Motivated by the insight that human evaluation
inherently combines explicit criteria with implicit comparative judgments, we
propose Comparative Policy Optimization (CPO). CPO redefines the reward
evaluation paradigm by shifting from sample-wise scoring to comparative
group-wise scoring.Building on the same principle, we introduce the
CharacterArena evaluation framework, which comprises two stages:(1)
Contextualized Multi-turn Role-playing Simulation, and (2) Trajectory-level
Comparative Evaluation. By operationalizing subjective scoring via objective
trajectory comparisons, CharacterArena minimizes contextual bias and enables
more robust and fair performance evaluation. Empirical results on
CharacterEval, CharacterBench, and CharacterArena confirm that CPO effectively
mitigates reward ambiguity and leads to substantial improvements in dialogue
quality.

### [103] [Utilizing Multilingual Encoders to Improve Large Language Models for Low-Resource Languages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09091)
*Imalsha Puranegedara,Themira Chathumina,Nisal Ranathunga,Nisansa de Silva,Surangika Ranathunga,Mokanarangan Thayaparan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with low-resource languages (LRLs). This paper proposes a new architecture to improve LRL performance using enriched intermediate layer fusion and token-specific weighting strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of English-centric training in LLMs and improve their capability with low-resource languages (LRLs).

Method: The authors introduce a novel architecture that fuses intermediate layers of a multilingual encoder using two strategies: Global Softmax weighting and Transformer Softmax, mapping results into the LLM's embedding space.

Result: The proposed model shows performance gains in LRLs, increasing Sinhala classification accuracy from 71.66% to 75.86% and improving XNLI average accuracy from 70.36% to 71.50%, outperforming the existing LangBridge baseline.

Conclusion: The approach provides a scalable and data-efficient method to boost multilingual capabilities in LLMs, demonstrating significant improvement for low-resource languages.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in English, but their performance degrades
significantly on low-resource languages (LRLs) due to English-centric training.
While methods like LangBridge align LLMs with multilingual encoders such as the
Massively Multilingual Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer (mT5), they typically
use only the final encoder layer. We propose a novel architecture that fuses
all intermediate layers, enriching the linguistic information passed to the
LLM. Our approach features two strategies: (1) a Global Softmax weighting for
overall layer importance, and (2) a Transformer Softmax model that learns
token-specific weights. The fused representations are mapped into the LLM's
embedding space, enabling it to process multilingual inputs. The model is
trained only on English data, without using any parallel or multilingual data.
Evaluated on XNLI, IndicXNLI, Sinhala News Classification, and Amazon Reviews,
our Transformer Softmax model significantly outperforms the LangBridge
baseline. We observe strong performance gains in LRLs, improving Sinhala
classification accuracy from 71.66% to 75.86% and achieving clear improvements
across Indic languages such as Tamil, Bengali, and Malayalam. These specific
gains contribute to an overall boost in average XNLI accuracy from 70.36% to
71.50%. This approach offers a scalable, data-efficient path toward more
capable and equitable multilingual LLMs.

*Anastasia Zhukova,Thomas Walton,Christian E. Matt,Bela Gipp*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper addresses the issue of fragmented event logs in shift books within the process industry by proposing a record linking model adapted from cross-document coreference resolution (CDCR), achieving a significant performance improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to optimize operations, ensure safety, and improve data usage in the process industry by addressing the challenge of fragmented event logs in shift books.

Method: The authors adapt CDCR, traditionally used in the news domain, into a record linking model that incorporates natural language inference (NLI) and semantic text similarity (STS), tailored to the unstructured and structured text formats specific to the process industry.

Result: The proposed RL model outperformed NLI- and STS-driven baselines, showing improvements of 28% and 27%, respectively.

Conclusion: Domain-adapted CDCR models with reasoning capabilities can significantly enhance data quality and connectivity in the process industry's shift logs, demonstrating the effectiveness of this approach.

Abstract: Knowledge management (KM) is vital in the process industry for optimizing
operations, ensuring safety, and enabling continuous improvement through
effective use of operational data and past insights. A key challenge in this
domain is the fragmented nature of event logs in shift books, where related
records, e.g., entries documenting issues related to equipment or processes and
the corresponding solutions, may remain disconnected. This fragmentation
hinders the recommendation of previous solutions to the users. To address this
problem, we investigate record linking (RL) as link prediction, commonly
studied in graph-based machine learning, by framing it as a cross-document
coreference resolution (CDCR) task enhanced with natural language inference
(NLI) and semantic text similarity (STS) by shifting it into the causal
inference (CI). We adapt CDCR, traditionally applied in the news domain, into
an RL model to operate at the passage level, similar to NLI and STS, while
accommodating the process industry's specific text formats, which contain
unstructured text and structured record attributes. Our RL model outperformed
the best versions of NLI- and STS-driven baselines by 28% (11.43 points) and
27% (11.21 points), respectively. Our work demonstrates how domain adaptation
of the state-of-the-art CDCR models, enhanced with reasoning capabilities, can
be effectively tailored to the process industry, improving data quality and
connectivity in shift logs.

TL;DR: Researchers extended Llama-3-8B to better support Sinhala by improving the tokenizer and pre-training on a Sinhala corpus.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Open-source LLMs often overlook low-resource languages like Sinhala.

Method: Enhanced the LLM tokenizer with Sinhala vocabulary and performed continual pre-training on a cleaned 10M Sinhala corpus.

Result: The developed SinLlama model outperformed Llama-3-8B variants in text classification tasks after instruction fine-tuning.

Conclusion: SinLlama demonstrates improved performance for Sinhala, showcasing the potential of incorporating low-resource language-specific adaptations in LLMs.

Abstract: Low-resource languages such as Sinhala are often overlooked by open-source
Large Language Models (LLMs). In this research, we extend an existing
multilingual LLM (Llama-3-8B) to better serve Sinhala. We enhance the LLM
tokenizer with Sinhala specific vocabulary and perform continual pre-training
on a cleaned 10 million Sinhala corpus, resulting in the SinLlama model. This
is the very first decoder-based open-source LLM with explicit Sinhala support.
When SinLlama was instruction fine-tuned for three text classification tasks,
it outperformed base and instruct variants of Llama-3-8B by a significant
margin.

*Weixuan Wang,Dongge Han,Daniel Madrigal Diaz,Jin Xu,Victor Rühle,Saravan Rajmohan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: OdysseyBench is a benchmark for evaluating large language model (LLM) agents on long-horizon workflows across office tools, addressing a gap in existing atomic task-focused benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks fail to evaluate LLM agents on complex, long-horizon workflows required in real-world applications, focusing instead on independent, atomic tasks.

Method: The paper introduces OdysseyBench, including OdysseyBench+ and OdysseyBench-Neo tasks, and proposes HomerAgents, a multi-agent framework for scalable benchmark creation through environment exploration, task generation, and dialogue synthesis.

Result: OdysseyBench presents a challenging evaluation framework that better assesses the capabilities of state-of-the-art LLM agents in long-horizon, real-world contexts.

Conclusion: OdysseyBench and HomerAgents will aid in advancing the development and evaluation of LLM agents in realistic productivity scenarios, and their public release encourages further research.

Abstract: Autonomous agents powered by large language models (LLMs) are increasingly
deployed in real-world applications requiring complex, long-horizon workflows.
However, existing benchmarks predominantly focus on atomic tasks that are
self-contained and independent, failing to capture the long-term contextual
dependencies and multi-interaction coordination required in realistic
scenarios. To address this gap, we introduce OdysseyBench, a comprehensive
benchmark for evaluating LLM agents on long-horizon workflows across diverse
office applications including Word, Excel, PDF, Email, and Calendar. Our
benchmark comprises two complementary splits: OdysseyBench+ with 300 tasks
derived from real-world use cases, and OdysseyBench-Neo with 302 newly
synthesized complex tasks. Each task requires agent to identify essential
information from long-horizon interaction histories and perform multi-step
reasoning across various applications. To enable scalable benchmark creation,
we propose HomerAgents, a multi-agent framework that automates the generation
of long-horizon workflow benchmarks through systematic environment exploration,
task generation, and dialogue synthesis. Our extensive evaluation demonstrates
that OdysseyBench effectively challenges state-of-the-art LLM agents, providing
more accurate assessment of their capabilities in complex, real-world contexts
compared to existing atomic task benchmarks. We believe that OdysseyBench will
serve as a valuable resource for advancing the development and evaluation of
LLM agents in real-world productivity scenarios. In addition, we release
OdysseyBench and HomerAgents to foster research along this line.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces LogicIFGen and LogicIFEval to evaluate Large Language Models' (LLMs) ability to follow complex logic-rich instructions, demonstrating notable limitations in their current performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the underexplored area of LLMs' performance on logic-rich natural language instructions, which are crucial for advanced capabilities like reasoning.

Method: The authors created LogicIFGen to generate complex, verifiable instructions from code functions and developed LogicIFEval as a benchmark with 426 such instructions to assess LLM performance.

Result: Experiments showed that state-of-the-art LLMs can follow less than 60% of these logic-rich instructions, highlighting significant gaps in their ability.

Conclusion: Current LLMs exhibit substantial deficiencies in handling logic-rich instructions, underscoring the need for improved instruction-following capabilities.

Abstract: Instruction following has catalyzed the recent era of Large Language Models
(LLMs) and is the foundational skill underpinning more advanced capabilities
such as reasoning and agentic behaviors. As tasks grow more challenging, the
logic structures embedded in natural language instructions becomes increasingly
intricate. However, how well LLMs perform on such logic-rich instructions
remains under-explored. We propose LogicIFGen and LogicIFEval. LogicIFGen is a
scalable, automated framework for generating verifiable instructions from code
functions, which can naturally express rich logic such as conditionals,
nesting, recursion, and function calls. We further curate a collection of
complex code functions and use LogicIFGen to construct LogicIFEval, a benchmark
comprising 426 verifiable logic-rich instructions. Our experiments demonstrate
that current state-of-the-art LLMs still struggle to correctly follow the
instructions in LogicIFEval. Most LLMs can only follow fewer than 60% of the
instructions, revealing significant deficiencies in the instruction-following
ability. Code and Benchmark: https://github.com/mianzhang/LogicIF

*Wen Wang,Bozhen Fang,Chenchen Jing,Yongliang Shen,Yangyi Shen,Qiuyu Wang,Hao Ouyang,Hao Chen,Chunhua Shen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper identifies the phenomenon of temporal oscillation in diffusion large language models (dLLMs) and introduces methods to leverage temporal consistency for improved output.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current dLLMs discard intermediate text predictions in favor of the final output, overlooking moments when correct answers emerge temporarily.

Method: The authors propose two methods: 1) Temporal Self-Consistency Voting, a training-free test-time strategy, and 2) Temporal Consistency Reinforcement, a post-training method using Temporal Semantic Entropy as a reward.

Result: The methods demonstrated empirical improvements, including a 24.7% average improvement on the Countdown dataset and gains of 2.0% to 25.3% across other benchmarks.

Conclusion: Temporal dynamics in dLLMs are underutilized, and the proposed strategies effectively harness these dynamics to improve language model performance.

Abstract: Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) generate text through iterative
denoising, yet current decoding strategies discard rich intermediate
predictions in favor of the final output. Our work here reveals a critical
phenomenon, temporal oscillation, where correct answers often emerge in the
middle process, but are overwritten in later denoising steps. To address this
issue, we introduce two complementary methods that exploit temporal
consistency: 1) Temporal Self-Consistency Voting, a training-free, test-time
decoding strategy that aggregates predictions across denoising steps to select
the most consistent output; and 2) a post-training method termed Temporal
Consistency Reinforcement, which uses Temporal Semantic Entropy (TSE), a
measure of semantic stability across intermediate predictions, as a reward
signal to encourage stable generations. Empirical results across multiple
benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Using the negative
TSE reward alone, we observe a remarkable average improvement of 24.7% on the
Countdown dataset over an existing dLLM. Combined with the accuracy reward, we
achieve absolute gains of 2.0% on GSM8K, 4.3% on MATH500, 6.6% on SVAMP, and
25.3% on Countdown, respectively. Our findings underscore the untapped
potential of temporal dynamics in dLLMs and offer two simple yet effective
tools to harness them.

TL;DR: This study reviews advanced AI-based methods for image-based detection of plant diseases and pests, highlighting high-performing techniques like the Hierarchical Vision Transformer (HvT).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enhance crop production and reduce economic losses by addressing the limitations of manual disease and pest identification through modern AI methods.

Method: The paper organizes detection methods into five categories such as hyperspectral imaging, visualization approaches, and transformer models, conducting a comprehensive review and comparative analysis.

Result: The study finds that modern AI techniques consistently outperform older methods, with vision transformers like HvT achieving over 99.3% accuracy in plant disease detection.

Conclusion: The study identifies system design challenges, proposes solutions, and suggests future research directions for applying AI in plant disease detection.

Abstract: Addressing plant diseases and pests is critical for enhancing crop production

taxonomy provides researchers with detailed, actionable insights for selecting
advanced state-of-the-art detection methods. A comprehensive survey of recent
work and comparative studies demonstrates the consistent superiority of modern
AI-based approaches, which often outperform older image analysis methods in
speed and accuracy. In particular, vision transformers such as the Hierarchical
Vision Transformer (HvT) have shown accuracy exceeding 99.3% in plant disease
detection, outperforming architectures like MobileNetV3. The study concludes by
discussing system design challenges, proposing solutions, and outlining
promising directions for future research.

### [110] [ImageDDI: Image-enhanced Molecular Motif Sequence Representation for Drug-Drug Interaction Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08338)
*Yuqin He,Tengfei Ma,Chaoyi Li,Pengsen Ma,Hongxin Xiang,Jianmin Wang,Yiping Liu,Bosheng Song,Xiangxiang Zeng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents ImageDDI, a framework that combines molecular motif sequences and image-based data to improve predictive performance for drug-drug interactions (DDIs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Identifying and predicting drug-drug interactions (DDIs) is vital to mitigate potential health risks from multi-drug use. Existing methods fall short due to limited functional motif-based representation, which is crucial since DDIs stem from motif interactions rather than whole drug structures.

Method: The proposed method is ImageDDI, a framework that tokenizes drug molecules into functional motifs and encodes them as sequences using a transformer-based model. It incorporates both global molecular image data (e.g., texture, shadow, and spatial relationships) and local motif structures. Adaptive Feature Fusion is used to dynamically integrate feature representations for better generalization.

Result: ImageDDI outperforms state-of-the-art models on widely used datasets and demonstrates excellent performance in both 2D and 3D molecular image-enhanced scenarios.

Conclusion: ImageDDI effectively combines motif-based and image-enhanced molecular representations for accurate DDI prediction, addressing the limitations of previous approaches and achieving high generalization capabilities.

Abstract: To mitigate the potential adverse health effects of simultaneous multi-drug
use, including unexpected side effects and interactions, accurately identifying
and predicting drug-drug interactions (DDIs) is considered a crucial task in
the field of deep learning. Although existing methods have demonstrated
promising performance, they suffer from the bottleneck of limited functional
motif-based representation learning, as DDIs are fundamentally caused by motif
interactions rather than the overall drug structures. In this paper, we propose
an Image-enhanced molecular motif sequence representation framework for
\textbf{DDI} prediction, called ImageDDI, which represents a pair of drugs from
both global and local structures. Specifically, ImageDDI tokenizes molecules
into functional motifs. To effectively represent a drug pair, their motifs are
combined into a single sequence and embedded using a transformer-based encoder,
starting from the local structure representation. By leveraging the
associations between drug pairs, ImageDDI further enhances the spatial
representation of molecules using global molecular image information (e.g.
texture, shadow, color, and planar spatial relationships). To integrate
molecular visual information into functional motif sequence, ImageDDI employs
Adaptive Feature Fusion, enhancing the generalization of ImageDDI by
dynamically adapting the fusion process of feature representations.
Experimental results on widely used datasets demonstrate that ImageDDI
outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, extensive experiments show that
ImageDDI achieved competitive performance in both 2D and 3D image-enhanced
scenarios compared to other models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper surveys optimization methods for deploying object detection (OD) models on resource-constrained IoT devices using TinyML.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid growth of IoT devices and their resource constraints create a need for efficient object detection solutions that can perform well in low-power environments.

Method: The paper analyzes optimization techniques such as quantization, pruning, knowledge distillation, and neural architecture search for deploying OD models on microcontrollers. It bridges theoretical and practical approaches while also benchmarking performance.

Result: The survey provides a comprehensive comparison of performance indicators for OD implementations, evaluating their accuracy and efficiency on microcontroller devices.

Conclusion: The paper highlights the current maturity level of OD solutions for TinyML and offers a public repository for tracking advancements in this fast-evolving area.

Abstract: Object detection (OD) has become vital for numerous computer vision
applications, but deploying it on resource-constrained IoT devices presents a
significant challenge. These devices, often powered by energy-efficient
microcontrollers, struggle to handle the computational load of deep
learning-based OD models. This issue is compounded by the rapid proliferation
of IoT devices, predicted to surpass 150 billion by 2030. TinyML offers a
compelling solution by enabling OD on ultra-low-power devices, paving the way
for efficient and real-time processing at the edge. Although numerous survey
papers have been published on this topic, they often overlook the optimization
challenges associated with deploying OD models in TinyML environments. To
address this gap, this survey paper provides a detailed analysis of key
optimization techniques for deploying OD models on resource-constrained
devices. These techniques include quantization, pruning, knowledge
distillation, and neural architecture search. Furthermore, we explore both
theoretical approaches and practical implementations, bridging the gap between
academic research and real-world edge artificial intelligence deployment.
Finally, we compare the key performance indicators (KPIs) of existing OD
implementations on microcontroller devices, highlighting the achieved maturity
level of these solutions in terms of both prediction accuracy and efficiency.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a pipeline to address training accuracy gaps and simulation-to-hardware discrepancies in hybrid optical neural networks (ONNs) for tasks like image classification and segmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ONNs are energy-efficient but face challenges like lower training accuracy compared to large-scale networks and errors due to mismatches between simulations and physical systems.

Method: A task-agnostic and hardware-agnostic pipeline with Neural Tangent Knowledge Distillation (NTKD) is proposed to improve ONN training and compensate for post-fabrication errors.

Result: Experimental results on multiple datasets and hardware configurations demonstrate significant improvements in ONN accuracy and performance.

Conclusion: The proposed pipeline facilitates reliable pre-fabrication simulation and physical implementation of ONNs, narrowing the accuracy gap and ensuring practical applicability.

Abstract: Hybrid Optical Neural Networks (ONNs, typically consisting of an optical
frontend and a digital backend) offer an energy-efficient alternative to fully
digital deep networks for real-time, power-constrained systems. However, their
adoption is limited by two main challenges: the accuracy gap compared to
large-scale networks during training, and discrepancies between simulated and
fabricated systems that further degrade accuracy. While previous work has
proposed end-to-end optimizations for specific datasets (e.g., MNIST) and
optical systems, these approaches typically lack generalization across tasks
and hardware designs. To address these limitations, we propose a task-agnostic
and hardware-agnostic pipeline that supports image classification and
segmentation across diverse optical systems. To assist optical system design
before training, we estimate achievable model accuracy based on user-specified
constraints such as physical size and the dataset. For training, we introduce
Neural Tangent Knowledge Distillation (NTKD), which aligns optical models with
electronic teacher networks, thereby narrowing the accuracy gap. After
fabrication, NTKD also guides fine-tuning of the digital backend to compensate
for implementation errors. Experiments on multiple datasets (e.g., MNIST,
CIFAR, Carvana Masking) and hardware configurations show that our pipeline
consistently improves ONN performance and enables practical deployment in both
pre-fabrication simulations and physical implementations.

TL;DR: The paper introduces MAViS, a multi-agent collaborative framework for generating long-sequence video storytelling with high quality, expressiveness, and multimodal outputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing long-sequence video generation frameworks suffer from limitations such as low quality, poor assistive capability, and limited expressiveness.

Method: MAViS employs a multi-agent framework operating in specialized stages, guided by the 3E Principle (Explore, Examine, Enhance). It uses Script Writing Guidelines to optimize compatibility with generative tools and integrates video, narrative, and audio generation.

Result: Experimental results show that MAViS achieves state-of-the-art performance in assistive capability, visual quality, and video expressiveness, while being scalable with various generative models.

Conclusion: MAViS enriches creativity by enabling high-quality long-sequence video storytelling with a modular, scalable, and multimodal design framework.

Abstract: Despite recent advances, long-sequence video generation frameworks still
suffer from significant limitations: poor assistive capability, suboptimal
visual quality, and limited expressiveness. To mitigate these limitations, we
propose MAViS, an end-to-end multi-agent collaborative framework for
long-sequence video storytelling. MAViS orchestrates specialized agents across
multiple stages, including script writing, shot designing, character modeling,
keyframe generation, video animation, and audio generation. In each stage,
agents operate under the 3E Principle -- Explore, Examine, and Enhance -- to
ensure the completeness of intermediate outputs. Considering the capability
limitations of current generative models, we propose the Script Writing
Guidelines to optimize compatibility between scripts and generative tools.
Experimental results demonstrate that MAViS achieves state-of-the-art
performance in assistive capability, visual quality, and video expressiveness.
Its modular framework further enables scalability with diverse generative
models and tools. With just a brief user prompt, MAViS is capable of producing
high-quality, expressive long-sequence video storytelling, enriching
inspirations and creativity for users. To the best of our knowledge, MAViS is
the only framework that provides multimodal design output -- videos with
narratives and background music.

*Ankan Deria,Dwarikanath Mahapatra,Behzad Bozorgtabar,Mohna Chakraborty,Snehashis Chakraborty,Sudipta Roy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MuGa-VTON, a new framework for virtual try-on that uses a unified approach to model garments and person identity together for enhanced realism and flexibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current virtual try-on methods face challenges in preserving individual-specific details like body shape, accessories, and tattoos while combining upper and lower garment modeling.

Method: The architecture uses three modules: Garment Representation Module (GRM) for garment semantics, Person Representation Module (PRM) for identity and pose encoding, and the A-DiT fusion module for integrating garment, person, and text-prompt features using diffusion transformers.

Result: Experiments on VITON-HD and DressCode benchmarks show that MuGa-VTON achieves superior results in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations, preserving realism and identity.

Conclusion: MuGa-VTON offers a robust solution for virtual try-on applications by combining garment and identity modeling while enabling fine-grained garment customization with minimal input.

Abstract: Virtual try-on seeks to generate photorealistic images of individuals in
desired garments, a task that must simultaneously preserve personal identity
and garment fidelity for practical use in fashion retail and personalization.
However, existing methods typically handle upper and lower garments separately,
rely on heavy preprocessing, and often fail to preserve person-specific cues
such as tattoos, accessories, and body shape-resulting in limited realism and
flexibility. To this end, we introduce MuGa-VTON, a unified multi-garment
diffusion framework that jointly models upper and lower garments together with
person identity in a shared latent space. Specifically, we proposed three key
modules: the Garment Representation Module (GRM) for capturing both garment
semantics, the Person Representation Module (PRM) for encoding identity and
pose cues, and the A-DiT fusion module, which integrates garment, person, and
text-prompt features through a diffusion transformer. This architecture
supports prompt-based customization, allowing fine-grained garment
modifications with minimal user input. Extensive experiments on the VITON-HD
and DressCode benchmarks demonstrate that MuGa-VTON outperforms existing
methods in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations, producing
high-fidelity, identity-preserving results suitable for real-world virtual
try-on applications.

*Aneel Damaraju,Dean Hazineh,Todd Zickler*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces CObL (Concurrent Object Layers), a diffusion-based architecture that represents and reconstructs multi-object scenes with occluded objects as layers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision tasks benefit from understanding objects and their spatial relationships; existing methods struggle with challenging setups like amodal object completion.

Method: CObL uses Stable Diffusion and inference-time guidance to generate an occlusion-ordered stack of object layers from an image. It is trained on synthetic multi-object scenes.

Result: CObL demonstrates zero-shot generalization to real-world images with novel objects and varying quantities, outpacing models focused on user prompts or specific training domains.

Conclusion: CObL advances object-centric vision by handling complex object-layered scenes in a flexible and interpretable way, outperforming current methods in unsupervised learning and generalization.

Abstract: Vision benefits from grouping pixels into objects and understanding their
spatial relationships, both laterally and in depth. We capture this with a
scene representation comprising an occlusion-ordered stack of "object layers,"
each containing an isolated and amodally-completed object. To infer this
representation from an image, we introduce a diffusion-based architecture named
Concurrent Object Layers (CObL). CObL generates a stack of object layers in
parallel, using Stable Diffusion as a prior for natural objects and
inference-time guidance to ensure the inferred layers composite back to the
input image. We train CObL using a few thousand synthetically-generated images
of multi-object tabletop scenes, and we find that it zero-shot generalizes to
photographs of real-world tabletops with varying numbers of novel objects. In
contrast to recent models for amodal object completion, CObL reconstructs
multiple occluded objects without user prompting and without knowing the number
of objects beforehand. Unlike previous models for unsupervised object-centric
representation learning, CObL is not limited to the world it was trained in.

*Aaditya Baranwal,Madhav Kataria,Naitik Agrawal,Yogesh S Rawat,Shruti Vyas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Current Vision Language Models (VLMs) excel at panel-level interpretation but fail at temporal causality and cross-panel cohesion necessary for coherent story comprehension in visual storytelling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate the limitations of current VLMs in understanding long-form, sequential visual storytelling such as manga to identify gaps in temporal reasoning and narrative cohesion.

Method: Develop a novel evaluation framework using multimodal annotation, cross-modal embedding analysis, and retrieval-augmented methods, analyzing the storytelling comprehension of VLMs through various paradigms.

Result: Testing with Re:Zero manga demonstrated deficiencies in VLMs, including challenges with non-linear narratives, character consistency, and causal reasoning, highlighting their lack of story-level intelligence.

Conclusion: This study presents a structured methodology for assessing narrative comprehension by VLMs and offers insights into enhancing their capabilities beyond basic visual recognition.

Abstract: Current Vision Language Models (VLMs) demonstrate a critical gap between
surface-level recognition and deep narrative reasoning when processing
sequential visual storytelling. Through a comprehensive investigation of manga
narrative understanding, we reveal that while recent large multimodal models
excel at individual panel interpretation, they systematically fail at temporal
causality and cross-panel cohesion, core requirements for coherent story
comprehension. We introduce a novel evaluation framework that combines
fine-grained multimodal annotation, cross-modal embedding analysis, and
retrieval-augmented assessment to systematically characterize these
limitations.
  Our methodology includes (i) a rigorous annotation protocol linking visual
elements to narrative structure through aligned light novel text, (ii)
comprehensive evaluation across multiple reasoning paradigms, including direct
inference and retrieval-augmented generation, and (iii) cross-modal similarity
analysis revealing fundamental misalignments in current VLMs' joint
representations. Applying this framework to Re:Zero manga across 11 chapters
with 308 annotated panels, we conduct the first systematic study of long-form
narrative understanding in VLMs through three core evaluation axes: generative
storytelling, contextual dialogue grounding, and temporal reasoning. Our
findings demonstrate that current models lack genuine story-level intelligence,
struggling particularly with non-linear narratives, character consistency, and
causal inference across extended sequences. This work establishes both the
foundation and practical methodology for evaluating narrative intelligence,
while providing actionable insights into the capability of deep sequential
understanding of Discrete Visual Narratives beyond basic recognition in
Multimodal Models.

### [117] [VISOR: Visual Input-based Steering for Output Redirection in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08521)
*Mansi Phute,Ravikumar Balakrishnan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces VISOR, a method using optimized visual inputs to control Vision Language Models' behavior, offering robust results while exposing potential security risks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of Vision Language Models (VLMs) in various applications demands better security and behavioral control mechanisms, especially since existing approaches are either ineffective or incompatible with many deployments.

Method: The authors propose VISOR, which uses optimized visual inputs (steering images) to induce target activation patterns in VLMs, achieving behavioral control without requiring access to model internals.

Result: VISOR achieves robust results, matching traditional steering vector performance on positive behavioral shifts and surpassing it for negative shifts (up to 25% changes). It maintains 99.9% accuracy on unrelated tasks while exposing a security vulnerability.

Conclusion: The study highlights VISOR's potential as a non-invasive behavioral control method for VLMs, with practical applications but also underscores the urgency of addressing the security risks posed by visual steering attacks.

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) are increasingly being used in a broad range of
applications, bringing their security and behavioral control to the forefront.
While existing approaches for behavioral control or output redirection, like
system prompting in VLMs, are easily detectable and often ineffective,
activation-based steering vectors require invasive runtime access to model
internals--incompatible with API-based services and closed-source deployments.
We introduce VISOR (Visual Input-based Steering for Output Redirection), a
novel method that achieves sophisticated behavioral control through optimized
visual inputs alone. By crafting universal steering images that induce target
activation patterns, VISOR enables practical deployment across all VLM serving
modalities while remaining imperceptible compared to explicit textual
instructions. We validate VISOR on LLaVA-1.5-7B across three critical alignment
tasks: refusal, sycophancy and survival instinct. A single 150KB steering image
matches steering vector performance within 1-2% for positive behavioral shifts
while dramatically exceeding it for negative steering--achieving up to 25%
shifts from baseline compared to steering vectors' modest changes. Unlike
system prompting (3-4% shifts), VISOR provides robust bidirectional control
while maintaining 99.9% performance on 14,000 unrelated MMLU tasks. Beyond
eliminating runtime overhead and model access requirements, VISOR exposes a
critical security vulnerability: adversaries can achieve sophisticated
behavioral manipulation through visual channels alone, bypassing text-based
defenses. Our work fundamentally re-imagines multimodal model control and
highlights the urgent need for defenses against visual steering attacks.

### [118] [Training Kindai OCR with parallel textline images and self-attention feature distance-based loss](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08537)
*Anh Le,Asanobu Kitamoto*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new approach for enhancing OCR systems aimed at transcribing historical documents by using parallel textline images and a distance-based objective function.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transcribing historical Kindai documents is labor-intensive, limiting annotated datasets for training OCR systems.

Method: The researchers augmented training data using parallel textline images paired with a distance-based objective function to adapt self-attention features for OCR.

Result: Their method reduced the character error rate by up to 3.94% over a baseline Transformer-based OCR system and improved representation quality.

Conclusion: The approach addresses data scarcity in OCR training for historical documents by improving transcription accuracy and self-attention feature effectiveness.

Abstract: Kindai documents, written in modern Japanese from the late 19th to early 20th
century, hold significant historical value for researchers studying societal
structures, daily life, and environmental conditions of that period. However,
transcribing these documents remains a labor-intensive and time-consuming task,
resulting in limited annotated data for training optical character recognition
(OCR) systems. This research addresses this challenge of data scarcity by
leveraging parallel textline images - pairs of original Kindai text and their
counterparts in contemporary Japanese fonts - to augment training datasets. We
introduce a distance-based objective function that minimizes the gap between
self-attention features of the parallel image pairs. Specifically, we explore
Euclidean distance and Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) as domain adaptation
metrics. Experimental results demonstrate that our method reduces the character
error rate (CER) by 2.23% and 3.94% over a Transformer-based OCR baseline when
using Euclidean distance and MMD, respectively. Furthermore, our approach
improves the discriminative quality of self-attention representations, leading
to more effective OCR performance for historical documents.

*Wenhao Liang,Wei Emma Zhang,Lin Yue,Miao Xu,Olaf Maennel,Weitong Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces Calibration Attention (CalAttn), a method to improve probability calibration in Vision Transformers without sacrificing accuracy. It offers adaptive, instance-specific temperature scaling that outperforms traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for trustworthy probability calibration in Vision Transformers, especially for risk-sensitive applications where standard post-hoc methods are limited.

Method: CalAttn leverages a learned, per-instance temperature derived directly from the ViT's CLS token. It acts as a drop-in module and eliminates the dependency on held-out validation sets.

Result: CalAttn achieves up to 4x reduction in calibration error across multiple datasets and transformer architectures, with minimal additional parameters (<0.1%).

Conclusion: CalAttn is a simple, efficient, and architecture-agnostic solution that improves calibration for Vision Transformers, offering reliable probabilities without impacting accuracy.

Abstract: Probability calibration is critical when Vision Transformers are deployed in
risk-sensitive applications. The standard fix, post-hoc temperature scaling,
uses a single global scalar and requires a held-out validation set. We
introduce Calibration Attention (CalAttn), a drop-in module that learns an
adaptive, per-instance temperature directly from the ViT's CLS token. Across
CIFAR-10/100, MNIST, Tiny-ImageNet, and ImageNet-1K, CalAttn reduces
calibration error by up to 4x on ViT-224, DeiT, and Swin, while adding under
0.1 percent additional parameters. The learned temperatures cluster tightly
around 1.0, in contrast to the large global values used by standard temperature
scaling. CalAttn is simple, efficient, and architecture-agnostic, and yields
more trustworthy probabilities without sacrificing accuracy. Code:

### [120] [Boosting Generic Semi-Supervised Medical Image Segmentation via Diverse Teaching and Label Propagation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08549)
*Wei Li,Pengcheng Zhou,Linye Ma,Wenyi Zhao,Huihua Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces DTLP-Net, a novel generic framework to tackle challenges in medical image segmentation, such as semi-supervised learning and domain adaptation, by generating reliable pseudo-labels and leveraging data augmentation and label propagation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from significant challenges in medical image segmentation due to limited annotation and domain shifts, which lead to suboptimal performance when conventional methods address specific tasks in isolation.

Method: The proposed DTLP-Net framework integrates a single student model with two diverse teacher models, decoupling the labeled and unlabeled data training processes and periodically updating one teacher using momentum. Inter-sample and intra-sample data augmentation and label propagation are further used to learn global/local knowledge and voxel-level correlations.

Result: DTLP-Net achieved significant improvements across five benchmark datasets for semi-supervised medical image segmentation (SSMIS), unsupervised medical domain adaptation (UMDA), and semi-supervised medical domain generalization (Semi-MDG), outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates the potential to address broader and more challenging semi-supervised learning issues in medical imaging, making it a versatile and impactful contribution.

Abstract: Both limited annotation and domain shift are significant challenges
frequently encountered in medical image segmentation, leading to derivative
scenarios like semi-supervised medical (SSMIS), semi-supervised medical domain
generalization (Semi-MDG) and unsupervised medical domain adaptation (UMDA).
Conventional methods are generally tailored to specific tasks in isolation, the
error accumulation hinders the effective utilization of unlabeled data and
limits further improvements, resulting in suboptimal performance when these
issues occur. In this paper, we aim to develop a generic framework that masters
all three tasks. We found that the key to solving the problem lies in how to
generate reliable pseudo labels for the unlabeled data in the presence of
domain shift with labeled data and increasing the diversity of the model. To
tackle this issue, we employ a Diverse Teaching and Label Propagation Network
(DTLP-Net) to boosting the Generic Semi-Supervised Medical Image Segmentation.
Our DTLP-Net involves a single student model and two diverse teacher models,
which can generate reliable pseudo-labels for the student model. The first
teacher model decouple the training process with labeled and unlabeled data,
The second teacher is momentum-updated periodically, thus generating reliable
yet divers pseudo-labels. To fully utilize the information within the data, we
adopt inter-sample and intra-sample data augmentation to learn the global and
local knowledge. In addition, to further capture the voxel-level correlations,
we propose label propagation to enhance the model robust. We evaluate our
proposed framework on five benchmark datasets for SSMIS, UMDA, and Semi-MDG
tasks. The results showcase notable improvements compared to state-of-the-art
methods across all five settings, indicating the potential of our framework to
tackle more challenging SSL scenarios.

### [121] [Unlocking the Potential of Diffusion Priors in Blind Face Restoration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08556)
*Yunqi Miao,Zhiyu Qu,Mingqi Gao,Changrui Chen,Jifei Song,Jungong Han,Jiankang Deng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper addresses limitations in using diffusion models for blind face restoration by introducing FLIPNET, a unified network with two modes: Restoration and Degradation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to resolve the discrepancy between high-quality and low-quality images as well as between synthesized and real-world images, which hinders the adaptation of vanilla diffusion models to blind face restoration.

Method: They propose FLIPNET, a dual-mode network. In Restoration mode, it integrates features and face embeddings from low-quality images for face restoration, while in Degradation mode, it synthesizes degraded images resembling real-world scenarios based on degradation datasets.

Result: The model shows superior performance over previous diffusion prior models in terms of authenticity and fidelity. It also outperforms naive degradation models in simulating real-world degradations.

Conclusion: FLIPNET effectively bridges the gap between vanilla diffusion models and blind face restoration by accurately handling both restoration and degradation tasks, making it more suitable for real-world applications.

Abstract: Although diffusion prior is rising as a powerful solution for blind face
restoration (BFR), the inherent gap between the vanilla diffusion model and BFR
settings hinders its seamless adaptation. The gap mainly stems from the
discrepancy between 1) high-quality (HQ) and low-quality (LQ) images and 2)
synthesized and real-world images. The vanilla diffusion model is trained on
images with no or less degradations, whereas BFR handles moderately to severely
degraded images. Additionally, LQ images used for training are synthesized by a
naive degradation model with limited degradation patterns, which fails to
simulate complex and unknown degradations in real-world scenarios. In this
work, we use a unified network FLIPNET that switches between two modes to
resolve specific gaps. In Restoration mode, the model gradually integrates
BFR-oriented features and face embeddings from LQ images to achieve authentic
and faithful face restoration. In Degradation mode, the model synthesizes
real-world like degraded images based on the knowledge learned from real-world
degradation datasets. Extensive evaluations on benchmark datasets show that our
model 1) outperforms previous diffusion prior based BFR methods in terms of
authenticity and fidelity, and 2) outperforms the naive degradation model in
modeling the real-world degradations.

### [122] [Think as Cardiac Sonographers: Marrying SAM with Left Ventricular Indicators Measurements According to Clinical Guidelines](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08566)
*Tuo Liu,Qinghan Yang,Yu Zhang,Rongjun Ge,Yang Chen,Guangquan Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces AutoSAME, a novel framework combining a vision foundational model (SAM) for LV segmentation and landmark localization to improve cardiovascular disease diagnosis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing algorithms struggle with LV quantification due to small training datasets, necessitating more robust models like vision foundational models (VFMs).

Method: AutoSAME integrates SAM with segmentation and landmark localization tasks, enhancing heatmap regression through Filtered Cross-Branch Attention (FCBA) and improving accuracy using Spatial-Guided Prompt Alignment (SGPA).

Result: AutoSAME achieved superior performance in LV segmentation, landmark localization, and indicator measurements on echocardiography datasets.

Conclusion: AutoSAME effectively mimics sonographers' operations, providing improved diagnostic measurements for cardiovascular disease aligned with clinical guidelines.

Abstract: Left ventricular (LV) indicator measurements following clinical
echocardiog-raphy guidelines are important for diagnosing cardiovascular
disease. Alt-hough existing algorithms have explored automated LV
quantification, they can struggle to capture generic visual representations due
to the normally small training datasets. Therefore, it is necessary to
introduce vision founda-tional models (VFM) with abundant knowledge. However,
VFMs represented by the segment anything model (SAM) are usually suitable for
segmentation but incapable of identifying key anatomical points, which are
critical in LV indicator measurements. In this paper, we propose a novel
framework named AutoSAME, combining the powerful visual understanding of SAM
with seg-mentation and landmark localization tasks simultaneously.
Consequently, the framework mimics the operation of cardiac sonographers,
achieving LV indi-cator measurements consistent with clinical guidelines. We
further present fil-tered cross-branch attention (FCBA) in AutoSAME, which
leverages relatively comprehensive features in the segmentation to enhance the
heatmap regression (HR) of key points from the frequency domain perspective,
optimizing the vis-ual representation learned by the latter. Moreover, we
propose spatial-guided prompt alignment (SGPA) to automatically generate prompt
embeddings guid-ed by spatial properties of LV, thereby improving the accuracy
of dense pre-dictions by prior spatial knowledge. The extensive experiments on
an echocar-diography dataset demonstrate the efficiency of each design and the
superiori-ty of our AutoSAME in LV segmentation, landmark localization, and
indicator measurements. The code will be available at

*Chenruo Liu,Hongjun Liu,Zeyu Lai,Yiqiu Shen,Chen Zhao,Qi Lei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a method to enhance robustness against spurious correlations using superclass information without relying on group annotations or assumptions on identical source-target domain groups.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods that focus on group robustness require impractical annotations and assumptions about domain consistency, limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios.

Method: The method uses gradient-based attention guided by a pre-trained vision-language model to disentangle features related or unrelated to superclasses and leverages all superclass-relevant features for robust predictions, removing reliance on annotations.

Result: The approach demonstrates significant improvement over baselines across multiple datasets in domain generalization tasks, supported by strong quantitative metrics and qualitative visual analyses.

Conclusion: The use of superclass semantics and gradient-based disentanglement provides a practical and annotation-free solution for improving robustness to complex spurious correlations across domains.

Abstract: To enhance group robustness to spurious correlations, prior work often relies
on auxiliary annotations for groups or spurious features and assumes identical
sets of groups across source and target domains. These two requirements are
both unnatural and impractical in real-world settings. To overcome these
limitations, we propose a method that leverages the semantic structure inherent
in class labels--specifically, superclass information--to naturally reduce
reliance on spurious features. Our model employs gradient-based attention
guided by a pre-trained vision-language model to disentangle
superclass-relevant and irrelevant features. Then, by promoting the use of all
superclass-relevant features for prediction, our approach achieves robustness
to more complex spurious correlations without the need to annotate any source
samples. Experiments across diverse datasets demonstrate that our method
significantly outperforms baselines in domain generalization tasks, with clear
improvements in both quantitative metrics and qualitative visualizations.

*Jingyun Liang,Jingkai Zhou,Shikai Li,Chenjie Cao,Lei Sun,Yichen Qian,Weihua Chen,Fan Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a framework for generating human videos with precise control over subject, background, trajectory, and actions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video generation methods lack the ability to independently control key video elements like subject appearance, background, trajectory, and action patterns.

Method: The framework uses a ground-aware 3D world system for motion editing, trajectory control in 3D space with calibration, and integrates text-to-video diffusion transformer models for combining video elements.

Result: Extensive experiments show superior controllability and video quality, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The proposed method enables realistic videos with unmatched flexibility, allowing creative combinations of people, actions, and scenes.

Abstract: Generating human videos with realistic and controllable motions is a
challenging task. While existing methods can generate visually compelling
videos, they lack separate control over four key video elements: foreground
subject, background video, human trajectory and action patterns. In this paper,
we propose a decomposed human motion control and video generation framework
that explicitly decouples motion from appearance, subject from background, and
action from trajectory, enabling flexible mix-and-match composition of these
elements. Concretely, we first build a ground-aware 3D world coordinate system
and perform motion editing directly in the 3D space. Trajectory control is
implemented by unprojecting edited 2D trajectories into 3D with focal-length
calibration and coordinate transformation, followed by speed alignment and
orientation adjustment; actions are supplied by a motion bank or generated via
text-to-motion methods. Then, based on modern text-to-video diffusion
transformer models, we inject the subject as tokens for full attention,
concatenate the background along the channel dimension, and add motion
(trajectory and action) control signals by addition. Such a design opens up the
possibility for us to generate realistic videos of anyone doing anything
anywhere. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets and real-world cases
demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on both
element-wise controllability and overall video quality.

*Wenwen Yu,Zhibo Yang,Yuliang Liu,Xiang Bai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DocThinker introduces a rule-based Reinforcement Learning framework to address the limitations of reasoning in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) and enhances explainability, adaptability, and generalization in document understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for reasoning in MLLMs rely on static templates and supervised fine-tuning, leading to issues like catastrophic forgetting and limited adaptability in high-stakes domains such as legal and medical document analysis.

Method: The paper introduces DocThinker, which utilizes RL policy learning for dynamic inference-time reasoning, generating explainable intermediate outputs like structured reasoning processes and identified Regions of Interest (RoI). Multi-objective rewards and KL-constrained optimization are employed to improve adaptability and transparency.

Result: Extensive benchmarks show that DocThinker outperforms existing methods in generalization and produces more explainable and human-understandable reasoning steps.

Conclusion: DocThinker demonstrates RL as an effective alternative to traditional methods for document understanding in MLLMs, addressing challenges related to adaptability, generalization, and explainability.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in document understanding. However, their reasoning processes
remain largely black-box, making it difficult to ensure reliability and
trustworthiness, especially in high-stakes domains such as legal, financial,
and medical document analysis. Existing methods use fixed Chain-of-Thought
(CoT) reasoning with supervised fine-tuning (SFT) but suffer from catastrophic
forgetting, poor adaptability, and limited generalization across domain tasks.
In this paper, we propose DocThinker, a rule-based Reinforcement Learning (RL)
framework for dynamic inference-time reasoning. Instead of relying on static
CoT templates, DocThinker autonomously refines reasoning strategies via policy
learning, generating explainable intermediate results, including structured
reasoning processes, rephrased questions, regions of interest (RoI) supporting
the answer, and the final answer. By integrating multi-objective rule-based
rewards and KL-constrained optimization, our method mitigates catastrophic
forgetting and enhances both adaptability and transparency. Extensive
experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that DocThinker significantly
improves generalization while producing more explainable and
human-understandable reasoning steps. Our findings highlight RL as a powerful
alternative for enhancing explainability and adaptability in MLLM-based
document understanding. Code will be available at

*Yuxiao Wang,Wolin Liang,Yu Lei,Weiying Xue,Nan Zhuang,Qi Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces QueryCraft, an HOI detection framework incorporating semantic priors and guided feature learning for enhanced performance. It includes the ACTOR module for action-aware feature extraction and the PDQD module for object query quality, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current DETR-based methods for HOI detection suffer from the limitation of randomly initialized queries lacking explicit semantics, which affects detection performance.

Method: The proposed framework incorporates the ACTOR module, a cross-modal Transformer that attends to visual regions and textual prompts, and the PDQD module, which distills object category awareness from pre-trained detectors for query initialization.

Result: QueryCraft demonstrates state-of-the-art performance and strong generalization on HICO-Det and V-COCO benchmarks.

Conclusion: The method effectively enhances HOI detection by leveraging semantically meaningful query representations and addressing the limitations of existing DETR-based methods.

Abstract: Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection aims to localize human-object pairs
and recognize their interactions in images. Although DETR-based methods have
recently emerged as the mainstream framework for HOI detection, they still
suffer from a key limitation: Randomly initialized queries lack explicit
semantics, leading to suboptimal detection performance. To address this
challenge, we propose QueryCraft, a novel plug-and-play HOI detection framework
that incorporates semantic priors and guided feature learning through
transformer-based query initialization. Central to our approach is
\textbf{ACTOR} (\textbf{A}ction-aware \textbf{C}ross-modal
\textbf{T}ransf\textbf{OR}mer), a cross-modal Transformer encoder that jointly
attends to visual regions and textual prompts to extract action-relevant
features. Rather than merely aligning modalities, ACTOR leverages
language-guided attention to infer interaction semantics and produce
semantically meaningful query representations. To further enhance object-level
query quality, we introduce a \textbf{P}erceptual \textbf{D}istilled
\textbf{Q}uery \textbf{D}ecoder (\textbf{PDQD}), which distills object category
awareness from a pre-trained detector to serve as object query initiation. This
dual-branch query initialization enables the model to generate more
interpretable and effective queries for HOI detection. Extensive experiments on
HICO-Det and V-COCO benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance and strong generalization. Code will be released
upon publication.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a unified, AI-driven framework for interactive video generation that combines simulation, generation, and editing.

Method: Yan integrates three modules: (1) a compressed, low-latency 3D-VAE for real-time simulation; (2) a multi-modal hierarchical autoregressive generation model for customizable, domain-agnostic video creation; and (3) a hybrid editing model that separates simulation mechanics from rendering for multi-granularity text-based editing.

Result: Yan achieves real-time 1080P/60FPS simulation, strong cross-domain generalization in video generation, and flexible content editing capabilities.

Conclusion: Yan represents a significant step forward in interactive video generation, enabling advanced creative tools for media and entertainment.

Abstract: We present Yan, a foundational framework for interactive video generation,
covering the entire pipeline from simulation and generation to editing.
Specifically, Yan comprises three core modules. AAA-level Simulation: We design
a highly-compressed, low-latency 3D-VAE coupled with a KV-cache-based
shift-window denoising inference process, achieving real-time 1080P/60FPS
interactive simulation. Multi-Modal Generation: We introduce a hierarchical
autoregressive caption method that injects game-specific knowledge into
open-domain multi-modal video diffusion models (VDMs), then transforming the
VDM into a frame-wise, action-controllable, real-time infinite interactive
video generator. Notably, when the textual and visual prompts are sourced from
different domains, the model demonstrates strong generalization, allowing it to
blend and compose the style and mechanics across domains flexibly according to
user prompts. Multi-Granularity Editing: We propose a hybrid model that
explicitly disentangles interactive mechanics simulation from visual rendering,
enabling multi-granularity video content editing during interaction through
text. Collectively, Yan offers an integration of these modules, pushing
interactive video generation beyond isolated capabilities toward a
comprehensive AI-driven interactive creation paradigm, paving the way for the
next generation of creative tools, media, and entertainment. The project page

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces TransMiter, a light-weight adapter for vision-language models (VLMs) to improve their performance and transfer knowledge in a model-agnostic and computation-efficient manner.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance stronger VLM models using adaptation knowledge from weaker ones due to the high cost of fine-tuning large and complex models.

Method: Developed TransMiter, a lightweight adapter that captures knowledge gaps between pre-trained and fine-tuned VLMs without backpropagation, and works in a transferable, unsupervised manner. Its layers induce negligible additional inference cost.

Result: TransMiter effectively transfers adaptation knowledge across VLM models of different sizes and architectures, preserving their generalization. Using additional labeled data improves performance further, often surpassing traditional fine-tuned results.

Conclusion: TransMiter offers a computationally efficient and transferable approach for adapting and improving VLMs while maintaining their generalization capabilities.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have been widely used in various visual
recognition tasks due to their remarkable generalization capabilities. As these
models grow in size and complexity, fine-tuning becomes costly, emphasizing the
need to reuse adaptation knowledge from 'weaker' models to efficiently enhance
'stronger' ones. However, existing adaptation transfer methods exhibit limited
transferability across models due to their model-specific design and high
computational demands. To tackle this, we propose Transferable Model-agnostic
adapter (TransMiter), a light-weight adapter that improves vision-language
models 'without backpropagation'. TransMiter captures the knowledge gap between
pre-trained and fine-tuned VLMs, in an 'unsupervised' manner. Once trained,
this knowledge can be seamlessly transferred across different models without
the need for backpropagation. Moreover, TransMiter consists of only a few
layers, inducing a negligible additional inference cost. Notably, supplementing
the process with a few labeled data further yields additional performance gain,
often surpassing a fine-tuned stronger model, with a marginal training cost.
Experimental results and analyses demonstrate that TransMiter effectively and
efficiently transfers adaptation knowledge while preserving generalization
abilities across VLMs of different sizes and architectures in visual
recognition tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issue of blurry frames in handheld mobile phone videos caused by instability factors, as existing deblurring methods perform poorly on real-world footage due to domain gaps.

Method: The authors propose a self-supervised framework that extracts sharp frames from video to train the deblurring model, uses a Self-Enhanced Video Deblurring (SEVD) technique to enhance input data, and applies a Self-Constrained Spatial Consistency Maintenance (SCSCM) method to maintain spatial alignment.

Result: Extensive experiments on both new and existing handheld video datasets verify that the proposed method surpasses current self-supervised deblurring models in performance.

Conclusion: The proposed self-supervised approach successfully improves handheld video deblurring, bridging the domain gap and enhancing real-world application capability. The code and datasets are publicly accessible.

Abstract: Shooting video with a handheld mobile phone, the most common photographic
device, often results in blurry frames due to shaking hands and other
instability factors. Although previous video deblurring methods have achieved
impressive progress, they still struggle to perform satisfactorily on
real-world handheld video due to the blur domain gap between training and
testing data. To address the issue, we propose a self-supervised method for
handheld video deblurring, which is driven by sharp clues in the video. First,
to train the deblurring model, we extract the sharp clues from the video and
take them as misalignment labels of neighboring blurry frames. Second, to
improve the model's ability, we propose a novel Self-Enhanced Video Deblurring
(SEVD) method to create higher-quality paired video data. Third, we propose a
Self-Constrained Spatial Consistency Maintenance (SCSCM) method to regularize
the model, preventing position shifts between the output and input frames.
Moreover, we construct a synthetic and a real-world handheld video dataset for
handheld video deblurring. Extensive experiments on these two and other common
real-world datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms
existing self-supervised ones. The code and datasets are publicly available at

*Justin London*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper combines neural artistic style transfer with color transfer using deep learning and Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence to evaluate color and luminance matching techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance artistic visuals and image correction by merging neural artistic style transfers with effective color transfer algorithms, fulfilling needs in fields like art, design, and film.

Method: The methodology evaluates color and luminance matching algorithms (e.g., Reinhard global color transfer, IDT, Cholesky, PCA) using KL divergence to compare color histograms of neural style-transferred images.

Result: Experiments were conducted to examine the effectiveness of these algorithms in achieving better style-to-content transfers via color distribution analysis.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates a quantitative way to optimize color and style integrations, enhancing the utility of neural style transfer and color adjustments in artistic and corrective applications.

Abstract: Neural artistic style transfers and blends the content and style
representation of one image with the style of another. This enables artists to
create unique innovative visuals and enhances artistic expression in various
fields including art, design, and film. Color transfer algorithms are an
important in digital image processing by adjusting the color information in a
target image based on the colors in the source image. Color transfer enhances
images and videos in film and photography, and can aid in image correction. We
introduce a methodology that combines neural artistic style with color
transfer. The method uses the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence to
quantitatively evaluate color and luminance histogram matching algorithms
including Reinhard global color transfer, iteration distribution transfer
(IDT), IDT with regrain, Cholesky, and PCA between the original and neural
artistic style transferred image using deep learning. We estimate the color
channel kernel densities. Various experiments are performed to evaluate the KL
of these algorithms and their color histograms for style to content transfer.

### [131] [Hierarchical Visual Prompt Learning for Continual Video Instance Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08612)
*Jiahua Dong,Hui Yin,Wenqi Liang,Hanbin Zhao,Henghui Ding,Nicu Sebe,Salman Khan,Fahad Shahbaz Khan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel model, Hierarchical Visual Prompt Learning (HVPL), for video instance segmentation that addresses the issue of catastrophic forgetting in existing methods when learning new object categories over time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video instance segmentation methods assume fixed object categories in videos over time and suffer from catastrophic forgetting of old classes when learning new ones.

Method: The HVPL model employs a task-specific frame prompt and an orthogonal gradient correction (OGC) module to handle forgetting at the frame level, and a task-specific video prompt combined with a video context decoder to mitigate forgetting at the video level.

Result: The HVPL model achieves superior performance in mitigating catastrophic forgetting compared to baseline methods, ensuring robust segmentation and tracking of object instances across video frames.

Conclusion: HVPL effectively addresses the limitations of existing video instance segmentation methods by introducing hierarchical prompt-based learning techniques that maintain knowledge of old categories while adapting to new ones.

Abstract: Video instance segmentation (VIS) has gained significant attention for its
capability in tracking and segmenting object instances across video frames.
However, most of the existing VIS approaches unrealistically assume that the
categories of object instances remain fixed over time. Moreover, they
experience catastrophic forgetting of old classes when required to continuously
learn object instances belonging to new categories. To resolve these
challenges, we develop a novel Hierarchical Visual Prompt Learning (HVPL) model
that overcomes catastrophic forgetting of previous categories from both
frame-level and video-level perspectives. Specifically, to mitigate forgetting
at the frame level, we devise a task-specific frame prompt and an orthogonal
gradient correction (OGC) module. The OGC module helps the frame prompt encode
task-specific global instance information for new classes in each individual
frame by projecting its gradients onto the orthogonal feature space of old
classes. Furthermore, to address forgetting at the video level, we design a
task-specific video prompt and a video context decoder. This decoder first
embeds structural inter-class relationships across frames into the frame prompt
features, and then propagates task-specific global video contexts from the
frame prompt features to the video prompt. Through rigorous comparisons, our
HVPL model proves to be more effective than baseline approaches. The code is
available at https://github.com/JiahuaDong/HVPL.

### [132] [AME: Aligned Manifold Entropy for Robust Vision-Language Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08644)
*Guiming Cao,Yuming Ou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces AME, a framework for robust vision-language distillation using minimal data by entropy minimization on a shared manifold.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge is effective vision-language knowledge distillation, especially under low-data regimes, to handle uncertainty in cross-modal representations.

Method: AME incorporates entropy minimization within a shared manifold created by projection functions bridging text and image data, aiding in structural compression.

Result: AME performs well in low-data setups, achieves robust knowledge transfer, and improves generalization across various tasks and architectures without altering the backbone.

Conclusion: The proposed AME framework is effective, versatile, and enhances vision-language distillation, with strong theoretical and experimental support.

Abstract: Knowledge distillation is a long-established technique for knowledge
transfer, and has regained attention in the context of the recent emergence of
large vision-language models (VLMs). However, vision-language knowledge
distillation often requires sufficient training data to achieve robust
generalization on amples with ambiguous or boundary-adjacent representations,
which are associated with high predictive uncertainty. Critically, collecting
such large-scale, task-specific data for training is often impractical in
real-world scenarios. To address this major challenge arising from the
entanglement of uncertainty and cross-modal feature representation, we propose
Aligned Manifold Entropy for Robust Vision-Language Distillation (AME), aiming
to achieve robust generalization under real-world conditions. AME applies
entropy minimization over a reconfigured shared manifold, where multi-modal
data (i.e., image and text) are bridged through a pair of projection functions,
conducive to structural compression for cross-modal feature representations.
This enables robust knowledge distillation under low-data regimes, while
requiring no architectural modifications to the backbone. As a result, it can
serve as a plug-and-play module compatible with a wide range of vision-language
distillation frameworks. Notably, our theoretical analysis reveals that
integrating knowledge distillation with entropy minimization over the shared
manifold leads to a tighter generalization error bound. Extensive experiments
across diverse distillation architectures and training settings demonstrate
that AME consistently facilitates robust knowledge distillation, resulting in
superior generalization performance across a wide spectrum of downstream tasks.

### [133] [Unified and Semantically Grounded Domain Adaptation for Medical Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08660)
*Xin Wang,Yin Guo,Jiamin Xia,Kaiyu Zhang,Niranjan Balu,Mahmud Mossa-Basha,Linda Shapiro,Chun Yuan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a unified, domain-agnostic framework for unsupervised domain adaptation in medical image segmentation, applicable to both source-accessible and source-free settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing domain adaptation methods in medical image segmentation are limited by their focus on either source-accessible or source-free settings, lacking a unified framework that generalizes anatomical knowledge effectively across domains.

Method: The framework learns a domain-agnostic probabilistic manifold representing global anatomical regularities. Structural content in images is disentangled into a canonical anatomy retrieved from this manifold and individual-specific geometry, enabling semantically grounded predictions.

Result: The proposed framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging cardiac and abdominal datasets in both source-accessible and source-free settings. Source-free performance closely matches the source-accessible results, showcasing notable consistency.

Conclusion: This framework offers a novel, interpretable formulation for domain adaptation, overcoming past limitations while achieving strong performance and enabling smooth shape manipulation via manifold traversal.

Abstract: Most prior unsupervised domain adaptation approaches for medical image
segmentation are narrowly tailored to either the source-accessible setting,
where adaptation is guided by source-target alignment, or the source-free
setting, which typically resorts to implicit supervision mechanisms such as
pseudo-labeling and model distillation. This substantial divergence in
methodological designs between the two settings reveals an inherent flaw: the
lack of an explicit, structured construction of anatomical knowledge that
naturally generalizes across domains and settings. To bridge this longstanding
divide, we introduce a unified, semantically grounded framework that supports
both source-accessible and source-free adaptation. Fundamentally distinct from
all prior works, our framework's adaptability emerges naturally as a direct
consequence of the model architecture, without the need for any handcrafted
adaptation strategies. Specifically, our model learns a domain-agnostic
probabilistic manifold as a global space of anatomical regularities, mirroring
how humans establish visual understanding. Thus, the structural content in each
image can be interpreted as a canonical anatomy retrieved from the manifold and
a spatial transformation capturing individual-specific geometry. This
disentangled, interpretable formulation enables semantically meaningful
prediction with intrinsic adaptability. Extensive experiments on challenging
cardiac and abdominal datasets show that our framework achieves
state-of-the-art results in both settings, with source-free performance closely
approaching its source-accessible counterpart, a level of consistency rarely
observed in prior works. Beyond quantitative improvement, we demonstrate strong
interpretability of the proposed framework via manifold traversal for smooth
shape manipulation.

### [134] [Learning Generalizable and Efficient Image Watermarking via Hierarchical Two-Stage Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08667)
*Ke Liu,Xuanhan Wang,Qilong Zhang,Lianli Gao,Jingkuan Song*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Hierarchical Watermark Learning (HiWL), a new deep image watermarking approach that excels in invisibility, robustness, and applicability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing image watermarking methods struggle to balance invisibility, robustness, and broad applicability simultaneously.

Method: The method uses a two-stage optimization: first, distribution alignment learning for consistent representations; second, disentanglement of watermarks from content using a generalized representation.

Result: HiWL outperforms existing methods, achieving 7.6% higher watermark extraction accuracy while maintaining high speed (100K images processed in 8 seconds).

Conclusion: HiWL demonstrates an efficient and highly generalizable approach to deep image watermarking, meeting essential criteria with strong performance.

Abstract: Deep image watermarking, which refers to enable imperceptible watermark
embedding and reliable extraction in cover images, has shown to be effective
for copyright protection of image assets. However, existing methods face
limitations in simultaneously satisfying three essential criteria for
generalizable watermarking: 1) invisibility (imperceptible hide of watermarks),
2) robustness (reliable watermark recovery under diverse conditions), and 3)
broad applicability (low latency in watermarking process). To address these
limitations, we propose a Hierarchical Watermark Learning (HiWL), a two-stage
optimization that enable a watermarking model to simultaneously achieve three
criteria. In the first stage, distribution alignment learning is designed to
establish a common latent space with two constraints: 1) visual consistency
between watermarked and non-watermarked images, and 2) information invariance
across watermark latent representations. In this way, multi-modal inputs
including watermark message (binary codes) and cover images (RGB pixels) can be
well represented, ensuring the invisibility of watermarks and robustness in
watermarking process thereby. The second stage employs generalized watermark
representation learning to establish a disentanglement policy for separating
watermarks from image content in RGB space. In particular, it strongly
penalizes substantial fluctuations in separated RGB watermarks corresponding to
identical messages. Consequently, HiWL effectively learns generalizable
latent-space watermark representations while maintaining broad applicability.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed method. In
particular, it achieves 7.6\% higher accuracy in watermark extraction than
existing methods, while maintaining extremely low latency (100K images
processed in 8s).

*Tao Luo,Weihua Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MMIF-AMIN, a novel method for multimodal medical image fusion (MMIF) that effectively extracts unique and complementary features across modalities using advanced architectures and loss functions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of simultaneously capturing unique and complementary information from different medical imaging modalities for enhanced diagnosis.

Method: The method employs an Invertible Dense Network (IDN) for feature extraction, a Multi-scale Complementary Feature Extraction Module (MCFEM) with hybrid attention mechanisms and Transformers, and an adaptive loss function to improve data representation.

Result: MMIF-AMIN significantly outperformed nine state-of-the-art MMIF methods in quantitative and qualitative evaluations, with ablation studies validating its components.

Conclusion: MMIF-AMIN is a robust method for multimodal image fusion, offering high-quality outputs and demonstrating promising adaptability for other image fusion tasks.

Abstract: Multimodal medical image fusion (MMIF) aims to integrate images from
different modalities to produce a comprehensive image that enhances medical
diagnosis by accurately depicting organ structures, tissue textures, and
metabolic information. Capturing both the unique and complementary information
across multiple modalities simultaneously is a key research challenge in MMIF.
To address this challenge, this paper proposes a novel image fusion method,
MMIF-AMIN, which features a new architecture that can effectively extract these
unique and complementary features. Specifically, an Invertible Dense Network
(IDN) is employed for lossless feature extraction from individual modalities.
To extract complementary information between modalities, a Multi-scale
Complementary Feature Extraction Module (MCFEM) is designed, which incorporates
a hybrid attention mechanism, convolutional layers of varying sizes, and
Transformers. An adaptive loss function is introduced to guide model learning,
addressing the limitations of traditional manually-designed loss functions and
enhancing the depth of data mining. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
MMIF-AMIN outperforms nine state-of-the-art MMIF methods, delivering superior
results in both quantitative and qualitative analyses. Ablation experiments
confirm the effectiveness of each component of the proposed method.
Additionally, extending MMIF-AMIN to other image fusion tasks also achieves
promising performance.

*Yimeng Geng,Mingyang Zhao,Fan Xu,Guanglin Cao,Gaofeng Meng,Hongbin Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PADReg introduces a novel physics-aware deformable registration framework for ultrasound imaging using contact force as a guiding physical constraint.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in ultrasound deformable registration such as poor contrast, noise, and ambiguous tissue boundaries hindering feature extraction and biomechanical property estimation, especially in applications like thyroid and breast cancer diagnosis.

Method: A framework combining contact force and ultrasound imaging data to construct stiffness maps, which are used in a lightweight physics-aware module inspired by Hooke's law to estimate deformation fields with improved anatomical alignment.

Result: PADReg achieves a HD95 of 12.90, improving anatomical alignment accuracy by 21.34% compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: PADReg successfully leverages physical priors for more accurate and physically plausible ultrasound image registration, presenting a significant improvement over previous approaches.

Abstract: Ultrasound deformable registration estimates spatial transformations between
pairs of deformed ultrasound images, which is crucial for capturing
biomechanical properties and enhancing diagnostic accuracy in diseases such as
thyroid nodules and breast cancer. However, ultrasound deformable registration
remains highly challenging, especially under large deformation. The inherently
low contrast, heavy noise and ambiguous tissue boundaries in ultrasound images
severely hinder reliable feature extraction and correspondence matching.
Existing methods often suffer from poor anatomical alignment and lack physical
interpretability. To address the problem, we propose PADReg, a physics-aware
deformable registration framework guided by contact force. PADReg leverages
synchronized contact force measured by robotic ultrasound systems as a physical
prior to constrain the registration. Specifically, instead of directly
predicting deformation fields, we first construct a pixel-wise stiffness map
utilizing the multi-modal information from contact force and ultrasound images.
The stiffness map is then combined with force data to estimate a dense
deformation field, through a lightweight physics-aware module inspired by
Hooke's law. This design enables PADReg to achieve physically plausible
registration with better anatomical alignment than previous methods relying
solely on image similarity. Experiments on in-vivo datasets demonstrate that it
attains a HD95 of 12.90, which is 21.34\% better than state-of-the-art methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces ROD, an RGB-only approach for off-road freespace detection, overcoming challenges of blurred boundaries and computational inefficiencies in LiDAR-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenges of blurred boundaries in off-road freespace detection and to eliminate the dependency on computationally expensive LiDAR data for real-time applications.

Method: The approach employs a pre-trained Vision Transformer (ViT) to extract feature-rich RGB image data and a lightweight, efficient decoder to enhance precision and speed.

Result: The ROD model achieves state-of-the-art performance on ORFD and RELLIS-3D datasets with an inference speed of 50 frames per second.

Conclusion: ROD provides a LiDAR-free, fast, and accurate solution for off-road freespace detection, making it suitable for real-time applications.

Abstract: Off-road freespace detection is more challenging than on-road scenarios
because of the blurred boundaries of traversable areas. Previous
state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods employ multi-modal fusion of RGB images and
LiDAR data. However, due to the significant increase in inference time when
calculating surface normal maps from LiDAR data, multi-modal methods are not
suitable for real-time applications, particularly in real-world scenarios where
higher FPS is required compared to slow navigation. This paper presents a novel
RGB-only approach for off-road freespace detection, named ROD, eliminating the
reliance on LiDAR data and its computational demands. Specifically, we utilize
a pre-trained Vision Transformer (ViT) to extract rich features from RGB
images. Additionally, we design a lightweight yet efficient decoder, which
together improve both precision and inference speed. ROD establishes a new SOTA
on ORFD and RELLIS-3D datasets, as well as an inference speed of 50 FPS,
significantly outperforming prior models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a robotic system combining ultrasound (US) imaging and real-time deep learning-based shape completion to improve spinal procedure visualization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the limitations of traditional CT-to-US registration methods and shadow artifacts in US imaging, which hinder deep tissue visualization during spinal procedures.

Method: The approach involves a robotic platform autonomously acquiring ultrasound sweeps, extracting vertebral surfaces, and employing a deep learning shape completion network for anatomy reconstruction in real-time.

Result: The system demonstrated improved accuracy through quantitative experiments and successful application in phantom setups. Additionally, qualitative results showed enhanced visualization during volunteer scans.

Conclusion: The proposed system offers improved consistency, reproducibility, and better understanding of spinal anatomy, with potential navigation benefits for clinical spinal procedures.

Abstract: Ultrasound (US) imaging is increasingly used in spinal procedures due to its
real-time, radiation-free capabilities; however, its effectiveness is hindered
by shadowing artifacts that obscure deeper tissue structures. Traditional
approaches, such as CT-to-US registration, incorporate anatomical information
from preoperative CT scans to guide interventions, but they are limited by
complex registration requirements, differences in spine curvature, and the need
for recent CT imaging. Recent shape completion methods can offer an alternative
by reconstructing spinal structures in US data, while being pretrained on large
set of publicly available CT scans. However, these approaches are typically
offline and have limited reproducibility. In this work, we introduce a novel
integrated system that combines robotic ultrasound with real-time shape
completion to enhance spinal visualization. Our robotic platform autonomously
acquires US sweeps of the lumbar spine, extracts vertebral surfaces from
ultrasound, and reconstructs the complete anatomy using a deep learning-based
shape completion network. This framework provides interactive, real-time
visualization with the capability to autonomously repeat scans and can enable
navigation to target locations. This can contribute to better consistency,
reproducibility, and understanding of the underlying anatomy. We validate our
approach through quantitative experiments assessing shape completion accuracy
and evaluations of multiple spine acquisition protocols on a phantom setup.
Additionally, we present qualitative results of the visualization on a
volunteer scan.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper addresses banding artifacts in compressed videos and introduces a new dataset and a no-reference video quality evaluator, CBAND, which outperforms prior models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically tackle the issue of banding artifacts, which degrade the quality of high-definition videos and lack proper datasets to study temporal dynamics.

Method: The authors created the LIVE-YT-Banding dataset, collected subjective ratings from 45 participants, and introduced CBAND, a model that uses deep neural network embeddings to predict perceptual quality without references.

Result: CBAND significantly outperformed existing models in predicting banding perceptual quality and is much faster. It also serves as a differentiable loss function for debanding optimization.

Conclusion: The paper advances the understanding of banding artifacts with a new dataset and model, laying the groundwork for better video quality assessment and enhancement solutions.

Abstract: Although there have been notable advancements in video compression
technologies in recent years, banding artifacts remain a serious issue
affecting the quality of compressed videos, particularly on smooth regions of
high-definition videos. Noticeable banding artifacts can severely impact the
perceptual quality of videos viewed on a high-end HDTV or high-resolution
screen. Hence, there is a pressing need for a systematic investigation of the
banding video quality assessment problem for advanced video codecs. Given that
the existing publicly available datasets for studying banding artifacts are
limited to still picture data only, which cannot account for temporal banding
dynamics, we have created a first-of-a-kind open video dataset, dubbed
LIVE-YT-Banding, which consists of 160 videos generated by four different
compression parameters using the AV1 video codec. A total of 7,200 subjective
opinions are collected from a cohort of 45 human subjects. To demonstrate the
value of this new resources, we tested and compared a variety of models that
detect banding occurrences, and measure their impact on perceived quality.
Among these, we introduce an effective and efficient new no-reference (NR)
video quality evaluator which we call CBAND. CBAND leverages the properties of
the learned statistics of natural images expressed in the embeddings of deep
neural networks. Our experimental results show that the perceptual banding
prediction performance of CBAND significantly exceeds that of previous
state-of-the-art models, and is also orders of magnitude faster. Moreover,
CBAND can be employed as a differentiable loss function to optimize video
debanding models. The LIVE-YT-Banding database, code, and pre-trained model are
all publically available at https://github.com/uniqzheng/CBAND.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to enhance the capabilities of Vision-Language-Action models by simultaneously capturing spatial and temporal information, addressing limitations in prior approaches that treated these aspects independently.

Method: It proposes projecting visual traces of key points from observations onto depth maps, enabling an integrated capture of spatial and temporal aspects. The approach is evaluated using experiments in SimplerEnv.

Result: The proposed method achieved a 4% improvement in solving tasks compared to SpatialVLA and a 19% improvement compared to TraceVLA, demonstrating its efficacy.

Conclusion: Integrating spatial and temporal understanding via visual prompting enhances Vision-Language-Action models with minimal training data, offering significant benefits for real-world applications.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
predicting agent movements within virtual environments and real-world scenarios
based on visual observations and textual instructions. Although recent research
has focused on enhancing spatial and temporal understanding independently, this
paper presents a novel approach that integrates both aspects through visual
prompting. We introduce a method that projects visual traces of key points from
observations onto depth maps, enabling models to capture both spatial and
temporal information simultaneously. The experiments in SimplerEnv show that
the mean number of tasks successfully solved increased for 4% compared to
SpatialVLA and 19% compared to TraceVLA. Furthermore, we show that this
enhancement can be achieved with minimal training data, making it particularly
valuable for real-world applications where data collection is challenging. The

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a model repair module using conditional text-to-image generation and large vision-language model filtering to improve visual recognition models' robustness against systematic failures in underrepresented semantic subpopulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Visual recognition models often fail in underrepresented semantic subpopulations. Current debugging focuses on identifying failures but struggles to repair them effectively due to issues like distribution shift and semantic errors in synthetic data.

Method: Leverages interpretable failure attribution to guide image generation using conditional text-to-image models. Deploys a large vision-language model (LVLM) for filtering synthetic generated samples for quality and semantic consistency before retraining the vision model.

Result: Significant error reductions for rare cases in visual recognition tasks. Experiments show improved robustness while avoiding the introduction of new bugs.

Conclusion: Targeted model repair through rare-case-augmented synthetic datasets effectively addresses systematic errors in visual recognition, enhancing robustness without sacrificing accuracy.

Abstract: Deep learning models for visual recognition often exhibit systematic errors
due to underrepresented semantic subpopulations. Although existing debugging
frameworks can pinpoint these failures by identifying key failure attributes,
repairing the model effectively remains difficult. Current solutions often rely
on manually designed prompts to generate synthetic training images -- an
approach prone to distribution shift and semantic errors. To overcome these
challenges, we introduce a model repair module that builds on an interpretable
failure attribution pipeline. Our approach uses a conditional text-to-image
model to generate semantically faithful and targeted images for failure cases.
To preserve the quality and relevance of the generated samples, we further
employ a large vision-language model (LVLM) to filter the outputs, enforcing
alignment with the original data distribution and maintaining semantic
consistency. By retraining vision models with this rare-case-augmented
synthetic dataset, we significantly reduce errors associated with rare cases.
Our experiments demonstrate that this targeted repair strategy improves model
robustness without introducing new bugs. Code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces an Adaptive Confidence-Wise (ACW) loss tailored for lens structure segmentation in cataract surgery, addressing inhomogeneous sub-regions and miscalibrated boundaries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve segmentation accuracy by leveraging inhomogeneous sub-region characteristics and expert annotation confidence in lens structure segmentation.

Method: ACW loss groups lens structure sub-regions into different confidence levels using thresholds, applies region-weighted loss, and incorporates a dynamic threshold optimization algorithm. It also introduces BECE as a new metric for boundary errors.

Result: ACW demonstrates significant performance gains, improving IoU by 6.13%, DSC by 4.33%, and reducing BECE by 4.79% in lens segmentation using U-Net.

Conclusion: ACW loss effectively addresses challenges in lens structure segmentation and offers measurable improvements over traditional loss methods, validated across datasets and segmentation networks.

Abstract: Precise lens structure segmentation is essential for the design of
intraocular lenses (IOLs) in cataract surgery. Existing deep segmentation
networks typically weight all pixels equally under cross-entropy (CE) loss,
overlooking the fact that sub-regions of lens structures are inhomogeneous
(e.g., some regions perform better than others) and that boundary regions often
suffer from poor segmentation calibration at the pixel level. Clinically,
experts annotate different sub-regions of lens structures with varying
confidence levels, considering factors such as sub-region proportions,
ambiguous boundaries, and lens structure shapes. Motivated by this observation,
we propose an Adaptive Confidence-Wise (ACW) loss to group each lens structure
sub-region into different confidence sub-regions via a confidence threshold
from the unique region aspect, aiming to exploit the potential of expert
annotation confidence prior. Specifically, ACW clusters each target region into
low-confidence and high-confidence groups and then applies a region-weighted
loss to reweigh each confidence group. Moreover, we design an adaptive
confidence threshold optimization algorithm to adjust the confidence threshold
of ACW dynamically. Additionally, to better quantify the miscalibration errors
in boundary region segmentation, we propose a new metric, termed Boundary
Expected Calibration Error (BECE). Extensive experiments on a clinical lens
structure AS-OCT dataset and other multi-structure datasets demonstrate that
our ACW significantly outperforms competitive segmentation loss methods across
different deep segmentation networks (e.g., MedSAM). Notably, our method
surpasses CE with 6.13% IoU gain, 4.33% DSC increase, and 4.79% BECE reduction
in lens structure segmentation under U-Net. The code of this paper is available

TL;DR: This paper introduces a framework to emulate the compression and resizing artifacts of social network video pipelines, improving the generalization of deepfake detection models to real-world conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deepfake detection models trained in controlled conditions fail to generalize well to real-world scenarios due to platform-specific video compression techniques that obscure forensic cues.

Method: The framework estimates the compression and resizing parameters of social networks using a small set of uploaded videos. It then uses these parameters to create a local emulator that replicates platform-specific video artifacts on large datasets without direct API access.

Result: The emulated data closely resembles real uploads' degradation patterns. Detectors fine-tuned on this emulated data perform comparably to those trained with actual shared media.

Conclusion: The proposed method is a scalable and practical solution to improve the real-world applicability of deepfake detection models, particularly for compressed video content in social media contexts.

Abstract: The growing presence of AI-generated videos on social networks poses new
challenges for deepfake detection, as detectors trained under controlled
conditions often fail to generalize to real-world scenarios. A key factor
behind this gap is the aggressive, proprietary compression applied by platforms
like YouTube and Facebook, which launder low-level forensic cues. However,
replicating these transformations at scale is difficult due to API limitations
and data-sharing constraints. For these reasons, we propose a first framework
that emulates the video sharing pipelines of social networks by estimating
compression and resizing parameters from a small set of uploaded videos. These
parameters enable a local emulator capable of reproducing platform-specific
artifacts on large datasets without direct API access. Experiments on
FaceForensics++ videos shared via social networks demonstrate that our emulated
data closely matches the degradation patterns of real uploads. Furthermore,
detectors fine-tuned on emulated videos achieve comparable performance to those
trained on actual shared media. Our approach offers a scalable and practical
solution for bridging the gap between lab-based training and real-world
deployment of deepfake detectors, particularly in the underexplored domain of
compressed video content.

TL;DR: ROOMELSA is a benchmark for testing 3D object retrieval systems using natural language queries in panoramic room images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most 3D retrieval systems focus on controlled, simple scenarios, but real-world applications deal with cluttered environments and vague language descriptions.

Method: ROOMELSA evaluates systems by requiring them to locate objects from panoramic room images and identify corresponding 3D models in a database. It provides extensive datasets and queries.

Result: While models performed well on coarse object retrieval, only one model ranked the correct match consistently. CLIP-based models exhibited minor errors in material and context recognition.

Conclusion: ROOMELSA provides a challenging benchmark for improving 3D recognition systems, emphasizing integration between visual understanding and language interpretation.

Abstract: Recent 3D retrieval systems are typically designed for simple, controlled
scenarios, such as identifying an object from a cropped image or a brief
description. However, real-world scenarios are more complex, often requiring
the recognition of an object in a cluttered scene based on a vague, free-form
description. To this end, we present ROOMELSA, a new benchmark designed to
evaluate a system's ability to interpret natural language. Specifically,
ROOMELSA attends to a specific region within a panoramic room image and
accurately retrieves the corresponding 3D model from a large database. In
addition, ROOMELSA includes over 1,600 apartment scenes, nearly 5,200 rooms,
and more than 44,000 targeted queries. Empirically, while coarse object
retrieval is largely solved, only one top-performing model consistently ranked
the correct match first across nearly all test cases. Notably, a lightweight
CLIP-based model also performed well, although it struggled with subtle
variations in materials, part structures, and contextual cues, resulting in
occasional errors. These findings highlight the importance of tightly
integrating visual and language understanding. By bridging the gap between
scene-level grounding and fine-grained 3D retrieval, ROOMELSA establishes a new
benchmark for advancing robust, real-world 3D recognition systems.

*Tianyu Xiong,Dayi Tan,Wei Tian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DiffPose-Animal introduces a novel diffusion-based framework for animal pose estimation that leverages large language models (LLMs) for semantic guidance, improving robustness and accuracy under challenging conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in animal pose estimation, such as interspecies morphological diversity, complex body structures, and limited annotated data.

Method: The paper proposes a diffusion-based framework that utilizes large language models (LLMs) for extracting anatomical priors and keypoint-wise semantics, integrating them with image features via cross-attention modules.

Result: Experiments on public animal pose datasets show enhanced effectiveness and generalization, especially in scenarios with diverse species, cluttered environments, and sparse keypoints.

Conclusion: DiffPose-Animal provides a semantically enriched, robust solution for animal pose estimation, outperforming traditional methods in complex and varied settings.

Abstract: Animal pose estimation is a fundamental task in computer vision, with growing
importance in ecological monitoring, behavioral analysis, and intelligent
livestock management. Compared to human pose estimation, animal pose estimation
is more challenging due to high interspecies morphological diversity, complex
body structures, and limited annotated data. In this work, we introduce
DiffPose-Animal, a novel diffusion-based framework for top-down animal pose
estimation. Unlike traditional heatmap regression methods, DiffPose-Animal
reformulates pose estimation as a denoising process under the generative
framework of diffusion models. To enhance semantic guidance during keypoint
generation, we leverage large language models (LLMs) to extract both global
anatomical priors and local keypoint-wise semantics based on species-specific
prompts. These textual priors are encoded and fused with image features via
cross-attention modules to provide biologically meaningful constraints
throughout the denoising process. Additionally, a diffusion-based keypoint
decoder is designed to progressively refine pose predictions, improving
robustness to occlusion and annotation sparsity. Extensive experiments on
public animal pose datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization
capability of our method, especially under challenging scenarios with diverse
species, cluttered backgrounds, and incomplete keypoints.

*Yingxue Pang,Shijie Zhao,Mengxi Guo,Junlin Li,Li Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces RPO-AdaSharp, a region-adaptive video sharpening model that improves perceptual video quality while optimizing bitrate allocation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Uniform sharpening fails to consider texture variations and increases bitrate, lacking techniques to allocate additional bits effectively.

Method: The method involves using the Coding Tree Unit (CTU) partition mask as prior information to guide sharpening and constrain bitrate allocation in an end-to-end model.

Result: Experiments on benchmarks showed that RPO-AdaSharp performs effectively, achieving perceptual enhancement and bitrate savings.

Conclusion: RPO-AdaSharp addresses shortcomings of uniform sharpening by improving video quality and optimally managing increased bitrate costs.

Abstract: Sharpening is a widely adopted video enhancement technique. However, uniform
sharpening intensity ignores texture variations, degrading video quality.
Sharpening also increases bitrate, and there's a lack of techniques to
optimally allocate these additional bits across diverse regions. Thus, this
paper proposes RPO-AdaSharp, an end-to-end region-adaptive video sharpening
model for both perceptual enhancement and bitrate savings. We use the coding
tree unit (CTU) partition mask as prior information to guide and constrain the
allocation of increased bits. Experiments on benchmarks demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed model qualitatively and quantitatively.

*Yao Lu,Jiawei Li,Ming Jiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MonoPartNeRF enhances monocular dynamic human rendering by addressing issues of unnatural part boundary transitions and occlusion recovery in complex poses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous methods struggle with handling complex pose variations, unnatural transitions at part boundaries, and occlusion reconstruction in monocular settings.

Method: MonoPartNeRF introduces a bidirectional deformation model and part-based pose embedding to enable smooth transitions and occlusion recovery. Techniques include sampling in a parameterized surface-time space, a consistency loss for artifact suppression, and dynamic texture modeling.

Result: Experiments on ZJU-MoCap and MonoCap datasets show that MonoPartNeRF outperforms prior methods in joint alignment, texture fidelity, and structural continuity under complex conditions.

Conclusion: MonoPartNeRF successfully enhances representational efficiency and robustness in dynamic human rendering, especially in challenging scenarios involving poses and occlusions.

Abstract: In recent years, Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have achieved remarkable
progress in dynamic human reconstruction and rendering. Part-based rendering
paradigms, guided by human segmentation, allow for flexible parameter
allocation based on structural complexity, thereby enhancing representational
efficiency. However, existing methods still struggle with complex pose
variations, often producing unnatural transitions at part boundaries and
failing to reconstruct occluded regions accurately in monocular settings. We
propose MonoPartNeRF, a novel framework for monocular dynamic human rendering
that ensures smooth transitions and robust occlusion recovery. First, we build
a bidirectional deformation model that combines rigid and non-rigid
transformations to establish a continuous, reversible mapping between
observation and canonical spaces. Sampling points are projected into a
parameterized surface-time space (u, v, t) to better capture non-rigid motion.
A consistency loss further suppresses deformation-induced artifacts and
discontinuities. We introduce a part-based pose embedding mechanism that
decomposes global pose vectors into local joint embeddings based on body
regions. This is combined with keyframe pose retrieval and interpolation, along
three orthogonal directions, to guide pose-aware feature sampling. A learnable
appearance code is integrated via attention to model dynamic texture changes
effectively. Experiments on the ZJU-MoCap and MonoCap datasets demonstrate that
our method significantly outperforms prior approaches under complex pose and
occlusion conditions, achieving superior joint alignment, texture fidelity, and
structural continuity.

*Luis S. Luevano,Pavel Korshunov,Sebastien Marcel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method for face aging and de-aging using StyleGAN2's latent space, avoiding complex conditioning methods like GANs and Diffusion models, while preserving identity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in current face aging/de-aging methods, including high data/training demands, inconsistent output, and poor identity preservation.

Method: Editing StyleGAN2's latent space using aging/de-aging directions modeled by SVMs and selecting features to ensure identity preservation with state-of-the-art face recognition systems.

Result: A practical formula to ensure identity preservation during face aging/de-aging and a publicly available synthetic face dataset generated for various benchmarks.

Conclusion: The method simplifies face aging/de-aging processes, enables identity-preserving transformations, and provides resources for related tasks, eliminating prior complexities.

Abstract: Face aging or de-aging with generative AI has gained significant attention
for its applications in such fields like forensics, security, and media.
However, most state of the art methods rely on conditional Generative
Adversarial Networks (GANs), Diffusion-based models, or Visual Language Models
(VLMs) to age or de-age faces based on predefined age categories and
conditioning via loss functions, fine-tuning, or text prompts. The reliance on
such conditioning leads to complex training requirements, increased data needs,
and challenges in generating consistent results. Additionally, identity
preservation is rarely taken into accountor evaluated on a single face
recognition system without any control or guarantees on whether identity would
be preserved in a generated aged/de-aged face. In this paper, we propose to
synthesize aged and de-aged faces via editing latent space of StyleGAN2 using a
simple support vector modeling of aging/de-aging direction and several feature
selection approaches. By using two state-of-the-art face recognition systems,
we empirically find the identity preserving subspace within the StyleGAN2
latent space, so that an apparent age of a given face can changed while
preserving the identity. We then propose a simple yet practical formula for
estimating the limits on aging/de-aging parameters that ensures identity
preservation for a given input face. Using our method and estimated parameters
we have generated a public dataset of synthetic faces at different ages that
can be used for benchmarking cross-age face recognition, age assurance systems,
or systems for detection of synthetic images. Our code and dataset are
available at the project page https://www.idiap.ch/paper/agesynth/

*Shi-Chen Zhang,Yunheng Li,Yu-Huan Wu,Qibin Hou,Ming-Ming Cheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper targets efficient semantic segmentation for resource-constrained devices and introduces a new offset learning paradigm to address misalignment issues in conventional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the issue of misalignment between class representations and image features in lightweight, efficient semantic segmentation methods, which affects accuracy in resource-constrained setups.

Method: It proposes a coupled dual-branch offset learning paradigm that refines both class representations and spatial image features dynamically. This paradigm can be integrated into existing architectures without major modifications.

Result: The proposed method, implemented in a network called OffSeg, delivers consistent performance improvements on four benchmark datasets with minimal additional parameters. For instance, it boosts mIoU scores on ADE20K by up to 2.7%.

Conclusion: Offset learning is effective for improving efficiency and segmentation accuracy, with negligible computational overhead, and is compatible with existing architectures.

Abstract: Semantic segmentation is fundamental to vision systems requiring pixel-level
scene understanding, yet deploying it on resource-constrained devices demands
efficient architectures. Although existing methods achieve real-time inference
through lightweight designs, we reveal their inherent limitation: misalignment
between class representations and image features caused by a per-pixel
classification paradigm. With experimental analysis, we find that this paradigm
results in a highly challenging assumption for efficient scenarios: Image pixel
features should not vary for the same category in different images. To address
this dilemma, we propose a coupled dual-branch offset learning paradigm that
explicitly learns feature and class offsets to dynamically refine both class
representations and spatial image features. Based on the proposed paradigm, we
construct an efficient semantic segmentation network, OffSeg. Notably, the
offset learning paradigm can be adopted to existing methods with no additional
architectural changes. Extensive experiments on four datasets, including
ADE20K, Cityscapes, COCO-Stuff-164K, and Pascal Context, demonstrate consistent
improvements with negligible parameters. For instance, on the ADE20K dataset,
our proposed offset learning paradigm improves SegFormer-B0, SegNeXt-T, and
Mask2Former-Tiny by 2.7%, 1.9%, and 2.6% mIoU, respectively, with only 0.1-0.2M
additional parameters required.

*Yuqi Peng,Lingtao Zheng,Yufeng Yang,Yi Huang,Mingfu Yan,Jianzhuang Liu,Shifeng Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses challenges in combining multiple LoRA modules for personalized text-to-image generation by proposing Token-Aware LoRA (TARA), which reduces token interference and spatial misalignment issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There are significant problems in personalized text-to-image generation when combining multiple LoRA modules, such as identity loss and visual feature leakage.

Method: The authors introduced TARA, which uses token masks to limit interference and proposes spatial alignment training objectives to enhance concept fidelity. It allows for training-free multi-concept generation.

Result: Experimental results show that TARA achieves efficient multi-concept inference and maintains the visual identity of different concepts during generation.

Conclusion: TARA effectively addresses token interference and spatial misalignment in multi-concept text-to-image generation, enabling robust and identity-preserving visual outputs.

Abstract: Personalized text-to-image generation aims to synthesize novel images of a
specific subject or style using only a few reference images. Recent methods
based on Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) enable efficient single-concept
customization by injecting lightweight, concept-specific adapters into
pre-trained diffusion models. However, combining multiple LoRA modules for
multi-concept generation often leads to identity missing and visual feature
leakage. In this work, we identify two key issues behind these failures: (1)
token-wise interference among different LoRA modules, and (2) spatial
misalignment between the attention map of a rare token and its corresponding
concept-specific region. To address these issues, we propose Token-Aware LoRA
(TARA), which introduces a token mask to explicitly constrain each module to
focus on its associated rare token to avoid interference, and a training
objective that encourages the spatial attention of a rare token to align with
its concept region. Our method enables training-free multi-concept composition
by directly injecting multiple independently trained TARA modules at inference
time. Experimental results demonstrate that TARA enables efficient
multi-concept inference and effectively preserving the visual identity of each
concept by avoiding mutual interference between LoRA modules. The code and
models are available at https://github.com/YuqiPeng77/TARA.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces 3DFroMLLM, a system that generates labeled 3D object prototypes using multi-modal large language models without requiring extra training data. This framework improves tasks like image classification and fine-tuning vision-language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-modal large language models show strong capabilities but are limited in spatial reasoning, motivating enhancements in spatial understanding and 3D representation generation.

Method: The proposed framework uses a pipeline with three main components: a designer, coder, and visual inspector, working interactively in a refinement loop to produce 3D object prototypes, focusing on geometry and part labels.

Result: Generated 3D object prototypes are successfully applied in tasks such as image classification (improving pretraining tasks by 15%) and fine-tuning vision-language models (achieving 55% higher accuracy in part segmentation without extra human-labeled data).

Conclusion: 3DFroMLLM effectively harnesses multi-modal large language models for 3D object generation and contributes to substantial performance gains in practical applications, eliminating the need for additional training data or human annotations.

Abstract: Recent Multi-Modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated strong
capabilities in learning joint representations from text and images. However,
their spatial reasoning remains limited. We introduce 3DFroMLLM, a novel
framework that enables the generation of 3D object prototypes directly from
MLLMs, including geometry and part labels. Our pipeline is agentic, comprising
a designer, coder, and visual inspector operating in a refinement loop.
Notably, our approach requires no additional training data or detailed user
instructions. Building on prior work in 2D generation, we demonstrate that
rendered images produced by our framework can be effectively used for image
classification pretraining tasks and outperforms previous methods by 15%. As a
compelling real-world use case, we show that the generated prototypes can be
leveraged to improve fine-grained vision-language models by using the rendered,
part-labeled prototypes to fine-tune CLIP for part segmentation and achieving a
55% accuracy improvement without relying on any additional human-labeled data.

### [152] [A Parametric Bi-Directional Curvature-Based Framework for Image Artifact Classification and Quantification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08824)
*Diego Frias*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel No-Reference Image Quality Assessment (NR-IQA) method based on directional image curvature and Anisotropic Texture Richness (ATR), achieving superior accuracy in identifying and quantifying image distortions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for No-Reference Image Quality Assessment struggle with accurately classifying and quantifying image degradations such as blur and noise. The authors aim to address this gap by proposing an advanced, more accurate framework.

Method: A two-stage system is developed. It computes a pixel-level ATR score optimized for specific artifacts and uses ATR signatures to classify blur vs. noise distortions. The system then applies a specialized regression model to predict quality ratings based on human perception.

Result: The method attained high Spearman correlations of -0.93 for Gaussian blur and -0.95 for white noise, a classification accuracy of over 97%, and an R2 of 0.892 with an RMSE of 5.17 DMOS points on a combined dataset.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates excellent accuracy in both classification and quantification of image quality degradation, solidifying its role as an effective tool for NR-IQA tasks.

Abstract: This work presents a novel framework for No-Reference Image Quality
Assessment (NR-IQA) founded on the analysis of directional image curvature.
Within this framework, we define a measure of Anisotropic Texture Richness
(ATR), which is computed at the pixel level using two tunable thresholds -- one
permissive and one restrictive -- that quantify orthogonal texture suppression.
When its parameters are optimized for a specific artifact, the resulting ATR
score serves as a high-performance quality metric, achieving Spearman
correlations with human perception of approximately -0.93 for Gaussian blur and
-0.95 for white noise on the LIVE dataset. The primary contribution is a
two-stage system that leverages the differential response of ATR to various
distortions. First, the system utilizes the signature from two specialist ATR
configurations to classify the primary artifact type (blur vs. noise) with over
97% accuracy. Second, following classification, it employs a dedicated
regression model mapping the relevant ATR score to a quality rating to quantify
the degradation. On a combined dataset, the complete system predicts human
scores with a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.892 and a Root Mean Square
Error (RMSE) of 5.17 DMOS points. This error corresponds to just 7.4% of the
dataset's total quality range, demonstrating high predictive accuracy. This
establishes our framework as a robust, dual-purpose tool for the classification
and subsequent quantification of image degradation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-frequency details maintain video clarity but cause high bitrate, increasing bandwidth and storage costs.

Method: An end-to-end framework leveraging FFPN predicts optimal high-frequency preprocessing, followed by filtering to achieve efficient rate-distortion tradeoff.

Result: Extensive evaluations show significant bitrate savings while enhancing subjective video quality on various datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively optimizes bitrate and visual clarity after video compression using advanced learning techniques.

Abstract: High-frequency components are crucial for maintaining video clarity and
realism, but they also significantly impact coding bitrate, resulting in
increased bandwidth and storage costs. This paper presents an end-to-end
learning-based framework for adaptive high-frequency preprocessing to enhance
subjective quality and save bitrate in video coding. The framework employs the
Frequency-attentive Feature pyramid Prediction Network (FFPN) to predict the
optimal high-frequency preprocessing strategy, guiding subsequent filtering
operators to achieve the optimal tradeoff between bitrate and quality after
compression. For training FFPN, we pseudo-label each training video with the
optimal strategy, determined by comparing the rate-distortion (RD) performance
across different preprocessing types and strengths. Distortion is measured
using the latest quality assessment metric. Comprehensive evaluations on
multiple datasets demonstrate the visually appealing enhancement capabilities
and bitrate savings achieved by our framework.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Adapting neural models to scene changes is labor-intensive and lacks the ability to capture detailed temporal changes.

Method: GaussianUpdate employs 3D Gaussian radiance fields with continual learning, a multi-stage update strategy, and visibility-aware generative replay.

Result: Experiments on benchmark datasets show superior real-time rendering and effective change visualization.

Conclusion: GaussianUpdate addresses key challenges by combining efficient updates with real-time and detailed change modeling.

Abstract: Novel view synthesis with neural models has advanced rapidly in recent years,
yet adapting these models to scene changes remains an open problem. Existing
methods are either labor-intensive, requiring extensive model retraining, or
fail to capture detailed types of changes over time. In this paper, we present
GaussianUpdate, a novel approach that combines 3D Gaussian representation with
continual learning to address these challenges. Our method effectively updates
the Gaussian radiance fields with current data while preserving information
from past scenes. Unlike existing methods, GaussianUpdate explicitly models
different types of changes through a novel multi-stage update strategy.
Additionally, we introduce a visibility-aware continual learning approach with
generative replay, enabling self-aware updating without the need to store
images. The experiments on the benchmark dataset demonstrate our method
achieves superior and real-time rendering with the capability of visualizing
changes over different times

Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of robust depth estimation for applications such as augmented reality, biomedical imaging, and scene reconstruction, while overcoming limitations of deep learning methods in terms of computational cost and real-world noise resilience.

Method: The proposed pipeline merges light field-based disparity data with a directed random walk refinement algorithm to improve depth map consistency without relying on extensive training or large datasets.

Result: Tests on the 4D Light Field Benchmark dataset and various real-world images show competitive accuracy and low computational complexity, though slight performance drops occur under uncontrolled conditions.

Conclusion: The research demonstrates that the proposed method is an efficient, robust, and practical alternative to deep learning approaches for light field depth estimation and segmentation, offering new avenues for integrating probabilistic graph models in pattern recognition tasks.

Abstract: Robust depth estimation in light field imaging remains a critical challenge
for pattern recognition applications such as augmented reality, biomedical
imaging, and scene reconstruction. While existing approaches often rely heavily
on deep convolutional neural networks, they tend to incur high computational
costs and struggle in noisy real-world environments. This paper proposes a
novel lightweight depth estimation pipeline that integrates light field-based
disparity information with a directed random walk refinement algorithm. Unlike
traditional CNN-based methods, our approach enhances depth map consistency
without requiring extensive training or large-scale datasets. The proposed
method was evaluated on the 4D Light Field Benchmark dataset and a diverse set
of real-world images. Experimental results indicate that while performance
slightly declines under uncontrolled conditions, the algorithm consistently
maintains low computational complexity and competitive accuracy compared to
state-of-the-art deep learning models. These findings highlight the potential
of our method as a robust and efficient alternative for depth estimation and
segmentation in light field imaging. The work provides insights into practical
algorithm design for light field-based pattern recognition and opens new

TL;DR: This paper introduces MaskClu, a novel unsupervised pre-training method for Vision Transformers (ViTs) aimed at enhancing 3D point cloud understanding by combining masked modeling with clustering-based learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the underexplored challenge of enabling Vision Transformers to effectively learn dense and informative semantic features from 3D point clouds.

Method: MaskClu combines masked point modeling with clustering-based learning to reconstruct both cluster assignments and centers. It integrates global contrastive learning to improve instance-level feature extraction and optimizes complementary objectives.

Result: MaskClu achieves competitive results across multiple 3D tasks such as part segmentation, semantic segmentation, object detection, and classification.

Conclusion: MaskClu demonstrates its capability to enable Vision Transformers to capture richer and semantically meaningful representations, setting new benchmarks in 3D point cloud analysis.

Abstract: Vision transformers (ViTs) have recently been widely applied to 3D point
cloud understanding, with masked autoencoding as the predominant pre-training
paradigm. However, the challenge of learning dense and informative semantic
features from point clouds via standard ViTs remains underexplored. We propose
MaskClu, a novel unsupervised pre-training method for ViTs on 3D point clouds
that integrates masked point modeling with clustering-based learning. MaskClu
is designed to reconstruct both cluster assignments and cluster centers from
masked point clouds, thus encouraging the model to capture dense semantic
information. Additionally, we introduce a global contrastive learning mechanism
that enhances instance-level feature learning by contrasting different masked
views of the same point cloud. By jointly optimizing these complementary
objectives, i.e., dense semantic reconstruction, and instance-level contrastive
learning. MaskClu enables ViTs to learn richer and more semantically meaningful
representations from 3D point clouds. We validate the effectiveness of our
method via multiple 3D tasks, including part segmentation, semantic
segmentation, object detection, and classification, where MaskClu sets new
competitive results. The code and models will be released

TL;DR: The study developed a standardized pipeline for postoperative MRI analysis of CNS tumors, incorporating segmentation, classification, and reporting using advanced architectures like Attention U-Net and DenseNet.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limited focus on postoperative imaging analysis in CNS tumor evaluations and improve clinical decision-making through standardized reporting.

Method: Leveraged Attention U-Net for segmentation tasks and DenseNet for classification, trained on multicenter datasets with 5-fold cross-validation, and implemented metrics to evaluate performance.

Result: Achieved segmentation Dice scores ranging from 66% to 87% across different regions, 99.5% accuracy in sequence classification, and 80% accuracy in tumor type classification.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates robust automated tools for postoperative CNS tumor analysis, integrated into Raidionics software, enhancing clinical reporting and decision-making workflows.

Abstract: Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging is essential for evaluating central nervous
system (CNS) tumors, guiding surgical planning, treatment decisions, and
assessing postoperative outcomes and complication risks. While recent work has
advanced automated tumor segmentation and report generation, most efforts have
focused on preoperative data, with limited attention to postoperative imaging
analysis. This study introduces a comprehensive pipeline for standardized
postsurtical reporting in CNS tumors. Using the Attention U-Net architecture,
segmentation models were trained for the preoperative (non-enhancing) tumor
core, postoperative contrast-enhancing residual tumor, and resection cavity.
Additionally, MR sequence classification and tumor type identification for
contrast-enhancing lesions were explored using the DenseNet architecture. The
models were integrated into a reporting pipeline, following the RANO 2.0
guidelines. Training was conducted on multicentric datasets comprising 2000 to
7000 patients, using a 5-fold cross-validation. Evaluation included patient-,
voxel-, and object-wise metrics, with benchmarking against the latest BraTS
challenge results. The segmentation models achieved average voxel-wise Dice
scores of 87%, 66%, 70%, and 77% for the tumor core, non-enhancing tumor core,
contrast-enhancing residual tumor, and resection cavity, respectively.
Classification models reached 99.5% balanced accuracy in MR sequence
classification and 80% in tumor type classification. The pipeline presented in
this study enables robust, automated segmentation, MR sequence classification,
and standardized report generation aligned with RANO 2.0 guidelines, enhancing
postoperative evaluation and clinical decision-making. The proposed models and
methods were integrated into Raidionics, open-source software platform for CNS
tumor analysis, now including a dedicated module for postsurgical analysis.

*Jintao Cheng,Jiehao Luo,Xieyuanli Chen,Jin Wu,Rui Fan,Xiaoyu Tang,Wei Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses LiDAR-based Place Recognition (LPR) by introducing a novel cross-view network and a new metric based on Mahalanobis distance to better handle complex environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LPR methods overly rely on Euclidean distance metrics, failing to account for nonlinear data distributions and intra-class variance, leading to performance issues in challenging scenarios.

Method: The proposed framework integrates a pseudo-global information guidance mechanism for unified semantic space learning and introduces a new metric using a Symmetric Positive Definite (SPD) matrix to compute Mahalanobis distance.

Result: The proposed approach demonstrates competitive performance, excelling especially in complex and variable environmental conditions.

Conclusion: The novel framework and metric significantly improve LPR performance by addressing intrinsic data distribution intricacies and inter-class dependencies, offering a robust solution for challenging scenarios.

Abstract: LiDAR-based Place Recognition (LPR) remains a critical task in Embodied
Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Autonomous Driving, primarily addressing
localization challenges in GPS-denied environments and supporting loop closure
detection. Existing approaches reduce place recognition to a Euclidean
distance-based metric learning task, neglecting the feature space's intrinsic
structures and intra-class variances. Such Euclidean-centric formulation
inherently limits the model's capacity to capture nonlinear data distributions,
leading to suboptimal performance in complex environments and temporal-varying
scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose a novel cross-view network
based on an innovative fusion paradigm. Our framework introduces a
pseudo-global information guidance mechanism that coordinates multi-modal
branches to perform feature learning within a unified semantic space.
Concurrently, we propose a Manifold Adaptation and Pairwise Variance-Locality
Learning Metric that constructs a Symmetric Positive Definite (SPD) matrix to
compute Mahalanobis distance, superseding traditional Euclidean distance
metrics. This geometric formulation enables the model to accurately
characterize intrinsic data distributions and capture complex inter-class
dependencies within the feature space. Experimental results demonstrate that
the proposed algorithm achieves competitive performance, particularly excelling
in complex environmental conditions.

*Leona Žůrková,Petr Strakoš,Michal Kravčenko,Tomáš Brzobohatý,Lubomír Říha*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a volumetric data compression method using Fourier-feature encoding and selective voxel sampling, achieving faster training and compact neural representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in volumetric data compression in fields like medical imaging and scientific simulation, focusing on scalability and efficiency.

Method: Combining Fourier-feature encoding with selective voxel sampling through dynamic voxel selection using morphological dilation, stored as neural network weights for compression.

Result: Training time reduced by 63.7% (from 30 to 11 min) with minor quality loss: PSNR dropped 0.59 dB and SSIM by 0.008, achieving compression rate of 14.

Conclusion: The structure-free neural method connects coordinate-based representations with scalable volumetric compression while reducing redundancy and data overhead for practical applications.

Abstract: Volumetric data compression is critical in fields like medical imaging,
scientific simulation, and entertainment. We introduce a structure-free neural
compression method combining Fourierfeature encoding with selective voxel
sampling, yielding compact volumetric representations and faster convergence.
Our dynamic voxel selection uses morphological dilation to prioritize active
regions, reducing redundant computation without any hierarchical metadata. In
the experiment, sparse training reduced training time by 63.7 % (from 30 to 11
minutes) with only minor quality loss: PSNR dropped 0.59 dB (from 32.60 to
32.01) and SSIM by 0.008 (from 0.948 to 0.940). The resulting neural
representation, stored solely as network weights, achieves a compression rate
of 14 and eliminates traditional data-loading overhead. This connects
coordinate-based neural representation with efficient volumetric compression,
offering a scalable, structure-free solution for practical applications.

*Eduarda Caldeira,Fadi Boutros,Naser Damer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper investigates zero-shot Face Morphing Attack Detection using CLIP by enhancing textual prompts instead of fine-tuning the model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Face recognition systems are vulnerable to morphing attacks, which blend multiple identities into images to bypass security checks.

Method: The authors use CLIP's zero-shot capabilities with carefully designed and aggregated textual prompts to align the model’s embedding with the MAD task.

Result: Prompt aggregation significantly enhances performance in detecting morphing attack samples without additional model training or fine-tuning.

Conclusion: Multimodal foundation models like CLIP can be efficiently adapted for security applications through innovative prompt engineering, bypassing the need for fine-tuning.

Abstract: Face Morphing Attack Detection (MAD) is a critical challenge in face
recognition security, where attackers can fool systems by interpolating the
identity information of two or more individuals into a single face image,
resulting in samples that can be verified as belonging to multiple identities
by face recognition systems. While multimodal foundation models (FMs) like CLIP
offer strong zero-shot capabilities by jointly modeling images and text, most
prior works on FMs for biometric recognition have relied on fine-tuning for
specific downstream tasks, neglecting their potential for direct, generalizable
deployment. This work explores a pure zero-shot approach to MAD by leveraging
CLIP without any additional training or fine-tuning, focusing instead on the
design and aggregation of multiple textual prompts per class. By aggregating
the embeddings of diverse prompts, we better align the model's internal
representations with the MAD task, capturing richer and more varied cues
indicative of bona-fide or attack samples. Our results show that prompt
aggregation substantially improves zero-shot detection performance,
demonstrating the effectiveness of exploiting foundation models' built-in
multimodal knowledge through efficient prompt engineering.

*Wenhan Wu,Zhishuai Guo,Chen Chen,Aidong Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a lightweight transformer framework for skeleton-based action recognition, simplifying spatio-temporal modeling and improving efficiency and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SAR methods rely on complex and heavy designs, resulting in inefficiency and scalability challenges.

Method: Proposed a unified framework with integrated spatio-temporal attention and a simplified multi-scale pooling fusion module to reduce computational redundancy.

Result: Achieved over 58% parameter reduction and over 60% computational cost reduction compared to state-of-the-art methods while maintaining competitive performance.

Conclusion: The lightweight model provides a superior balance between accuracy and efficiency, advancing the scalability and practicality of SAR approaches.

Abstract: Skeleton-based action recognition (SAR) has achieved impressive progress with
transformer architectures. However, existing methods often rely on complex
module compositions and heavy designs, leading to increased parameter counts,
high computational costs, and limited scalability. In this paper, we propose a
unified spatio-temporal lightweight transformer framework that integrates
spatial and temporal modeling within a single attention module, eliminating the
need for separate temporal modeling blocks. This approach reduces redundant
computations while preserving temporal awareness within the spatial modeling
process. Furthermore, we introduce a simplified multi-scale pooling fusion
module that combines local and global pooling pathways to enhance the model's
ability to capture fine-grained local movements and overarching global motion
patterns. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our
lightweight model achieves a superior balance between accuracy and efficiency,
reducing parameter complexity by over 58% and lowering computational cost by
over 60% compared to state-of-the-art transformer-based baselines, while
maintaining competitive recognition performance.

*Ao Ma,Jiasong Feng,Ke Cao,Jing Wang,Yun Wang,Quanwei Zhang,Zhanjie Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses challenges in maintaining subject consistency in storytelling tasks by proposing a Layout-Togglable Storytelling method, introducing annotated datasets, and a robust framework based on Diffusion Transformers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by challenges in generating consistent subjects in storytelling tasks due to the lack of fine-grained guidance, inter-frame interaction, and insufficient high-quality datasets.

Method: The authors propose a storytelling method that leverages layout conditions for fine-grained control and interactions, introduce Lay2Story-1M and Lay2Story-Bench datasets, and develop a framework using Diffusion Transformers (DiTs).

Result: Experiments show their framework surpasses previous state-of-the-art methods in subject consistency, semantic correlation, and aesthetic quality.

Conclusion: Layout conditions significantly boost subject consistency and control in storytelling tasks, paving the way for advanced storytelling methods aligned with visual coherence and precision.

Abstract: Storytelling tasks involving generating consistent subjects have gained
significant attention recently. However, existing methods, whether
training-free or training-based, continue to face challenges in maintaining
subject consistency due to the lack of fine-grained guidance and inter-frame
interaction. Additionally, the scarcity of high-quality data in this field
makes it difficult to precisely control storytelling tasks, including the
subject's position, appearance, clothing, expression, and posture, thereby
hindering further advancements. In this paper, we demonstrate that layout
conditions, such as the subject's position and detailed attributes, effectively
facilitate fine-grained interactions between frames. This not only strengthens
the consistency of the generated frame sequence but also allows for precise
control over the subject's position, appearance, and other key details.
Building on this, we introduce an advanced storytelling task: Layout-Togglable
Storytelling, which enables precise subject control by incorporating layout
conditions. To address the lack of high-quality datasets with layout
annotations for this task, we develop Lay2Story-1M, which contains over 1
million 720p and higher-resolution images, processed from approximately 11,300
hours of cartoon videos. Building on Lay2Story-1M, we create Lay2Story-Bench, a
benchmark with 3,000 prompts designed to evaluate the performance of different
methods on this task. Furthermore, we propose Lay2Story, a robust framework
based on the Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) architecture for Layout-Togglable
Storytelling tasks. Through both qualitative and quantitative experiments, we
find that our method outperforms the previous state-of-the-art (SOTA)
techniques, achieving the best results in terms of consistency, semantic
correlation, and aesthetic quality.

### [164] [Text-conditioned State Space Model For Domain-generalized Change Detection Visual Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08974)
*Elman Ghazaei,Erchan Aptoula*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper revisits the challenge of Change Detection Visual Question Answering (CDVQA) under domain shifts and introduces a new dataset (BrightVQA) and a novel model (TCSSM) to improve performance across domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the limitations of current CDVQA methods, which assume training and testing datasets share similar distributions—an assumption that fails in real-world applications due to domain shifts. They seek to enable non-expert users to access change detection information more flexibly and reliably.

Method: The authors propose TCSSM (Text-Conditioned State Space Model), which integrates bi-temporal imagery and geo-disaster-related text to learn domain-invariant features. Additionally, they introduce BrightVQA, a new multi-modal and multi-domain dataset to facilitate research in domain-generalized CDVQA.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate that TCSSM outperforms state-of-the-art models consistently, even under domain shifts.

Conclusion: By introducing both the BrightVQA dataset and the TCSSM framework, the paper advances the CDVQA field, particularly in addressing domain shifts, thus offering a more robust solution for real-world applications.

Abstract: The Earth's surface is constantly changing, and detecting these changes
provides valuable insights that benefit various aspects of human society. While
traditional change detection methods have been employed to detect changes from
bi-temporal images, these approaches typically require expert knowledge for
accurate interpretation. To enable broader and more flexible access to change
information by non-expert users, the task of Change Detection Visual Question
Answering (CDVQA) has been introduced. However, existing CDVQA methods have
been developed under the assumption that training and testing datasets share
similar distributions. This assumption does not hold in real-world
applications, where domain shifts often occur. In this paper, the CDVQA task is
revisited with a focus on addressing domain shift. To this end, a new
multi-modal and multi-domain dataset, BrightVQA, is introduced to facilitate
domain generalization research in CDVQA. Furthermore, a novel state space
model, termed Text-Conditioned State Space Model (TCSSM), is proposed. The
TCSSM framework is designed to leverage both bi-temporal imagery and
geo-disaster-related textual information in an unified manner to extract
domain-invariant features across domains. Input-dependent parameters existing
in TCSSM are dynamically predicted by using both bi-temporal images and
geo-disaster-related description, thereby facilitating the alignment between
bi-temporal visual data and the associated textual descriptions. Extensive
experiments are conducted to evaluate the proposed method against
state-of-the-art models, and superior performance is consistently demonstrated.
The code and dataset will be made publicly available upon acceptance at

### [165] [TaoCache: Structure-Maintained Video Generation Acceleration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08978)
*Zhentao Fan,Zongzuo Wang,Weiwei Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TaoCache is a novel strategy for accelerating video diffusion models, focusing on late denoising stages and improving visual quality metrics significantly compared to prior caching methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for accelerating video diffusion models often lead to structural discrepancies and hinder features like instruction following and character consistency, necessitating a better caching strategy.

Method: TaoCache introduces a fixed-point prediction strategy for denoising stages, calibrating cosine similarities and norm ratios to preserve high-resolution structure while enabling skipping.

Result: TaoCache demonstrates significantly higher visual quality in metrics like LPIPS, SSIM, and PSNR compared to previous caching methods while achieving the same speedup.

Conclusion: TaoCache provides a training-free, effective solution for accelerating video diffusion models, integrating well with existing frameworks and achieving superior visual quality.

Abstract: Existing cache-based acceleration methods for video diffusion models
primarily skip early or mid denoising steps, which often leads to structural
discrepancies relative to full-timestep generation and can hinder instruction
following and character consistency. We present TaoCache, a training-free,
plug-and-play caching strategy that, instead of residual-based caching, adopts
a fixed-point perspective to predict the model's noise output and is
specifically effective in late denoising stages. By calibrating cosine
similarities and norm ratios of consecutive noise deltas, TaoCache preserves
high-resolution structure while enabling aggressive skipping. The approach is
orthogonal to complementary accelerations such as Pyramid Attention Broadcast
(PAB) and TeaCache, and it integrates seamlessly into DiT-based frameworks.
Across Latte-1, OpenSora-Plan v110, and Wan2.1, TaoCache attains substantially
higher visual quality (LPIPS, SSIM, PSNR) than prior caching methods under the
same speedups.

*Ding Xia,Naoto Inoue,Qianru Qiu,Kotaro Kikuchi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study introduces a pipeline named ColorGPT, utilizing pretrained Large Language Models (LLMs) for effective color recommendation tasks in vector graphic designs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional color recommendation methods struggle due to the complexity of color design and limited data availability.

Method: The researchers employed pretrained LLMs combined with effective prompt engineering techniques to build ColorGPT for color palette completion and generation.

Result: The proposed pipeline demonstrated superior performance in accuracy, distribution, diversity, and similarity compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: ColorGPT shows promise in leveraging LLMs for advancing color recommendation, outperforming prior techniques both in palette completion and full palette generation.

Abstract: Colors play a crucial role in the design of vector graphic documents by
enhancing visual appeal, facilitating communication, improving usability, and
ensuring accessibility. In this context, color recommendation involves
suggesting appropriate colors to complete or refine a design when one or more
colors are missing or require alteration. Traditional methods often struggled
with these challenges due to the complex nature of color design and the limited
data availability. In this study, we explored the use of pretrained Large
Language Models (LLMs) and their commonsense reasoning capabilities for color
recommendation, raising the question: Can pretrained LLMs serve as superior
designers for color recommendation tasks? To investigate this, we developed a
robust, rigorously validated pipeline, ColorGPT, that was built by
systematically testing multiple color representations and applying effective
prompt engineering techniques. Our approach primarily targeted color palette
completion by recommending colors based on a set of given colors and
accompanying context. Moreover, our method can be extended to full palette
generation, producing an entire color palette corresponding to a provided
textual description. Experimental results demonstrated that our LLM-based
pipeline outperformed existing methods in terms of color suggestion accuracy
and the distribution of colors in the color palette completion task. For the
full palette generation task, our approach also yielded improvements in color
diversity and similarity compared to current techniques.

*Ming Nie,Chunwei Wang,Hang Xu,Li Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents KFFocus, a method to improve video token compression and context emphasis for Vid-LLMs, addressing inefficiencies in current strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenges in Vid-LLMs caused by uneven temporal information distribution and inefficiencies in current video token compression strategies.

Method: Introduce KFFocus, a method that identifies and captures keyframes using temporal redundancy principles while applying adaptable condensation ratios to reduce redundancy and preserve critical details. Additionally, it incorporates a spatiotemporal modeling module.

Result: KFFocus outperforms existing methods in video understanding benchmarks, particularly for long videos, by improving computational efficiency and accuracy.

Conclusion: KFFocus addresses limitations in video token compression in Vid-LLMs, preserving key details and improving both efficiency and performance in video comprehension tasks.

Abstract: Recently, with the emergence of large language models, multimodal LLMs have
demonstrated exceptional capabilities in image and video modalities. Despite
advancements in video comprehension, the substantial computational demands of
long video sequences lead current video LLMs (Vid-LLMs) to employ compression
strategies at both the inter-frame level (e.g., uniform sampling of video
frames) and intra-frame level (e.g., condensing all visual tokens of each frame
into a limited number). However, this approach often neglects the uneven
temporal distribution of critical information across frames, risking the
omission of keyframes that contain essential temporal and semantic details. To
tackle these challenges, we propose KFFocus, a method designed to efficiently
compress video tokens and emphasize the informative context present within
video frames. We substitute uniform sampling with a refined approach inspired
by classic video compression principles to identify and capture keyframes based
on their temporal redundancy. By assigning varying condensation ratios to
frames based on their contextual relevance, KFFocus efficiently reduces token
redundancy while preserving informative content details. Additionally, we
introduce a spatiotemporal modeling module that encodes both the temporal
relationships between video frames and the spatial structure within each frame,
thus providing Vid-LLMs with a nuanced understanding of spatial-temporal
dynamics. Extensive experiments on widely recognized video understanding
benchmarks, especially long video scenarios, demonstrate that KFFocus
significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving substantial computational
efficiency and enhanced accuracy.

*Zan Wang,Jingze Zhang,Yixin Chen,Baoxiong Jia,Wei Liang,Siyuan Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MSQ, a multi-scale quantization method for motion sequence representation, which improves multi-scale motion modeling and compositional flexibility, outperforming baseline methods in diverse generation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current motion representations fail to model multi-scale motion patterns and lack compositional flexibility, restraining performance in complex and diverse motion generation tasks.

Method: The MSQ method captures motion sequences by employing spatial and temporal encoders that encode body parts at varying granularities and interpolate them across multiple scales before converting them into discrete tokens. A generative mask modeling framework is then used for motion generation tasks.

Result: The MSQ method allows seamless motion token composition, achieves superior performance in motion generation, editing, and control tasks, and outperforms existing baseline approaches as demonstrated across various benchmarks.

Conclusion: MSQ successfully tackles the limitations of current motion representations by introducing a flexible and expressive multi-scale quantization approach, marking progress in human motion generation.

Abstract: Despite significant advancements in human motion generation, current motion
representations, typically formulated as discrete frame sequences, still face
two critical limitations: (i) they fail to capture motion from a multi-scale
perspective, limiting the capability in complex patterns modeling; (ii) they
lack compositional flexibility, which is crucial for model's generalization in
diverse generation tasks. To address these challenges, we introduce MSQ, a
novel quantization method that compresses the motion sequence into multi-scale
discrete tokens across spatial and temporal dimensions. MSQ employs distinct
encoders to capture body parts at varying spatial granularities and temporally
interpolates the encoded features into multiple scales before quantizing them
into discrete tokens. Building on this representation, we establish a
generative mask modeling model to effectively support motion editing, motion
control, and conditional motion generation. Through quantitative and
qualitative analysis, we show that our quantization method enables the seamless
composition of motion tokens without requiring specialized design or
re-training. Furthermore, extensive evaluations demonstrate that our approach
outperforms existing baseline methods on various benchmarks.

TL;DR: The paper introduces UniConvNet, a CNN design that expands the effective receptive field (ERF) efficiently, outperforming existing models in vision tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current ConvNets with large ERF work well but are limited by high computational costs and disrupted Gaussian ERF distributions.

Method: Proposes combining smaller kernels to expand ERF while maintaining Gaussian characteristics. Designs a Three-layer Receptive Field Aggregator and a foundational Layer Operator.

Result: UniConvNet achieves 84.2% ImageNet top-1 accuracy with 30M parameters and 5.1G FLOPs, scalable to large datasets with strong performance.

Conclusion: UniConvNet demonstrates efficiency and scalability, making it a universal model for any scale of ConvNet and excelling in various vision tasks.

Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (ConvNets) with large effective receptive field
(ERF), still in their early stages, have demonstrated promising effectiveness
while constrained by high parameters and FLOPs costs and disrupted
asymptotically Gaussian distribution (AGD) of ERF. This paper proposes an
alternative paradigm: rather than merely employing extremely large ERF, it is
more effective and efficient to expand the ERF while maintaining AGD of ERF by
proper combination of smaller kernels, such as $7\times{7}$, $9\times{9}$,
$11\times{11}$. This paper introduces a Three-layer Receptive Field Aggregator
and designs a Layer Operator as the fundamental operator from the perspective
of receptive field. The ERF can be expanded to the level of existing
large-kernel ConvNets through the stack of proposed modules while maintaining
AGD of ERF. Using these designs, we propose a universal model for ConvNet of
any scale, termed UniConvNet. Extensive experiments on ImageNet-1K, COCO2017,
and ADE20K demonstrate that UniConvNet outperforms state-of-the-art CNNs and
ViTs across various vision recognition tasks for both lightweight and
large-scale models with comparable throughput. Surprisingly, UniConvNet-T
achieves $84.2\%$ ImageNet top-1 accuracy with $30M$ parameters and $5.1G$
FLOPs. UniConvNet-XL also shows competitive scalability to big data and large
models, acquiring $88.4\%$ top-1 accuracy on ImageNet. Code and models are

*Luyang Cao,Han Xu,Jian Zhang,Lei Qi,Jiayi Ma,Yinghuan Shi,Yang Gao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents the IRetinex model to address inter-component residuals (ICR) in Retinex-based low-light image enhancement, significantly improving image decomposition and synthesis quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous Retinex-based methods for low-light image enhancement face challenges due to inter-component residuals (ICR), which hinder decomposition accuracy and image quality. The paper seeks to address the overlooked impact of ICR.

Method: The proposed IRetinex model incorporates two key elements: an inter-component residual reduction module during the decomposition stage and a feature similarity-based detection and mitigation framework during the enhancement stage.

Result: Experiments on three benchmark datasets showed that IRetinex successfully reduces ICR, outperforming state-of-the-art methods qualitatively and quantitatively.

Conclusion: IRetinex effectively mitigates ICR in low-light image enhancement, improving decomposition accuracy and synthesized image quality, marking it as a superior method in its domain.

Abstract: In low-light image enhancement, Retinex-based deep learning methods have
garnered significant attention due to their exceptional interpretability. These
methods decompose images into mutually independent illumination and reflectance
components, allows each component to be enhanced separately. In fact, achieving
perfect decomposition of illumination and reflectance components proves to be
quite challenging, with some residuals still existing after decomposition. In
this paper, we formally name these residuals as inter-component residuals
(ICR), which has been largely underestimated by previous methods. In our
investigation, ICR not only affects the accuracy of the decomposition but also
causes enhanced components to deviate from the ideal outcome, ultimately
reducing the final synthesized image quality. To address this issue, we propose
a novel Inter-correction Retinex model (IRetinex) to alleviate ICR during the
decomposition and enhancement stage. In the decomposition stage, we leverage
inter-component residual reduction module to reduce the feature similarity
between illumination and reflectance components. In the enhancement stage, we
utilize the feature similarity between the two components to detect and
mitigate the impact of ICR within each enhancement unit. Extensive experiments
on three low-light benchmark datasets demonstrated that by reducing ICR, our
method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches both qualitatively and
quantitatively.

*Kaiwen Huang,Tao Zhou,Huazhu Fu,Yizhe Zhang,Yi Zhou,Xiao-Jun Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes UC-Seg, a semi-supervised learning framework that uses cross-subnet consistency and uncertainty-aware pseudo-labels to improve medical image segmentation accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce reliance on expert annotations in medical image segmentation while addressing limitations of existing semi-supervised methods, such as cognitive biases and challenges in generating confident pseudo-labels.

Method: UC-Seg combines two key components: (1) Cross-subnet Consistency Preservation (CCP) to synchronize feature representation across two subnets, and (2) Uncertainty-aware Pseudo-label Generation (UPG) to create reliable pseudo-labels using segmentation and uncertainty maps.

Result: UC-Seg demonstrated superior segmentation accuracy and generalization across diverse medical imaging modalities, outperforming state-of-the-art semi-supervised approaches.

Conclusion: UC-Seg effectively mitigates cognitive biases and leverages unlabeled data, refining semi-supervised medical image segmentation accuracy and generalization. The code is publicly available for further use.

Abstract: Semi-supervised learning has gained considerable popularity in medical image
segmentation tasks due to its capability to reduce reliance on expert-examined
annotations. Several mean-teacher (MT) based semi-supervised methods utilize
consistency regularization to effectively leverage valuable information from
unlabeled data. However, these methods often heavily rely on the student model
and overlook the potential impact of cognitive biases within the model.
Furthermore, some methods employ co-training using pseudo-labels derived from
different inputs, yet generating high-confidence pseudo-labels from perturbed
inputs during training remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we
propose an Uncertainty-aware Cross-training framework for semi-supervised
medical image Segmentation (UC-Seg). Our UC-Seg framework incorporates two
distinct subnets to effectively explore and leverage the correlation between
them, thereby mitigating cognitive biases within the model. Specifically, we
present a Cross-subnet Consistency Preservation (CCP) strategy to enhance
feature representation capability and ensure feature consistency across the two
subnets. This strategy enables each subnet to correct its own biases and learn
shared semantics from both labeled and unlabeled data. Additionally, we propose
an Uncertainty-aware Pseudo-label Generation (UPG) component that leverages
segmentation results and corresponding uncertainty maps from both subnets to
generate high-confidence pseudo-labels. We extensively evaluate the proposed
UC-Seg on various medical image segmentation tasks involving different modality
images, such as MRI, CT, ultrasound, colonoscopy, and so on. The results
demonstrate that our method achieves superior segmentation accuracy and
generalization performance compared to other state-of-the-art semi-supervised
methods. Our code will be released at https://github.com/taozh2017/UCSeg.

### [172] [When Deepfakes Look Real: Detecting AI-Generated Faces with Unlabeled Data due to Annotation Challenges](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09022)
*Zhiqiang Yang,Renshuai Tao,Xiaolong Zheng,Guodong Yang,Chunjie Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces DPGNet, a novel method to detect deepfakes effectively by leveraging unlabeled data and bridging domain gaps using text-guided alignment and curriculum-driven pseudo labeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing realism of deepfakes challenges human annotators and traditional detection methods, necessitating approaches that can utilize large-scale unlabeled data.

Method: The proposed DPGNet combines text-guided cross-domain alignment and curriculum-driven pseudo labeling, along with cross-domain knowledge distillation to handle deepfake detection challenges.

Result: DPGNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 6.3% on 11 popular datasets, demonstrating its superiority in utilizing unlabeled data.

Conclusion: DPGNet effectively addresses annotation limitations and improves deepfake detection by leveraging innovative techniques, setting a new benchmark in the field.

Abstract: Existing deepfake detection methods heavily depend on labeled training data.
However, as AI-generated content becomes increasingly realistic, even
\textbf{human annotators struggle to distinguish} between deepfakes and
authentic images. This makes the labeling process both time-consuming and less
reliable. Specifically, there is a growing demand for approaches that can
effectively utilize large-scale unlabeled data from online social networks.
Unlike typical unsupervised learning tasks, where categories are distinct,
AI-generated faces closely mimic real image distributions and share strong
similarities, causing performance drop in conventional strategies. In this
paper, we introduce the Dual-Path Guidance Network (DPGNet), to tackle two key
challenges: (1) bridging the domain gap between faces from different generation
models, and (2) utilizing unlabeled image samples. The method features two core
modules: text-guided cross-domain alignment, which uses learnable prompts to
unify visual and textual embeddings into a domain-invariant feature space, and
curriculum-driven pseudo label generation, which dynamically exploit more
informative unlabeled samples. To prevent catastrophic forgetting, we also
facilitate bridging between domains via cross-domain knowledge distillation.
Extensive experiments on \textbf{11 popular datasets}, show that DPGNet
outperforms SoTA approaches by \textbf{6.3\%}, highlighting its effectiveness
in leveraging unlabeled data to address the annotation challenges posed by the
increasing realism of deepfakes.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes enhancing text-to-image personalization by introducing prompt-specific adjustments and attention-based loss terms to improve identity capture, showing improvements across multiple models and personalization methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation lies in improving existing text-to-image personalization methods to better capture the identity of new concepts, enabling applications in areas such as product placement and personalized design.

Method: The method involves a two-step personalization process: one tailored to the prompt and noise seed, and the other incorporating self- and cross-attention loss terms to enhance semantic similarity using PDM features.

Result: Significant improvements were observed across six different personalization methods and various base models, such as UNet and DiT, even outperforming prior per-query methods.

Conclusion: Integrating prompt-specific personalization steps and attention-based loss terms can substantially advance visual concept learning in pretrained models, making it more effective and identity-conscious.

Abstract: Visual concept learning, also known as Text-to-image personalization, is the
process of teaching new concepts to a pretrained model. This has numerous
applications from product placement to entertainment and personalized design.
Here we show that many existing methods can be substantially augmented by
adding a personalization step that is (1) specific to the prompt and noise
seed, and (2) using two loss terms based on the self- and cross- attention,
capturing the identity of the personalized concept. Specifically, we leverage
PDM features -- previously designed to capture identity -- and show how they
can be used to improve personalized semantic similarity. We evaluate the
benefit that our method gains on top of six different personalization methods,
and several base text-to-image models (both UNet- and DiT-based). We find
significant improvements even over previous per-query personalization methods.

### [174] [ALFred: An Active Learning Framework for Real-world Semi-supervised Anomaly Detection with Adaptive Thresholds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09058)
*Shanle Yao,Ghazal Alinezhad Noghre,Armin Danesh Pazho,Hamed Tabkhi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents an active learning framework for Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) to address challenges posed by dynamic real-world conditions, enabling adaptive thresholding and improved model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the challenges of VAD in dynamic real-world scenarios, such as domain shifts and environmental variations, traditional metrics inadequacy, and difficulty in distinguishing normal from anomalous behavior.

Method: An active learning framework incorporating human-in-the-loop mechanisms is proposed, leveraging continuous labeling and pseudo-label results to define adaptive thresholds for different environments.

Result: The approach achieves an Error Balance Index (EBI) of 68.91 for Q3 in simulated real-world scenarios, showcasing enhanced adaptability and effectiveness.

Conclusion: The proposed framework improves the applicability of VAD in dynamic settings, allowing adaptive anomaly detection tailored to changing conditions.

Abstract: Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) can play a key role in spotting unusual
activities in video footage. VAD is difficult to use in real-world settings due
to the dynamic nature of human actions, environmental variations, and domain
shifts. Traditional evaluation metrics often prove inadequate for such
scenarios, as they rely on static assumptions and fall short of identifying a
threshold that distinguishes normal from anomalous behavior in dynamic
settings. To address this, we introduce an active learning framework tailored
for VAD, designed for adapting to the ever-changing real-world conditions. Our
approach leverages active learning to continuously select the most informative
data points for labeling, thereby enhancing model adaptability. A critical
innovation is the incorporation of a human-in-the-loop mechanism, which enables
the identification of actual normal and anomalous instances from
pseudo-labeling results generated by AI. This collected data allows the
framework to define an adaptive threshold tailored to different environments,
ensuring that the system remains effective as the definition of 'normal' shifts
across various settings. Implemented within a lab-based framework that
simulates real-world conditions, our approach allows rigorous testing and
refinement of VAD algorithms with a new metric. Experimental results show that
our method achieves an EBI (Error Balance Index) of 68.91 for Q3 in real-world
simulated scenarios, demonstrating its practical effectiveness and
significantly enhancing the applicability of VAD in dynamic environments.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces VLM-3D, an end-to-end framework that leverages Visual Language Models for improved 3D geometric perception in autonomous driving environments, showing a significant accuracy boost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the critical challenge of recognizing unseen object categories in complex traffic environments to enhance safety in autonomous driving systems.

Method: The proposed method introduces VLM-3D, which adapts Visual Language Models using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) for driving tasks, and employs a joint semantic-geometric loss combining semantic loss for early training and 3D IoU loss for later stages.

Result: The method demonstrated a 12.8% improvement in perception accuracy on the nuScenes dataset.

Conclusion: VLM-3D's design effectively advances open-set perception in autonomous driving by integrating Visual Language Models with a novel training strategy, proving its success in complex scenarios.

Abstract: Open-set perception in complex traffic environments poses a critical
challenge for autonomous driving systems, particularly in identifying
previously unseen object categories, which is vital for ensuring safety. Visual
Language Models (VLMs), with their rich world knowledge and strong semantic
reasoning capabilities, offer new possibilities for addressing this task.
However, existing approaches typically leverage VLMs to extract visual features
and couple them with traditional object detectors, resulting in multi-stage
error propagation that hinders perception accuracy. To overcome this
limitation, we propose VLM-3D, the first end-to-end framework that enables VLMs
to perform 3D geometric perception in autonomous driving scenarios. VLM-3D
incorporates Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to efficiently adapt VLMs to driving
tasks with minimal computational overhead, and introduces a joint
semantic-geometric loss design: token-level semantic loss is applied during
early training to ensure stable convergence, while 3D IoU loss is introduced in
later stages to refine the accuracy of 3D bounding box predictions. Evaluations
on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that the proposed joint semantic-geometric
loss in VLM-3D leads to a 12.8% improvement in perception accuracy, fully
validating the effectiveness and advancement of our method.

*Yuqi Li,Haotian Zhang,Li Li,Dong Liu,Feng Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper explores scaling large learned image compression models to enhance performance, revealing a strong correlation between model size and compression capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current image compression models are constrained by their limited scale and representation capacity, and how scaling influences compression performance has not been deeply studied.

Method: The researchers scale the parameters of the HPCM model from 68.5 million to 1 billion and fit power-law relations between key scaling factors such as model size and training compute.

Result: Experimental results show that the scaled-up HPCM-1B model achieves state-of-the-art rate-distortion performance, demonstrating the benefits of scaling.

Conclusion: Scaling learned image compression models improves their capabilities, and these findings could inspire further research linking compression technologies to the advancements in intelligence models.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) highlight a strong connection
between intelligence and compression. Learned image compression, a fundamental
task in modern data compression, has made significant progress in recent years.
However, current models remain limited in scale, restricting their
representation capacity, and how scaling model size influences compression
performance remains unexplored. In this work, we present a pioneering study on
scaling up learned image compression models and revealing the performance
trends through scaling laws. Using the recent state-of-the-art HPCM model as
baseline, we scale model parameters from 68.5 millions to 1 billion and fit
power-law relations between test loss and key scaling variables, including
model size and optimal training compute. The results reveal a scaling trend,
enabling extrapolation to larger scale models. Experimental results demonstrate
that the scaled-up HPCM-1B model achieves state-of-the-art rate-distortion
performance. We hope this work inspires future exploration of large-scale
compression models and deeper investigations into the connection between
compression and intelligence.

*Ahsan Habib Akash,Greg Murray,Annahita Amireskandari,Joel Palko,Carol Laxson,Binod Bhattarai,Prashnna Gyawali*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces an attribute-agnostic debiasing method using contrastive learning to reduce disparities in glaucoma screening from retinal images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The goal is to address demographic biases in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) while improving automated glaucoma screening, which is critical due to its impact on underserved populations.

Method: The paper proposes a label-free approach that infers subgroups using unsupervised clustering, computes gradient-similarity weights, and targets underperforming clusters using a weighted objective in a multimodal learning framework.

Result: The method was evaluated on the Harvard FairVLMed glaucoma subset, showing improved measures of fairness like Equalized Odds Distance, Equalized Subgroup AUC, and Groupwise AUC.

Conclusion: The proposed approach successfully promotes equitable performance across inferred demographic subgroups, potentially reducing biases in medical applications.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable success on multimodal
tasks such as image-text retrieval and zero-shot classification, yet they can
exhibit demographic biases even when explicit protected attributes are absent
during training. In this work, we focus on automated glaucoma screening from
retinal fundus images, a critical application given that glaucoma is a leading
cause of irreversible blindness and disproportionately affects underserved
populations. Building on a reweighting-based contrastive learning framework, we
introduce an attribute-agnostic debiasing method that (i) infers proxy
subgroups via unsupervised clustering of image-image embeddings, (ii) computes
gradient-similarity weights between the CLIP-style multimodal loss and a
SimCLR-style image-pair contrastive loss, and (iii) applies these weights in a
joint, top-$k$ weighted objective to upweight underperforming clusters. This
label-free approach adaptively targets the hardest examples, thereby reducing
subgroup disparities. We evaluate our method on the Harvard FairVLMed glaucoma
subset, reporting Equalized Odds Distance (EOD), Equalized Subgroup AUC (ES
AUC), and Groupwise AUC to demonstrate equitable performance across inferred
demographic subgroups.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing biometric facial recognition systems are vulnerable to advanced spoofing methods like deepfakes, exposing a gap in current liveness detection techniques.

Method: Deep learning models integrating texture analysis and reflective properties of human traits were developed and tested on five diverse datasets against various attack vectors.

Result: AttackNet V2.2 achieved 99.9% accuracy, demonstrating a significant improvement over traditional anti-spoofing technologies.

Conclusion: The models strengthen biometric authentication systems and provide critical insights into spoofing behaviors, thereby enhancing security protocols across multiple sectors.

Abstract: In the rapidly evolving landscape of digital security, biometric
authentication systems, particularly facial recognition, have emerged as
integral components of various security protocols. However, the reliability of
these systems is compromised by sophisticated spoofing attacks, where imposters
gain unauthorized access by falsifying biometric traits. Current literature
reveals a concerning gap: existing liveness detection methodologies - designed
to counteract these breaches - fall short against advanced spoofing tactics
employing deepfakes and other artificial intelligence-driven manipulations.
This study introduces a robust solution through novel deep learning models
addressing the deficiencies in contemporary anti-spoofing techniques. By
innovatively integrating texture analysis and reflective properties associated
with genuine human traits, our models distinguish authentic presence from
replicas with remarkable precision. Extensive evaluations were conducted across
five diverse datasets, encompassing a wide range of attack vectors and
environmental conditions. Results demonstrate substantial advancement over
existing systems, with our best model (AttackNet V2.2) achieving 99.9% average
accuracy when trained on combined data. Moreover, our research unveils critical
insights into the behavioral patterns of impostor attacks, contributing to a
more nuanced understanding of their evolving nature. The implications are
profound: our models do not merely fortify the authentication processes but
also instill confidence in biometric systems across various sectors reliant on
secure access.

*Ya Zou,Jingfeng Yao,Siyuan Yu,Shuai Zhang,Wenyu Liu,Xinggang Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Turbo-VAED, a method for reducing the computational bottleneck of video VAEs to enable real-time high-resolution decoding on mobile devices. It achieves significant speedups and parameter reduction while preserving reconstruction quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deploying large generative AI models on mobile devices faces major challenges, particularly due to the inefficiencies and limitations of existing Variational AutoEncoder (VAE) architectures.

Method: The paper optimizes video VAEs by analyzing redundancy in their architecture, introducing 3D depthwise separable convolutions, implementing a decoupled 3D pixel shuffle upsampling scheme, and distilling the decoder into Turbo-VAED rather than retraining the entire VAE.

Result: Turbo-VAED achieves real-time 720p decoding on mobile devices for the first time, accelerates VAEs by up to 84.5x, reduces parameter usage to 17.5%, and retains 96.9% reconstruction quality. It outperforms existing mobile-optimized VAEs in speed and quality.

Conclusion: Turbo-VAED offers a universal solution for efficient video VAE decoding on mobile devices. It provides strong performance gains and is applicable to most video VAEs, making it suitable for real-world mobile implementation.

Abstract: There is a growing demand for deploying large generative AI models on mobile
devices. For recent popular video generative models, however, the Variational
AutoEncoder (VAE) represents one of the major computational bottlenecks. Both
large parameter sizes and mismatched kernels cause out-of-memory errors or
extremely slow inference on mobile devices. To address this, we propose a
low-cost solution that efficiently transfers widely used video VAEs to mobile
devices. (1) We analyze redundancy in existing VAE architectures and get
empirical design insights. By integrating 3D depthwise separable convolutions
into our model, we significantly reduce the number of parameters. (2) We
observe that the upsampling techniques in mainstream video VAEs are poorly
suited to mobile hardware and form the main bottleneck. In response, we propose
a decoupled 3D pixel shuffle scheme that slashes end-to-end delay. Building
upon these, we develop a universal mobile-oriented VAE decoder, Turbo-VAED. (3)
We propose an efficient VAE decoder training method. Since only the decoder is
used during deployment, we distill it to Turbo-VAED instead of retraining the
full VAE, enabling fast mobile adaptation with minimal performance loss. To our
knowledge, our method enables real-time 720p video VAE decoding on mobile
devices for the first time. This approach is widely applicable to most video
VAEs. When integrated into four representative models, with training cost as
low as $95, it accelerates original VAEs by up to 84.5x at 720p resolution on
GPUs, uses as low as 17.5% of original parameter count, and retains 96.9% of
the original reconstruction quality. Compared to mobile-optimized VAEs,
Turbo-VAED achieves a 2.9x speedup in FPS and better reconstruction quality on
the iPhone 16 Pro. The code and models will soon be available at
https://github.com/hustvl/Turbo-VAED.

One-Light-at-a-Time (OLAT) captures of full-body humans. The dataset includes
HDR RGB frames under various illuminations, such as white light, environment
maps, color gradients and fine-grained OLAT illuminations. Our evaluations of
state-of-the-art relighting and novel-view synthesis methods underscore both
the dataset's value and the significant challenges still present in modeling

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper analyzes GPU resource utilization in edge computing to highlight underutilization and proposes hardware-aware optimizations targeting NVIDIA Jetson devices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: IoT devices and advanced networks demand real-time edge data processing, requiring efficient AI accelerators like GPUs. Improving GPU utilization is vital for meeting performance demands.

Method: Detailed profiling of NVIDIA Jetson GPUs using multiple tools to analyze resource usage (e.g., SMs, tensor cores), identify bottlenecks, and assess CPU-side constraints.

Result: Edge GPUs optimized for 100% utilization in select cases, but key resources like SMs or tensor cores remain underutilized (15-30%). CPU events (e.g., thread scheduling) found to bottleneck GPU performance.

Conclusion: Optimizing both GPU and CPU-side processes is necessary to fully harness NVIDIA GPUs in edge computing, which aids efficient real-time vision inference.

Abstract: The proliferation of IoT devices and advancements in network technologies
have intensified the demand for real-time data processing at the network edge.
To address these demands, low-power AI accelerators, particularly GPUs, are
increasingly deployed for inference tasks, enabling efficient computation while
mitigating cloud-based systems' latency and bandwidth limitations. Despite
their growing deployment, GPUs remain underutilised even in computationally
intensive workloads. This underutilisation stems from the limited understanding
of GPU resource sharing, particularly in edge computing scenarios. In this
work, we conduct a detailed analysis of both high- and low-level metrics,
including GPU utilisation, memory usage, streaming multiprocessor (SM)
utilisation, and tensor core usage, to identify bottlenecks and guide
hardware-aware optimisations. By integrating traces from multiple profiling
tools, we provide a comprehensive view of resource behaviour on NVIDIA Jetson
edge devices under concurrent vision inference workloads. Our findings indicate
that while GPU utilisation can reach $100\%$ under specific optimisations,
critical low-level resources, such as SMs and tensor cores, often operate only
at $15\%$ to $30\%$ utilisation. Moreover, we observe that certain CPU-side
events, such as thread scheduling, context switching, etc., frequently emerge
as bottlenecks, further constraining overall GPU performance. We provide
several key observations for users of vision inference workloads on NVIDIA edge
devices.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper benchmarks federated learning (FL) strategies for network throughput prediction in 5G/6G edge networks using various models and datasets, highlighting key trade-offs and offering insights for scalable systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of centralized training methods in heterogeneous networks with non-IID data and to enable accurate throughput prediction for applications in 5G/6G networks.

Method: The study evaluates FL strategies (FedAvg, FedProx, FedBN) with different time-series architectures (LSTM, CNN, CNN+LSTM, Transformer) using five datasets. It examines the effects of heterogeneity, cohort size, and temporal factors on prediction.

Result: The FedBN algorithm performs robustly with non-IID data, LSTM and Transformer models achieve up to 80% higher R2 scores than CNN baselines, and Transformers require longer history windows despite faster convergence.

Conclusion: FedBN-based FL frameworks, particularly with LSTM and Transformer models, provide scalable, privacy-preserving solutions for edge-aware throughput prediction, significantly improving QoE in streaming systems.

Abstract: Accurate and adaptive network throughput prediction is essential for
latency-sensitive and bandwidth-intensive applications in 5G and emerging 6G
networks. However, most existing methods rely on centralized training with
uniformly collected data, limiting their applicability in heterogeneous mobile
environments with non-IID data distributions. This paper presents the first
comprehensive benchmarking of federated learning (FL) strategies for throughput
prediction in realistic 5G edge scenarios. We evaluate three aggregation
algorithms - FedAvg, FedProx, and FedBN - across four time-series
architectures: LSTM, CNN, CNN+LSTM, and Transformer, using five diverse
real-world datasets. We systematically analyze the effects of client
heterogeneity, cohort size, and history window length on prediction
performance. Our results reveal key trade-offs among model complexities,
convergence rates, and generalization. It is found that FedBN consistently
delivers robust performance under non-IID conditions. On the other hand, LSTM
and Transformer models outperform CNN-based baselines by up to 80% in R2
scores. Moreover, although Transformers converge in half the rounds of LSTM,
they require longer history windows to achieve a high R2, indicating higher
context dependence. LSTM is, therefore, found to achieve a favorable balance
between accuracy, rounds, and temporal footprint. To validate the end-to-end
applicability of the framework, we have integrated our FL-based predictors into
a live adaptive streaming pipeline. It is seen that FedBN-based LSTM and
Transformer models improve mean QoE scores by 11.7% and 11.4%, respectively,
over FedAvg, while also reducing the variance. These findings offer actionable
insights for building scalable, privacy-preserving, and edge-aware throughput
prediction systems in next-generation wireless networks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to solve challenges in task scheduling for multi-tenant distributed systems, such as dynamic resource fluctuation, varied tenant demands, and fairness.

Method: A scheduling method based on Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) is proposed, modeling scheduling as a Markov decision process with a multi-objective reward mechanism to optimize latency, resource utilization, and fairness.

Result: Experiments using a real-world dataset demonstrated that the proposed method outperforms existing approaches in task latency control, resource efficiency, policy stability, and fairness.

Conclusion: The method effectively improves scheduling efficiency and resource management, making it practically valuable for distributed systems under complex, multi-tenant conditions.

Abstract: This paper addresses key challenges in task scheduling for multi-tenant
distributed systems, including dynamic resource variation, heterogeneous tenant
demands, and fairness assurance. An adaptive scheduling method based on
reinforcement learning is proposed. By modeling the scheduling process as a
Markov decision process, the study defines the state space, action space, and
reward function. A scheduling policy learning framework is designed using
Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) as the core algorithm. This enables dynamic
perception of complex system states and real-time decision-making. Under a
multi-objective reward mechanism, the scheduler jointly optimizes task latency,
resource utilization, and tenant fairness. The coordination between the policy
network and the value network continuously refines the scheduling strategy.
This enhances overall system performance. To validate the effectiveness of the
proposed method, a series of experiments were conducted in multi-scenario
environments built using a real-world public dataset. The experiments evaluated
task latency control, resource efficiency, policy stability, and fairness. The
results show that the proposed method outperforms existing scheduling
approaches across multiple evaluation metrics. It demonstrates strong stability
and generalization ability. The proposed scheduling framework provides
practical and engineering value in policy design, dynamic resource modeling,
and multi-tenant service assurance. It effectively improves scheduling
efficiency and resource management in distributed systems under complex
conditions.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper introduces a cloud-device separation framework to improve the efficiency of serving large language models, addressing bottlenecks like decoding delays and limited device resources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address two major issues in serving large language models: 1) prolonged resource occupation on the cloud during the decoding phase, and 2) dramatically increased latency (TTFT) in the prefill phase on devices with limited resources.

Method: A novel framework is proposed where the cloud handles only the prefill phase of large language models and sends the first token to the device, enabling quicker TTFT. A speed controller ensures smooth output token timing (TPOT), and refinement of prompts during cloud prefill further enhances device performance. The framework is named P/D-Device.

Result: The proposed P/D-Device system achieves a reduction in TTFT by at least 60%, improves maximum TPOT to tens of milliseconds, and increases cloud throughput by up to 15x in experiments using real-world data.

Conclusion: The P/D-Device framework successfully mitigates resource bottlenecks, enabling both lower latency and higher throughput in serving large language models. It outperforms alternative approaches and is shown to be practical and efficient in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Serving disaggregated large language models has been widely adopted in
industrial practice for enhanced performance. However, too many tokens
generated in decoding phase, i.e., occupying the resources for a long time,
essentially hamper the cloud from achieving a higher throughput. Meanwhile, due
to limited on-device resources, the time to first token (TTFT), i.e., the
latency of prefill phase, increases dramatically with the growth on prompt
length. In order to concur with such a bottleneck on resources, i.e., long
occupation in cloud and limited on-device computing capacity, we propose to
separate large language model between cloud and devices. That is, the cloud
helps a portion of the content for each device, only in its prefill phase.
Specifically, after receiving the first token from the cloud, decoupling with
its own prefill, the device responds to the user immediately for a lower TTFT.
Then, the following tokens from cloud are presented via a speed controller for
smoothed TPOT (the time per output token), until the device catches up with the
progress. On-device prefill is then amortized using received tokens while the
resource usage in cloud is controlled. Moreover, during cloud prefill, the
prompt can be refined, using those intermediate data already generated, to
further speed up on-device inference. We implement such a scheme P/D-Device,
and confirm its superiority over other alternatives. We further propose an
algorithm to decide the best settings. Real-trace experiments show that TTFT
decreases at least 60%, maximum TPOT is about tens of milliseconds, and cloud
throughput increases by up to 15x.

### [185] [Benchmarking Large Language Models for Geolocating Colonial Virginia Land Grants](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08266)
*Ryan Mioduski*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This study evaluates large language models (LLMs) in converting Virginia's 17th-18th century land patent descriptions to geographic coordinates. Using 5,471 cases and testing six OpenAI models, results show significant outperformance over external baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the limitation in spatial analysis of Virginia's historical land patents, which exist primarily as narrative descriptions, by leveraging the capabilities of modern LLMs for georeferencing.

Method: The study compares six OpenAI models under two approaches (direct-to-coordinate and chain-of-thought with external geocoding) against benchmarks including GIS analysts and existing geoparsers. It uses test cases and evaluates models on accuracy and cost-effectiveness.

Result: The best-performing LLM achieved a mean error of 23 km, reducing to 19 km with an ensemble approach. It outperformed standard baselines by substantial margins, while maintaining cost-efficiency and demonstrating minimal reliance on external geocoding.

Conclusion: LLMs prove to be scalable, accurate, and cost-efficient for historical georeferencing tasks, showcasing their potential to significantly enhance spatial analysis of historical data like Virginia's land patents.

Abstract: Virginia's seventeenth- and eighteenth-century land patents survive primarily
as narrative metes-and-bounds descriptions, limiting spatial analysis. This
study systematically evaluates current-generation large language models (LLMs)
in converting these prose abstracts into geographically accurate
latitude/longitude coordinates within a focused evaluation context. A digitized
corpus of 5,471 Virginia patent abstracts (1695-1732) is released, with 43
rigorously verified test cases serving as an initial, geographically focused
benchmark. Six OpenAI models across three architectures (o-series, GPT-4-class,
and GPT-3.5) were tested under two paradigms: direct-to-coordinate and
tool-augmented chain-of-thought invoking external geocoding APIs. Results were
compared with a GIS-analyst baseline, the Stanford NER geoparser, Mordecai-3,
and a county-centroid heuristic.
  The top single-call model, o3-2025-04-16, achieved a mean error of 23 km
(median 14 km), outperforming the median LLM (37.4 km) by 37.5%, the weakest
LLM (50.3 km) by 53.5%, and external baselines by 67% (GIS analyst) and 70%
(Stanford NER). A five-call ensemble further reduced errors to 19 km (median 12
km) at minimal additional cost (approx. USD 0.20 per grant), outperforming the
median LLM by 48.6%. A patentee-name-redaction ablation increased error by
about 9%, indicating reliance on textual landmark and adjacency descriptions
rather than memorization. The cost-efficient gpt-4o-2024-08-06 model maintained
a 28 km mean error at USD 1.09 per 1,000 grants, establishing a strong
cost-accuracy benchmark; external geocoding tools offered no measurable benefit
in this evaluation.
  These findings demonstrate the potential of LLMs for scalable, accurate, and
cost-effective historical georeferencing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal biomedical AI systems based on general foundation LLMs have limited understanding of medical concepts and struggle with image-text relationship capture, necessitating a specialized approach.

Method: Doctor Sun integrates a vision encoder and a medical LLM, with a two-stage training process focusing on feature alignment and instruction tuning using diverse medical datasets.

Result: The development of Doctor Sun enhances multimodal generative capabilities in medicine, and SunMed-VL dataset, along with models and resources, is released to support research.

Conclusion: Doctor Sun and its supporting SunMed-VL dataset represent a significant step in advancing biomedical multimodal AI with improved concept comprehension and data integration.

Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) have demonstrated significant potential in
providing innovative solutions for various biomedical tasks, including
pathology analysis, radiology report generation, and biomedical assistance.
However, the existing multimodal biomedical AI is typically based on foundation
LLMs, thus hindering the understanding of intricate medical concepts with
limited medical training data. Moreover, recent LLaVA-induced medical LMMs
struggle to effectively capture the intricate relationship between the texts
and the images. Therefore, we introduce Doctor Sun, a large multimodal
generative model specialized in medicine, developed to encode, integrate, and
interpret diverse biomedical data modalities such as text and images. In
particular, Doctor Sun integrates a pre-trained vision encoder with a medical
LLM and conducts two-stage training on various medical datasets, focusing on
feature alignment and instruction tuning. Moreover, we release SunMed-VL, a
wide-range bilingual medical multimodal dataset, along with all associated
models, code, and resources, to freely support the advancement of biomedical
multimodal research.

### [187] [Towards Scalable Lottery Ticket Networks using Genetic Algorithms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08877)
*Julian Schönberger,Maximilian Zorn,Jonas Nüßlein,Thomas Gabor,Philipp Altmann*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates the use of genetic algorithms to identify efficient subnetworks (strong lottery tickets) within overparameterized neural networks without requiring traditional training, achieving competitive performance and sparsity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods of neural network design and training are resource-intensive, often relying on overparameterized models and subsequent compression, motivating the need for more efficient alternatives.

Method: The paper employs genetic algorithms to identify strong lottery ticket subnetworks within randomly initialized neural networks, avoiding expensive parameter updates and leveraging evolutionary strategies.

Result: The approach demonstrated improved accuracies and sparsity levels for classification tasks compared to existing methods, and it achieved these results without utilizing gradient-based training.

Conclusion: Using genetic algorithms, effective and efficient neural network subnetworks can be identified without expensive parameter training, potentially optimizing resource utilization in deep learning.

Abstract: Building modern deep learning systems that are not just effective but also
efficient requires rethinking established paradigms for model training and
neural architecture design. Instead of adapting highly overparameterized
networks and subsequently applying model compression techniques to reduce
resource consumption, a new class of high-performing networks skips the need
for expensive parameter updates, while requiring only a fraction of parameters,
making them highly scalable. The Strong Lottery Ticket Hypothesis posits that
within randomly initialized, sufficiently overparameterized neural networks,
there exist subnetworks that can match the accuracy of the trained original
model-without any training. This work explores the usage of genetic algorithms
for identifying these strong lottery ticket subnetworks. We find that for
instances of binary and multi-class classification tasks, our approach achieves
better accuracies and sparsity levels than the current state-of-the-art without
requiring any gradient information. In addition, we provide justification for
the need for appropriate evaluation metrics when scaling to more complex
network architectures and learning tasks.

### [188] [Towards Heterogeneity-Aware and Energy-Efficient Topology Optimization for Decentralized Federated Learning in Edge Environment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08278)
*Yuze Liu,Tiehua Zhang,Zhishu Shen,Libing Wu,Shiping Chen,Jiong Jin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Hat-DFed is a heterogeneity-aware, cost-effective decentralized federated learning framework addressing challenges in edge computing environments related to topology dynamics, energy efficiency, and data heterogeneity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome challenges in decentralized federated learning (DFL), such as communication bottlenecks, energy inefficiency, and degraded model performance due to data and resource heterogeneity in edge computing systems.

Method: Hat-DFed employs a dual optimization problem for topology construction, proven NP-hard, and introduces a two-phase algorithm for dynamic topology optimization. Additionally, it incorporates importance-aware model aggregation to address data heterogeneity issues.

Result: The proposed framework shows improvements in model performance and energy efficiency by dynamically optimizing communication topologies and mitigating performance degradation under heterogeneous edge environments.

Conclusion: Hat-DFed effectively addresses critical challenges in decentralized federated learning by providing a scalable, energy-efficient, and performance-aware framework for edge computing systems.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a promising paradigm within edge
computing (EC) systems, enabling numerous edge devices to collaboratively train
artificial intelligence (AI) models while maintaining data privacy. To overcome
the communication bottlenecks associated with centralized parameter servers,
decentralized federated learning (DFL), which leverages peer-to-peer (P2P)
communication, has been extensively explored in the research community.
Although researchers design a variety of DFL approach to ensure model
convergence, its iterative learning process inevitably incurs considerable cost
along with the growth of model complexity and the number of participants. These
costs are largely influenced by the dynamic changes of topology in each
training round, particularly its sparsity and connectivity conditions.
Furthermore, the inherent resources heterogeneity in the edge environments
affects energy efficiency of learning process, while data heterogeneity
degrades model performance. These factors pose significant challenges to the
design of an effective DFL framework for EC systems. To this end, we propose
Hat-DFed, a heterogeneity-aware and coset-effective decentralized federated
learning (DFL) framework. In Hat-DFed, the topology construction is formulated
as a dual optimization problem, which is then proven to be NP-hard, with the
goal of maximizing model performance while minimizing cumulative energy
consumption in complex edge environments. To solve this problem, we design a
two-phase algorithm that dynamically constructs optimal communication
topologies while unbiasedly estimating their impact on both model performance
and energy cost. Additionally, the algorithm incorporates an importance-aware
model aggregation mechanism to mitigate performance degradation caused by data
heterogeneity.

### [189] [XFMNet: Decoding Cross-Site and Nonstationary Water Patterns via Stepwise Multimodal Fusion for Long-Term Water Quality Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08279)
*Ziqi Wang,Hailiang Zhao,Cheng Bao,Wenzhuo Qian,Yuhao Yang,Xueqiang Sun,Shuiguang Deng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents XFMNet, a network designed for long-term water quality forecasts by integrating spatial and environmental context using multimodal data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to overcome the challenges of predicting water quality, including complex periodicity, nonstationarity, abrupt fluctuations, and spatial-temporal dynamics across multiple sites.

Method: The proposed XFMNet combines adaptive downsampling, locally adaptive decomposition, and cross-attention gated fusion to integrate remote sensing precipitation imagery with water quality data, enabling dynamic analysis of trends and cycles.

Result: Experiments on real-world datasets show that XFMNet outperforms existing methods in spatially distributed time-series prediction.

Conclusion: XFMNet enhances robustness in water quality forecasting by leveraging multimodal fusion, demonstrating its capability to address ecological and spatio-temporal complexities effectively.

Abstract: Long-term time-series forecasting is critical for environmental monitoring,
yet water quality prediction remains challenging due to complex periodicity,
nonstationarity, and abrupt fluctuations induced by ecological factors. These
challenges are further amplified in multi-site scenarios that require
simultaneous modeling of temporal and spatial dynamics. To tackle this, we
introduce XFMNet, a stepwise multimodal fusion network that integrates remote
sensing precipitation imagery to provide spatial and environmental context in
river networks. XFMNet first aligns temporal resolutions between water quality
series and remote sensing inputs via adaptive downsampling, followed by locally
adaptive decomposition to disentangle trend and cycle components. A
cross-attention gated fusion module dynamically integrates temporal patterns
with spatial and ecological cues, enhancing robustness to nonstationarity and
site-specific anomalies. Through progressive and recursive fusion, XFMNet
captures both long-term trends and short-term fluctuations. Extensive
experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate substantial improvements over
state-of-the-art baselines, highlighting the effectiveness of XFMNet for
spatially distributed time series prediction.

### [190] [MoSSDA: A Semi-Supervised Domain Adaptation Framework for Multivariate Time-Series Classification using Momentum Encoder](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08280)
*Seonyoung Kim,Dongil Kim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces MoSSDA, a two-step semi-supervised domain adaptation framework for multivariate time-series classification that achieves state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models perform poorly under domain shifts, where the training and test data distributions differ. This paper addresses this challenge in multivariate time-series classification through SSDA.

Method: MoSSDA uses a domain-invariant encoder to extract robust features, followed by a mixup-enhanced positive contrastive module with an online momentum encoder. The gradient flow between encoders and the classifier is separated.

Result: MoSSDA outperformed existing approaches on six datasets for various setups (different backbones and unlabeled ratios in target domain data), confirmed by extensive experiments and ablation studies.

Conclusion: The proposed MoSSDA framework is effective in addressing domain shifts in semi-supervised settings, producing robust, discriminative representations without requiring data augmentation.

Abstract: Deep learning has emerged as the most promising approach in various fields;
however, when the distributions of training and test data are different (domain
shift), the performance of deep learning models can degrade. Semi-supervised
domain adaptation (SSDA) is a major approach for addressing this issue,
assuming that a fully labeled training set (source domain) is available, but
the test set (target domain) provides labels only for a small subset. In this
study, we propose a novel two-step momentum encoder-utilized SSDA framework,
MoSSDA, for multivariate time-series classification. Time series data are
highly sensitive to noise, and sequential dependencies cause domain shifts
resulting in critical performance degradation. To obtain a robust,
domain-invariant and class-discriminative representation, MoSSDA employs a
domain-invariant encoder to learn features from both source and target domains.
Subsequently, the learned features are fed to a mixup-enhanced positive
contrastive module consisting of an online momentum encoder. The final
classifier is trained with learned features that exhibit consistency and
discriminability with limited labeled target domain data, without data
augmentation. We applied a two-stage process by separating the gradient flow
between the encoders and the classifier to obtain rich and complex
representations. Through extensive experiments on six diverse datasets, MoSSDA
achieved state-of-the-art performance for three different backbones and various
unlabeled ratios in the target domain data. The Ablation study confirms that
each module, including two-stage learning, is effective in improving the
performance. Our code is available at https://github.com/seonyoungKimm/MoSSDA

### [191] [Understanding Transformers through the Lens of Pavlovian Conditioning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08289)
*Mu Qiao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a reinterpretation of attention mechanisms in transformers through the lens of Pavlovian conditioning, offering mathematical and theoretical insights into their computational principles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To elucidate the opaque computational principles underlying the success of attention mechanisms in transformers.

Method: The authors develop a theoretical framework equating attention mechanisms with Pavlovian conditioning and analyze these using simplified linear attention models.

Result: The framework provides insights such as a capacity theorem for attention heads, architectural trade-offs balancing model depth and width, and implications of biologically inspired learning rules on transformer architectures.

Conclusion: The paper posits that transformers' success lies in their implementation of evolutionary-optimized computational principles rather than purely novel architectures.

Abstract: Transformer architectures have revolutionized artificial intelligence (AI)
through their attention mechanisms, yet the computational principles underlying
their success remain opaque. We present a novel theoretical framework that
reinterprets the core computation of attention as Pavlovian conditioning. Our
model finds a direct mathematical analogue in linear attention, which
simplifies the analysis of the underlying associative process. We demonstrate
that attention's queries, keys, and values can be mapped to the three elements
of classical conditioning: test stimuli that probe associations, conditional
stimuli (CS) that serve as retrieval cues, and unconditional stimuli (US) that
contain response information. Through this lens, we suggest that each attention
operation constructs a transient associative memory via a Hebbian rule, where
CS-US pairs form dynamic associations that test stimuli can later retrieve. Our
framework yields several theoretical insights grounded in this linearized
model: (1) a capacity theorem showing that attention heads can store
O($\sqrt{d_k}$) associations before interference degrades retrieval; (2) an
error propagation analysis revealing fundamental architectural trade-offs of
balancing model depth, width, and head redundancy to maintain reliability; and
(3) an understanding of how biologically plausible learning rules could enhance
transformer architectures. By establishing this deep connection, we suggest
that the success of modern AI may stem not from architectural novelty alone,
but from implementing computational principles that biology optimized over
millions of years of evolution.

### [192] [Multi-grained spatial-temporal feature complementarity for accurate online cellular traffic prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08281)
*Ningning Fu,Shengheng Liu,Weiliang Xie,Yongming Huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces MGSTC, an online method for precise cellular traffic forecasting by leveraging multi-grained spatial-temporal feature complementarity and real-time learning to address concept drift.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The telecom industry struggles with relying on manual intervention and challenges posed by the sporadic and bursty nature of cellular traffic, as well as concept drift affecting forecasting accuracy.

Method: MGSTC combines coarse-grained temporal attention for trend estimation and fine-grained spatial attention to refine details. An online learning strategy detects and responds to concept drift in real-time.

Result: Experiments across four real-world datasets show that MGSTC achieves superior performance over eleven state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: MGSTC is an effective solution for dynamic and accurate cellular traffic prediction, addressing the industry's practical continuous forecasting challenges.

Abstract: Knowledge discovered from telecom data can facilitate proactive understanding
of network dynamics and user behaviors, which in turn empowers service
providers to optimize cellular traffic scheduling and resource allocation.
Nevertheless, the telecom industry still heavily relies on manual expert
intervention. Existing studies have been focused on exhaustively explore the
spatial-temporal correlations. However, they often overlook the underlying
characteristics of cellular traffic, which are shaped by the sporadic and
bursty nature of telecom services. Additionally, concept drift creates
substantial obstacles to maintaining satisfactory accuracy in continuous
cellular forecasting tasks. To resolve these problems, we put forward an online
cellular traffic prediction method grounded in Multi-Grained Spatial-Temporal
feature Complementarity (MGSTC). The proposed method is devised to achieve
high-precision predictions in practical continuous forecasting scenarios.
Concretely, MGSTC segments historical data into chunks and employs the
coarse-grained temporal attention to offer a trend reference for the prediction
horizon. Subsequently, fine-grained spatial attention is utilized to capture
detailed correlations among network elements, which enables localized
refinement of the established trend. The complementarity of these multi-grained
spatial-temporal features facilitates the efficient transmission of valuable
information. To accommodate continuous forecasting needs, we implement an
online learning strategy that can detect concept drift in real-time and
promptly switch to the appropriate parameter update stage. Experiments carried
out on four real-world datasets demonstrate that MGSTC outperforms eleven
state-of-the-art baselines consistently.

### [193] [Scaled-Dot-Product Attention as One-Sided Entropic Optimal Transport](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08369)
*Elon Litman*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper provides a first-principles justification for scaled-dot-product attention (SDPA), linking it to Entropic Optimal Transport and revealing its mathematical properties for inference and learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To offer a rigorous theoretical foundation for SDPA, addressing its typically heuristic motivation and exploring its mathematical implications.

Method: By relating SDPA to the Entropic Optimal Transport problem and analyzing its backward pass through reinforcement learning-based gradient updates.

Result: The forward pass aligns with the EOT problem, while the backward pass is equivalent to an advantage-based policy gradient. Both are influenced by specific information geometry.

Conclusion: SDPA is shown to be a principled mechanism where the forward pass optimizes for inference and the backward pass facilitates manifold-aware learning.

Abstract: The scaled-dot-product attention (SDPA) mechanism is a core component of
modern deep learning, but its mathematical form is often motivated by
heuristics. This work provides a first-principles justification for SDPA. We
first show that the attention forward pass is the exact solution to a
degenerate, one-sided Entropic Optimal Transport (EOT) problem, which seeks a
distribution that maximizes similarity while being maximally entropic. This
optimization perspective has a direct consequence for the backward pass. We
prove that the standard gradient computed via backpropagation is mathematically
identical to an advantage-based policy gradient, a variance-reduced update rule
from reinforcement learning. Crucially, we demonstrate that the EOT formulation
of the forward pass induces a specific information geometry on the space of
attention distributions. It is this geometry, characterized by the Fisher
Information Matrix, that dictates the precise form of the learning gradient,
revealing the advantage-based update as a natural consequence of the
optimization problem being solved. This unified view reveals SDPA as a
principled mechanism where the forward pass performs optimal inference and the
backward pass implements a rational, manifold-aware learning update.

*Kazuki Irie,Samuel J. Gershman*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper reviews Fast Weight Programmers (FWPs), a class of RNNs with 2D matrix-form hidden states, exploring their function as short-term memory and connections to brain synaptic plasticity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the potential of Fast Weight Programmers (FWPs) in machine learning by examining their technical foundations, computational properties, and links to both artificial intelligence frameworks like transformers and biological synaptic plasticity.

Method: The paper reviews the principles of FWPs, their relationship to other models (e.g., state space models and transformers), and their parallels to brain-based synaptic plasticity.

Result: The review identifies FWPs as a dynamic, short-term memory model in RNNs with possible links to natural intelligence, making them relevant for advancing machine learning architectures.

Conclusion: FWPs represent a convergence between artificial neural networks and biological synaptic plasticity, offering new insights into memory storage and learning dynamics.

Abstract: Recent advances in artificial neural networks for machine learning, and
language modeling in particular, have established a family of recurrent neural
network (RNN) architectures that, unlike conventional RNNs with vector-form
hidden states, use two-dimensional (2D) matrix-form hidden states. Such
2D-state RNNs, known as Fast Weight Programmers (FWPs), can be interpreted as a
neural network whose synaptic weights (called fast weights) dynamically change
over time as a function of input observations, and serve as short-term memory
storage; corresponding synaptic weight modifications are controlled or
programmed by another network (the programmer) whose parameters are trained
(e.g., by gradient descent). In this Primer, we review the technical
foundations of FWPs, their computational characteristics, and their connections
to transformers and state space models. We also discuss connections between
FWPs and models of synaptic plasticity in the brain, suggesting a convergence
of natural and artificial intelligence.

### [195] [Regret minimization in Linear Bandits with offline data via extended D-optimal exploration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08420)
*Sushant Vijayan,Arun Suggala,Karthikeyan VS,Soumyabrata Pal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces the OOPE algorithm to minimize online regret in linear bandits enhanced by prior offline data, achieving improved regret bounds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Leveraging offline data available in settings like recommendation systems and advertising to minimize online regret in linear bandit models.

Method: Developed the OOPE algorithm, using extended D-optimal design and Frank-Wolfe approximation to effectively incorporate offline data into exploration phases.

Result: OOPE achieves reduced online regret bounds depending on the quality and quantity of offline data (measured by eigen-spectrum). Minimax lower bounds also validate algorithm performance.

Conclusion: OOPE optimally incorporates offline data, demonstrating significant online regret reductions for high-quality offline datasets, and achieves theoretical lower bounds indicative of its efficacy.

Abstract: We consider the problem of online regret minimization in linear bandits with
access to prior observations (offline data) from the underlying bandit model.
There are numerous applications where extensive offline data is often
available, such as in recommendation systems, online advertising. Consequently,
this problem has been studied intensively in recent literature. Our algorithm,
Offline-Online Phased Elimination (OOPE), effectively incorporates the offline
data to substantially reduce the online regret compared to prior work. To
leverage offline information prudently, OOPE uses an extended D-optimal design
within each exploration phase. OOPE achieves an online regret is
$\tilde{O}(\sqrt{\deff T \log \left(|\mathcal{A}|T\right)}+d^2)$. $\deff \leq
d)$ is the effective problem dimension which measures the number of poorly
explored directions in offline data and depends on the eigen-spectrum
$(\lambda_k)_{k \in [d]}$ of the Gram matrix of the offline data. The
eigen-spectrum $(\lambda_k)_{k \in [d]}$ is a quantitative measure of the
\emph{quality} of offline data. If the offline data is poorly explored ($\deff
\approx d$), we recover the established regret bounds for purely online setting
while, when offline data is abundant ($\Toff >> T$) and well-explored ($\deff =
o(1) $), the online regret reduces substantially. Additionally, we provide the
first known minimax regret lower bounds in this setting that depend explicitly
on the quality of the offline data. These lower bounds establish the optimality
of our algorithm in regimes where offline data is either well-explored or
poorly explored. Finally, by using a Frank-Wolfe approximation to the extended
optimal design we further improve the $O(d^{2})$ term to
$O\left(\frac{d^{2}}{\deff} \min \{ \deff,1\} \right)$, which can be
substantial in high dimensions with moderate quality of offline data $\deff =
\Omega(1)$.

### [196] [Probabilistic Emissivity Retrieval from Hyperspectral Data via Physics-Guided Variational Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08291)
*Joshua R. Tempelman,Kevin Mitchell,Adam J. Wachtor,Eric B. Flynn*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a physics-conditioned generative model for hyperspectral imaging (HSI) target identification, aiming to go beyond traditional per-pixel class predictions by generating interpretable emissivity distributions and incorporating contextual information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of traditional deep learning methods in HSI, such as their reliance on predefined material libraries, lack of interpretability, and inability to handle material variations inherent in remotely sensed data.

Method: The paper proposes a probabilistic latent-variable model that uses HSI radiance data to estimate emissivity spectra. The approach integrates physically relevant conditioning with scene-specific atmosphere and background information, employs an augmentation scheme and physics-based losses, and uses Monte-Carlo sampling for uncertainty quantification.

Result: The model successfully delivers emissivity distributions that are interpretable and unbiased while enabling contextualized material identification and uncertainty quantification for HSI data.

Conclusion: By leveraging a physics-conditioned generative framework, the study enhances the interpretability of HSI target identification, captures material variabilities, and provides robust uncertainty-aware material matching, thus overcoming key limitations in existing methods.

Abstract: Recent research has proven neural networks to be a powerful tool for
performing hyperspectral imaging (HSI) target identification. However, many
deep learning frameworks deliver a single material class prediction and operate
on a per-pixel basis; such approaches are limited in their interpretability and
restricted to predicting materials that are accessible in available training
libraries. In this work, we present an inverse modeling approach in the form of
a physics-conditioned generative model.A probabilistic latent-variable model
learns the underlying distribution of HSI radiance measurements and produces
the conditional distribution of the emissivity spectrum. Moreover, estimates of
the HSI scene's atmosphere and background are used as a physically relevant
conditioning mechanism to contextualize a given radiance measurement during the
encoding and decoding processes. Furthermore, we employ an in-the-loop
augmentation scheme and physics-based loss criteria to avoid bias towards a
predefined training material set and to encourage the model to learn physically
consistent inverse mappings. Monte-Carlo sampling of the model's conditioned
posterior delivers a sought emissivity distribution and allows for
interpretable uncertainty quantification. Moreover, a distribution-based
material matching scheme is presented to return a set of likely material
matches for an inferred emissivity distribution. Hence, we present a strategy
to incorporate contextual information about a given HSI scene, capture the
possible variation of underlying material spectra, and provide interpretable
probability measures of a candidate material accounting for given
remotely-sensed radiance measurement.

### [197] [Differentiable Cyclic Causal Discovery Under Unmeasured Confounders](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08450)
*Muralikrishnna G. Sethuraman,Faramarz Fekri*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces DCCD-CONF, a method for discovering nonlinear cyclic causal graphs with unmeasured confounders, using interventional data. It offers better performance and theoretical guarantees compared to previous methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Causal discovery algorithms often assume all variables are observed and graphs are acyclic, which is unrealistic in real-world systems. Existing approaches for handling confounders suffer from limitations like linearity assumptions or scalability issues.

Method: The proposed DCCD-CONF framework alternates between optimizing a causal graph structure and estimating the confounder distribution by maximizing the log-likelihood of interventional data.

Result: DCCD-CONF demonstrates superior performance in recovering causal graphs and identifying confounders, based on experiments with synthetic and real-world (gene perturbation) datasets.

Conclusion: DCCD-CONF effectively addresses the challenges of nonlinear, cyclic causal discovery in the presence of unmeasured confounders, with strong experimental and theoretical outcomes.

Abstract: Understanding causal relationships between variables is fundamental across
scientific disciplines. Most causal discovery algorithms rely on two key
assumptions: (i) all variables are observed, and (ii) the underlying causal
graph is acyclic. While these assumptions simplify theoretical analysis, they
are often violated in real-world systems, such as biological networks. Existing
methods that account for confounders either assume linearity or struggle with
scalability. To address these limitations, we propose DCCD-CONF, a novel
framework for differentiable learning of nonlinear cyclic causal graphs in the
presence of unmeasured confounders using interventional data. Our approach
alternates between optimizing the graph structure and estimating the confounder
distribution by maximizing the log-likelihood of the data. Through experiments
on synthetic data and real-world gene perturbation datasets, we show that
DCCD-CONF outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both causal graph recovery
and confounder identification. Additionally, we also provide consistency
guarantees for our framework, reinforcing its theoretical soundness.

### [198] [SHEFL: Resource-Aware Aggregation and Sparsification in Heterogeneous Ensemble Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08552)
*Keumseo Ryum,Jinu Gong,Joonhyuk Kang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes SHEFL, a global ensemble-based federated learning (FL) framework, addressing heterogeneity across clients with diverse computational capacities, achieving improved fairness and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges posed by system and data heterogeneity in federated learning, which hinders convergence and efficiency in realistic communication scenarios.

Method: SHEFL allocates multiple global models to clients based on computational resources, introduces a bias-aware aggregation scheme, and dynamically adjusts client resource ratios to reduce training burdens and data biases.

Result: The method effectively handles computational heterogeneity, improving fairness and overall performance in federated learning scenarios, as demonstrated through extensive experiments.

Conclusion: SHEFL offers a robust solution for federated learning in heterogeneous environments by leveraging adaptive resource allocation and ensemble aggregation strategies.

Abstract: Federated learning enables distributed training with private data of clients,
but its convergence is hindered by data and system heterogeneity in realistic
communication scenarios. Most existing system heterogeneous FL schemes utilize
global pruning or ensemble distillation, yet they often overlook typical
constraints required for communication efficiency. Meanwhile, deep ensembles
can aggregate predictions from individually trained models to improve
performance, but current ensemble-based FL methods fall short in fully
capturing the diversity of model predictions. In this work, we propose SHEFL, a
global ensemble-based federated learning framework suited for clients with
diverse computational capacities. We allocate different numbers of global
models to clients based on their available resources. We further introduce a
novel aggregation scheme that accounts for bias between clients with different
computational capabilities. To reduce the computational burden of training deep
ensembles and mitigate data bias, we dynamically adjust the resource ratio
across clients - aggressively reducing the influence of underpowered clients in
constrained scenarios, while increasing their weight in the opposite case.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method effectively addresses
computational heterogeneity, significantly improving both fairness and overall
performance compared to existing approaches.

*Nathan Breslow*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This research explores the effects of channel mixing via MLPs on recurrent convolutional networks, showing significant gains in generalization when such mixing is utilized.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how channel-wise mixing using MLPs can improve generalization capabilities in recurrent convolutional networks.

Method: Two architectures, DARC (basic recurrent convolution) and DAMP (advanced with gated MLP for channel mixing), are compared using the Re-ARC benchmark.

Result: DAMP outperformed DARC in both in-distribution and out-of-distribution generalization using exact-match grading criteria.

Conclusion: Channel-wise mixing through MLPs enhances the ability of recurrent convolutional networks to learn robust and generalizable patterns, with implications for neural program synthesis and hypernetwork architectures.

Abstract: We investigate the impact of channel-wise mixing via multi-layer perceptrons
(MLPs) on the generalization capabilities of recurrent convolutional networks.
Specifically, we compare two architectures: DARC (Depth Aware Recurrent
Convolution), which employs a simple recurrent convolutional structure, and
DAMP (Depth Aware Multi-layer Perceptron), which extends DARC with a gated MLP
for channel mixing. Using the Re-ARC benchmark, we find that DAMP significantly
outperforms DARC in both in-distribution and out-of-distribution generalization
under exact-match grading criteria. These results suggest that explicit channel
mixing through MLPs enables recurrent convolutional networks to learn more
robust and generalizable computational patterns. Our findings have implications
for neural program synthesis and highlight the potential of DAMP as a target
architecture for hypernetwork approaches.

*Dinh Triem Phan,Jérôme Bobin,Cheick Thiam,Christophe Bobin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces an open-source benchmark to evaluate numerical methods for γ-ray spectrometry, analyzing statistical and machine learning approaches in three scenarios with a large simulated dataset. Statistical methods excel in radionuclide identification and quantification, but their accuracy depends on accurate spectral modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of common benchmarks for evaluating and comparing numerical methods used in γ-ray spectrometry identification and quantification tasks.

Method: The authors created an open-source benchmark including simulated γ-spectrometry datasets, codes for analysis methods, and comparison metrics. They tested statistical and machine learning approaches under three conditions: known spectral signatures, deformed spectral signatures, and shifted spectral signatures.

Result: Statistical methods consistently outperform machine learning in identification under all scenarios but are sensitive to incorrect modeling of spectral signatures. They excel in radionuclide quantification, while machine learning methods underperform in this task.

Conclusion: A full-spectrum statistical approach is ideal for cases with known or well-modeled spectral signatures. Machine learning methods serve as useful alternatives under uncertain measurement conditions, particularly for identification.

Abstract: During the last decade, a large number of different numerical methods have
been proposed to tackle the automatic identification and quantification in
{\gamma}-ray spectrometry. However, the lack of common benchmarks, including
datasets, code and comparison metrics, makes their evaluation and comparison
hard. In that context, we propose an open-source benchmark that comprises
simulated datasets of various {\gamma}-spectrometry settings, codes of
different analysis approaches and evaluation metrics. This allows us to compare
the state-of-the-art end-to-end machine learning with a statistical unmixing
approach using the full spectrum. Three scenarios have been investigated: (1)
spectral signatures are assumed to be known; (2) spectral signatures are
deformed due to physical phenomena such as Compton scattering and attenuation;
and (3) spectral signatures are shifted (e.g., due to temperature variation). A
large dataset of 200000 simulated spectra containing nine radionuclides with an
experimental natural background is used for each scenario with multiple
radionuclides present in the spectrum. Regarding identification performance,
the statistical approach consistently outperforms the machine learning
approaches across all three scenarios for all comparison metrics. However, the
performance of the statistical approach can be significantly impacted when
spectral signatures are not modeled correctly. Consequently, the full-spectrum
statistical approach is most effective with known or well-modeled spectral
signatures, while end-to-end machine learning is a good alternative when
measurement conditions are uncertain for radionuclide identification.
Concerning the quantification task, the statistical approach provides accurate
estimates of radionuclide counting, while the machine learning methods deliver
less satisfactory results.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Federated Learning faces challenges in cross-organizational collaboration due to privacy-preserving constraints and diverse communication topologies.

Method: The authors propose distributed optimization algorithms leveraging the augmented Lagrangian technique, incorporating proximal relaxation and quadratic approximation to generalize unconstrained optimization methods. Termination criteria and parameter update mechanisms are also devised.

Result: The algorithms show strong performance in large-scale FL scenarios with high statistical heterogeneity among clients, paired with theoretical guarantees for convergence.

Conclusion: The framework offers a systematic approach integrating classical optimization methods into FL, providing efficiency and scalable convergence guarantees across varied communication settings.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL), as a distributed collaborative Machine Learning (ML)
framework under privacy-preserving constraints, has garnered increasing
research attention in cross-organizational data collaboration scenarios. This
paper proposes a class of distributed optimization algorithms based on the
augmented Lagrangian technique, designed to accommodate diverse communication
topologies in both centralized and decentralized FL settings. Furthermore, we
develop multiple termination criteria and parameter update mechanisms to
enhance computational efficiency, accompanied by rigorous theoretical
guarantees of convergence. By generalizing the augmented Lagrangian relaxation
through the incorporation of proximal relaxation and quadratic approximation,
our framework systematically recovers a broad of classical unconstrained
optimization methods, including proximal algorithm, classic gradient descent,
and stochastic gradient descent, among others. Notably, the convergence
properties of these methods can be naturally derived within the proposed
theoretical framework. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed
algorithm exhibits strong performance in large-scale settings with significant
statistical heterogeneity across clients.

Result: Cerealia successfully detected anomalies in agricultural weather datasets, showcasing its ability to assist end-users in informed decision-making in the context of weather data inconsistencies.

Conclusion: Digital twins and AI-powered frameworks like Cerealia can significantly improve agricultural decision-making by addressing weather data inaccuracies, providing valuable real-time insights to end-users.

Abstract: By offering a dynamic, real-time virtual representation of physical systems,
digital twin technology can enhance data-driven decision-making in digital

attributes for various agricultural decision-making and automation tasks. We
develop a modular framework named Cerealia that allows end-users to check for

### [203] [HSA-Net: Hierarchical and Structure-Aware Framework for Efficient and Scalable Molecular Language Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08334)
*Zihang Shao,Wentao Lei,Lei Wang,Wencai Ye,Li Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces HSA-Net, a framework for molecular representation learning addressing limitations in Graph Neural Networks (GNN) by providing hierarchical feature projection and fusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Graph Neural Networks (GNN)-based molecular representation learning struggles with over-smoothing in deep layers and an imbalanced global-local trade-off in existing methods.

Method: The authors propose HSA-Net with two core modules: Hierarchical Adaptive Projector (HAP) for dynamic feature projection across layers and Source-Aware Fusion (SAF) for adaptive feature fusion.

Result: HSA-Net quantitatively and qualitatively outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in molecular representation learning tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed HSA-Net effectively balances the global-local trade-off and resolves over-smoothing issues in GNN, offering superior molecular representation learning performance.

Abstract: Molecular representation learning, a cornerstone for downstream tasks like
molecular captioning and molecular property prediction, heavily relies on Graph
Neural Networks (GNN). However, GNN suffers from the over-smoothing problem,
where node-level features collapse in deep GNN layers. While existing feature
projection methods with cross-attention have been introduced to mitigate this
issue, they still perform poorly in deep features. This motivated our
exploration of using Mamba as an alternative projector for its ability to
handle complex sequences. However, we observe that while Mamba excels at
preserving global topological information from deep layers, it neglects
fine-grained details in shallow layers. The capabilities of Mamba and
cross-attention exhibit a global-local trade-off. To resolve this critical
global-local trade-off, we propose Hierarchical and Structure-Aware Network
(HSA-Net), a novel framework with two modules that enables a hierarchical
feature projection and fusion. Firstly, a Hierarchical Adaptive Projector (HAP)
module is introduced to process features from different graph layers. It learns
to dynamically switch between a cross-attention projector for shallow layers
and a structure-aware Graph-Mamba projector for deep layers, producing
high-quality, multi-level features. Secondly, to adaptively merge these
multi-level features, we design a Source-Aware Fusion (SAF) module, which
flexibly selects fusion experts based on the characteristics of the aggregation
features, ensuring a precise and effective final representation fusion.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our HSA-Net framework quantitatively and
qualitatively outperforms current state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.

*Dung T. Tran,Nguyen B. Ha,Van-Dinh Nguyen,Kok-Seng Wong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SHeRL-FL integrates split learning (SL), hierarchical FL, and representation learning to reduce complexity and communication costs in federated learning. It demonstrates notable reductions in data transmission while maintaining performance in image classification and segmentation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the computational and communication challenges in federated learning, particularly for resource-constrained edge devices and large models.

Method: Proposes SHeRL-FL, a hybrid approach combining split learning, hierarchical FL, and representation learning. It enables independent training objectives for clients and edge servers to reduce coordination complexity and communication overhead.

Result: SHeRL-FL achieves over 90% reduction in data transmission compared to centralized FL and HierFL, and 50% reduction compared to SplitFed, while maintaining performance in classification and segmentation tasks.

Conclusion: SHeRL-FL is an effective and efficient solution for enhancing scalability and reducing burdens in federated learning by addressing both computational and communication challenges.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a promising approach for addressing scalability
and latency issues in large-scale networks by enabling collaborative model
training without requiring the sharing of raw data. However, existing FL
frameworks often overlook the computational heterogeneity of edge clients and
the growing training burden on resource-limited devices. However, FL suffers
from high communication costs and complex model aggregation, especially with
large models. Previous works combine split learning (SL) and hierarchical FL
(HierFL) to reduce device-side computation and improve scalability, but this
introduces training complexity due to coordination across tiers. To address
these issues, we propose SHeRL-FL, which integrates SL and hierarchical model
aggregation and incorporates representation learning at intermediate layers. By
allowing clients and edge servers to compute training objectives independently
of the cloud, SHeRL-FL significantly reduces both coordination complexity and
communication overhead. To evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of
SHeRL-FL, we performed experiments on image classification tasks using
CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and HAM10000 with AlexNet, ResNet-18, and ResNet-50 in
both IID and non-IID settings. In addition, we evaluate performance on image
segmentation tasks using the ISIC-2018 dataset with a ResNet-50-based U-Net.
Experimental results demonstrate that SHeRL-FL reduces data transmission by
over 90\% compared to centralized FL and HierFL, and by 50\% compared to
SplitFed, which is a hybrid of FL and SL, and further improves hierarchical
split learning methods.

### [205] [Hi-fi functional priors by learning activations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08880)
*Marcin Sendera,Amin Sorkhei,Tomasz Kuśmierczyk*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper explores how trainable activations in Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) can enable flexible function-space priors to enhance regularization and uncertainty quantification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in imposing function-space priors in BNNs for more intuitive modeling and improved decision-making capabilities.

Method: The authors use optimization and flexible activation models like Pade functions and piecewise linear functions, while investigating challenges such as identifiability and loss construction.

Result: Empirical results show that even simple BNNs with flexible, trainable activations can satisfy complex function-space prior requirements.

Conclusion: Trainable activations in BNNs can effectively accommodate higher-complexity function-space priors, fostering better outputs and modeling flexibility.

Abstract: Function-space priors in Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) provide a more
intuitive approach to embedding beliefs directly into the model's output,
thereby enhancing regularization, uncertainty quantification, and risk-aware
decision-making. However, imposing function-space priors on BNNs is
challenging. We address this task through optimization techniques that explore
how trainable activations can accommodate higher-complexity priors and match
intricate target function distributions. We investigate flexible activation
models, including Pade functions and piecewise linear functions, and discuss
the learning challenges related to identifiability, loss construction, and
symmetries. Our empirical findings indicate that even BNNs with a single wide
hidden layer when equipped with flexible trainable activation, can effectively
achieve desired function-space priors.

### [206] [Fuzzy-Pattern Tsetlin Machine](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08350)
*Artem Hnilov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes the Fuzzy-Pattern Tsetlin Machine (FPTM), a new variant of the Tsetlin Machine, which uses a fuzzy evaluation strategy for clauses to improve accuracy and efficiency while reducing computational resource requirements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations of traditional Tsetlin Machine algorithms that require thousands of strict clauses for accurate prediction, leading to high memory usage, slow training, and suboptimal efficiency.

Method: The FPTM method employs a fuzzy clause evaluation mechanism where failed literals in a clause still contribute proportionally to its voting score. This allows individual sub-patterns within a clause to adapt more flexibly to input data.

Result: On IMDb, FPTM reduces clauses by 50x and improves training speed by up to 316x, achieving 90.15% accuracy with one clause per class. On Fashion-MNIST, accuracy reaches 92.18% with 2 clauses, outperforming traditional TM methods. On the noisy Amazon Sales dataset, FPTM outperforms Graph TM and Graph CNN in accuracy.

Conclusion: The fuzzy mechanism enables more efficient, robust, and accurate pattern matching, significantly reducing the number of required clauses, training time, and memory footprint, making the FPTM a promising tool for online learning on resource-constrained devices.

Abstract: The "all-or-nothing" clause evaluation strategy is a core mechanism in the
Tsetlin Machine (TM) family of algorithms. In this approach, each clause - a
logical pattern composed of binary literals mapped to input data - is
disqualified from voting if even a single literal fails. Due to this strict
requirement, standard TMs must employ thousands of clauses to achieve
competitive accuracy. This paper introduces the Fuzzy-Pattern Tsetlin Machine
(FPTM), a novel variant where clause evaluation is fuzzy rather than strict. If
some literals in a clause fail, the remaining ones can still contribute to the
overall vote with a proportionally reduced score. As a result, each clause
effectively consists of sub-patterns that adapt individually to the input,
enabling more flexible, efficient, and robust pattern matching. The proposed
fuzzy mechanism significantly reduces the required number of clauses, memory
footprint, and training time, while simultaneously improving accuracy. On the
IMDb dataset, FPTM achieves 90.15% accuracy with only one clause per class, a
50x reduction in clauses and memory over the Coalesced Tsetlin Machine. FPTM
trains up to 316x faster (45 seconds vs. 4 hours) and fits within 50 KB,
enabling online learning on microcontrollers. Inference throughput reaches 34.5
million predictions/second (51.4 GB/s). On Fashion-MNIST, accuracy reaches
92.18% (2 clauses), 93.19% (20 clauses) and 94.68% (8000 clauses), a ~400x
clause reduction compared to the Composite TM's 93.00% (8000 clauses). On the
Amazon Sales dataset with 20% noise, FPTM achieves 85.22% accuracy,
significantly outperforming the Graph Tsetlin Machine (78.17%) and a Graph
Convolutional Neural Network (66.23%).

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper highlights the value of synthetic experiments in evaluating causal machine learning methods, critiques current practices, and proposes principles to improve empirical evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite the potential of causal machine learning to optimize decision-making, its adoption remains limited due to concerns over reliability and dependence on synthetic experiments.

Method: Authors critically review existing evaluation practices in causal machine learning and propose comprehensive principles for using synthetic data to conduct reliable empirical analyses.

Result: The paper identifies shortcomings in current evaluation methods and argues the necessity of synthetic experiments for assessing causal machine learning approaches.

Conclusion: Incorporating the proposed principles can improve the reliability and robustness of causal machine learning evaluations, fostering broader adoption and real-world applications.

Abstract: Causal machine learning has the potential to revolutionize decision-making by
combining the predictive power of machine learning algorithms with the theory
of causal inference. However, these methods remain underutilized by the broader
machine learning community, in part because current empirical evaluations do
not permit assessment of their reliability and robustness, undermining their
practical utility. Specifically, one of the principal criticisms made by the
community is the extensive use of synthetic experiments. We argue, on the
contrary, that synthetic experiments are essential and necessary to precisely
assess and understand the capabilities of causal machine learning methods. To
substantiate our position, we critically review the current evaluation
practices, spotlight their shortcomings, and propose a set of principles for
conducting rigorous empirical analyses with synthetic data. Adopting the
proposed principles will enable comprehensive evaluations that build trust in
causal machine learning methods, driving their broader adoption and impactful
real-world use.

*Marte Eggen,Jacob Lysnæs-Larsen,Inga Strümke*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper explores integrating attention weights from transformer models into explainable AI frameworks for improved model interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Attention mechanisms in transformer models provide interpretable signals, but their potential to explain model behavior remains underutilized.

Method: Two novel methods were developed: 1) integrating attention weights into the Shapley value decomposition, and 2) using attention weights with token-level directional derivatives to measure concept sensitivity.

Result: The proposed methods demonstrated effectiveness on benchmarks, offering attention-driven insights within the studied XAI frameworks.

Conclusion: Incorporating attention weights enhances the explainability of transformer models, showing their utility in both NLP and computer vision tasks.

Abstract: The attention mechanism lies at the core of the transformer architecture,
providing an interpretable model-internal signal that has motivated a growing
interest in attention-based model explanations. Although attention weights do
not directly determine model outputs, they reflect patterns of token influence
that can inform and complement established explainability techniques. This work
studies the potential of utilising the information encoded in attention weights
to provide meaningful model explanations by integrating them into explainable
AI (XAI) frameworks that target fundamentally different aspects of model
behaviour. To this end, we develop two novel explanation methods applicable to
both natural language processing and computer vision tasks. The first
integrates attention weights into the Shapley value decomposition by redefining
the characteristic function in terms of pairwise token interactions via
attention weights, thus adapting this widely used game-theoretic solution
concept to provide attention-driven attributions for local explanations. The
second incorporates attention weights into token-level directional derivatives
defined through concept activation vectors to measure concept sensitivity for
global explanations. Our empirical evaluations on standard benchmarks and in a
comparison study with widely used explanation methods show that attention
weights can be meaningfully incorporated into the studied XAI frameworks,
highlighting their value in enriching transformer explainability.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study introduces a scalable method for active testing on large language models, reducing computational demands and improving performance evaluation efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard evaluation methods for large language models require significant data and computational resources, prompting a need for more label-efficient and cost-effective solutions.

Method: The approach uses surrogate models with in-context learning for guiding data acquisition, minimizes the need for frequent updates or predictions by the target model, and implements a single-run error estimator for real-time assessment.

Result: The proposed method achieves efficient evaluations of LLMs with less labeling data compared to traditional practices.

Conclusion: Scaling active testing for LLMs is feasible and leads to more data-efficient evaluation processes, without compromising assessment accuracy.

Abstract: Active testing enables label-efficient evaluation of models through careful
data acquisition. However, its significant computational costs have previously
undermined its use for large models. We show how it can be successfully scaled
up to the evaluation of large language models (LLMs). In particular we show
that the surrogate model used to guide data acquisition can be constructed
cheaply using in-context learning, does not require updating within an
active-testing loop, and can be smaller than the target model. We even find we
can make good data-acquisition decisions without computing predictions with the
target model and further introduce a single-run error estimator to asses how
well active testing is working on the fly. We find that our approach is able to
more effectively evaluate LLM performance with less data than current standard
practices.

Result: The proposed model achieved a high F1-score at lower prediction thresholds on a publicly available dataset, balancing precision and recall effectively.

Conclusion: The combination of deep learning and metaheuristic optimization demonstrated its potential in enhancing medical image analysis for complex tasks like automated liver tumor segmentation.

Abstract: Liver cancer is one of the most prevalent and lethal forms of cancer, making
early detection crucial for effective treatment. This paper introduces a novel
approach for automated liver tumor segmentation in computed tomography (CT)
images by integrating a 3D U-Net architecture with the Bat Algorithm for
hyperparameter optimization. The method enhances segmentation accuracy and
robustness by intelligently optimizing key parameters like the learning rate
and batch size. Evaluated on a publicly available dataset, our model
demonstrates a strong ability to balance precision and recall, with a high
F1-score at lower prediction thresholds. This is particularly valuable for
clinical diagnostics, where ensuring no potential tumors are missed is
paramount. Our work contributes to the field of medical image analysis by
demonstrating that the synergy between a robust deep learning architecture and

*Pallabee Das,Stefan Heindorf*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces DiGNNExplainer, a model-level explanation approach for Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs), that generates realistic explanations using discrete denoising diffusion models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of support for realistic, faithful explanations in existing post-hoc explanation methods for HGNNs, particularly in handling real node features beyond one-hot encodings.

Method: DiGNNExplainer employs discrete denoising diffusion models within a discrete space to synthesize realistic heterogeneous graphs with meaningful node features (e.g., bag-of-words).

Result: DiGNNExplainer outperformed state-of-the-art methods in producing explanations that are both realistic and faithful to the model's decision-making across multiple datasets.

Conclusion: This approach offers a significant advance in providing interpretable and effective explanations for HGNNs, bridging the gap in handling realistic node feature representations.

Abstract: Many real-world datasets, such as citation networks, social networks, and
molecular structures, are naturally represented as heterogeneous graphs, where
nodes belong to different types and have additional features. For example, in a
citation network, nodes representing "Paper" or "Author" may include attributes
like keywords or affiliations. A critical machine learning task on these graphs
is node classification, which is useful for applications such as fake news
detection, corporate risk assessment, and molecular property prediction.
Although Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs) perform well in these
contexts, their predictions remain opaque. Existing post-hoc explanation
methods lack support for actual node features beyond one-hot encoding of node
type and often fail to generate realistic, faithful explanations. To address
these gaps, we propose DiGNNExplainer, a model-level explanation approach that
synthesizes heterogeneous graphs with realistic node features via discrete
denoising diffusion. In particular, we generate realistic discrete features
(e.g., bag-of-words features) using diffusion models within a discrete space,
whereas previous approaches are limited to continuous spaces. We evaluate our
approach on multiple datasets and show that DiGNNExplainer produces
explanations that are realistic and faithful to the model's decision-making,
outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Quadratic Regularized Partial Optimal Transport (QPOT) formulation to improve sparsity in transport plans, addressing the limitations of prior entropic regularized POT methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for Partial Optimal Transport (POT) rely on entropic regularization, producing dense transport plans unsuitable for applications requiring sparsity.

Method: The authors propose a novel POT formulation using quadratic regularization (QPOT) to induce sparsity in transport plans.

Result: Extensive experiments on synthetic data, CIFAR-10, and real-world applications demonstrate improved sparsity and competitive performance of QPOT compared to existing POT formulations.

Conclusion: QPOT offers a flexible approach for unbalanced input measures while addressing sparsity needs, providing enhanced utility in various Machine Learning applications.

Abstract: Partial Optimal Transport (POT) has recently emerged as a central tool in
various Machine Learning (ML) applications. It lifts the stringent assumption
of the conventional Optimal Transport (OT) that input measures are of equal
masses, which is often not guaranteed in real-world datasets, and thus offers
greater flexibility by permitting transport between unbalanced input measures.
Nevertheless, existing major solvers for POT commonly rely on entropic
regularization for acceleration and thus return dense transport plans,
hindering the adoption of POT in various applications that favor sparsity. In
this paper, as an alternative approach to the entropic POT formulation in the
literature, we propose a novel formulation of POT with quadratic
regularization, hence termed quadratic regularized POT (QPOT), which induces
sparsity to the transport plan and consequently facilitates the adoption of POT
in many applications with sparsity requirements. Extensive experiments on
synthetic and CIFAR-10 datasets, as well as real-world applications such as
color transfer and domain adaptations, consistently demonstrate the improved
sparsity and favorable performance of our proposed QPOT formulation.

*Jihyun Lim,Junhyuk Jo,Chanhyeok Ko,Young Min Go,Jimin Hwa,Sunwoo Lee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses training neural networks using heterogeneous computing resources and introduces a method involving controlled bias for improving efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Leveraging heterogeneous resources for neural network training and overcoming inefficiencies caused by differing compute speeds.

Method: Proposes system-aware local stochastic gradient descent (local SGD) with workload allocations proportionate to compute capacity and controlled bias in sampling and aggregation.

Result: The method accelerates local SGD in heterogeneous settings, achieving accuracy comparable to or surpassing synchronous SGD within the same time frame.

Conclusion: Controlled bias and proper resource allocation can enable efficient neural network training in diverse heterogeneous computing environments.

Abstract: Most large-scale neural network training methods assume homogeneous parallel
computing resources. For example, synchronous SGD with data parallelism, the
most widely used parallel training strategy, incurs significant synchronization
overhead when workers process their assigned data at different speeds.
Consequently, in systems with heterogeneous compute resources, users often rely
solely on the fastest components, such as GPUs, for training. In this work, we
explore how to effectively use heterogeneous resources for neural network
training. We propose a system-aware local stochastic gradient descent (local
SGD) method that allocates workloads to each compute resource in proportion to
its compute capacity. To make better use of slower resources such as CPUs, we
intentionally introduce bias into data sampling and model aggregation. Our
study shows that well-controlled bias can significantly accelerate local SGD in
heterogeneous environments, achieving comparable or even higher accuracy than
synchronous SGD with data-parallelism within the same time budget. This
fundamental parallelization strategy can be readily extended to diverse
heterogeneous environments, including cloud platforms and multi-node
high-performance computing clusters.

Motivation: To address the challenges in current traffic prediction methods that depend heavily on graph structures or complex model designs, which hinder efficient deployment on large datasets.

Method: The authors introduced M3-Net, an MLP-based model that utilizes time series and spatio-temporal embeddings alongside an MLP-Mixer architecture with a mixture of experts (MoE) mechanism for feature processing.

Result: Extensive experimentation on real datasets shows that the proposed model outperforms existing methods in traffic prediction and is lightweight for deployment.

Conclusion: M3-Net is a cost-effective and high-performing model that simplifies traffic prediction by eliminating the dependency on graph structures and complex designs, making it suitable for scalable intelligent transportation systems.

Abstract: Achieving accurate traffic prediction is a fundamental but crucial task in
the development of current intelligent transportation systems.Most of the
mainstream methods that have made breakthroughs in traffic prediction rely on
spatio-temporal graph neural networks, spatio-temporal attention mechanisms,
etc. The main challenges of the existing deep learning approaches are that they
either depend on a complete traffic network structure or require intricate
model designs to capture complex spatio-temporal dependencies. These
limitations pose significant challenges for the efficient deployment and
operation of deep learning models on large-scale datasets. To address these
challenges, we propose a cost-effective graph-free Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)
based model M3-Net for traffic prediction. Our proposed model not only employs
time series and spatio-temporal embeddings for efficient feature processing but
also first introduces a novel MLP-Mixer architecture with a mixture of experts
(MoE) mechanism. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple real datasets
demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model in terms of prediction
performance and lightweight deployment.

### [215] [UQGNN: Uncertainty Quantification of Graph Neural Networks for Multivariate Spatiotemporal Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08551)
*Dahai Yu,Dingyi Zhuang,Lin Jiang,Rongchao Xu,Xinyue Ye,Yuheng Bu,Shenhao Wang,Guang Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces UQGNN, a Graph Neural Network designed for multivariate spatiotemporal prediction with uncertainty quantification, addressing limitations of deterministic models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most spatiotemporal models are deterministic and unable to quantify uncertainty, which leads to unreliable and narrow predictions, especially across heterogeneous urban phenomena.

Method: UQGNN incorporates an Interaction-aware Spatiotemporal Embedding Module and a multivariate probabilistic prediction module to improve spatial-temporal correlation and uncertainty estimation.

Result: UQGNN shows consistent improvements in prediction accuracy and uncertainty quantification across four datasets, achieving a 5% performance boost on the Shenzhen dataset.

Conclusion: UQGNN effectively enhances prediction reliability and comprehensiveness for spatiotemporal data by integrating advanced models for interaction-aware and probabilistic analysis.

Abstract: Spatiotemporal prediction plays a critical role in numerous real-world
applications such as urban planning, transportation optimization, disaster
response, and pandemic control. In recent years, researchers have made
significant progress by developing advanced deep learning models for
spatiotemporal prediction. However, most existing models are deterministic,
i.e., predicting only the expected mean values without quantifying uncertainty,
leading to potentially unreliable and inaccurate outcomes. While recent studies
have introduced probabilistic models to quantify uncertainty, they typically
focus on a single phenomenon (e.g., taxi, bike, crime, or traffic crashes),
thereby neglecting the inherent correlations among heterogeneous urban
phenomena. To address the research gap, we propose a novel Graph Neural Network
with Uncertainty Quantification, termed UQGNN for multivariate spatiotemporal
prediction. UQGNN introduces two key innovations: (i) an Interaction-aware
Spatiotemporal Embedding Module that integrates a multivariate diffusion graph
convolutional network and an interaction-aware temporal convolutional network
to effectively capture complex spatial and temporal interaction patterns, and
(ii) a multivariate probabilistic prediction module designed to estimate both
expected mean values and associated uncertainties. Extensive experiments on
four real-world multivariate spatiotemporal datasets from Shenzhen, New York
City, and Chicago demonstrate that UQGNN consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines in both prediction accuracy and uncertainty
quantification. For example, on the Shenzhen dataset, UQGNN achieves a 5%
improvement in both prediction accuracy and uncertainty quantification.

### [216] [Dynamic Rank Adjustment for Accurate and Efficient Neural Network Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08625)
*Hyuntak Shin,Aecheon Jung,Sunwoo Lee,Sungeun Hong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a dynamic-rank training framework that interleaves full-rank and low-rank training epochs to address rank collapse in low-rank neural network training, achieving efficiency close to low-rank methods while maintaining accuracy similar to full-rank approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fixed low-rank structures limit the ability of neural networks to learn complex patterns, and the effective rank of weight matrices decreases during training, especially in low-rank reparameterizations.

Method: The proposed framework dynamically alternates between full-rank and low-rank training epochs to mitigate rank collapse and adjusts the rank of weight matrices during training.

Result: The method achieves computational efficiency comparable to SVD-based low-rank training methods while providing accuracy on par with full-rank training across multiple benchmarks.

Conclusion: Dynamic-rank training effectively balances computational efficiency and model learning capacity, offering a robust alternative to purely low-rank or full-rank training methods.

Abstract: Low-rank training methods reduce the number of trainable parameters by
re-parameterizing the weights with matrix decompositions (e.g., singular value
decomposition). However, enforcing a fixed low-rank structure caps the rank of
the weight matrices and can hinder the model's ability to learn complex
patterns. Furthermore, the effective rank of the model's weights tends to
decline during training, and this drop is accelerated when the model is
reparameterized into a low-rank structure. In this study, we argue that
strategically interleaving full-rank training epochs within low-rank training
epochs can effectively restore the rank of the model's weights. Based on our
findings, we propose a general dynamic-rank training framework that is readily
applicable to a wide range of neural-network tasks. We first describe how to
adjust the rank of weight matrix to alleviate the inevitable rank collapse that
arises during training, and then present extensive empirical results that
validate our claims and demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed framework. Our
empirical study shows that the proposed method achieves almost the same
computational cost as SVD-based low-rank training while achieving a comparable
accuracy to full-rank training across various benchmarks.

### [217] [Classifier Language Models: Unifying Sparse Finetuning and Adaptive Tokenization for Specialized Classification Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08635)
*Adit Krishnan,Chu Wang,Chris Kong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents a token-driven sparse finetuning method for small language models (SLMs) on specialized semantic text classification tasks, focusing on stability and cost-effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Semantic text classification in industry often requires specialized, domain-specific solutions with high inference throughput. Current solutions with large models are cost- and latency-constrained, necessitating fine-tuning of smaller models.

Method: The method involves token-driven sparse finetuning by identifying and updating only a small, sensitive subset of model parameters based on task-specific token constructs, without introducing additional parameters like in adapter approaches.

Result: The token-driven approach outperforms other methods such as end-to-end finetuning, LoRA, layer selection, and prefix tuning across diverse semantic classification tasks, while being more stable and reducing training costs by half compared to end-to-end finetuning.

Conclusion: Token-driven sparse finetuning is an effective and efficient strategy to adapt small language models for specialized classification tasks, achieving competitive performance with reduced costs and enhanced stability.

Abstract: Semantic text classification requires the understanding of the contextual
significance of specific tokens rather than surface-level patterns or keywords
(as in rule-based or statistical text classification), making large language
models (LLMs) well-suited for this task. However, semantic classification
applications in industry, like customer intent detection or semantic role
labeling, tend to be highly specialized. They require annotation by domain
experts in contrast to general-purpose corpora for pretraining. Further, they
typically require high inference throughputs which limits the model size from
latency and cost perspectives. Thus, for a range of specialized classification
tasks, the preferred solution is to develop customized classifiers by
finetuning smaller language models (e.g., mini-encoders, small language
models).
  In this work, we develop a token-driven sparse finetuning strategy to adapt
small language models to specialized classification tasks. We identify and
finetune a small sensitive subset of model parameters by leveraging
task-specific token constructs in the finetuning dataset, while leaving most of
the pretrained weights unchanged. Unlike adapter approaches such as low rank
adaptation (LoRA), we do not introduce additional parameters to the model. Our
approach identifies highly relevant semantic tokens (case study in the
Appendix) and outperforms end-to-end finetuning, LoRA, layer selection, and
prefix tuning on five diverse semantic classification tasks. We achieve greater
stability and half the training costs vs. end-to-end finetuning.

*Peter Phan,Dhruv Agarwal,Kavitha Srinivas,Horst Samulowitz,Pavan Kapanipathi,Andrew McCallum*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces MiGrATe, a test-time training method for optimizing large language models (LLMs) that does not require external training data and balances exploration and exploitation using mixed-policy group procedures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for black-box optimization using LLMs struggle with balancing exploration and exploitation and often depend on hand-crafted training data, limiting scalability.

Method: MiGrATe employs GRPO as a search algorithm and uses mixed-policy group construction combining on-policy sampling, greedy sampling of top past completions, and neighborhood sampling based on structural similarity.

Result: MiGrATe outperforms inference-only and traditional test-time training baselines across three domains: word search, molecule optimization, and hypothesis+program induction on ARC.

Conclusion: Online test-time training (TTT) without external supervision holds strong potential for improving solutions in complex search tasks across domains.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being applied to black-box
optimization tasks, from program synthesis to molecule design. Prior work
typically leverages in-context learning to iteratively guide the model towards
better solutions. Such methods, however, often struggle to balance exploration
of new solution spaces with exploitation of high-reward ones. Recently,
test-time training (TTT) with synthetic data has shown promise in improving
solution quality. However, the need for hand-crafted training data tailored to
each task limits feasibility and scalability across domains. To address this
problem, we introduce MiGrATe-a method for online TTT that uses GRPO as a
search algorithm to adapt LLMs at inference without requiring external training
data. MiGrATe operates via a mixed-policy group construction procedure that
combines on-policy sampling with two off-policy data selection techniques:
greedy sampling, which selects top-performing past completions, and
neighborhood sampling (NS), which generates completions structurally similar to
high-reward ones. Together, these components bias the policy gradient towards
exploitation of promising regions in solution space, while preserving
exploration through on-policy sampling. We evaluate MiGrATe on three
challenging domains-word search, molecule optimization, and hypothesis+program
induction on the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC)-and find that it
consistently outperforms both inference-only and TTT baselines, demonstrating
the potential of online TTT as a solution for complex search tasks without
external supervision.

*Jiaxin Ju,Yizhen Zheng,Huan Yee Koh,Can Wang,Shirui Pan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces M2LLM, a multi-view framework leveraging large language models (LLMs) for molecular property prediction, achieving state-of-the-art performance across several benchmarks by integrating multiple perspectives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current molecular property prediction methods using fingerprints and graph neural networks often ignore semantic and contextual knowledge accumulated over decades. Based on the advanced reasoning abilities of large language models in sciences, the authors hypothesize that LLMs can generate superior molecular representations by incorporating multiple perspectives.

Method: The authors propose M2LLM, a framework integrating three perspectives—molecular structure view, molecular task view, and molecular rules view—that are dynamically fused to meet task-specific requirements, supported by the advanced reasoning capabilities of LLMs.

Result: Experimental results show that M2LLM achieves state-of-the-art performance on various classification and regression benchmarks, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: The study concludes that integrating multiple perspectives via LLMs generates rich molecular representations, with superior predictive performance arising from advanced encoding and reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Accurate molecular property prediction is a critical challenge with
wide-ranging applications in chemistry, materials science, and drug discovery.
Molecular representation methods, including fingerprints and graph neural
networks (GNNs), achieve state-of-the-art results by effectively deriving
features from molecular structures. However, these methods often overlook
decades of accumulated semantic and contextual knowledge. Recent advancements
in large language models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable reasoning abilities and
prior knowledge across scientific domains, leading us to hypothesize that LLMs
can generate rich molecular representations when guided to reason in multiple
perspectives. To address these gaps, we propose $\text{M}^{2}$LLM, a multi-view
framework that integrates three perspectives: the molecular structure view, the
molecular task view, and the molecular rules view. These views are fused
dynamically to adapt to task requirements, and experiments demonstrate that
$\text{M}^{2}$LLM achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks
across classification and regression tasks. Moreover, we demonstrate that
representation derived from LLM achieves exceptional performance by leveraging
two core functionalities: the generation of molecular embeddings through their
encoding capabilities and the curation of molecular features through advanced
reasoning processes.

*Shibin Su,Guoqiang Liang,De Cheng,Shizhou Zhang,Lingyan Ran,Yanning Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to improve Online Class-Incremental Learning (OCIL) by employing a shared Global Workspace Model (GWM) and collaborative distillation, achieving better stability and adaptability under strict memory constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: OCIL is essential for real-world applications because it learns continuously from non-i.i.d. data streams, but current methods struggle with memory efficiency and balancing stability and adaptability.

Method: The proposed approach uses a Global Workspace Model (GWM) formed by fusing student models’ parameters to consolidate learning and periodically redistribute knowledge. Additionally, a multi-level collaborative distillation mechanism aligns students with the GWM to maintain knowledge stability and peer consistency.

Result: The method shows significant performance improvement in OCIL benchmarks for multiple models, especially under varying memory constraints.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates that the proposed GWM and collaborative distillation mechanisms successfully address OCIL's challenges, striking a better balance between stability and adaptability.

Abstract: Online Class-Incremental Learning (OCIL) enables models to learn continuously
from non-i.i.d. data streams and samples of the data streams can be seen only
once, making it more suitable for real-world scenarios compared to offline
learning. However, OCIL faces two key challenges: maintaining model stability
under strict memory constraints and ensuring adaptability to new tasks. Under
stricter memory constraints, current replay-based methods are less effective.
While ensemble methods improve adaptability (plasticity), they often struggle
with stability. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel approach that
enhances ensemble learning through a Global Workspace Model (GWM)-a shared,
implicit memory that guides the learning of multiple student models. The GWM is
formed by fusing the parameters of all students within each training batch,
capturing the historical learning trajectory and serving as a dynamic anchor
for knowledge consolidation. This fused model is then redistributed
periodically to the students to stabilize learning and promote cross-task
consistency. In addition, we introduce a multi-level collaborative distillation
mechanism. This approach enforces peer-to-peer consistency among students and
preserves historical knowledge by aligning each student with the GWM. As a
result, student models remain adaptable to new tasks while maintaining
previously learned knowledge, striking a better balance between stability and
plasticity. Extensive experiments on three standard OCIL benchmarks show that
our method delivers significant performance improvement for several OCIL models
across various memory budgets.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Generative bidding in advertising systems is improved with a novel approach combining expert trajectory guidance and a skip-step strategy, achieving significantly better results in conversion and revenue.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve auto-bidding effectiveness, addressing weaknesses in traditional Markov Decision Process approaches and diffusion-model limitations like timeliness risks and lack of personalized decision sequences.

Method: A conditional diffusion modeling technique guided by expert trajectories and incorporating a skip-step sampling strategy to improve both decision-making and efficiency.

Result: Offline experiments show significant improvements, while online A/B testing highlights 11.29% higher conversion and 12.35% higher revenue compared to the baseline approach.

Conclusion: The proposed method enhances generative auto-bidding by overcoming key limitations in traditional and diffusion-based methods, demonstrating strong applicability and success in advertising systems.

Abstract: Auto-bidding is extensively applied in advertising systems, serving a
multitude of advertisers. Generative bidding is gradually gaining traction due
to its robust planning capabilities and generalizability. In contrast to
traditional reinforcement learning-based bidding, generative bidding does not
rely on the Markov Decision Process (MDP) exhibiting superior planning
capabilities in long-horizon scenarios. Conditional diffusion modeling
approaches have demonstrated significant potential in the realm of
auto-bidding. However, relying solely on return as the optimality condition is
weak to guarantee the generation of genuinely optimal decision sequences,
lacking personalized structural information. Moreover, diffusion models' t-step
autoregressive generation mechanism inherently carries timeliness risks. To
address these issues, we propose a novel conditional diffusion modeling method
based on expert trajectory guidance combined with a skip-step sampling strategy
to enhance generation efficiency. We have validated the effectiveness of this
approach through extensive offline experiments and achieved statistically
significant results in online A/B testing, achieving an increase of 11.29% in
conversion and a 12.35% in revenue compared with the baseline.

### [222] [Generative Modeling for Robust Deep Reinforcement Learning on the Traveling Salesman Problem](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08718)
*Michael Li,Eric Bae,Christopher Haberland,Natasha Jaques*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses the distribution robustness of neural network solvers for the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) by proposing a generative-sampling-based approach called COGS and introducing a new dataset, TSPLib50.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to improve neural network solvers for TSP, which struggle with generalizing to realistic, distributionally diverse datasets, especially for large-scale or dynamic problems.

Method: The paper introduces COGS, which samples training data from a generative TSP model to achieve better coverage and interpolation across various distribution spaces. It also presents TSPLib50, a dataset designed to test real-world generalization.

Result: The proposed COGS approach outperforms existing neural network baselines, particularly improving worst-case distribution robustness, as demonstrated across synthetic datasets and TSPLib50.

Conclusion: COGS enhances the ability of neural network solvers to generalize across diverse TSP distributions, addressing the challenge of poor generalization, especially in the worst-case scenarios.

Abstract: The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is a classic NP-hard combinatorial
optimization task with numerous practical applications. Classic heuristic
solvers can attain near-optimal performance for small problem instances, but
become computationally intractable for larger problems. Real-world logistics
problems such as dynamically re-routing last-mile deliveries demand a solver
with fast inference time, which has led researchers to investigate specialized
neural network solvers. However, neural networks struggle to generalize beyond
the synthetic data they were trained on. In particular, we show that there
exist TSP distributions that are realistic in practice, which also consistently
lead to poor worst-case performance for existing neural approaches. To address
this issue of distribution robustness, we present Combinatorial Optimization
with Generative Sampling (COGS), where training data is sampled from a
generative TSP model. We show that COGS provides better data coverage and
interpolation in the space of TSP training distributions. We also present
TSPLib50, a dataset of realistically distributed TSP samples, which tests
real-world generalization ability without conflating this issue with instance
size. We evaluate our method on various synthetic datasets as well as TSPLib50,
and compare to state-of-the-art neural baselines. We demonstrate that COGS
improves distribution robustness, with most performance gains coming from
worst-case scenarios.

*Ruofeng Yang,Zhaoyu Zhu,Bo Jiang,Cheng Chen,Shuai Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper establishes the first polynomial discretization complexity results for rectified flow (RF)-based generative models in both multi-step and one-step settings, improving theoretical understanding and previous complexity results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RF-based models have achieved superior empirical performance in generative tasks, but theoretical analysis of their discretization complexity has been insufficient, particularly in deterministic settings.

Method: The authors analyze RF-based models with deterministic samplers under bounded support assumptions, compare them with diffusion models using the predictor-corrector framework, and provide complexity results for both multi-step and one-step generation.

Result: The study demonstrates better polynomial discretization complexity for RF-based models compared to diffusion models and establishes new complexity results for one-step RF-based models exceeding diffusion-based models' performance.

Conclusion: This work bridges the gap between empirical success and theoretical understanding of RF-based models, offering insights into their advantages over popular generative models like VP and VE-based frameworks.

Abstract: Recently, rectified flow (RF)-based models have achieved state-of-the-art
performance in many areas for both the multi-step and one-step generation.
However, only a few theoretical works analyze the discretization complexity of
RF-based models. Existing works either focus on flow-based models with
stochastic samplers or establish complexity results that exhibit exponential
dependence on problem parameters. In this work, under the realistic bounded
support assumption, we prove the first polynomial discretization complexity for
multi-step and one-step RF-based models with a deterministic sampler
simultaneously. For the multi-step setting, inspired by the predictor-corrector
framework of diffusion models, we introduce a Langevin process as a corrector
and show that RF-based models can achieve better polynomial discretization
complexity than diffusion models. To achieve this result, we conduct a detailed
analysis of the RF-based model and explain why it is better than previous
popular models, such as variance preserving (VP) and variance exploding
(VE)-based models. Based on the observation of multi-step RF-based models, we
further provide the first polynomial discretization complexity result for
one-step RF-based models, improving upon prior results for one-step
diffusion-based models. These findings mark the first step toward theoretically
understanding the impressive empirical performance of RF-based models in both
multi-step and one-step generation.

*Shuyi Zhang,Wei Shi,Sihang Li,Jiayi Liao,Tao Liang,Hengxing Cai,Xiang Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents SARM, an innovative reward model that integrates a Sparse Autoencoder, enhancing the interpretability and adaptability of rewards assigned by large language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional reward models used in aligning large language models to human preferences via RLHF lack interpretability, adaptability, and often fail to explain the reasoning behind rewards. Addressing these issues is crucial for aligning AI behavior effectively with human values.

Method: The Sparse Autoencoder-enhanced Reward Model (SARM) is proposed, integrating a pretrained Sparse Autoencoder into the reward model. This architecture maps hidden activations of the model into an interpretable feature space, aggregating them into meaningful reward scores that are sparse and monosemantic.

Result: SARM provides interpretable, feature-level reward attributions, adapts to changes in user preferences, and achieves better alignment performance compared to traditional reward models.

Conclusion: SARM addresses the limitations of traditional reward models by offering a more interpretable, adaptable, and effective approach for aligning large language models to human preferences.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been widely deployed across numerous
fields. Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) leverages reward
models (RMs) as proxies for human preferences to align LLM behaviors with human
values, making the accuracy, reliability, and interpretability of RMs critical
for effective alignment. However, traditional RMs lack interpretability, offer
limited insight into the reasoning behind reward assignments, and are
inflexible toward user preference shifts. While recent multidimensional RMs aim
for improved interpretability, they often fail to provide feature-level
attribution and require costly annotations. To overcome these limitations, we
introduce the Sparse Autoencoder-enhanced Reward Model (\textbf{SARM}), a novel
architecture that integrates a pretrained Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) into a
reward model. SARM maps the hidden activations of LLM-based RM into an
interpretable, sparse, and monosemantic feature space, from which a scalar head
aggregates feature activations to produce transparent and conceptually
meaningful reward scores. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that SARM
facilitates direct feature-level attribution of reward assignments, allows
dynamic adjustment to preference shifts, and achieves superior alignment
performance compared to conventional reward models. Our code is available at

*Long Wang,Kai Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes the "Differentiated Factor Consistency Semi-supervised Framework" (DiFac), which enhances semi-supervised learning (SSL) for graph neural networks (GNNs) by deriving independent decision factors from a single source and ensuring their consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges in SSL for GNNs, where pseudo-label confirmation bias and training collapse occur due to the lack of mutually independent decision factors from multiple information sources.

Method: The DiFac framework extracts independent decision factors from a single information source, enforces consistency, filters conflicting samples, and selects pseudo-labels based on a shortest stave principle. Additionally, it integrates latent textual knowledge using multimodal language models and employs an accountability scoring mechanism for error mitigation.

Result: Experiments on multiple benchmark datasets reveal that DiFac achieves better robustness and generalization in low-label settings, outperforming baseline methods consistently.

Conclusion: DiFac offers a robust solution to enhance SSL for GNNs, even in scenarios with limited labeled data, by improving factor differentiation, consistency, and robustness using additional multimodal knowledge.

Abstract: In semi-supervised learning (SSL) for enhancing the performance of graph
neural networks (GNNs) with unlabeled data, introducing mutually independent
decision factors for cross-validation is regarded as an effective strategy to
alleviate pseudo-label confirmation bias and training collapse. However,
obtaining such factors is challenging in practice: additional and valid
information sources are inherently scarce, and even when such sources are
available, their independence from the original source cannot be guaranteed. To
address this challenge, In this paper we propose a Differentiated Factor
Consistency Semi-supervised Framework (DiFac), which derives differentiated
factors from a single information source and enforces their consistency. During
pre-training, the model learns to extract these factors; in training, it
iteratively removes samples with conflicting factors and ranks pseudo-labels
based on the shortest stave principle, selecting the top candidate samples to
reduce overconfidence commonly observed in confidence-based or ensemble-based
methods. Our framework can also incorporate additional information sources. In
this work, we leverage the large multimodal language model to introduce latent
textual knowledge as auxiliary decision factors, and we design a accountability
scoring mechanism to mitigate additional erroneous judgments introduced by
these auxiliary factors. Experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate
that DiFac consistently improves robustness and generalization in low-label
regimes, outperforming other baseline methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces open-source templates for documenting data, models, and applications across the AI lifecycle to meet EU AI Act requirements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Compliance with the EU AI Act demands comprehensive documentation for AI systems, which current methods fall short of.

Method: Creating and validating templates for technical documentation, tested across real-world applications, and refined using user feedback.

Result: Templates facilitate traceability, reproducibility, and regulatory compliance while supporting risk reduction and collaboration.

Conclusion: TechOps templates are practical tools for responsible AI development and oversight under the EU AI Act.

Abstract: Operationalizing the EU AI Act requires clear technical documentation to
ensure AI systems are transparent, traceable, and accountable. Existing
documentation templates for AI systems do not fully cover the entire AI
lifecycle while meeting the technical documentation requirements of the AI Act.
  This paper addresses those shortcomings by introducing open-source templates
and examples for documenting data, models, and applications to provide
sufficient documentation for certifying compliance with the AI Act. These
templates track the system status over the entire AI lifecycle, ensuring
traceability, reproducibility, and compliance with the AI Act. They also
promote discoverability and collaboration, reduce risks, and align with best
practices in AI documentation and governance.
  The templates are evaluated and refined based on user feedback to enable
insights into their usability and implementability. We then validate the
approach on real-world scenarios, providing examples that further guide their
implementation: the data template is followed to document a skin tones dataset
created to support fairness evaluations of downstream computer vision models
and human-centric applications; the model template is followed to document a
neural network for segmenting human silhouettes in photos. The application
template is tested on a system deployed for construction site safety using
real-time video analytics and sensor data. Our results show that TechOps can
serve as a practical tool to enable oversight for regulatory compliance and
responsible AI development.

TL;DR: This paper introduces an unsupervised learning method called Temporal Optimization (TempOpt) to improve fault alarm analysis in telecommunications networks, addressing the challenge of massive and interconnected alarm systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation was to overcome the challenges faced by Network Operations Centre (NOC) engineers in identifying root alarms among a massive volume of fault alarms and understanding their interrelations for effective network problem resolution.

Method: The proposed method, Temporal Optimization (TempOpt), is an unsupervised alarm relational learning technique aiming to improve upon traditional temporal dependency methods.

Result: Experiments conducted on real-world network datasets showed that TempOpt produces higher-quality alarm relations compared to existing temporal dependency approaches.

Conclusion: TempOpt offers a practical and efficient solution to relational learning of alarms in telecommunication networks, enhancing the accuracy and speed of root alarm identification.

Abstract: In a telecommunications network, fault alarms generated by network nodes are
monitored in a Network Operations Centre (NOC) to ensure network availability
and continuous network operations. The monitoring process comprises of tasks
such as active alarms analysis, root alarm identification, and resolution of
the underlying problem. Each network node potentially can generate alarms of
different types, while nodes can be from multiple vendors, a network can have
hundreds of nodes thus resulting in an enormous volume of alarms at any time.
Since network nodes are inter-connected, a single fault in the network would
trigger multiple sequences of alarms across a variety of nodes and from a
monitoring point of view, it is a challenging task for a NOC engineer to be
aware of relations between the various alarms, when trying to identify, for
example, a root alarm on which an action needs to be taken. To effectively
identify root alarms, it is essential to learn relation among the alarms for
accurate and faster resolution. In this work we propose a novel unsupervised
alarm relation learning technique Temporal Optimization (TempOpt) that is
practical and overcomes the limitations of an existing class of alarm
relational learning method-temporal dependency methods. Experiments have been
carried on real-world network datasets, that demonstrate the improved quality
of alarm relations learned by TempOpt as compared to temporal dependency
method.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces WaveTS-B and WaveTS-M, utilizing wavelet transforms with MLP and a Mixture of Experts framework for SOTA time series forecasting with reduced parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods like Transformers and MLPs face challenges: Transformers are computationally heavy and struggle with non-stationary data, while MLPs cannot effectively manage multi-channel dependencies.

Method: WaveTS-B incorporates wavelet transforms and MLP to improve periodic and non-stationary data handling. WaveTS-M further employs a Mixture of Experts framework with a channel clustering strategy for multi-channel dependency handling.

Result: WaveTS series models demonstrate SOTA performance on eight real-world datasets with fewer parameters and notable multi-channel improvements.

Conclusion: WaveTS models address key limitations in conventional forecasting approaches, effectively balancing computational efficiency and predictive accuracy, particularly for multi-channel time-series data.

Abstract: The field of time series forecasting is rapidly advancing, with recent
large-scale Transformers and lightweight Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) models
showing strong predictive performance. However, conventional Transformer models
are often hindered by their large number of parameters and their limited
ability to capture non-stationary features in data through smoothing.
Similarly, MLP models struggle to manage multi-channel dependencies
effectively. To address these limitations, we propose a novel, lightweight time
series prediction model, WaveTS-B. This model combines wavelet transforms with
MLP to capture both periodic and non-stationary characteristics of data in the
wavelet domain. Building on this foundation, we propose a channel clustering
strategy that incorporates a Mixture of Experts (MoE) framework, utilizing a
gating mechanism and expert network to handle multi-channel dependencies
efficiently. We propose WaveTS-M, an advanced model tailored for multi-channel
time series prediction. Empirical evaluation across eight real-world time
series datasets demonstrates that our WaveTS series models achieve
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with significantly fewer parameters.
Notably, WaveTS-M shows substantial improvements on multi-channel datasets,
highlighting its effectiveness.

*Eric Seng,Hugh O'Connor,Adam Boyce,Josh J. Bailey,Anton van Beek*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a framework tailored for generative machine learning models to address dataset and interpretability challenges in design representation and exploration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Design exploration is limited by the need for large datasets and unclear interpretability of optimal design features.

Method: The paper proposes a systematic framework to create tailored datasets and employs Bayesian optimization to interpret latent spaces of design.

Result: The framework was successfully applied to design a flow battery manifold, capturing feasible design spaces and facilitating efficient exploration.

Conclusion: The proposed framework improves generative machine-learning models by enhancing their applicability, quality, and reliability in system designs.

Abstract: Generative machine learning has emerged as a powerful tool for design
representation and exploration. However, its application is often constrained
by the need for large datasets of existing designs and the lack of
interpretability about what features drive optimality. To address these
challenges, we introduce a systematic framework for constructing training
datasets tailored to generative models and demonstrate how these models can be
leveraged for interpretable design. The novelty of this work is twofold: (i) we
present a systematic framework for generating archetypes with internally
homogeneous but mutually heterogeneous inputs that can be used to generate a
training dataset, and (ii) we show how integrating generative models with
Bayesian optimization can enhance the interpretability of the latent space of
admissible designs. These findings are validated by using the framework to
design a flow battery manifold, demonstrating that it effectively captures the
space of feasible designs, including novel configurations while enabling
efficient exploration. This work broadens the applicability of generative
machine-learning models in system designs by enhancing quality and reliability.

### [230] [Oblivionis: A Lightweight Learning and Unlearning Framework for Federated Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08875)
*Fuyao Zhang,Xinyu Yan,Tiantong Wu,Wenjie Li,Tianxiang Chen,Yang Cao,Ran Yan,Longtao Huang,Wei Yang Bryan Lim,Qiang Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Oblivionis, a framework for addressing the challenge of selective unlearning of client contributions in Federated Learning applied to Large Language Models (LLMs), ensuring data privacy compliance and enhanced trustworthiness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the need for enforceable unlearning mechanisms in Federated Learning (FL) frameworks for LLMs, especially for regulatory compliance, like the GDPR, and to address challenges of data quality and governance.

Method: The authors propose Oblivionis, a dual optimization framework integrating FL and unlearning mechanisms, incorporating 6 FL and 5 unlearning algorithms for evaluation. This approach allows selective removal of private client data used in federated LLM training.

Result: Experiments confirm that Oblivionis outperforms local training methods by achieving a balance between unlearning effectiveness and model performance. Cross-algorithm analysis highlights its utility for federated LLM training.

Conclusion: Oblivionis enhances trustworthiness in federated LLM development, addressing privacy and compliance challenges while providing a platform for structured evaluation and future advancements.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly leverage Federated Learning (FL) to
utilize private, task-specific datasets for fine-tuning while preserving data
privacy. However, while federated LLM frameworks effectively enable
collaborative training without raw data sharing, they critically lack built-in
mechanisms for regulatory compliance like GDPR's right to be forgotten.
Integrating private data heightens concerns over data quality and long-term
governance, yet existing distributed training frameworks offer no principled
way to selectively remove specific client contributions post-training. Due to
distributed data silos, stringent privacy constraints, and the intricacies of
interdependent model aggregation, federated LLM unlearning is significantly
more complex than centralized LLM unlearning. To address this gap, we introduce
Oblivionis, a lightweight learning and unlearning framework that enables
clients to selectively remove specific private data during federated LLM
training, enhancing trustworthiness and regulatory compliance. By unifying FL
and unlearning as a dual optimization objective, we incorporate 6 FL and 5
unlearning algorithms for comprehensive evaluation and comparative analysis,
establishing a robust pipeline for federated LLM unlearning. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that Oblivionis outperforms local training, achieving a
robust balance between forgetting efficacy and model utility, with
cross-algorithm comparisons providing clear directions for future LLM
development.

*Hao Liu,Chun Yang,Zhang xiaoxing,Rui Ma,Xiaobin Zhu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel method called Amplitude-Phase Reconstruct Network (APRNet) for time series forecasting, effectively modeling amplitude-phase relationships to explore stationary information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enhance time series forecasting by focusing on stationary information in complex frequency components, which is often overlooked by existing methods.

Method: The proposed APRNet models amplitude-phase inter-relationships, decouples their characteristics, and highlights their correlation across sequence and channel dimensions. It includes a KLC module for adaptive function fitting to better capture stationary features.

Result: APRNet demonstrates superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods in extensive experiments.

Conclusion: APRNet's design effectively improves the capability to model time-varying and stationary patterns in time series data, making it a significant advancement.

Abstract: Deep learning-based time series forecasting has found widespread
applications. Recently, converting time series data into the frequency domain
for forecasting has become popular for accurately exploring periodic patterns.
However, existing methods often cannot effectively explore stationary
information from complex intertwined frequency components. In this paper, we
propose a simple yet effective Amplitude-Phase Reconstruct Network (APRNet)
that models the inter-relationships of amplitude and phase, which prevents the
amplitude and phase from being constrained by different physical quantities,
thereby decoupling the distinct characteristics of signals for capturing
stationary information. Specifically, we represent the multivariate time series
input across sequence and channel dimensions, highlighting the correlation
between amplitude and phase at multiple interaction frequencies. We propose a
novel Kolmogorov-Arnold-Network-based Local Correlation (KLC) module to
adaptively fit local functions using univariate functions, enabling more
flexible characterization of stationary features across different amplitudes
and phases. This significantly enhances the model's capability to capture
time-varying patterns. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our
APRNet against the state-of-the-arts (SOTAs).

*Jungwoo Kim,Jong-Seok Lee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores the vulnerability of class-incremental continual learning models to stage-transferred adversarial attacks, finding them highly susceptible and revealing insufficient effectiveness of current adversarial training defenses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate the security vulnerability of class-incremental continual learning models against adversarial attacks, particularly focusing on stage-transferred attacks.

Method: Analyzed stage-transferred attacks where adversarial examples are generated in one model stage and used to attack it in a later stage. Examined model similarity and robustness degradation among learning stages.

Result: Found that continual learning models are highly susceptible to stage-transferred attacks due to stage-related vulnerabilities. Current adversarial training-based defense approaches were insufficient against these attacks.

Conclusion: Continual learning methods face significant security risks from stage-transferred attacks, requiring better defense strategies to ensure robustness.

Abstract: Class-incremental continual learning addresses catastrophic forgetting by
enabling classification models to preserve knowledge of previously learned
classes while acquiring new ones. However, the vulnerability of the models
against adversarial attacks during this process has not been investigated
sufficiently. In this paper, we present the first exploration of vulnerability
to stage-transferred attacks, i.e., an adversarial example generated using the
model in an earlier stage is used to attack the model in a later stage. Our
findings reveal that continual learning methods are highly susceptible to these
attacks, raising a serious security issue. We explain this phenomenon through
model similarity between stages and gradual robustness degradation.
Additionally, we find that existing adversarial training-based defense methods
are not sufficiently effective to stage-transferred attacks. Codes are

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) often exhibit limited predictive accuracy in complex scientific and engineering problems.

Method: The authors incorporated liquid residual gating solely within the hidden-layer mapping of PINNs while retaining the original sampling strategy, loss composition, and hyperparameters.

Result: LNN-PINN consistently reduced RMSE and MAE across four benchmark problems, improving accuracy and stability under various problem dimensions and boundary conditions.

Conclusion: LNN-PINN proves to be a concise and effective framework for boosting predictive accuracy in challenging scenarios while preserving the physics-informed foundation.

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have attracted considerable
attention for their ability to integrate partial differential equation priors
into deep learning frameworks; however, they often exhibit limited predictive
accuracy when applied to complex problems. To address this issue, we propose
LNN-PINN, a physics-informed neural network framework that incorporates a
liquid residual gating architecture while preserving the original physics
modeling and optimization pipeline to improve predictive accuracy. The method
introduces a lightweight gating mechanism solely within the hidden-layer
mapping, keeping the sampling strategy, loss composition, and hyperparameter
settings unchanged to ensure that improvements arise purely from architectural
refinement. Across four benchmark problems, LNN-PINN consistently reduced RMSE
and MAE under identical training conditions, with absolute error plots further
confirming its accuracy gains. Moreover, the framework demonstrates strong
adaptability and stability across varying dimensions, boundary conditions, and
operator characteristics. In summary, LNN-PINN offers a concise and effective
architectural enhancement for improving the predictive accuracy of
physics-informed neural networks in complex scientific and engineering

TL;DR: GenCast is a model proposed for traffic forecasting in regions without traffic sensors by leveraging external knowledge and physical principles, achieving reduced forecasting errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of forecasting traffic in regions without sensors due to high deployment and maintenance costs, and the lack of historical observations that affect existing models' generalisability.

Method: Proposes the GenCast model, which incorporates physics-informed neural networks, an external signal learning module to analyze external factors like weather, and a spatial grouping module to remove localised features that may hinder the model.

Result: GenCast shows consistent improvements by reducing forecasting errors in various real-world datasets.

Conclusion: GenCast enhances traffic forecasting capabilities in non-sensor regions by effectively utilizing external knowledge and improving the generalisability of predictions.

Abstract: Traffic forecasting is essential for intelligent transportation systems.
Accurate forecasting relies on continuous observations collected by traffic
sensors. However, due to high deployment and maintenance costs, not all regions
are equipped with such sensors. This paper aims to forecast for regions without
traffic sensors, where the lack of historical traffic observations challenges
the generalisability of existing models. We propose a model named GenCast, the
core idea of which is to exploit external knowledge to compensate for the
missing observations and to enhance generalisation. We integrate
physics-informed neural networks into GenCast, enabling physical principles to
regularise the learning process. We introduce an external signal learning
module to explore correlations between traffic states and external signals such
as weather conditions, further improving model generalisability. Additionally,
we design a spatial grouping module to filter localised features that hinder
model generalisability. Extensive experiments show that GenCast consistently
reduces forecasting errors on multiple real-world datasets.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GRAVITY leverages physical-inspired interaction topology to dynamically classify graph vertices, achieving competitive results in classification tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve vertex classification accuracy by introducing adaptive and dynamic neighborhood modeling inspired by physical systems.

Method: The framework models vertex interactions via latent potential fields shaped by proximity and similarity, dynamically modulating aggregation through a learned force function.

Result: GRAVITY provides competitive embeddings and outperforms in real-world transductive and inductive vertex classification benchmarks.

Conclusion: GRAVITY enhances semantic coherence and sharpens class boundaries, offering a novel dynamic approach to graph-based learning.

Abstract: In the quest of accurate vertex classification, we introduce GRAVITY
(Graph-based Representation leArning via Vertices Interaction TopologY), a
framework inspired by physical systems where objects self-organize under
attractive forces. GRAVITY models each vertex as exerting influence through
learned interactions shaped by structural proximity and attribute similarity.
These interactions induce a latent potential field in which vertices move
toward energy efficient positions, coalescing around class-consistent
attractors and distancing themselves from unrelated groups. Unlike traditional
message-passing schemes with static neighborhoods, GRAVITY adaptively modulates
the receptive field of each vertex based on a learned force function, enabling
dynamic aggregation driven by context. This field-driven organization sharpens
class boundaries and promotes semantic coherence within latent clusters.
Experiments on real-world benchmarks show that GRAVITY yields competitive
embeddings, excelling in both transductive and inductive vertex classification
tasks.

*Naifu Feng,Lixing Chen,Junhua Tang,Hua Ding,Jianhua Li,Yang Bai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper explores the vulnerability of transformer-based time series forecasting models to adversarial attacks and proposes an innovative attack algorithm utilizing frequency-domain information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the lack of research on the susceptibility of time series forecasting models, particularly transformer-based models, to adversarial attacks, and focuses on the overlooked frequency-domain features in such attacks.

Method: An attack algorithm is developed by adapting a classification-task-oriented method to time series prediction and leveraging both time-domain and frequency-domain losses to optimize adversarial samples.

Result: Experimental results highlight the vulnerability of current time series forecasting models to adversarial attacks, with the proposed frequency-based approach yielding high performance on benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: The study reveals new insights into the adversarial weaknesses of time series forecasting models and demonstrates the effectiveness of utilizing frequency-domain features in such attacks.

Abstract: Transformer-based models have made significant progress in time series
forecasting. However, a key limitation of deep learning models is their
susceptibility to adversarial attacks, which has not been studied enough in the
context of time series prediction. In contrast to areas such as computer
vision, where adversarial robustness has been extensively studied, frequency
domain features of time series data play an important role in the prediction
task but have not been sufficiently explored in terms of adversarial attacks.
This paper proposes a time series prediction attack algorithm based on
frequency domain loss. Specifically, we adapt an attack method originally
designed for classification tasks to the prediction field and optimize the
adversarial samples using both time-domain and frequency-domain losses. To the
best of our knowledge, there is no relevant research on using frequency
information for time-series adversarial attacks. Our experimental results show
that these current time series prediction models are vulnerable to adversarial
attacks, and our approach achieves excellent performance on major time series
forecasting datasets.

*Sameep Chattopadhyay,Vinay Sutar,Jaya Prakash Champati,Sharayu Moharir*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study introduces Hierarchical Inference Learning (HIL) strategies for edge intelligence systems, proposing two improved policies, HI-LCB and HI-LCB-lite, that optimize performance by reducing latency and enhancing inference accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of estimating incorrect local inference likelihood in edge intelligence systems, especially under dynamic data distributions and varying offloading costs.

Method: The paper models the probability of correct local inference as an increasing function of the model's confidence. It introduces HI-LCB and HI-LCB-lite policies based on the UCB framework, ensuring computational efficiency and optimal regret.

Result: The proposed policies achieve $O(\log T)$ regret, outperforming existing methods with $O(T^{2/3})$ regret. HI-LCB-lite also offers low computational complexity, making it suitable for resource-constrained devices.

Conclusion: HI-LCB and HI-LCB-lite provide effective solutions to the HIL problem, ensuring both theoretical guarantees and practical advantages in edge intelligence systems, validated through real-world simulations.

Abstract: This work focuses on Hierarchical Inference (HI) in edge intelligence
systems, where a compact Local-ML model on an end-device works in conjunction
with a high-accuracy Remote-ML model on an edge-server. HI aims to reduce
latency, improve accuracy, and lower bandwidth usage by first using the
Local-ML model for inference and offloading to the Remote-ML only when the
local inference is likely incorrect. A critical challenge in HI is estimating
the likelihood of the local inference being incorrect, especially when data
distributions and offloading costs change over time -- a problem we term
Hierarchical Inference Learning (HIL). We introduce a novel approach to HIL by
modeling the probability of correct inference by the Local-ML as an increasing
function of the model's confidence measure, a structure motivated by empirical
observations but previously unexploited. We propose two policies, HI-LCB and
HI-LCB-lite, based on the Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) framework. We
demonstrate that both policies achieve order-optimal regret of $O(\log T)$, a
significant improvement over existing HIL policies with $O(T^{2/3})$ regret
guarantees. Notably, HI-LCB-lite has an $O(1)$ per-sample computational
complexity, making it well-suited for deployment on devices with severe
resource limitations. Simulations using real-world datasets confirm that our
policies outperform existing state-of-the-art HIL methods.

Conclusion: MechaFormer provides an efficient hybrid solution to mechanism design, offering state-of-the-art accuracy and flexibility for engineers and designers.

Abstract: Designing mechanical mechanisms to trace specific paths is a classic yet
notoriously difficult engineering problem, characterized by a vast and complex
search space of discrete topologies and continuous parameters. We introduce
MechaFormer, a Transformer-based model that tackles this challenge by treating
mechanism design as a conditional sequence generation task. Our model learns to
translate a target curve into a domain-specific language (DSL) string,
simultaneously determining the mechanism's topology and geometric parameters in
a single, unified process. MechaFormer significantly outperforms existing
baselines, achieving state-of-the-art path-matching accuracy and generating a
wide diversity of novel and valid designs. We demonstrate a suite of sampling
strategies that can dramatically improve solution quality and offer designers
valuable flexibility. Furthermore, we show that the high-quality outputs from
MechaFormer serve as excellent starting points for traditional optimizers,
creating a hybrid approach that finds superior solutions with remarkable
efficiency.

*Bisman Singh,Lucy Van Kleunen,Aaron Clauset*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper systematically compares link prediction approaches, revealing that algorithm performance varies based on network characteristics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the challenge of choosing the optimal link prediction algorithm for networks with missing links, given the diversity in network structures.

Method: Using a benchmark of 550 real-world networks and standard accuracy measures, the paper evaluates model stacking algorithms, topological link predictors (including two new ones), and graph neural networks. A meta-learning algorithm is introduced to optimize algorithm selection.

Result: Model stacking with random forest performs well on AUC or competitively on Top-k accuracy compared to graph neural networks. However, algorithm effectiveness is strongly influenced by network features. The meta-learning approach showed superior performance by adapting predictions to specific network structures.

Conclusion: No single algorithm excels across all networks, but tailoring predictions to network characteristics improves results, with the proposed meta-learning algorithm outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Relational data are ubiquitous in real-world data applications, e.g., in
social network analysis or biological modeling, but networks are nearly always
incompletely observed. The state-of-the-art for predicting missing links in the
hard case of a network without node attributes uses model stacking or neural
network techniques. It remains unknown which approach is best, and whether or
how the best choice of algorithm depends on the input network's
characteristics. We answer these questions systematically using a large,
structurally diverse benchmark of 550 real-world networks under two standard
accuracy measures (AUC and Top-k), comparing four stacking algorithms with 42
topological link predictors, two of which we introduce here, and two graph
neural network algorithms. We show that no algorithm is best across all input
networks, all algorithms perform well on most social networks, and few perform
well on economic and biological networks. Overall, model stacking with a random
forest is both highly scalable and surpasses on AUC or is competitive with
graph neural networks on Top-k accuracy. But, algorithm performance depends
strongly on network characteristics like the degree distribution, triangle
density, and degree assortativity. We introduce a meta-learning algorithm that
exploits this variability to optimize link predictions for individual networks
by selecting the best algorithm to apply, which we show outperforms all
state-of-the-art algorithms and scales to large networks.

TL;DR: Chi-Geometry is a library designed to generate synthetic graph datasets focusing on chirality prediction for benchmarking graph neural networks (GNNs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) often struggle with chirality prediction due to confounding correlations and architectural limitations. This paper aims to address this issue by introducing more interpretable benchmarking datasets.

Method: Chi-Geometry generates synthetic graphs with controlled geometric and topological traits, labeled chiral centers, and randomized node attributes. The library creates datasets specifically tailored for node classification tasks focusing on chirality.

Result: The library was used to benchmark multiple state-of-the-art GNNs and led to the development of two novel architectures: one with all-to-all connections for accuracy and another introducing a virtual node for computational efficiency.

Conclusion: Chi-Geometry improves the benchmarking of GNN architectures for chirality prediction, enabling the development of models with better predictive accuracy and efficiency.

Abstract: We introduce Chi-Geometry - a library that generates graph data for testing
and benchmarking GNNs' ability to predict chirality. Chi-Geometry generates
synthetic graph samples with (i) user-specified geometric and topological
traits to isolate certain types of samples and (ii) randomized node positions
and species to minimize extraneous correlations. Each generated graph contains
exactly one chiral center labeled either R or S, while all other nodes are
labeled N/A (non-chiral). The generated samples are then combined into a
cohesive dataset that can be used to assess a GNN's ability to predict
chirality as a node classification task. Chi-Geometry allows more interpretable
and less confounding benchmarking of GNNs for prediction of chirality in the
graph samples which can guide the design of new GNN architectures with improved
predictive performance. We illustrate Chi-Geometry's efficacy by using it to
generate synthetic datasets for benchmarking various state-of-the-art (SOTA)
GNN architectures. The conclusions of these benchmarking results guided our
design of two new GNN architectures. The first GNN architecture established
all-to-all connections in the graph to accurately predict chirality across all
challenging configurations where previously tested SOTA models failed, but at a
computational cost (both for training and inference) that grows quadratically
with the number of graph nodes. The second GNN architecture avoids all-to-all
connections by introducing a virtual node in the original graph structure of
the data, which restores the linear scaling of training and inference
computational cost with respect to the number of nodes in the graph, while
still ensuring competitive accuracy in detecting chirality with respect to SOTA
GNN architectures.

*Tianyun Yang,Yunwen Li,Ziniu Li,Zhihang Lin,Ruoyu Sun,Tian Ding*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces GF-Reasoner, a model combining Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning with formal language for solving Geometry Problems. It achieves significant accuracy improvements using novel dataset training and reinforcement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional vision-language models struggle with Geometry Problem Solving due to unreliable diagram interpretation and lack of formal reasoning. Existing symbolic methods lack intermediate reasoning and transparency.

Method: The approach integrates Chain-of-Thought (CoT) with symbolic reasoning by interleaving natural language explanation with solver-executable code. Training is done through supervised fine-tuning on a synthetic dataset and reinforcement learning with outcome-based rewards.

Result: The proposed GF-Reasoner model achieves up to 15% accuracy improvement on geometry problem-solving benchmarks, outperforming both 7B-scale peers and larger models.

Conclusion: Combining CoT reasoning with symbolic computation improves both accuracy and reasoning trace clarity. The method offers a scalable solution to integrate symbolic and natural language reasoning for geometry tasks.

Abstract: Large vision language models exhibit notable limitations on Geometry Problem
Solving (GPS) because of their unreliable diagram interpretation and pure
natural-language reasoning. A recent line of work mitigates this by using
symbolic solvers: the model directly generates a formal program that a geometry
solver can execute. However, this direct program generation lacks intermediate
reasoning, making the decision process opaque and prone to errors. In this
work, we explore a new approach that integrates Chain-of-Thought (CoT) with
formal language. The model interleaves natural language reasoning with
incremental emission of solver-executable code, producing a hybrid reasoning
trace in which critical derivations are expressed in formal language. To teach
this behavior at scale, we combine (1) supervised fine-tuning on an 11K newly
developed synthetic dataset with interleaved natural language reasoning and
automatic formalization, and (2) solver-in-the-loop reinforcement learning that
jointly optimizes both the CoT narrative and the resulting program through
outcome-based rewards. Built on Qwen2.5-VL-7B, our new model, named
GF-Reasoner, achieves up to 15% accuracy improvements on standard GPS
benchmarks, surpassing both 7B-scale peers and the much larger model
Qwen2.5-VL-72B. By exploiting high-order geometric knowledge and offloading
symbolic computation to the solver, the generated reasoning traces are
noticeably shorter and cleaner. Furthermore, we present a comprehensive
analysis of method design choices (e.g., reasoning paradigms, data synthesis,
training epochs, etc.), providing actionable insights for future research.

### [244] [Towards Universal Neural Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09100)
*Shreyas Bhat Brahmavar,Yang Li,Junier Oliva*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces ASPIRE, a universal neural inference model designed for reasoning and prediction across diverse datasets with inconsistent structures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in leveraging information across datasets with varying schemas, semantics, and feature ordering.

Method: ASPIRE combines a set-based Transformer with a semantic grounding module to align semantics across disjoint tables and perform reasoning over structured data.

Result: ASPIRE delivers strong results across diverse benchmarks and supports cost-aware active feature acquisition under test-time budget constraints.

Conclusion: ASPIRE represents progress toward universal, semantics-aware inference models for heterogeneous structured data.

Abstract: Real-world data often appears in diverse, disjoint forms -- with varying
schemas, inconsistent semantics, and no fixed feature ordering -- making it
challenging to build general-purpose models that can leverage information
across datasets. We introduce ASPIRE, Arbitrary Set-based Permutation-Invariant
Reasoning Engine, a Universal Neural Inference model for semantic reasoning and
prediction over heterogeneous structured data. ASPIRE combines a
permutation-invariant, set-based Transformer with a semantic grounding module
that incorporates natural language descriptions, dataset metadata, and
in-context examples to learn cross-dataset feature dependencies. This
architecture allows ASPIRE to ingest arbitrary sets of feature--value pairs and
support examples, align semantics across disjoint tables, and make predictions
for any specified target. Once trained, ASPIRE generalizes to new inference
tasks without additional tuning. In addition to delivering strong results
across diverse benchmarks, ASPIRE naturally supports cost-aware active feature
acquisition in an open-world setting, selecting informative features under
test-time budget constraints for an arbitrary unseen dataset. These
capabilities position ASPIRE as a step toward truly universal, semantics-aware
inference over structured data.

*Jiani Ni,He Zhao,Yibo Yang,Dandan Guo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces MaC-Cal, a novel method for improving DNNs' calibration using mask-based techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Poor calibration of DNNs poses risks in safety-critical fields like healthcare and autonomous driving due to unreliable confidence estimates.

Method: MaC-Cal uses a two-stage training scheme with stochastic sparsity and adaptive mask retention rates to align confidence and accuracy.

Result: MaC-Cal achieves better calibration performance and robustness under data corruption compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: MaC-Cal provides an effective solution for improving the reliability of confidence estimates in DNNs, addressing both overconfidence and underconfidence challenges.

Abstract: In recent years, deep neural networks (DNNs) have shown competitive results
in many fields. Despite this success, they often suffer from poor calibration,
especially in safety-critical scenarios such as autonomous driving and
healthcare, where unreliable confidence estimates can lead to serious
consequences. Recent studies have focused on improving calibration by modifying
the classifier, yet such efforts remain limited. Moreover, most existing
approaches overlook calibration errors caused by underconfidence, which can be
equally detrimental. To address these challenges, we propose MaC-Cal, a novel
mask-based classifier calibration method that leverages stochastic sparsity to
enhance the alignment between confidence and accuracy. MaC-Cal adopts a
two-stage training scheme with adaptive sparsity, dynamically adjusting mask
retention rates based on the deviation between confidence and accuracy.
Extensive experiments show that MaC-Cal achieves superior calibration
performance and robustness under data corruption, offering a practical and
effective solution for reliable confidence estimation in DNNs.

### [246] [Playing Atari Space Invaders with Sparse Cosine Optimized Policy Evolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08526)
*Jim O'Connor,Jay B. Nash,Derin Gezgin,Gary B. Parker*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: This paper presents Sparse Cosine Optimized Policy Evolution (SCOPE), which applies the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) to reduce input space dimensionality for game-playing policies. SCOPE achieves better performance in Space Invaders compared to other evolutionary and reinforcement learning methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge evolutionary methods face in game-playing due to the large state space of video games, which leads to a high number of trainable parameters and slower convergence speeds.

Method: The proposed method, SCOPE, uses the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) as a pseudo-attention mechanism to transform the input state into a coefficient matrix, reducing the input dimensionality through truncation and sparsification before applying CMA-ES for policy learning.

Result: SCOPE reduces the input size by 53% (from 33,600 to 15,625) and outperforms traditional evolutionary methods like OpenAI-ES and HyperNEAT, as well as reinforcement learning algorithms like DQN and A3C in the Atari game Space Invaders.

Conclusion: SCOPE demonstrates that input dimensionality reduction using DCT effectively improves learning efficiency and performance, offering a promising framework for handling high-dimensional state spaces in evolutionary learning.

Abstract: Evolutionary approaches have previously been shown to be effective learning
methods for a diverse set of domains. However, the domain of game-playing poses
a particular challenge for evolutionary methods due to the inherently large
state space of video games. As the size of the input state expands, the size of
the policy must also increase in order to effectively learn the temporal
patterns in the game space. Consequently, a larger policy must contain more
trainable parameters, exponentially increasing the size of the search space.
Any increase in search space is highly problematic for evolutionary methods, as
increasing the number of trainable parameters is inversely correlated with
convergence speed. To reduce the size of the input space while maintaining a
meaningful representation of the original space, we introduce Sparse Cosine
Optimized Policy Evolution (SCOPE). SCOPE utilizes the Discrete Cosine
Transform (DCT) as a pseudo attention mechanism, transforming an input state
into a coefficient matrix. By truncating and applying sparsification to this
matrix, we reduce the dimensionality of the input space while retaining the
highest energy features of the original input. We demonstrate the effectiveness
of SCOPE as the policy for the Atari game Space Invaders. In this task, SCOPE
with CMA-ES outperforms evolutionary methods that consider an unmodified input
state, such as OpenAI-ES and HyperNEAT. SCOPE also outperforms simple
reinforcement learning methods, such as DQN and A3C. SCOPE achieves this result
through reducing the input size by 53% from 33,600 to 15,625 then using a
bilinear affine mapping of sparse DCT coefficients to policy actions learned by
the CMA-ES algorithm.

Main category: cs.PF

TL;DR: The paper proposes an AI-driven pipeline for optimal placement of LLM adapters to maximize performance and resource efficiency in single-node and multi-replica setups.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Increasing efficiency and reducing overhead in serving diverse task-specific LLM adapters, which currently face challenges in performance degradation and placement optimization.

Method: An analytical pipeline driven by AI insights and a Digital Twin model simulating online LLM adapter systems to optimize GPU resource allocation based on real-time workload patterns.

Result: The Digital Twin model achieved a throughput SMAPE difference of no more than 5.5% compared to real-world results, and the pipeline accurately predicts optimal adapter placement with minimal latency.

Conclusion: The approach significantly improves performance and resource efficiency in LLM adapter serving by optimizing placement strategies based on workload dynamics, providing a scalable solution for multi-replica deployments.

Abstract: Serving LLM adapters has gained significant attention as an effective
approach to adapt general-purpose language models to diverse, task-specific use
cases. However, serving a wide range of adapters introduces several and
substantial overheads, leading to performance degradation and challenges in
optimal placement. To address these challenges, we present an analytical,
AI-driven pipeline that accurately determines the optimal allocation of
adapters in single-node setups. This allocation maximizes performance,
effectively using GPU resources, while preventing request starvation.
Crucially, the proposed allocation is given based on current workload patterns.
These insights in single-node setups can be leveraged in multi-replica
deployments for overall placement, load balancing and server configuration,
ultimately enhancing overall performance and improving resource efficiency. Our
approach builds on an in-depth analysis of LLM adapter serving, accounting for
overheads and performance variability, and includes the development of the
first Digital Twin capable of replicating online LLM-adapter serving systems
with matching key performance metrics. The experimental results demonstrate
that the Digital Twin achieves a SMAPE difference of no more than 5.5% in
throughput compared to real results, and the proposed pipeline accurately
predicts the optimal placement with minimal latency.

*Afsara Benazir,Felix Xiaozhu Lin*

Main category: cs.PF

TL;DR: This paper systematically examines Apple Silicon's performance in on-device LLM inference, comparing it to NVIDIA GPUs and debunking myths about both hardware types.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation lies in addressing the lack of detailed understanding about Apple Silicon's capabilities and efficiency for on-device inference, especially when compared to widely used NVIDIA GPUs.

Method: The authors conducted latency and throughput benchmarks, profiled low-level hardware metrics (e.g., ALU utilization, memory bandwidth), and evaluated 5 hardware setups, 5 model scales, and 14 quantization schemes to analyze Apple Silicon.

Result: Apple Silicon's large unified memory was found to make it cost-effective and efficient compared to NVIDIA GPUs for ultra-large language models. Several performance bottlenecks and resource interdependencies were identified.

Conclusion: This study serves as the first thorough characterization of Apple Silicon's potential for on-device inference, dispelling misconceptions and presenting a nuanced perspective of its capabilities.

Abstract: A systematic understanding of Apple Silicon is lacking in the current
landscape of hardware efficiency; research focus is largely centered on
accelerating GPUs for large-scale training or inference on CUDA devices. This
paper investigates Apple Silicon's unique memory architecture that offers a
unified memory integrating CPU and GPU memory and its implications for
on-device LLM inference.
  We decipher myths about whether Apple Silicon is efficient for on-device
inference compared to competitors such as NVIDIA GPUs by directly conducting
latency and throughput comparison benchmarks. We explain the performance gap
between them through profiling low level hardware metrics - ALU utilization,
memory bandwidth, buffer usage, cache residency etc. at runtime. We draw
several insights regarding performance bottlenecks such as dequantization
overhead, compute throughput and memory bandwidth. We debunk existing false
claims regarding large language model inference such as compressing models to
lower bit precision is a defacto promise for faster inference across all
hardware platforms. We find that the large unified memory enables Apple Silicon
to be both cost effective and efficient against NVIDIA GPUs for ultra large
language models.
  Our large scale evaluation on 5 hardware testbeds incorporating three Apple
M-series devices: M2 Ultra, M2 Max and M4 Pro and two NVIDIA GPUs: NVIDIA RTX
A6000, a multi GPU setup with 2xNVIDIA RTX A6000, 5 model scales ranging from
8B to 405B parameters and 14 quantization schemes gives an understanding of how
Apple Silicon fits within the paradigm of on-device LLM inference. Our analysis
reveals multiple resource interdependencies and unexpected findings, while also
quantifying established insights. To the best of our knowledge, this study
makes the first attempt to present a thorough characterization and analysis of
Apple Silicon for on-device inference.

### [249] [Humanoid Robot Acrobatics Utilizing Complete Articulated Rigid Body Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08258)
*Gerald Brantner*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper develops a control architecture integrating trajectory optimization and whole-body control for humanoid robots to perform acrobatic tasks, using an accurate model of rigid body dynamics. The effectiveness is validated via simulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Humanoid robots struggle with executing dynamic motions like acrobatics due to the complexity of their high degrees of freedom and the challenges of planning control trajectories based on true physical dynamics.

Method: They propose a control architecture that combines trajectory optimization and whole-body control with an intermediate model abstraction. This architecture adheres to the full equations of motion of articulated rigid body systems to handle constraints and posture behaviors.

Result: Simulation results are presented demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed system in executing acrobatic maneuvers.

Conclusion: The proposed architecture allows humanoid robots to perform dynamic and complex acrobatic motions by leveraging precise physical modeling and advanced optimization methods.

Abstract: Endowing humanoid robots with the ability to perform highly dynamic motions
akin to human-level acrobatics has been a long-standing challenge. Successfully
performing these maneuvers requires close consideration of the underlying
physics in both trajectory optimization for planning and control during
execution. This is particularly challenging due to humanoids' high
degree-of-freedom count and associated exponentially scaling complexities,
which makes planning on the explicit equations of motion intractable. Typical
workarounds include linearization methods and model approximations. However,
neither are sufficient because they produce degraded performance on the true
robotic system. This paper presents a control architecture comprising
trajectory optimization and whole-body control, intermediated by a matching
model abstraction, that enables the execution of acrobatic maneuvers, including
constraint and posture behaviors, conditioned on the unabbreviated equations of
motion of the articulated rigid body model. A review of underlying modeling and
control methods is given, followed by implementation details including model
abstraction, trajectory optimization and whole-body controller. The system's
effectiveness is analyzed in simulation.

*Chun-Ming Yang,Pranav A. Bhounsule*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces an LMPC strategy using the Koopman operator to manage quadruped robot locomotion, enhancing control accuracy and disturbance rejection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to improve online optimal control for quadruped robots, enabling them to adapt adaptively to diverse inputs and environmental conditions in real time.

Method: They use the Koopman operator to create a linear high-dimensional model preserving the nonlinear dynamics of quadruped systems, integrating this model into an LMPC framework.

Result: Demonstrates high-fidelity motion tracking and effective disturbance rejection in quadruped robots using the proposed approach.

Conclusion: By leveraging the Koopman operator within LMPC, this study achieves robust and precise quadrupedal locomotion control, marking the first application of this technique in such scenarios.

Abstract: Online optimal control of quadruped robots would enable them to adapt to
varying inputs and changing conditions in real time. A common way of achieving
this is linear model predictive control (LMPC), where a quadratic programming
(QP) problem is formulated over a finite horizon with a quadratic cost and
linear constraints obtained by linearizing the equations of motion and solved
on the fly. However, the model linearization may lead to model inaccuracies. In
this paper, we use the Koopman operator to create a linear model of the
quadrupedal system in high dimensional space which preserves the nonlinearity
of the equations of motion. Then using LMPC, we demonstrate high fidelity
tracking and disturbance rejection on a quadrupedal robot. This is the first
work that uses the Koopman operator theory for LMPC of quadrupedal locomotion.

TL;DR: The paper introduces eIFP-MPC, an enhanced version of IFP that addresses challenges in multi-robot path planning, focusing on robustness and efficiency in dense and symmetric environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The original IFP struggled with collisions and deadlocks in symmetric configurations, necessitating a more robust solution for effective path planning in decentralized settings.

Method: eIFP-MPC employs time-to-collision heuristics, cost-based via-point selection, and integrates model predictive control (MPC) for improved threat prioritization, path stability, and dynamic feasibility.

Result: Simulations show eIFP-MPC reduces oscillations, ensures collision-free motion, and enhances trajectory efficiency in challenging scenarios.

Conclusion: eIFP-MPC successfully improves upon IFP's scalability and stability, demonstrating its capability to handle complex multi-agent environments efficiently.

Abstract: The Iterative Forecast Planner (IFP) is a geometric planning approach that
offers lightweight computations, scalable, and reactive solutions for
multi-robot path planning in decentralized, communication-free settings.
However, it struggles in symmetric configurations, where mirrored interactions
often lead to collisions and deadlocks. We introduce eIFP-MPC, an optimized and
extended version of IFP that improves robustness and path consistency in dense,
dynamic environments. The method refines threat prioritization using a
time-to-collision heuristic, stabilizes path generation through cost-based
via-point selection, and ensures dynamic feasibility by incorporating model
predictive control (MPC) into the planning process. These enhancements are
tightly integrated into the IFP to preserve its efficiency while improving its
adaptability and stability. Extensive simulations across symmetric and
high-density scenarios show that eIFP-MPC significantly reduces oscillations,
ensures collision-free motion, and improves trajectory efficiency. The results
demonstrate that geometric planners can be strengthened through optimization,
enabling robust performance at scale in complex multi-agent environments.

Conclusion: CRADLE offers an advanced approach to user-guided RTL design optimization, demonstrating effectiveness in resource minimization and adaptability for design space exploration.

Abstract: This paper presents CRADLE, a conversational framework for design space
exploration of RTL designs using LLM-based multi-agent systems. Unlike existing

with a generator-critic agent system targeting FPGA resource minimization using

TL;DR: The paper introduces a large-scale EMG-to-Tendon Control dataset and a novel diffusion-based regression model, enhancing tendon-driven robotic hand manipulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tendon-driven robotic hands offer advanced dexterity, but challenges arise from the lack of direct mapping between motion capture data and tendon controls, as well as issues with visual tracking and occlusions in real-world applications.

Method: The authors created a large-scale dataset with tendon control signals derived from the MyoHand model and proposed baseline regression models alongside a diffusion-based regression framework for mapping sEMG signals to tendon control.

Result: The dataset includes data from 193 subjects spanning 370 hours and 29 gesture stages, with improved accuracy in tendon control predictions demonstrated by the proposed models.

Conclusion: This work provides a significant leap in enabling scalable and precise tendon control for dexterous robotic manipulation, paving the way for future advancements.

Abstract: Tendon-driven robotic hands offer unparalleled dexterity for manipulation
tasks, but learning control policies for such systems presents unique
challenges. Unlike joint-actuated robotic hands, tendon-driven systems lack a
direct one-to-one mapping between motion capture (mocap) data and tendon
controls, making the learning process complex and expensive. Additionally,
visual tracking methods for real-world applications are prone to occlusions and
inaccuracies, further complicating joint tracking. Wrist-wearable surface
electromyography (sEMG) sensors present an inexpensive, robust alternative to
capture hand motion. However, mapping sEMG signals to tendon control remains a
significant challenge despite the availability of EMG-to-pose data sets and
regression-based models in the existing literature.
  We introduce the first large-scale EMG-to-Tendon Control dataset for robotic
hands, extending the emg2pose dataset, which includes recordings from 193
subjects, spanning 370 hours and 29 stages with diverse gestures. This dataset
incorporates tendon control signals derived using the MyoSuite MyoHand model,
addressing limitations such as invalid poses in prior methods. We provide three
baseline regression models to demonstrate emg2tendon utility and propose a
novel diffusion-based regression model for predicting tendon control from sEMG
recordings. This dataset and modeling framework marks a significant step
forward for tendon-driven dexterous robotic manipulation, laying the groundwork
for scalable and accurate tendon control in robotic hands.

Motivation: To address the challenges of energy efficiency and maneuverability in long-term water environmental monitoring by autonomous robots.

Method: Developed a water surface robot with two control modes: station-keeping and traveling; conducted field experiments to compare energy consumption and time efficiency.

Result: Traveling mode reduces power consumption by 10% and total travel time by 5% compared to station-keeping mode, based on field experiments.

Conclusion: The transformable mobility mechanism effectively enhances the operational efficiency of autonomous water surface robots during patrolling tasks.

Abstract: Efficient mobility and power consumption are critical for autonomous water
surface robots in long-term water environmental monitoring. This study develops
and evaluates a transformable mobility mechanism for a water surface robot with
two control modes: station-keeping and traveling to improve energy efficiency
and maneuverability. Field experiments show that, in a round-trip task between
two points, the traveling mode reduces power consumption by 10\% and decreases

TL;DR: The paper introduces DQ-Bench, a benchmark for evaluating dynamic grasping, and DQ-Net, a framework for robust control in dynamic grasping scenarios, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing quadrupedal robot studies neglect dynamic target grasping challenges, limiting their application in scenarios like logistics sorting and human-robot collaboration.

Method: The paper introduces DQ-Bench and DQ-Net. DQ-Bench provides a systematic evaluation framework for dynamic grasping. DQ-Net employs a teacher-student network to model target characteristics and robustly plan grasp configurations, enabling closed-loop action outputs with limited data.

Result: Experiments show that DQ-Net handles dynamic object grasping effectively under various conditions, outperforming baseline methods in success rate and responsiveness.

Conclusion: Through DQ-Bench and DQ-Net, the paper advances dynamic grasping capabilities in quadrupedal robots, paving the way for better application in dynamic, unstructured environments.

Abstract: Quadrupedal robots with manipulators offer strong mobility and adaptability
for grasping in unstructured, dynamic environments through coordinated
whole-body control. However, existing research has predominantly focused on
static-object grasping, neglecting the challenges posed by dynamic targets and
thus limiting applicability in dynamic scenarios such as logistics sorting and
human-robot collaboration. To address this, we introduce DQ-Bench, a new
benchmark that systematically evaluates dynamic grasping across varying object
motions, velocities, heights, object types, and terrain complexities, along
with comprehensive evaluation metrics. Building upon this benchmark, we propose
DQ-Net, a compact teacher-student framework designed to infer grasp
configurations from limited perceptual cues. During training, the teacher
network leverages privileged information to holistically model both the static
geometric properties and dynamic motion characteristics of the target, and
integrates a grasp fusion module to deliver robust guidance for motion
planning. Concurrently, we design a lightweight student network that performs
dual-viewpoint temporal modeling using only the target mask, depth map, and
proprioceptive state, enabling closed-loop action outputs without reliance on
privileged data. Extensive experiments on DQ-Bench demonstrate that DQ-Net
achieves robust dynamic objects grasping across multiple task settings,
substantially outperforming baseline methods in both success rate and
responsiveness.

*Hossein B. Jond*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a minimalist model for swarm robotics, which avoids collisions, supports flexible group dynamics, and enables adaptive transitions between flocking and swarming.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing models struggle to integrate collision avoidance, flexibility, and naturalistic behaviors in swarm robotics.

Method: The proposed model uses agent dynamics based on relative positions, velocities, and local density, with tunable parameters for adaptability.

Result: The model demonstrated collision-free, flexible group dynamics and phase transitions by adjusting control parameters.

Conclusion: This model provides a robust framework for cognitive autonomous systems, with particular applicability in aerial multi-robot systems.

Abstract: Collective behaviors such as swarming and flocking emerge from simple,
decentralized interactions in biological systems. Existing models, such as
Vicsek and Cucker-Smale, lack collision avoidance, whereas the Olfati-Saber
model imposes rigid formations, limiting their applicability in swarm robotics.
To address these limitations, this paper proposes a minimal yet expressive
model that governs agent dynamics using relative positions, velocities, and
local density, modulated by two tunable parameters: the spatial offset and
kinetic offset. The model achieves spatially flexible, collision-free behaviors
that reflect naturalistic group dynamics. Furthermore, we extend the framework
to cognitive autonomous systems, enabling energy-aware phase transitions
between swarming and flocking through adaptive control parameter tuning. This
cognitively inspired approach offers a robust foundation for real-world
applications in multi-robot systems, particularly autonomous aerial swarms.

TL;DR: AZRA is an augmented reality framework to enhance emotional interactions with zoomorphic robots like Petit Qoobo, aiming for dynamic user interaction without physical modifications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Zoomorphic robots currently lack dynamic, nuanced emotional interactions, limiting their potential for domestic adoption as alternatives to pets.

Method: AZRA combines augmented reality features with computational models of emotion to extend robots’ emotional capabilities, without physically modifying them.

Result: The framework provides novel ways for robots to express emotions (face, sound, thought bubbles) and interact with humans (voice, touch, gaze), enabling rapid prototyping and enhancement.

Conclusion: AZRA paves the way for advancing zoomorphic robots’ emotional and interactive dynamics, supporting their adoption in domestic contexts and influencing future development.

Abstract: Zoomorphic robots could serve as accessible and practical alternatives for
users unable or unwilling to keep pets. However, their affective interactions
are often simplistic and short-lived, limiting their potential for domestic
adoption. In order to facilitate more dynamic and nuanced affective
interactions and relationships between users and zoomorphic robots we present
AZRA, a novel augmented reality (AR) framework that extends the affective
capabilities of these robots without physical modifications. To demonstrate
AZRA, we augment a zoomorphic robot, Petit Qoobo, with novel emotional displays
(face, light, sound, thought bubbles) and interaction modalities (voice, touch,
proximity, gaze). Additionally, AZRA features a computational model of emotion
to calculate the robot's emotional responses, daily moods, evolving personality
and needs. We highlight how AZRA can be used for rapid participatory
prototyping and enhancing existing robots, then discuss implications on future
zoomorphic robot development.

Motivation: To enable better coordination and planning for large-scale mobile robot fleets in environments like Amazon warehouses.

Method: Developed and tested four distinct model architectures: Robot-Centric, Robot-Floor, Image-Floor, and Graph-Floor, using fleet movement data from worldwide warehouse operations.

Result: Robot-centric and graph-floor models performed the best, demonstrating effectiveness in localized robot interactions and scalability with larger datasets.

Conclusion: Robot-centric and graph-floor models show significant potential in revolutionizing large-scale fleet robotics, especially as the dataset size grows.

Abstract: We introduce DeepFleet, a suite of foundation models designed to support
coordination and planning for large-scale mobile robot fleets. These models are
trained on fleet movement data, including robot positions, goals, and
interactions, from hundreds of thousands of robots in Amazon warehouses
worldwide. DeepFleet consists of four architectures that each embody a distinct
inductive bias and collectively explore key points in the design space for
multi-agent foundation models: the robot-centric (RC) model is an
autoregressive decision transformer operating on neighborhoods of individual
robots; the robot-floor (RF) model uses a transformer with cross-attention
between robots and the warehouse floor; the image-floor (IF) model applies
convolutional encoding to a multi-channel image representation of the full
fleet; and the graph-floor (GF) model combines temporal attention with graph
neural networks for spatial relationships. In this paper, we describe these
models and present our evaluation of the impact of these design choices on
prediction task performance. We find that the robot-centric and graph-floor
models, which both use asynchronous robot state updates and incorporate the
localized structure of robot interactions, show the most promise. We also
present experiments that show that these two models can make effective use of

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that calibration enhances the realistic planning potential of digital twins in construction automation.

Abstract: This paper presents the development of a calibrated digital twin of a wheel
loader. A calibrated digital twin integrates a construction vehicle with a
high-fidelity digital model allowing for automated diagnostics and optimization
of operations as well as pre-planning simulations enhancing automation
capabilities. The high-fidelity digital model is a virtual twin of the physical
wheel loader. It uses a physics-based multibody dynamic model of the wheel
loader in the software AGX Dynamics. Interactions of the wheel loader's bucket
while in use in construction can be simulated in the virtual model. Calibration
makes this simulation of high-fidelity which can enhance realistic planning for
automation of construction operations. In this work, a wheel loader was
instrumented with several sensors used to calibrate the digital model. The
calibrated digital twin was able to estimate the magnitude of the forces on the
bucket base with high accuracy, providing a high-fidelity simulation.

TL;DR: A novel autonomous robot employs computer vision and mobility to detect, analyze, and water plants intelligently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing agricultural robots are costly and lack flexible mobility and functionality.

Method: Developed a mobile robot integrated with a 6-DOF manipulator, Jetson Nano, YOLOv5 for detection, and soil moisture sensing capability; uses LIDAR for movement planning.

Result: Robot effectively detects plants, assesses their needs using sensors, and waters appropriately without pre-defined paths.

Conclusion: The robot demonstrates feasibility in autonomous plant watering, integrating technology for precision and adaptability.

Abstract: Plants need regular and the appropriate amount of watering to thrive and
survive. While agricultural robots exist that can spray water on plants and
crops such as the , they are expensive and have limited mobility and/or
functionality. We introduce a novel autonomous mobile plant watering robot that
uses a 6 degree of freedom (DOF) manipulator, connected to a 4 wheel drive
alloy chassis, to be able to hold a garden hose, recognize and detect plants,
and to water them with the appropriate amount of water by being able to insert
a soil humidity/moisture sensor into the soil. The robot uses Jetson Nano and
Arduino microcontroller and real sense camera to perform computer vision to
detect plants using real-time YOLOv5 with the Pl@ntNet-300K dataset. The robot
uses LIDAR for object and collision avoideance and does not need to move on a
pre-defined path and can keep track of which plants it has watered. We provide
the Denavit-Hartenberg (DH) Table, forward kinematics, differential driving
kinematics, and inverse kinematics along with simulation and experiment results

### [261] [Communication Efficient Robotic Mixed Reality with Gaussian Splatting Cross-Layer Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08624)
*Chenxuan Liu,He Li,Zongze Li,Shuai Wang,Wei Xu,Kejiang Ye,Derrick Wing Kwan Ng,Chengzhong Xu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces Gaussian splatting (GS) and a cross-layer optimization (GSCLO) to enable low-cost communication in robotic mixed reality (RoboMR) systems by minimizing the need for image uploads and adjusting power/content profiles efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of high communication costs in RoboMR systems due to the need for transmitting high-resolution images over wireless channels.

Method: The paper proposes Gaussian splatting RoboMR (GSMR) to render photo-realistic views using a GS model, and introduces a GS cross-layer optimization (GSCLO) framework to jointly optimize content switching and power allocation using an accelerated penalty optimization algorithm.

Result: The proposed methods outperform benchmarks in various metrics and scenarios, enabling ultra-low communication costs while ensuring robust and effective performance in dynamic contexts.

Conclusion: GSMR and GSCLO set a new paradigm for low-cost RoboMR systems by combining GS modeling and optimization techniques, highlighting the importance of data mixture for dynamic environments.

Abstract: Realizing low-cost communication in robotic mixed reality (RoboMR) systems
presents a challenge, due to the necessity of uploading high-resolution images
through wireless channels. This paper proposes Gaussian splatting (GS) RoboMR
(GSMR), which enables the simulator to opportunistically render a
photo-realistic view from the robot's pose by calling ``memory'' from a GS
model, thus reducing the need for excessive image uploads. However, the GS
model may involve discrepancies compared to the actual environments. To this
end, a GS cross-layer optimization (GSCLO) framework is further proposed, which
jointly optimizes content switching (i.e., deciding whether to upload image or
not) and power allocation (i.e., adjusting to content profiles) across
different frames by minimizing a newly derived GSMR loss function. The GSCLO
problem is addressed by an accelerated penalty optimization (APO) algorithm
that reduces computational complexity by over $10$x compared to traditional
branch-and-bound and search algorithms. Moreover, variants of GSCLO are
presented to achieve robust, low-power, and multi-robot GSMR. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that the proposed GSMR paradigm and GSCLO method
achieve significant improvements over existing benchmarks on both wheeled and
legged robots in terms of diverse metrics in various scenarios. For the first
time, it is found that RoboMR can be achieved with ultra-low communication
costs, and mixture of data is useful for enhancing GS performance in dynamic
scenarios.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Unmanned aerial-aquatic vehicles with amphibious wings enable dual air and underwater operation, inspired by puffins’ wings and designed to minimize environmental impact.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Develop a UAAV capable of operations in both air and water, addressing engineering challenges caused by medium differences.

Method: Design amphibious wings based on fixed-wing structures with a single degree of freedom for underwater flapping motion and integrate artificial central pattern generator for smooth movement.

Result: Prototype of UAAV demonstrated smooth air-to-water transition and environmentally friendly propulsion underwater.

Conclusion: Amphibious wing design showcases potential for advanced UAAVs with dual-operation capabilities while reducing harm to marine ecosystems.

Abstract: Unmanned aerial-aquatic vehicles (UAAVs) can operate both in the air and
underwater, giving them broad application prospects. Inspired by the
dual-function wings of puffins, we propose a UAAV with amphibious wings to
address the challenge posed by medium differences on the vehicle's propulsion
system. The amphibious wing, redesigned based on a fixed-wing structure,
features a single degree of freedom in pitch and requires no additional
components. It can generate lift in the air and function as a flapping wing for
propulsion underwater, reducing disturbance to marine life and making it
environmentally friendly. Additionally, an artificial central pattern generator
(CPG) is introduced to enhance the smoothness of the flapping motion. This
paper presents the prototype, design details, and practical implementation of
this concept.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This study proposes OmniVTLA, a vision-language-action model incorporating tactile sensing, improving robotic manipulation tasks which vision-only models struggle with.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of tactile perception integration in vision-language-action (VLA) models, which struggle with contact-intensive robotic tasks due to tactile sensor heterogeneity and limited tactile data availability.

Method: The authors introduce a dual-path tactile encoder, a semantically-aligned tactile ViT, and a new diverse tactile dataset (ObjTac) to train tactile representations and integrate tactile data into the OmniVTLA model for improved task performance.

Result: OmniVTLA outperformed VLA baselines in real-world pick-and-place robotics tasks, achieving a 96.9% success rate with grippers and 100% success rate with dexterous hands, with smoother trajectories and reduced task times.

Conclusion: By incorporating tactile sensing, OmniVTLA demonstrates significant advances in task generalization and performance in robotic manipulation, showcasing the importance of tactile perception in VLA models.

Abstract: Recent vision-language-action (VLA) models build upon vision-language
foundations, and have achieved promising results and exhibit the possibility of
task generalization in robot manipulation. However, due to the heterogeneity of
tactile sensors and the difficulty of acquiring tactile data, current VLA
models significantly overlook the importance of tactile perception and fail in
contact-rich tasks. To address this issue, this paper proposes OmniVTLA, a
novel architecture involving tactile sensing. Specifically, our contributions
are threefold. First, our OmniVTLA features a dual-path tactile encoder
framework. This framework enhances tactile perception across diverse
vision-based and force-based tactile sensors by using a pretrained vision
transformer (ViT) and a semantically-aligned tactile ViT (SA-ViT). Second, we
introduce ObjTac, a comprehensive force-based tactile dataset capturing
textual, visual, and tactile information for 56 objects across 10 categories.
With 135K tri-modal samples, ObjTac supplements existing visuo-tactile
datasets. Third, leveraging this dataset, we train a semantically-aligned
tactile encoder to learn a unified tactile representation, serving as a better
initialization for OmniVTLA. Real-world experiments demonstrate substantial
improvements over state-of-the-art VLA baselines, achieving 96.9% success rates
with grippers, (21.9% higher over baseline) and 100% success rates with
dexterous hands (6.2% higher over baseline) in pick-and-place tasks. Besides,
OmniVTLA significantly reduces task completion time and generates smoother
trajectories through tactile sensing compared to existing VLA.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: PF2MP introduces a safety-focused motion generation method using potential fields in flow matching models to avoid collisions in complex environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhancing the safety of generated motions in imitation learning, particularly in environments with obstacles, has been underexplored.

Method: The PF2MP approach learns task policies and extracts obstacle-related data as potential fields from successful demonstrations, modulating flow matching vector fields during inference.

Result: PF2MP significantly reduces collisions compared to baseline policies while maintaining task success across diverse applications such as navigation and robotic manipulation.

Conclusion: The approach supports safer and effective motion generation in unstructured and obstacle-rich environments, demonstrating its utility in real-world and simulated settings.

Abstract: Deep generative models, particularly diffusion and flow matching models, have
recently shown remarkable potential in learning complex policies through
imitation learning. However, the safety of generated motions remains
overlooked, particularly in complex environments with inherent obstacles. In
this work, we address this critical gap by proposing Potential Field-Guided
Flow Matching Policy (PF2MP), a novel approach that simultaneously learns task
policies and extracts obstacle-related information, represented as a potential
field, from the same set of successful demonstrations. During inference, PF2MP
modulates the flow matching vector field via the learned potential field,
enabling safe motion generation. By leveraging these complementary fields, our
approach achieves improved safety without compromising task success across
diverse environments, such as navigation tasks and robotic manipulation
scenarios. We evaluate PF2MP in both simulation and real-world settings,
demonstrating its effectiveness in task space and joint space control.
Experimental results demonstrate that PF2MP enhances safety, achieving a
significant reduction of collisions compared to baseline policies. This work
paves the way for safer motion generation in unstructured and obstaclerich
environments.

### [265] [Boosting Action-Information via a Variational Bottleneck on Unlabelled Robot Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08743)
*Haoyu Zhang,Long Cheng*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new method for learning from unlabeled video demonstrations by maximizing mutual information between latent actions and true robot actions, improving robotic policy performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large amounts of action-labeled expert trajectories limit the scale of training data in Learning from Demonstrations (LfD). Learning from unlabeled videos offers a promising alternative but suffers from low mutual information between latent actions and true actions.

Method: The proposed framework explicitly utilizes the variational information-bottleneck to extract action-relevant representations while discarding irrelevant information, maximizing mutual information between latent and true robot actions.

Result: Experiments conducted in both simulated and real-world robotic environments show that this approach significantly enhances mutual information and consistently improves policy control performance.

Conclusion: Maximizing mutual information in learning from unlabeled video demonstrations is shown theoretically and experimentally to improve action representation and control performance in robotic environments.

Abstract: Learning from demonstrations (LfD) typically relies on large amounts of
action-labeled expert trajectories, which fundamentally constrains the scale of
available training data. A promising alternative is to learn directly from
unlabeled video demonstrations. However, we find that existing methods tend to
encode latent actions that share little mutual information with the true robot
actions, leading to suboptimal control performance. To address this limitation,
we introduce a novel framework that explicitly maximizes the mutual information
between latent actions and true actions, even in the absence of action labels.
Our method leverage the variational information-bottleneck to extract
action-relevant representations while discarding task-irrelevant information.
We provide a theoretical analysis showing that our objective indeed maximizes
the mutual information between latent and true actions. Finally, we validate
our approach through extensive experiments: first in simulated robotic
environments and then on real-world robotic platforms, the experimental results
demonstrate that our method significantly enhances mutual information and
consistently improves policy performance.

TL;DR: The paper addresses robotic pick-and-place tasks in convenience stores, proposing a perception-action pipeline combined with Action Chunking with Transformers (ACT) to improve trajectory planning and grasping.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dense object arrangements, occlusions, and variations in object properties such as color, shape, and size in convenience stores complicate robot operations, necessitating advanced trajectory planning and grasp techniques.

Method: The authors utilize a perception-action pipeline based on annotation-guided visual prompting with bounding box annotations and Action Chunking with Transformers (ACT), an imitation learning algorithm, to inform robotic pick-and-place actions using human demonstrations.

Result: The system demonstrated improved grasp accuracy and adaptability in robotic pick-and-place tasks, validated through success rates and visual analysis in retail-like settings.

Conclusion: The proposed method enhances robotic pick-and-place efficiency, making it smoother and more adaptable for dense and variable retail environments.

Abstract: Robotic pick-and-place tasks in convenience stores pose challenges due to
dense object arrangements, occlusions, and variations in object properties such
as color, shape, size, and texture. These factors complicate trajectory
planning and grasping. This paper introduces a perception-action pipeline
leveraging annotation-guided visual prompting, where bounding box annotations
identify both pickable objects and placement locations, providing structured
spatial guidance. Instead of traditional step-by-step planning, we employ
Action Chunking with Transformers (ACT) as an imitation learning algorithm,
enabling the robotic arm to predict chunked action sequences from human
demonstrations. This facilitates smooth, adaptive, and data-driven
pick-and-place operations. We evaluate our system based on success rate and
visual analysis of grasping behavior, demonstrating improved grasp accuracy and
adaptability in retail environments.

### [267] [Robot can reduce superior's dominance in group discussions with human social hierarchy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08767)
*Kazuki Komura,Kumi Ozaki,Seiji Yamada*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This study examines if robots addressing social hierarchies can balance participation in discussions but finds inconclusive results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address imbalances in group discussions caused by hierarchical dominance, often seen in professional or social settings.

Method: An experimental study involving 30 doctors and students in hierarchical relationships tested a robot using hierarchical and non-hierarchical speech interventions.

Result: While robots showed potential to influence speaking time, significant differences in effects were not conclusively observed, but satisfaction levels remained stable.

Conclusion: Robot behavior, like targeted backchanneling, might help reduce dominance in hierarchical discussions but requires further validation.

Abstract: This study investigated whether robotic agents that deal with social
hierarchical relationships can reduce the dominance of superiors and equalize
participation among participants in discussions with hierarchical structures.
Thirty doctors and students having hierarchical relationship were gathered as
participants, and an intervention experiment was conducted using a robot that
can encourage participants to speak depending on social hierarchy. These were
compared with strategies that intervened equally for all participants without
considering hierarchy and with a no-action. The robots performed follow
actions, showing backchanneling to speech, and encourage actions, prompting
speech from members with less speaking time, on the basis of the hierarchical
relationships among group members to equalize participation. The experimental
results revealed that the robot's actions could potentially influence the
speaking time among members, but it could not be conclusively stated that there
were significant differences between the robot's action conditions. However,
the results suggested that it might be possible to influence speaking time
without decreasing the satisfaction of superiors. This indicates that in
discussion scenarios where experienced superiors are likely to dominate,
controlling the robot's backchanneling behavior could potentially suppress
dominance and equalize participation among group members.

### [268] [Towards Affordance-Aware Robotic Dexterous Grasping with Human-like Priors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08896)
*Haoyu Zhao,Linghao Zhuang,Xingyue Zhao,Cheng Zeng,Haoran Xu,Yuming Jiang,Jun Cen,Kexiang Wang,Jiayan Guo,Siteng Huang,Xin Li,Deli Zhao,Hua Zou*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Researchers introduced AffordDex, a framework enabling dexterous and human-like object grasping by leveraging motion priors and object affordances for universal grasping capability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current grasping techniques ignore natural, human-like grasp poses and functional contact areas crucial for downstream use.

Method: AffordDex employs a two-stage training: pre-training human motion imitation and refining motions with object-specific adaptations using a segmentation module and teacher-student distillation.

Result: AffordDex achieves superior performance in universal grasping tasks, showcasing adaptability over seen, unseen, and novel object categories while maintaining human-like and functional grasp behavior.

Conclusion: AffordDex outperforms existing methods in dexterous object grasping by incorporating both human-likeness and affordance-aware adaptations, marking it a significant step forward for embodied AI systems.

Abstract: A dexterous hand capable of generalizable grasping objects is fundamental for
the development of general-purpose embodied AI. However, previous methods focus
narrowly on low-level grasp stability metrics, neglecting affordance-aware
positioning and human-like poses which are crucial for downstream manipulation.
To address these limitations, we propose AffordDex, a novel framework with
two-stage training that learns a universal grasping policy with an inherent
understanding of both motion priors and object affordances. In the first stage,
a trajectory imitator is pre-trained on a large corpus of human hand motions to
instill a strong prior for natural movement. In the second stage, a residual
module is trained to adapt these general human-like motions to specific object
instances. This refinement is critically guided by two components: our Negative
Affordance-aware Segmentation (NAA) module, which identifies functionally
inappropriate contact regions, and a privileged teacher-student distillation
process that ensures the final vision-based policy is highly successful.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that AffordDex not only achieves universal
dexterous grasping but also remains remarkably human-like in posture and
functionally appropriate in contact location. As a result, AffordDex
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across seen objects,
unseen instances, and even entirely novel categories.

TL;DR: The paper introduces SDAX, a framework enabling legged robots to autonomously learn agile locomotion behaviors via unsupervised skill discovery and regulated exploration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The aim is to overcome the challenge of enabling legged robots to navigate diverse obstacles without relying heavily on labor-intensive methods such as reward engineering or expert demonstrations, which limit generalizability.

Method: SDAX employs unsupervised skill discovery and a bi-level optimization process to autonomously acquire diverse skills and dynamically adjust exploration levels during learning.

Result: SDAX facilitates quadrupedal robots in autonomously learning a range of agile behaviors, including advanced maneuvers like jumping off vertical walls.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully reduces human intervention and transfers learned policies to real hardware, enhancing the generalizability and practicality of robot locomotion systems.

Abstract: Exploration is crucial for enabling legged robots to learn agile locomotion
behaviors that can overcome diverse obstacles. However, such exploration is
inherently challenging, and we often rely on extensive reward engineering,
expert demonstrations, or curriculum learning - all of which limit
generalizability. In this work, we propose Skill Discovery as Exploration
(SDAX), a novel learning framework that significantly reduces human engineering
effort. SDAX leverages unsupervised skill discovery to autonomously acquire a
diverse repertoire of skills for overcoming obstacles. To dynamically regulate
the level of exploration during training, SDAX employs a bi-level optimization
process that autonomously adjusts the degree of exploration. We demonstrate
that SDAX enables quadrupedal robots to acquire highly agile behaviors
including crawling, climbing, leaping, and executing complex maneuvers such as
jumping off vertical walls. Finally, we deploy the learned policy on real
hardware, validating its successful transfer to the real world.

*Ben Zandonati,Tomás Lozano-Pérez,Leslie Pack Kaelbling*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces Rational Inverse Reasoning (RIR), a framework enabling robots to infer latent programs and generalize intelligent behavior from limited demonstrations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inability of robots to recover latent explanations for intelligent behavior and generalize from limited examples, unlike humans.

Method: Introduced RIR, a hierarchical generative model that uses Bayesian program induction, combining vision-language models with planner-in-the-loop inference to extract structured task programs.

Result: RIR successfully generalizes tasks across variations with one demonstration, outperforming current vision-language model baselines in manipulation tasks.

Conclusion: RIR demonstrates that using structured programs inferred from demonstrations allows robots to generalize tasks effectively, advancing few-shot imitation capabilities.

Abstract: Humans can observe a single, imperfect demonstration and immediately
generalize to very different problem settings. Robots, in contrast, often
require hundreds of examples and still struggle to generalize beyond the
training conditions. We argue that this limitation arises from the inability to
recover the latent explanations that underpin intelligent behavior, and that
these explanations can take the form of structured programs consisting of
high-level goals, sub-task decomposition, and execution constraints. In this
work, we introduce Rational Inverse Reasoning (RIR), a framework for inferring
these latent programs through a hierarchical generative model of behavior. RIR
frames few-shot imitation as Bayesian program induction: a vision-language
model iteratively proposes structured symbolic task hypotheses, while a
planner-in-the-loop inference scheme scores each by the likelihood of the
observed demonstration under that hypothesis. This loop yields a posterior over
concise, executable programs. We evaluate RIR on a suite of continuous
manipulation tasks designed to test one-shot and few-shot generalization across
variations in object pose, count, geometry, and layout. With as little as one
demonstration, RIR infers the intended task structure and generalizes to novel
settings, outperforming state-of-the-art vision-language model baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robots need expressive behaviors to effectively convey emotional states during human interaction.

Method: The method involves capturing human facial expressions, head movements, and gestures via Mixed Reality, mapping them onto robot components, and employing a flow-matching generative algorithm to create varied real-time behaviors.

Result: A preliminary test demonstrated that the system can effectively generate autonomous robotic expressions conditioned by emotional states.

Conclusion: The proposed framework paves the way for robots to display realistic and diverse emotional expressions, enhancing human-robot interaction.

Abstract: Expressive behaviors in robots are critical for effectively conveying their
emotional states during interactions with humans. In this work, we present a
framework that autonomously generates realistic and diverse robotic emotional
expressions based on expert human demonstrations captured in Mixed Reality
(MR). Our system enables experts to teleoperate a virtual robot from a
first-person perspective, capturing their facial expressions, head movements,
and upper-body gestures, and mapping these behaviors onto corresponding robotic
components including eyes, ears, neck, and arms. Leveraging a
flow-matching-based generative process, our model learns to produce coherent
and varied behaviors in real-time in response to moving objects, conditioned
explicitly on given emotional states. A preliminary test validated the
effectiveness of our approach for generating autonomous expressions.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces a framework for the autonomous operation of hydraulic material handlers in large-scale material handling tasks using reinforcement learning-based modules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Material handling tasks are repetitive, labor-intensive, and safety-critical, often performed with underactuated hydraulic grippers. Automating these tasks could improve efficiency, safety, and precision.

Method: The framework combines modules for environment perception, attack point planning via reinforcement learning, path planning, and motion control. The two major contributions are: (1) an attack point planner optimizing pile handling; (2) a trajectory-following controller leveraging underactuated grippers for precise material throwing.

Result: The autonomous system was validated on a 40-ton material handler in real-world scenarios, including bulk pile management and truck loading. It was found to be effective and performed better in terms of precision, repeatability, and safety compared to human operators.

Conclusion: This is the first demonstration of complete automation for full-scale material handling tasks, achieving operational improvements and validating the framework's feasibility.

Abstract: Bulk material handling involves the efficient and precise moving of large
quantities of materials, a core operation in many industries, including cargo
ship unloading, waste sorting, construction, and demolition. These repetitive,
labor-intensive, and safety-critical operations are typically performed using
large hydraulic material handlers equipped with underactuated grippers. In this
work, we present a comprehensive framework for the autonomous execution of
large-scale material handling tasks. The system integrates specialized modules
for environment perception, pile attack point selection, path planning, and
motion control. The main contributions of this work are two reinforcement
learning-based modules: an attack point planner that selects optimal grasping
locations on the material pile to maximize removal efficiency and minimize the
number of scoops, and a robust trajectory following controller that addresses
the precision and safety challenges associated with underactuated grippers in
movement, while utilizing their free-swinging nature to release material
through dynamic throwing. We validate our framework through real-world
experiments on a 40 t material handler in a representative worksite, focusing
on two key tasks: high-throughput bulk pile management and high-precision truck
loading. Comparative evaluations against human operators demonstrate the
system's effectiveness in terms of precision, repeatability, and operational
safety. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first complete automation of
material handling tasks on a full scale.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of current VLA models that rely on 2D visual inputs and lack 3D spatial awareness critical for advanced robotic manipulation.

Method: GeoVLA fuses vision and language embeddings from a Vision-Language Model (VLM) with 3D point cloud embeddings processed by a Point Embedding Network. These are combined and processed by a 3D-enhanced Action Expert.

Result: GeoVLA outperforms existing models in LIBERO and ManiSkill2 benchmarks and demonstrates robustness in real-world tasks needing height adaptability, scale awareness, and viewpoint invariance.

Conclusion: The integration of 3D geometric information with multi-modal embeddings significantly enhances the spatial awareness and adaptability of VLA models, advancing robotic manipulation performance.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have emerged as a promising approach for
enabling robots to follow language instructions and predict corresponding
actions.However, current VLA models mainly rely on 2D visual inputs, neglecting
the rich geometric information in the 3D physical world, which limits their
spatial awareness and adaptability. In this paper, we present GeoVLA, a novel
VLA framework that effectively integrates 3D information to advance robotic
manipulation. It uses a vision-language model (VLM) to process images and
language instructions,extracting fused vision-language embeddings. In parallel,
it converts depth maps into point clouds and employs a customized point
encoder, called Point Embedding Network, to generate 3D geometric embeddings
independently. These produced embeddings are then concatenated and processed by
our proposed spatial-aware action expert, called 3D-enhanced Action Expert,
which combines information from different sensor modalities to produce precise
action sequences. Through extensive experiments in both simulation and
real-world environments, GeoVLA demonstrates superior performance and
robustness. It achieves state-of-the-art results in the LIBERO and ManiSkill2
simulation benchmarks and shows remarkable robustness in real-world tasks
requiring height adaptability, scale awareness and viewpoint invariance.

multi-file projects due to context limitations and knowledge gaps. We propose a
novel context engineering workflow that combines multiple AI components: an
Intent Translator (GPT-5) for clarifying user requirements, an Elicit-powered
semantic literature retrieval for injecting domain knowledge, NotebookLM-based
document synthesis for contextual understanding, and a Claude Code multi-agent
system for code generation and validation. Our integrated approach leverages
intent clarification, retrieval-augmented generation, and specialized
sub-agents orchestrated via Claude's agent framework. We demonstrate that this
method significantly improves the accuracy and reliability of code assistants
in real-world repositories, yielding higher single-shot success rates and
better adherence to project context than baseline single-agent approaches.
Qualitative results on a large Next.js codebase show the multi-agent system
effectively plans, edits, and tests complex features with minimal human
intervention. We compare our system with recent frameworks like CodePlan,
MASAI, and HyperAgent, highlighting how targeted context injection and agent
role decomposition lead to state-of-the-art performance. Finally, we discuss
the implications for deploying LLM-based coding assistants in production, along
with lessons learned on context management and future research directions.

### [275] [Energy-Aware Code Generation with LLMs: Benchmarking Small vs. Large Language Models for Sustainable AI Programming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08332)
*Humza Ashraf,Syed Muhammad Danish,Aris Leivadeas,Yazan Otoum,Zeeshan Sattar*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The study compares open-source Small Language Models (SLMs) and commercial Large Language Models (LLMs) for code generation, focusing on energy efficiency and performance. SLMs often consume less energy than LLMs, though LLMs achieve higher correctness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address growing concerns about the environmental impact of code generation by massive LLMs, the study investigates whether open-source SLMs can offer comparable performance with improved energy efficiency.

Method: The study evaluates 150 LeetCode problems (easy, medium, hard) using three SLMs and two LLMs. Each generated code solution is assessed on four metrics: runtime, memory usage, energy consumption, and correctness. Human-written Python code serves as a benchmark.

Result: LLMs demonstrate the highest correctness across all difficulty levels. However, SLMs are often more energy-efficient, using less or the same energy as LLMs in over 52% of the problems when their outputs are correct.

Conclusion: While LLMs provide superior correctness, SLMs hold promise for energy efficiency, particularly in scenarios where their outputs are accurate.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used for code generation. However,
commercial models like ChatGPT require significant computing power, which leads
to high energy use and carbon emissions. This has raised concerns about their
environmental impact. In this study, we evaluate open-source Small Language
Models (SLMs) trained explicitly for code generation and compare their
performance and energy efficiency against large LLMs and efficient
human-written Python code. The goal is to investigate whether SLMs can match
the performance of LLMs on certain types of programming problems while
producing more energy-efficient code. We evaluate 150 coding problems from
LeetCode, evenly distributed across three difficulty levels: easy, medium, and
hard. Our comparison includes three small open-source models, StableCode-3B,
StarCoderBase-3B, and Qwen2.5-Coder-3B-Instruct, and two large commercial
models, GPT-4.0 and DeepSeek-Reasoner. The generated code is evaluated using
four key metrics: run-time, memory usage, energy consumption, and correctness.
We use human-written solutions as a baseline to assess the quality and
efficiency of the model-generated code. Results indicate that LLMs achieve the
highest correctness across all difficulty levels, but SLMs are often more
energy-efficient when their outputs are correct. In over 52% of the evaluated
problems, SLMs consumed the same or less energy than LLMs.

### [276] [Improving Merge Pipeline Throughput in Continuous Integration via Pull Request Prioritization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08342)
*Maximilian Jungwirth,Martin Gruber,Gordon Fraser*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper proposes optimizing merge pipeline efficiency by predicting successful builds based on historical data, significantly outperforming traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Merge pipelines in large software projects often become bottlenecks despite parallelization, and existing optimizations are tied to specific build systems, limiting generalizability.

Method: The paper suggests using historical build data, PR metadata, and contextual information to predict successful builds and prioritize them dynamically in merge pipelines during peak hours.

Result: Predictive ordering of PRs in merge pipelines significantly outperforms FIFO and non-learning-based strategies in experiments on a large-scale real-world project.

Conclusion: This build-system-agnostic approach effectively enhances throughput during peak hours and can be easily integrated into existing automated merge pipelines.

Abstract: Integrating changes into large monolithic software repositories is a critical
step in modern software development that substantially impacts the speed of
feature delivery, the stability of the codebase, and the overall productivity
of development teams. To ensure the stability of the main branch, many
organizations use merge pipelines that test software versions before the
changes are permanently integrated. However, the load on merge pipelines is
often so high that they become bottlenecks, despite the use of parallelization.
Existing optimizations frequently rely on specific build systems, limiting
their generalizability and applicability. In this paper we propose to optimize
the order of PRs in merge pipelines using practical build predictions utilizing
only historical build data, PR metadata, and contextual information to estimate
the likelihood of successful builds in the merge pipeline. By dynamically
prioritizing likely passing PRs during peak hours, this approach maximizes
throughput when it matters most. Experiments conducted on a real-world,
large-scale project demonstrate that predictive ordering significantly
outperforms traditional first-in-first-out (FIFO), as well as
non-learning-based ordering strategies. Unlike alternative optimizations, this
approach is agnostic to the underlying build system and thus easily integrable
into existing automated merge pipelines.

### [277] [OmniLLP: Enhancing LLM-based Log Level Prediction with Context-Aware Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08545)
*Youssef Esseddiq Ouatiti,Mohammed Sayagh,Bram Adams,Ahmed E. Hassan*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper introduces OmniLLP, an enhanced framework for ML-based log level prediction, using semantic and ownership-aware clustering to improve predictive accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the accuracy of log level predictors by addressing the limitations in current methods, which ignore semantic structure and diverse logging practices within software projects.

Method: OmniLLP clusters source files using semantic similarity and developer ownership cohesion, retrieving context-specific learning examples for log level prediction.

Result: OmniLLP improves prediction accuracy by up to 8% in AUC and achieves AUC scores of 0.88 to 0.96 across tested projects, outperforming random selection baselines.

Conclusion: Integrating software-specific signals like code semantics and ownership into log level prediction offers a more accurate and context-aware approach, enhancing system maintainability and observability.

Abstract: Developers insert logging statements in source code to capture relevant
runtime information essential for maintenance and debugging activities. Log
level choice is an integral, yet tricky part of the logging activity as it
controls log verbosity and therefore influences systems' observability and
performance. Recent advances in ML-based log level prediction have leveraged
large language models (LLMs) to propose log level predictors (LLPs) that
demonstrated promising performance improvements (AUC between 0.64 and 0.8).
Nevertheless, current LLM-based LLPs rely on randomly selected in-context
examples, overlooking the structure and the diverse logging practices within
modern software projects. In this paper, we propose OmniLLP, a novel LLP
enhancement framework that clusters source files based on (1) semantic
similarity reflecting the code's functional purpose, and (2) developer
ownership cohesion. By retrieving in-context learning examples exclusively from
these semantic and ownership aware clusters, we aim to provide more coherent
prompts to LLPs leveraging LLMs, thereby improving their predictive accuracy.
Our results show that both semantic and ownership-aware clusterings
statistically significantly improve the accuracy (by up to 8\% AUC) of the
evaluated LLM-based LLPs compared to random predictors (i.e., leveraging
randomly selected in-context examples from the whole project). Additionally,
our approach that combines the semantic and ownership signal for in-context
prediction achieves an impressive 0.88 to 0.96 AUC across our evaluated
projects. Our findings highlight the value of integrating software
engineering-specific context, such as code semantic and developer ownership
signals into LLM-LLPs, offering developers a more accurate, contextually-aware
approach to logging and therefore, enhancing system maintainability and
observability.

*Chunhua Liu,Hong Yi Lin,Patanamon Thongtanunam*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper analyzes hallucinations in language models for tasks involving code changes, focusing on commit message generation and code review comment generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of understanding of hallucinations in code change-related tasks, which have a structurally complex and context-dependent format.

Method: The paper quantifies hallucination prevalence in language models, evaluates metric-based detection methods, and combines metrics to enhance performance.

Result: Approximately 50% of generated code reviews and 20% of commit messages exhibit hallucinations. Combining metrics significantly improves detection efficacy.

Conclusion: Hallucinations are prevalent in code-related tasks, and combining metrics such as model confidence and feature attribution aids reliable inference-time detection of hallucinations.

Abstract: Language models have shown strong capabilities across a wide range of tasks
in software engineering, such as code generation, yet they suffer from
hallucinations. While hallucinations have been studied independently in natural
language and code generation, their occurrence in tasks involving code changes
which have a structurally complex and context-dependent format of code remains
largely unexplored. This paper presents the first comprehensive analysis of
hallucinations in two critical tasks involving code change to natural language
generation: commit message generation and code review comment generation. We
quantify the prevalence of hallucinations in recent language models and explore
a range of metric-based approaches to automatically detect them. Our findings
reveal that approximately 50\% of generated code reviews and 20\% of generated
commit messages contain hallucinations. Whilst commonly used metrics are weak
detectors on their own, combining multiple metrics substantially improves
performance. Notably, model confidence and feature attribution metrics
effectively contribute to hallucination detection, showing promise for
inference-time detection.\footnote{All code and data will be released upon
acceptance.

*Henning Femmer,Frank Houdek,Max Unterbusch,Andreas Vogelsang*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: QuRE is a new dataset of 2,111 industrial requirements, annotated through real-world review. It offers a detailed context, systematic labeling, and aims to enhance research on requirements quality in software engineering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing datasets for studying requirements quality are often inaccessible, small, or lack detailed annotations. This paper addresses the need for realistic and representative datasets to advance research on quality defects in requirements.

Method: The authors introduce QuRE, a dataset derived from 5+ years of annotations from industrial practices. It includes descriptive statistics, comparisons with existing and synthetic datasets, emphasizing linguistic similarity and systematic labeling.

Result: QuRE demonstrates linguistic similarity to existing datasets and offers detailed annotations based on industrial practices. Its descriptive statistics highlight lexical diversity and readability.

Conclusion: The release of QuRE aims to foster research through enhanced transparency, comparability, and rigor, providing a gold standard for requirements quality studies to support collaborative efforts in the domain.

Abstract: Requirements quality is central to successful software and systems
engineering. Empirical research on quality defects in natural language
requirements relies heavily on datasets, ideally as realistic and
representative as possible. However, such datasets are often inaccessible,
small, or lack sufficient detail. This paper introduces QuRE (Quality in
Requirements), a new dataset comprising 2,111 industrial requirements that have
been annotated through a real-world review process. Previously used for over
five years as part of an industrial contract, this dataset is now being
released to the research community. In this work, we furthermore provide
descriptive statistics on the dataset, including measures such as lexical
diversity and readability, and compare it to existing requirements datasets and
synthetically generated requirements. In contrast to synthetic datasets, QuRE
is linguistically similar to existing ones. However, this dataset comes with a
detailed context description, and its labels have been created and used
systematically and extensively in an industrial context over a period of close
to a decade. Our goal is to foster transparency, comparability, and empirical
rigor by supporting the development of a common gold standard for requirements
quality datasets. This, in turn, will enable more sound and collaborative
research efforts in the field.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper analyzes fault patterns in 16 open-source Java and Python projects, finding that faults are long-lived and often co-occur, contrary to assumptions in Defects4J and BugsInPy datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for lower software maintenance costs through a better understanding and dataset analysis of software faults.

Method: Empirical analysis of the temporal and spatial characteristics of faults in 16 open-source projects from the Defects4J (Java) and BugsInPy (Python) datasets.

Result: Found that faults are long-lived, tend to coexist in various software versions, and are spread evenly among a subset of the systems, creating few bug hotspots.

Conclusion: The results challenge prior assumptions in defect datasets and provide insights for better fault understanding, testing, and cost reduction efforts.

Abstract: Fixing software faults contributes significantly to the cost of software
maintenance and evolution. Techniques for reducing these costs require datasets
of software faults, as well as an understanding of the faults, for optimal
testing and evaluation. In this paper, we present an empirical analysis of the
temporal and spatial characteristics of faults existing in 16 open-source Java
and Python projects, which form part of the Defects4J and BugsInPy datasets,
respectively. Our findings show that many faults in these software systems are
long-lived, leading to the majority of software versions having multiple
coexisting faults. This is in contrast to the assumptions of the original
datasets, where the majority of versions only identify a single fault. In
addition, we show that although the faults are found in only a small subset of
the systems, these faults are often evenly distributed amongst this subset,
leading to relatively few bug hotspots.

*Hyunwoo Kim,Jaeseong Lee,Sunpyo Hong,Changmin Han*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces an automated framework for optimizing hardware resource allocation in software-defined vehicles using modeling approaches and real-world testing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The automotive industry's transition to software-defined vehicles necessitates efficient resource allocation to address the challenge of adapting static configurations to dynamic system requirements.

Method: The method combines runtime profiling data, theoretical models, and vendor heuristics to generate optimized hypervisor configurations using domain-guided parametric and deep learning-based modeling approaches.

Result: The presented framework improves resource allocation efficiency, enhances integration processes, and reduces development time in real-world deployments.

Conclusion: The tool successfully addresses the needs for adaptable and efficient resource allocation in software-defined vehicles, showcasing its applicability in resource-constrained automotive environments.

Abstract: In the automotive industry, the rise of software-defined vehicles (SDVs) has
  driven a shift toward virtualization-based architectures that consolidate
  diverse automotive workloads on a shared hardware platform. To support this
  evolution, chipset vendors provide board support packages (BSPs), hypervisor
  setups, and resource allocation guidelines. However, adapting these static
  configurations to varying system requirements and workloads remain a
  significant challenge for Tier 1 integrators.
  This paper presents an automated scenario generation framework, which helps
  automotive vendors to allocate hardware resources efficiently across multiple
  VMs. By profiling runtime behavior and integrating both theoretical models
and
  vendor heuristics, the proposed tool generates optimized hypervisor
  configurations tailored to system constraints.
  We compare two main approaches for modeling target QoS based on profiled data
  and resource allocation: domain-guided parametric modeling and deep
  learning-based modeling. We further describe our optimization strategy using
  the selected QoS model to derive efficient resource allocations. Finally, we
  report on real-world deployments to demonstrate the effectiveness of our
  framework in improving integration efficiency and reducing development time
in
  resource-constrained environments.

### [282] [Field-theoretic approach to compartmental neuronal networks: impact of dendritic calcium spike-dependent bursting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08405)
*Audrey O'Brien Teasley,Gabriel Koch Ocker*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: The paper develops a statistical field-theoretic approach to analyze networks of compartmental neurons capable of generating different types of spikes, focusing on thick-tufted pyramidal cells and revealing mean-field limits that explain activity states.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing mean-field theories often rely on oversimplified point-neuron models that ignore spatial compartmentalization and multiple spike types in neurons. The goal is to address these limitations and better understand collective activity in networks of complex neurons.

Method: The approach involves developing a statistical field-theoretic framework tailored to networks of compartmental neurons and deriving their mean-field limit. In particular, the analysis centers on thick-tufted layer 5 pyramidal cells and examines the interactions between calcium spikes and somatic spikes.

Result: The study reveals an exact mean-field limit in weakly-coupled network regimes, mapping these networks to a marked point process. It demonstrates how compartmentalized connectivity affects equilibrium phases, uncovering metastable regions with variable dendritic and inhibitory activity states.

Conclusion: Compartmentalized excitatory and inhibitory interactions are crucial for determining neuronal network dynamics, leading to varied and metastable activity states. The proposed method advances understanding of complex neural population behavior.

Abstract: Neurons are spatially extended cells; different parts of a neuron have
specific voltage dynamics. Important types of neurons even generate different
spikes in different parts of the cell. Neurons' inputs are also often spatially
compartmentalized, with different sources targeting different locations on the
cell. Classic mean-field theories for neural population activity, however, rely
on point-neuron models with at most one type of spike. Here, we develop a
statistical field-theoretic approach to understanding collective activity in
networks of compartmental neurons, including those generating multiple types of
spikes. We use this to examine simple models of networks with thick-tufted
layer 5 pyramidal cells, which generate calcium spikes in their apical dendrite
when dendritic depolarization coincides with a back-propagating somatic spike.
In the weakly-coupled regime, we uncover an exact mean-field limit for these
networks that maps them to a marked point process. We use this mean-field limit
to compare the impact of compartmentalized recurrent excitatory and inhibitory
connectivity on the equilibrium phase diagram. This exposes regions of
metastability between various activity states, including activity with silent
vs active dendrites, with and without inhibitory activity, and oscillations.

*Kaixi Tian,Shengjia Zhao,Yuhan Zhang,Shan Yu*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method (Multi-dimensional Neural Decoding, MND) to extract multiple motor variables from neural recordings and proposes a framework (OrthoSchema) to overcome cross-task interference and generalization issues, leading to improved accuracy in brain-computer interface tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current brain-computer interfaces are limited by their ability to decode only single motor variables, which restricts their potential for natural, high-bandwidth neural control involving multiple correlated motor dimensions.

Method: The authors propose OrthoSchema, a multi-task framework inspired by cortical orthogonal subspace organization and cognitive schema reuse. It enforces orthogonality to prevent cross-task interference and utilizes selective feature reuse for adaptation across sessions, subjects, and paradigms.

Result: OrthoSchema significantly enhances decoding accuracy in cross-session, cross-subject, and cross-paradigm generalization tasks on macaque motor cortex datasets. Its performance improvements are especially notable with limited fine-tuning samples.

Conclusion: OrthoSchema effectively tackles cross-task interference and generalization issues, offering robust solutions for multi-dimensional neural decoding. This work advances scalable, accurate BCI designs suitable for diverse real-world applications.

Abstract: Current brain-computer interfaces primarily decode single motor variables,
limiting their ability to support natural, high-bandwidth neural control that
requires simultaneous extraction of multiple correlated motor dimensions. We
introduce Multi-dimensional Neural Decoding (MND), a task formulation that
simultaneously extracts multiple motor variables (direction, position,
velocity, acceleration) from single neural population recordings. MND faces two
key challenges: cross-task interference when decoding correlated motor
dimensions from shared cortical representations, and generalization issues
across sessions, subjects, and paradigms. To address these challenges, we
propose OrthoSchema, a multi-task framework inspired by cortical orthogonal
subspace organization and cognitive schema reuse. OrthoSchema enforces
representation orthogonality to eliminate cross-task interference and employs
selective feature reuse transfer for few-shot cross-session, subject and
paradigm adaptation. Experiments on macaque motor cortex datasets demonstrate
that OrthoSchema significantly improves decoding accuracy in cross-session,
cross-subject and challenging cross-paradigm generalization tasks, with larger
performance improvements when fine-tuning samples are limited. Ablation studies
confirm the synergistic effects of all components are crucial, with OrthoSchema
effectively modeling cross-task features and capturing session relationships
for robust transfer. Our results provide new insights into scalable and robust
neural decoding for real-world BCI applications.

*F. Pérez-Gay,T. Sicotte,N. Goulet,X. Kang,S. Harnad*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: The study investigated whether category learning could alter perceptual processes, finding that successful learners exhibited perceptual and neural changes, while non-learners did not.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To examine if and how the process of learning to categorize stimuli with specific features can lead to perceptual changes.

Method: 96 subjects trained to categorize line-drawn fish using trial-and-error feedback; pairwise dissimilarity judgments and ERP measurements were taken before and after training.

Result: 40% of participants successfully learned the categories, showing perceptual changes (separation/compression) and ERP shifts correlated with accuracy.

Conclusion: Learning categories can induce perceptual and neural changes, even without reliance on feature type, as confirmed by experimental and neural net modeling results.

Abstract: Learning to categorize requires distinguishing category members from
non-members by detecting the features that covary with membership. Whether this
process can induce changes in perception is still a matter of debate. In prior
studies, wereported Learned Categorical Perception (Learned CP) effects in the
form of between-category separation and within-category compression in
perceived similarity after training subjects to categorize visual stimuli with
distributed, holistic features.These effects were correlated with changes in an
early, perceptual component of Event Related Potentials (ERPs). Using the same
methodology, in this experiment we trained 96 subjects to sort line drawings of
fish with local, verbalizable features into two categories by trial and error
with corrective feedback. We tested for Learned CP effects and their neural
correlates by measuring subjects' pairwise dissimilarity judgments and(ERPs)
before and after the training. With the same frequency of trials and
feedback,about 40% of the participants succeeded in learning the categories
("learners") while the rest did not ("non-learners"). Learners showed a)
significant between-category separation and within-category compression after
training compared to before and b) an increase in a late parietal ERP
positivity (LPC; 400-600 ms) and an early, occipital positivity (P1; 80-140
ms), correlated with categorization accuracy and degree of Learned CP. These
behavioral and neural changes after learning a category, absent in Non
Learners, provide further evidence that category learning can modulate
perceptual processes, regardless of the nature of the visual features. We
complement our experimental results with a neural net model using the same
stimuli.

TL;DR: This paper presents multifidelity linear regression methods for high-dimensional outputs, incorporating dimensionality reduction and data augmentation techniques, and demonstrates improved accuracy with limited high-fidelity data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of surrogate modeling in data-limited applications with high-dimensional outputs, where training data acquisition is costly.

Method: It introduces two projection-based multifidelity linear regression methods, leveraging principal component basis vectors for dimensionality reduction and data augmentation techniques that combine low-fidelity and high-fidelity data. Weighted least squares with fidelity-specific weights are employed.

Result: The methods demonstrated 3% - 12% improvement in median accuracy compared to single-fidelity models when tested in a low-data regime with no more than ten high-fidelity samples.

Conclusion: The multifidelity techniques outperform single-fidelity methods in terms of accuracy, showcasing their potential for data-efficient surrogate modeling.

Abstract: Surrogate modeling for systems with high-dimensional quantities of interest
remains challenging, particularly when training data are costly to acquire.
This work develops multifidelity methods for multiple-input multiple-output
linear regression targeting data-limited applications with high-dimensional
outputs. Multifidelity methods integrate many inexpensive low-fidelity model
evaluations with limited, costly high-fidelity evaluations. We introduce two
projection-based multifidelity linear regression approaches that leverage
principal component basis vectors for dimensionality reduction and combine
multifidelity data through: (i) a direct data augmentation using low-fidelity
data, and (ii) a data augmentation incorporating explicit linear corrections
between low-fidelity and high-fidelity data. The data augmentation approaches
combine high-fidelity and low-fidelity data into a unified training set and
train the linear regression model through weighted least squares with
fidelity-specific weights. Various weighting schemes and their impact on
regression accuracy are explored. The proposed multifidelity linear regression
methods are demonstrated on approximating the surface pressure field of a
hypersonic vehicle in flight. In a low-data regime of no more than ten
high-fidelity samples, multifidelity linear regression achieves approximately
3% - 12% improvement in median accuracy compared to single-fidelity methods
with comparable computational cost.

TL;DR: The paper evaluates the excess risk of In-Context Learning (ICL) for multiclass classification, deriving performance bounds and showing both transformers and MLPs can achieve optimal prediction rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to understand the efficiency and performance limits of In-Context Learning (ICL) for multiclass classification, addressing both theoretical bounds and the applicability of various neural architectures, like transformers and MLPs.

Method: Using a sequence-based task model, the authors analyze ICL performance via the expected excess risk, grounded in a new oracle inequality and bounds using KL divergence. They further leverage uniform empirical covering entropy to control generalization error.

Result: They establish tight bounds for ICL excess risk, showing it achieves minimax optimal rates up to logarithmic factors. They also prove MLPs under certain conditions can achieve similar ICL performance as transformers.

Conclusion: ICL is shown to be effective for conditional probability estimation, achieving near-optimal rates in multiclass classification. Both transformer models and MLPs can serve as architectures for executing ICL, challenging the view that transformers are uniquely suited.

Abstract: This paper investigates the expected excess risk of In-Context Learning (ICL)
for multiclass classification. We model each task as a sequence of labeled
prompt samples and a query input, where a pre-trained model estimates the
conditional class probabilities of the query. The expected excess risk is
defined as the average truncated Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the
predicted and ground-truth conditional class distributions, averaged over a
specified family of tasks. We establish a new oracle inequality for the
expected excess risk based on KL divergence in multiclass classification. This
allows us to derive tight upper and lower bounds for the expected excess risk
in transformer-based models, demonstrating that the ICL estimator achieves the
minimax optimal rate - up to a logarithmic factor - for conditional probability
estimation. From a technical standpoint, our results introduce a novel method
for controlling generalization error using the uniform empirical covering
entropy of the log-likelihood function class. Furthermore, we show that
multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) can also perform ICL and achieve this optimal
rate under specific assumptions, suggesting that transformers may not be the
exclusive architecture capable of effective ICL.

*Joseph Paillard,Antoine Collas,Denis A. Engemann,Bertrand Thirion*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces Hierarchical-CPI, a model-agnostic variable importance measure designed for applications in medical imaging, addressing challenges posed by highly-correlated data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to enhance interpretability of predictive models in medical imaging, which face challenges due to data complexity and correlation in variables.

Method: The authors developed Hierarchical-CPI, a method that identifies jointly predictive variable groups using hierarchical tree exploration and tree-based importance allocation, while ensuring family-wise error rate control.

Result: Hierarchical-CPI was benchmarked against state-of-the-art methods and demonstrated its effectiveness in identifying biologically plausible variables in two neuroimaging datasets: ADNI (MRI dementia classification) and TDBRAIN (EEG Berger effect analysis).

Conclusion: Hierarchical-CPI offers an interpretable and computationally efficient approach for analyzing highly correlated medical imaging data, showing promise in real-world neuroimaging applications.

Abstract: Recent advances in machine learning have greatly expanded the repertoire of
predictive methods for medical imaging. However, the interpretability of
complex models remains a challenge, which limits their utility in medical
applications. Recently, model-agnostic methods have been proposed to measure
conditional variable importance and accommodate complex non-linear models.
However, they often lack power when dealing with highly correlated data, a
common problem in medical imaging. We introduce Hierarchical-CPI, a
model-agnostic variable importance measure that frames the inference problem as
the discovery of groups of variables that are jointly predictive of the
outcome. By exploring subgroups along a hierarchical tree, it remains
computationally tractable, yet also enjoys explicit family-wise error rate
control. Moreover, we address the issue of vanishing conditional importance
under high correlation with a tree-based importance allocation mechanism. We

*Davide Casnici,Charlotte Frenkel,Justin Dauwels*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces Predictive Coding (PC) as a biologically plausible alternative to Backpropagation (BP), providing insights into its theoretical underpinnings and practical implementation with Python.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to explore an alternative to Backpropagation (BP) for neural network training, as BP's reliance on a global error signal is inconsistent with biological principles, unlike Predictive Coding (PC), which is local and biologically plausible.

Method: The authors provide a tutorial-style introduction to Predictive Coding, covering its mathematical formulation, derivation, theoretical connections to optimization and signal processing methods, and practical implementation using PyTorch.

Result: The paper bridges the gap between the theoretical foundations and practical implementation of PC, demonstrating its importance as a biologically plausible learning rule.

Conclusion: Predictive Coding can effectively serve as an alternative to Backpropagation, aligning with biological principles while offering computational advantages. The paper serves as a guide for researchers interested in its mathematical and practical aspects.

Abstract: Backpropagation (BP) of errors is the backbone training algorithm for
artificial neural networks (ANNs). It updates network weights through gradient
descent to minimize a loss function representing the mismatch between
predictions and desired outputs. BP uses the chain rule to propagate the loss
gradient backward through the network hierarchy, allowing efficient weight
updates. However, this process requires weight updates at every layer to rely
on a global error signal generated at the network's output.
  In contrast, the Hebbian model of synaptic plasticity states that weight
updates are local, depending only on the activity of pre- and post-synaptic
neurons. This suggests biological brains likely do not implement BP directly.
Recently, Predictive Coding (PC) has gained interest as a biologically
plausible alternative that updates weights using only local information.
Originating from 1950s work on signal compression, PC was later proposed as a
model of the visual cortex and formalized under the free energy principle,
linking it to Bayesian inference and dynamical systems. PC weight updates rely
solely on local information and provide theoretical advantages such as
automatic scaling of gradients based on uncertainty.
  This lecture notes column offers a novel, tutorial-style introduction to PC,
focusing on its formulation, derivation, and connections to well-known
optimization and signal processing algorithms such as BP and the Kalman Filter
(KF). It aims to support existing literature by guiding readers from the
mathematical foundations of PC to practical implementation, including Python
examples using PyTorch.

*Bo-Hsun Chen,Nevindu M. Batagoda,Dan Negrut*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: The paper introduces DiffPhysCam, a differentiable camera simulator that enables gradient-based optimization in robotics and visual perception pipelines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to bridge the gap between synthetic and real-world images for effective training and simulation in robotics and AI, addressing limitations in existing virtual cameras.

Method: They propose a multi-stage pipeline that provides fine-grained control over settings, models optical artifacts, and supports calibration, enabling both forward and inverse rendering.

Result: DiffPhysCam improves robotic perception, facilitates creation of digital twins, and demonstrates autonomous vehicle navigation in multi-physics simulations.

Conclusion: DiffPhysCam is an effective tool for enhancing sim-to-real transfer in robotics and AI by offering robust, tunable simulation capabilities for visual perception tasks.

Abstract: We introduce DiffPhysCam, a differentiable camera simulator designed to
support robotics and embodied AI applications by enabling gradient-based
optimization in visual perception pipelines. Generating synthetic images that
closely mimic those from real cameras is essential for training visual models
and enabling end-to-end visuomotor learning. Moreover, differentiable rendering
allows inverse reconstruction of real-world scenes as digital twins,
facilitating simulation-based robotics training. However, existing virtual
cameras offer limited control over intrinsic settings, poorly capture optical
artifacts, and lack tunable calibration parameters -- hindering sim-to-real
transfer. DiffPhysCam addresses these limitations through a multi-stage
pipeline that provides fine-grained control over camera settings, models key
optical effects such as defocus blur, and supports calibration with real-world
data. It enables both forward rendering for image synthesis and inverse
rendering for 3D scene reconstruction, including mesh and material texture
optimization. We show that DiffPhysCam enhances robotic perception performance
in synthetic image tasks. As an illustrative example, we create a digital twin
of a real-world scene using inverse rendering, simulate it in a multi-physics
environment, and demonstrate navigation of an autonomous ground vehicle using
images generated by DiffPhysCam.

*Mutian Tong,Rundi Wu,Changxi Zheng*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method for estimating spatiotemporally varying indoor lighting from video using diffusion models and MLPs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Indoor lighting estimation is challenging due to its ill-posed nature and the spatially and temporally varying lighting conditions.

Method: The method uses 2D diffusion priors to optimize a light field represented as a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP). It fine-tunes a pre-trained image diffusion model to inpaint multiple light probes for zero-shot generalization.

Result: It demonstrates superior performance in indoor lighting estimation tasks, outperforming baselines.

Conclusion: The approach significantly enhances spatiotemporally consistent lighting estimation in in-the-wild video scenarios, addressing a less explored aspect in prior research.

Abstract: Indoor lighting estimation from a single image or video remains a challenge
due to its highly ill-posed nature, especially when the lighting condition of
the scene varies spatially and temporally. We propose a method that estimates
from an input video a continuous light field describing the spatiotemporally
varying lighting of the scene. We leverage 2D diffusion priors for optimizing
such light field represented as a MLP. To enable zero-shot generalization to
in-the-wild scenes, we fine-tune a pre-trained image diffusion model to predict
lighting at multiple locations by jointly inpainting multiple chrome balls as
light probes. We evaluate our method on indoor lighting estimation from a
single image or video and show superior performance over compared baselines.
Most importantly, we highlight results on spatiotemporally consistent lighting
estimation from in-the-wild videos, which is rarely demonstrated in previous
works.

### [292] [Improving Facial Rig Semantics for Tracking and Retargeting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08429)
*Dalton Omens,Allise Thurman,Jihun Yu,Ronald Fedkiw*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: The paper focuses on retargeting facial performances to different subjects by using the same rig framework for both source and target, along with techniques like volumetric morphing and a "Simon-Says" calibration process, enhancing semantically meaningful animation results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To simplify the process of retargeting facial performances by avoiding the complexity of mapping semantics between different rig frameworks.

Method: The approach involves using shared rig frameworks, volumetric morphing, "Simon-Says" expressions for calibration, and fine-tuning techniques employing implicit differentiation.

Result: The method produces desirable expressions and acceptable geometry reconstruction, while addressing challenges of semantically meaningful retargeting.

Conclusion: Fine-tuning the rig used by the tracker improves retargeting effectiveness, especially in real-world scenarios involving non-differentiable trackers.

Abstract: In this paper, we consider retargeting a tracked facial performance to either
another person or to a virtual character in a game or virtual reality (VR)
environment. We remove the difficulties associated with identifying and
retargeting the semantics of one rig framework to another by utilizing the same
framework (3DMM, FLAME, MetaHuman, etc.) for both subjects. Although this does
not constrain the choice of framework when retargeting from one person to
another, it does force the tracker to use the game/VR character rig when
retargeting to a game/VR character. We utilize volumetric morphing in order to
fit facial rigs to both performers and targets; in addition, a carefully chosen
set of Simon-Says expressions is used to calibrate each rig to the motion
signatures of the relevant performer or target. Although a uniform set of
Simon-Says expressions can likely be used for all person to person retargeting,
we argue that person to game/VR character retargeting benefits from Simon-Says
expressions that capture the distinct motion signature of the game/VR character
rig. The Simon-Says calibrated rigs tend to produce the desired expressions
when exercising animation controls (as expected). Unfortunately, these
well-calibrated rigs still lead to undesirable controls when tracking a
performance (a well-behaved function can have an arbitrarily ill-conditioned
inverse), even though they typically produce acceptable geometry
reconstructions. Thus, we propose a fine-tuning approach that modifies the rig
used by the tracker in order to promote the output of more semantically
meaningful animation controls, facilitating high efficacy retargeting. In order
to better address real-world scenarios, the fine-tuning relies on implicit
differentiation so that the tracker can be treated as a (potentially
non-differentiable) black box.

*Dasith de Silva Edirimuni,Xuequan Lu,Ajmal Saeed Mian,Lei Wei,Gang Li,Scott Schaefer,Ying He*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: The paper proposes Hybrid Point Cloud Filtering (HybridPF) to address the noise issues in point cloud data by combining short-range and long-range filtering trajectories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges posed by noise artifacts in point cloud capture, focusing on issues like point clustering and noise retention that current methods often face.

Method: The method introduces HybridPF, leveraging short-range scores (displacements to a clean surface) and long-range velocity flows (constant displacements towards a clean patch) using two parallel modules: ShortModule and LongModule, with a joint loss function and a dynamic graph convolutional decoder.

Result: HybridPF achieves state-of-the-art denoising performance and faster inference speed through better point distribution and convergence near the clean surface.

Conclusion: HybridPF effectively combines short and long-range filtering information, overcomes decoder architecture limitations, and presents a robust method for noise removal in point cloud data.

Abstract: Point cloud capture processes are error-prone and introduce noisy artifacts
that necessitate filtering/denoising. Recent filtering methods often suffer
from point clustering or noise retaining issues. In this paper, we propose
Hybrid Point Cloud Filtering ($\textbf{HybridPF}$) that considers both
short-range and long-range filtering trajectories when removing noise. It is
well established that short range scores, given by $\nabla_{x}\log p(x_t)$, may
provide the necessary displacements to move noisy points to the underlying
clean surface. By contrast, long range velocity flows approximate constant
displacements directed from a high noise variant patch $x_0$ towards the
corresponding clean surface $x_1$. Here, noisy patches $x_t$ are viewed as
intermediate states between the high noise variant and the clean patches. Our
intuition is that long range information from velocity flow models can guide
the short range scores to align more closely with the clean points. In turn,
score models generally provide a quicker convergence to the clean surface.
Specifically, we devise two parallel modules, the ShortModule and LongModule,
each consisting of an Encoder-Decoder pair to respectively account for
short-range scores and long-range flows. We find that short-range scores,
guided by long-range features, yield filtered point clouds with good point
distributions and convergence near the clean surface. We design a joint loss
function to simultaneously train the ShortModule and LongModule, in an
end-to-end manner. Finally, we identify a key weakness in current displacement
based methods, limitations on the decoder architecture, and propose a dynamic
graph convolutional decoder to improve the inference process. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate that our HybridPF achieves state-of-the-art results
while enabling faster inference speed.

### [294] [Exploring Palette based Color Guidance in Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08754)
*Qianru Qiu,Jiafeng Mao,Xueting Wang*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method for improving control over image color schemes in text-to-image generation using color palette guidance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text-to-image models struggle to comprehensively manage color schemes in entire images, especially for less prominent elements not directly specified in prompts.

Method: The authors integrate color palettes as an additional guidance mechanism and explore different palette representation techniques within a diffusion-based image colorization framework.

Result: The use of palette guidance enhances the ability to generate images with desired color schemes, verified through quantitative and qualitative analyses.

Conclusion: Incorporating palette guidance enables more controlled, refined, and accurate colorization in text-to-image models, expanding their capabilities.

Abstract: With the advent of diffusion models, Text-to-Image (T2I) generation has seen
substantial advancements. Current T2I models allow users to specify object
colors using linguistic color names, and some methods aim to personalize
color-object association through prompt learning. However, existing models
struggle to provide comprehensive control over the color schemes of an entire
image, especially for background elements and less prominent objects not
explicitly mentioned in prompts. This paper proposes a novel approach to
enhance color scheme control by integrating color palettes as a separate
guidance mechanism alongside prompt instructions. We investigate the
effectiveness of palette guidance by exploring various palette representation
methods within a diffusion-based image colorization framework. To facilitate
this exploration, we construct specialized palette-text-image datasets and
conduct extensive quantitative and qualitative analyses. Our results
demonstrate that incorporating palette guidance significantly improves the
model's ability to generate images with desired color schemes, enabling a more
controlled and refined colorization process.

*Xiang Zhang,Yawar Siddiqui,Armen Avetisyan,Chris Xie,Jakob Engel,Henry Howard-Jenkins*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: VertexRegen is a new framework for mesh generation enabling flexible generation at different levels of detail using a vertex split approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing autoregressive mesh generation methods often produce incomplete intermediate results, lacking the ability to generate valid meshes at varying resolutions.

Method: VertexRegen reformulates mesh generation as the reverse of edge collapse (vertex split) and uses a generative model to enable continuous detailing.

Result: Experimental results confirm that VertexRegen generates meshes of similar quality to current state-of-the-art methods while achieving unique anytime generation capability.

Conclusion: VertexRegen offers a novel, flexible approach to generating meshes, allowing valid outputs at various detail levels by halting the process at any stage.

Abstract: We introduce VertexRegen, a novel mesh generation framework that enables
generation at a continuous level of detail. Existing autoregressive methods
generate meshes in a partial-to-complete manner and thus intermediate steps of
generation represent incomplete structures. VertexRegen takes inspiration from
progressive meshes and reformulates the process as the reversal of edge
collapse, i.e. vertex split, learned through a generative model. Experimental
results demonstrate that VertexRegen produces meshes of comparable quality to
state-of-the-art methods while uniquely offering anytime generation with the
flexibility to halt at any step to yield valid meshes with varying levels of
detail.

TL;DR: ColorCtrl is a training-free color editing method using Multi-Modal Diffusion Transformers to enable accurate and consistent text-guided color editing in images and videos, surpassing current methods in quality and consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of fine-grained color editing in images and videos while preserving physical and visual consistency.

Method: Leverages Multi-Modal Diffusion Transformers by manipulating attention maps and value tokens to separate color and structure, enabling accurate editing and strong word-level control.

Result: ColorCtrl outperforms existing training-free methods and commercial models in edit quality and consistency, excelling in image and video editing tasks.

Conclusion: ColorCtrl is robust and versatile, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance and generalization capabilities across various models and editing scenarios, including image and video contexts.

Abstract: Text-guided color editing in images and videos is a fundamental yet unsolved
problem, requiring fine-grained manipulation of color attributes, including
albedo, light source color, and ambient lighting, while preserving physical
consistency in geometry, material properties, and light-matter interactions.
Existing training-free methods offer broad applicability across editing tasks
but struggle with precise color control and often introduce visual
inconsistency in both edited and non-edited regions. In this work, we present
ColorCtrl, a training-free color editing method that leverages the attention
mechanisms of modern Multi-Modal Diffusion Transformers (MM-DiT). By
disentangling structure and color through targeted manipulation of attention
maps and value tokens, our method enables accurate and consistent color
editing, along with word-level control of attribute intensity. Our method
modifies only the intended regions specified by the prompt, leaving unrelated
areas untouched. Extensive experiments on both SD3 and FLUX.1-dev demonstrate
that ColorCtrl outperforms existing training-free approaches and achieves
state-of-the-art performances in both edit quality and consistency.
Furthermore, our method surpasses strong commercial models such as FLUX.1
Kontext Max and GPT-4o Image Generation in terms of consistency. When extended
to video models like CogVideoX, our approach exhibits greater advantages,
particularly in maintaining temporal coherence and editing stability. Finally,
our method also generalizes to instruction-based editing diffusion models such
as Step1X-Edit and FLUX.1 Kontext dev, further demonstrating its versatility.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a learning-based estimator to predict diffuse indirect illumination for real-time global illumination rendering, improving realism in virtual environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve real-time realistic rendering by overcoming challenges in capturing long-range indirect illumination using neural networks.

Method: A novel neural network architecture equipped with a modified attention mechanism guided by spatial geometry features and a monochromatic design for encoding color channels individually.

Result: The approach outperforms previous techniques in handling complex lighting scenarios, capturing distant indirect illumination, simulating color bleeding effects, and generalizing to unseen scenes.

Conclusion: The method enhances real-time rendering with global illumination by efficiently predicting diffuse indirect illumination and demonstrating high adaptability across diverse scenarios.

Abstract: Real-time rendering with global illumination is crucial to afford the user
realistic experience in virtual environments. We present a learning-based
estimator to predict diffuse indirect illumination in screen space, which then
is combined with direct illumination to synthesize globally-illuminated high
dynamic range (HDR) results. Our approach tackles the challenges of capturing
long-range/long-distance indirect illumination when employing neural networks
and is generalized to handle complex lighting and scenarios.
  From the neural network thinking of the solver to the rendering equation, we
present a novel network architecture to predict indirect illumination. Our
network is equipped with a modified attention mechanism that aggregates global
information guided by spacial geometry features, as well as a monochromatic
design that encodes each color channel individually.
  We conducted extensive evaluations, and the experimental results demonstrate
our superiority over previous learning-based techniques. Our approach excels at
handling complex lighting such as varying-colored lighting and environment
lighting. It can successfully capture distant indirect illumination and
simulates the interreflections between textured surfaces well (i.e., color
bleeding effects); it can also effectively handle new scenes that are not
present in the training dataset.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges posed by immutable blockchains in regulatory, corrective, and privacy-sensitive scenarios.

Method: Utilizes cryptographic mechanisms such as chameleon hash functions to implement controlled redaction and surveys competing approaches.

Result: Analyzes practical deployment of redactable blockchains in private sectors like healthcare and finance, while highlighting shortcomings and challenges.

Conclusion: Redactable blockchains can aid in creating law-compliant, scalable infrastructures, but further research is needed in reversible computing and broader adaptation.

Abstract: Blockchains are widely recognized for their immutability, which provides
robust guarantees of data integrity and transparency. However, this same
feature poses significant challenges in real-world situations that require
regulatory compliance, correction of erroneous data, or removal of sensitive
information. Redactable blockchains address the limitations of traditional ones
by enabling controlled, auditable modifications to blockchain data, primarily
through cryptographic mechanisms such as chameleon hash functions and
alternative redaction schemes. This report examines the motivations for
introducing redactability, surveys the cryptographic primitives that enable
secure edits, and analyzes competing approaches and their shortcomings. Special
attention is paid to the practical deployment of redactable blockchains in
private settings, with discussions of use cases in healthcare, finance,
Internet of drones, and federated learning. Finally, the report outlines
further challenges, also in connection with reversible computing, and the
future potential of redactable blockchains in building law-compliant,

*Kexin Chu,Zecheng Lin,Dawei Xiang,Zixu Shen,Jianchang Su,Cheng Chu,Yiwei Yang,Wenhui Zhang,Wenfei Wu,Wei Zhang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: SafeKV tackles timing side-channel attacks in globally shared KV-caches for LLMs while improving performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Global KV-cache sharing optimizes LLM inference but introduces timing side-channel vulnerabilities.

Method: SafeKV leverages a hybrid detection pipeline, a unified radix-tree index, and entropy-based monitoring.

Result: SafeKV mitigates 94%-97% timing side-channel attacks, improves TTFT by 40.58%, and boosts throughput by 2.66X.

Conclusion: SafeKV enables secure, efficient KV-cache sharing with strong privacy guarantees and minimal performance trade-offs.

Abstract: Global KV-cache sharing has emerged as a key optimization for accelerating
large language model (LLM) inference. However, it exposes a new class of timing
side-channel attacks, enabling adversaries to infer sensitive user inputs via
shared cache entries. Existing defenses, such as per-user isolation, eliminate
leakage but degrade performance by up to 38.9% in time-to-first-token (TTFT),
making them impractical for high-throughput deployment. To address this gap, we
introduce SafeKV (Secure and Flexible KV Cache Sharing), a privacy-aware
KV-cache management framework that selectively shares non-sensitive entries
while confining sensitive content to private caches. SafeKV comprises three
components: (i) a hybrid, multi-tier detection pipeline that integrates
rule-based pattern matching, a general-purpose privacy detector, and
context-aware validation; (ii) a unified radix-tree index that manages public
and private entries across heterogeneous memory tiers (HBM, DRAM, SSD); and
(iii) entropy-based access monitoring to detect and mitigate residual
information leakage. Our evaluation shows that SafeKV mitigates 94% - 97% of
timing-based side-channel attacks. Compared to per-user isolation method,
SafeKV improves TTFT by up to 40.58% and throughput by up to 2.66X across
diverse LLMs and workloads. SafeKV reduces cache-induced TTFT overhead from
50.41% to 11.74% on Qwen3-235B. By combining fine-grained privacy control with
high cache reuse efficiency, SafeKV reclaims the performance advantages of
global sharing while providing robust runtime privacy guarantees for LLM
inference.

TL;DR: The paper addresses the issue of information leakage in image data using mutual information estimators, combining deep learning, information theory, and cryptography.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Growing concerns over privacy in digital data transmission highlight the need for studying information leakage in image data, a field lacking established quantitative measures.

Method: The study applies mutual information estimators (empirical and MINE frameworks) to detect data leakage from selectively encrypted images, focusing on capturing spatial dependencies and residual structures.

Result: The proposed approach shows promise as a means to estimate information leakage in selectively encrypted images using a probabilistic framework.

Conclusion: This work provides a novel direction to better understand and estimate image information leakage, bridging gaps within these interdisciplinary domains.

Abstract: As digital data transmission continues to scale, concerns about privacy grow
increasingly urgent - yet privacy remains a socially constructed and
ambiguously defined concept, lacking a universally accepted quantitative
measure. This work examines information leakage in image data, a domain where
information-theoretic guarantees are still underexplored. At the intersection
of deep learning, information theory, and cryptography, we investigate the use
of mutual information (MI) estimators - in particular, the empirical estimator
and the MINE framework - to detect leakage from selectively encrypted images.
Motivated by the intuition that a robust estimator would require a
probabilistic frameworks that can capture spatial dependencies and residual
structures, even within encrypted representations - our work represent a
promising direction for image information leakage estimation.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper develops a holistic AI security map to relate AI security elements, negative impacts, and countermeasures, clarifying their interconnections in technical and stakeholder contexts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing research in AI security lacks a comprehensive framework to organize techniques, attacks, defenses, and their impacts on stakeholders, making it difficult to understand relationships and implications.

Method: The study creates an AI security map divided into two aspects: the Information System Aspect (ISA), detailing elements within information systems, and the External Influence Aspect (EIA), cataloging impacts on stakeholders due to attacks or misuse. Negative impacts and corresponding countermeasures are also identified.

Result: The AI security map provides a structured view of how AI system vulnerabilities correlate with stakeholder impacts, enabling easier understanding of potential issues and solutions. New findings and recommendations are presented.

Conclusion: The AI security map enhances understanding of AI risks and stakeholder impacts, offering actionable insights and directing future research in AI security.

Abstract: As the social implementation of AI has been steadily progressing, research
and development related to AI security has also been increasing. However,
existing studies have been limited to organizing related techniques, attacks,
defenses, and risks in terms of specific domains or AI elements. Thus, it
extremely difficult to understand the relationships among them and how negative
impacts on stakeholders are brought about. In this paper, we argue that the
knowledge, technologies, and social impacts related to AI security should be
holistically organized to help understand relationships among them. To this
end, we first develop an AI security map that holistically organizes
interrelationships among elements related to AI security as well as negative
impacts on information systems and stakeholders. This map consists of the two
aspects, namely the information system aspect (ISA) and the external influence
aspect (EIA). The elements that AI should fulfill within information systems
are classified under the ISA. The EIA includes elements that affect
stakeholders as a result of AI being attacked or misused. For each element,
corresponding negative impacts are identified. By referring to the AI security
map, one can understand the potential negative impacts, along with their causes
and countermeasures. Additionally, our map helps clarify how the negative
impacts on AI-based systems relate to those on stakeholders. We show some
findings newly obtained by referring to our map. We also provide several
recommendations and open problems to guide future AI security communities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the critical need to address cybersecurity challenges in IEC61850-based digital substations, where advanced communication protocols introduce vulnerabilities to cyberattacks.

Method: The authors propose using generative AI-based ADSs coupled with Advanced Adversarial Traffic Mutation (AATM) to create balanced datasets for realistic zero-day attack detection and implement task-oriented dialogue (ToD) processes for enhanced anomaly detection.

Result: The GenAI-based ADS outperforms traditional ML-based frameworks in accuracy and effectiveness, as demonstrated through AATM-generated GOOSE datasets and comprehensive evaluation metrics.

Conclusion: The study concludes that integrating generative AI and AATM techniques presents a promising solution for addressing cybersecurity threats in digital substations, enabling secure energy management and robust attack pattern identification.

Abstract: In digital substations, security events pose significant challenges to the
sustained operation of power systems. To mitigate these challenges, the
implementation of robust defense strategies is critically important. A thorough
process of anomaly identification and detection in information and
communication technology (ICT) frameworks is crucial to ensure secure and
reliable communication and coordination between interconnected devices within
digital substations. Hence, this paper addresses the critical cybersecurity
challenges confronting IEC61850-based digital substations within modern smart
grids, where the integration of advanced communication protocols, e.g., generic
object-oriented substation event (GOOSE), has enhanced energy management and
introduced significant vulnerabilities to cyberattacks. Focusing on the
limitations of traditional anomaly detection systems (ADSs) in detecting
threats, this research proposes a transformative approach by leveraging
generative AI (GenAI) to develop robust ADSs. The primary contributions include
the suggested advanced adversarial traffic mutation (AATM) technique to
generate synthesized and balanced datasets for GOOSE messages, ensuring
protocol compliance and enabling realistic zero-day attack pattern creation to
address data scarcity. Then, the implementation of GenAI-based ADSs
incorporating the task-oriented dialogue (ToD) processes has been explored for
improved detection of attack patterns. Finally, a comparison of the GenAI-based
ADS with machine learning (ML)-based ADSs has been implemented to showcase the
outperformance of the GenAI-based frameworks considering the AATM-generated
GOOSE datasets and standard/advanced performance evaluation metrics.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address privacy and security risks associated with fingerprinting attacks targeting large language models (LLMs).

Method: Developed an attack method using reinforcement learning for optimized query selection and a defensive strategy employing semantic-preserving output filtering via a secondary LLM.

Result: The attack method achieved higher fingerprinting accuracy with fewer queries, while the defensive approach effectively reduced fingerprinting accuracy without compromising output quality.

Conclusion: The study advances fingerprinting techniques and proposes practical defenses to mitigate associated privacy risks.

Abstract: As large language models are increasingly deployed in sensitive environments,
fingerprinting attacks pose significant privacy and security risks. We present
a study of LLM fingerprinting from both offensive and defensive perspectives.
Our attack methodology uses reinforcement learning to automatically optimize
query selection, achieving better fingerprinting accuracy with only 3 queries
compared to randomly selecting 3 queries from the same pool. Our defensive
approach employs semantic-preserving output filtering through a secondary LLM
to obfuscate model identity while maintaining semantic integrity. The defensive
method reduces fingerprinting accuracy across tested models while preserving
output quality. These contributions show the potential to improve
fingerprinting tools capabilities while providing practical mitigation
strategies against fingerprinting attacks.

*Abu Shafin Mohammad Mahdee Jameel,Shreya Ghosh,Aly El Gamal*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper proposes a distributed intrusion detection system using deep learning (CNN) that emphasizes transferability to counter unknown attacks effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the ability of intrusion detection systems to handle unknown attacks by utilizing knowledge from known attacks across networked devices.

Method: The system employs a CNN model, along with two algorithms: a two-step data preprocessing stage and a Block-Based Smart Aggregation (BBSA) algorithm to improve transferability relationships.

Result: The system achieves enhanced transferability capabilities across datasets while maintaining strong local detection rates. It performs well with different backbone architectures.

Conclusion: The proposed system demonstrates effective generalizability, superior transferability performance, and practical applicability in intrusion detection contexts.

Abstract: Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) are a vital part of a network-connected
device. In this paper, we develop a deep learning based intrusion detection
system that is deployed in a distributed setup across devices connected to a
network. Our aim is to better equip deep learning models against unknown
attacks using knowledge from known attacks. To this end, we develop algorithms
to maximize the number of transferability relationships. We propose a
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model, along with two algorithms that
maximize the number of relationships observed. One is a two step data
pre-processing stage, and the other is a Block-Based Smart Aggregation (BBSA)
algorithm. The proposed system succeeds in achieving superior transferability
performance while maintaining impressive local detection rates. We also show
that our method is generalizable, exhibiting transferability potential across
datasets and even with different backbones. The code for this work can be found

### [305] [EditMF: Drawing an Invisible Fingerprint for Your Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08836)
*Jiaxuan Wu,Yinghan Zhou,Wanli Peng,Yiming Xue,Juan Wen,Ping Zhong*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper introduces EditMF, a training-free approach for embedding fingerprints in large language models to verify ownership with high stealth and low computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the challenges of protecting intellectual property of large language models while ensuring both stealth and computational efficiency in ownership verification methods.

Method: The method, EditMF, utilizes semantic triples from an encrypted artificial knowledge base to encode ownership and employs causal tracing to localize relevant layers for embedding. A zero-space update is used to embed fingerprints without affecting unrelated model knowledge.

Result: EditMF demonstrates high imperceptibility, negligible performance degradation, and superior robustness when compared to LoRA-based fingerprinting. It is close to the effectiveness of other methods like SFT embeddings.

Conclusion: EditMF is a practical and efficient solution for securely embedding fingerprints in LLMs to verify ownership, balancing robustness and imperceptibility without additional computational overhead.

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) is resource-intensive and expensive,
making protecting intellectual property (IP) for LLMs crucial. Recently,
embedding fingerprints into LLMs has emerged as a prevalent method for
establishing model ownership. However, existing back-door-based methods suffer
from limited stealth and efficiency. To simultaneously address these issues, we
propose EditMF, a training-free fingerprinting paradigm that achieves highly
imperceptible fingerprint embedding with minimal computational overhead.
Ownership bits are mapped to compact, semantically coherent triples drawn from
an encrypted artificial knowledge base (e.g., virtual author-novel-protagonist
facts). Causal tracing localizes the minimal set of layers influencing each
triple, and a zero-space update injects the fingerprint without perturbing
unrelated knowledge. Verification requires only a single black-box query and
succeeds when the model returns the exact pre-embedded protagonist. Empirical
results on LLaMA and Qwen families show that EditMF combines high
imperceptibility with negligible model's performance loss, while delivering
robustness far beyond LoRA-based fingerprinting and approaching that of SFT
embeddings. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EditMF is an effective and
low-overhead solution for secure LLM ownership verification.

### [306] [The DNA of nuclear models: How AI predicts nuclear masses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08370)
*Kate A. Richardson,Sokratis Trifinopoulos,Mike Williams*

Main category: nucl-th

TL;DR: The paper proposes an AI model for nuclear binding energy prediction that achieves high precision and interpretable results, revealing underlying patterns and linking improvements to previous theoretical insights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To achieve high precision in predicting nuclear binding energies while addressing the limitations of black-box AI models for reliable extrapolations.

Method: The authors developed an AI model that ensures interpretability in its predictions. They uncovered internal structures, such as a double-helix-like representation, and factorized predictions hierarchically, revealing links to established symbolic models.

Result: The AI model achieved state-of-the-art precision in nuclear binding energy predictions while maintaining full interpretability. Improvements over conventional models were explained and linked to previous scientific observations.

Conclusion: This interpretable, data-driven AI approach offers a transparent and precise tool for nuclear mass predictions, bridging data-based methods and traditional theoretical insights.

Abstract: Obtaining high-precision predictions of nuclear masses, or equivalently
nuclear binding energies, $E_b$, remains an important goal in nuclear-physics
research. Recently, many AI-based tools have shown promising results on this
task, some achieving precision that surpasses the best physics models. However,
the utility of these AI models remains in question given that predictions are
only useful where measurements do not exist, which inherently requires
extrapolation away from the training (and testing) samples. Since AI models are
largely black boxes, the reliability of such an extrapolation is difficult to
assess. We present an AI model that not only achieves cutting-edge precision
for $E_b$, but does so in an interpretable manner. For example, we find (and
explain why) that the most important dimensions of its internal representation
form a double helix, where the analog of the hydrogen bonds in DNA here link
the number of protons and neutrons found in the most stable nucleus of each
isotopic chain. Furthermore, we show that the AI prediction of $E_b$ can be
factorized and ordered hierarchically, with the most important terms
corresponding to well-known symbolic models (such as the famous liquid drop).
Remarkably, the improvement of the AI model over symbolic ones can almost
entirely be attributed to an observation made by Jaffe in 1969. The end result
is a fully interpretable data-driven model of nuclear masses.

Method: The Neutone SDK simplifies deployment by providing tools to manage variable buffer sizes, sample rate conversion, delay compensation, and control parameter handling, packaged into a model-agnostic interface accessible in Python.

Result: The SDK demonstrates versatility by enabling applications like audio effect emulation, timbre transfer, and sample generation, and has been adopted by researchers, educators, companies, and artists.

Conclusion: Neutone SDK effectively bridges the gap between deep learning-based neural audio processing and DAW integration, providing a user-friendly and adaptable solution for real-time and offline audio applications.

Abstract: Neural audio processing has unlocked novel methods of sound transformation
and synthesis, yet integrating deep learning models into digital audio
workstations (DAWs) remains challenging due to real-time / neural network
inference constraints and the complexities of plugin development. In this
paper, we introduce the Neutone SDK: an open source framework that streamlines
the deployment of PyTorch-based neural audio models for both real-time and
offline applications. By encapsulating common challenges such as variable
buffer sizes, sample rate conversion, delay compensation, and control parameter
handling within a unified, model-agnostic interface, our framework enables
seamless interoperability between neural models and host plugins while allowing
users to work entirely in Python. We provide a technical overview of the
interfaces needed to accomplish this, as well as the corresponding SDK
implementations. We also demonstrate the SDK's versatility across applications
such as audio effect emulation, timbre transfer, and sample generation, as well
as its adoption by researchers, educators, companies, and artists alike. The

### [308] [Fine-grained Video Dubbing Duration Alignment with Segment Supervised Preference Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08550)
*Chaoqun Cui,Liangbin Huang,Shijing Wang,Zhe Tong,Zhaolong Huang,Xiao Zeng,Xiaofeng Liu*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Segment Supervised Preference Optimization (SSPO) method to address audio-video synchronization issues in video dubbing caused by mismatched speech duration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional video dubbing faces significant issues due to mismatches in speech duration between the source and target languages, leading to poor viewer experience.

Method: The authors propose SSPO, which uses a segment-wise sampling strategy and a fine-grained loss to optimize and align the duration of source and target speech.

Result: Experimental results indicate that SSPO successfully reduces duration mismatches and delivers improved performance in video dubbing alignment.

Conclusion: The SSPO method significantly enhances the synchronization of audio and video in video dubbing, addressing a key challenge caused by differing information densities in languages.

Abstract: Video dubbing aims to translate original speech in visual media programs from
the source language to the target language, relying on neural machine
translation and text-to-speech technologies. Due to varying information
densities across languages, target speech often mismatches the source speech
duration, causing audio-video synchronization issues that significantly impact
viewer experience. In this study, we approach duration alignment in LLM-based
video dubbing machine translation as a preference optimization problem. We
propose the Segment Supervised Preference Optimization (SSPO) method, which
employs a segment-wise sampling strategy and fine-grained loss to mitigate
duration mismatches between source and target lines. Experimental results
demonstrate that SSPO achieves superior performance in duration alignment
tasks.

*Kuan-Tang Huang,Li-Wei Chen,Hung-Shin Lee,Berlin Chen,Hsin-Min Wang*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper addresses how channel variations harm ASR model performance and proposes a normalization technique to improve robustness on unseen channels and languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pre-trained ASR models struggle with degraded performance when audio inputs come from different recording channels, a weakness needing improvement.

Method: The authors introduce a normalization technique aligning internal ASR model features to those from a clean reference recording, mitigating channel variation effects.

Result: The proposed method significantly enhances ASR performance on new channels and languages, demonstrating strong generalization capabilities.

Conclusion: The normalization approach effectively reduces challenges caused by channel and language variations in ASR systems, improving their robustness and generalization.

Abstract: Pre-trained automatic speech recognition (ASR) models have demonstrated
strong performance on a variety of tasks. However, their performance can
degrade substantially when the input audio comes from different recording
channels. While previous studies have demonstrated this phenomenon, it is often
attributed to the mismatch between training and testing corpora. This study
argues that variations in speech characteristics caused by different recording
channels can fundamentally harm ASR performance. To address this limitation, we
propose a normalization technique designed to mitigate the impact of channel
variation by aligning internal feature representations in the ASR model with
those derived from a clean reference channel. This approach significantly
improves ASR performance on previously unseen channels and languages,
highlighting its ability to generalize across channel and language differences.

*Alexandrine Fortier,Sonal Joshi,Thomas Thebaud,Jesus Villalba Lopez,Najim Dehak,Patrick Cardinal*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper proposes a multi-target backdoor attack on speaker identification and verification systems using clicking sounds as triggers, achieving high success rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the stealth and effectiveness of backdoor attacks against speaker identification and verification systems while targeting multiple individuals simultaneously.

Method: A novel method using position-independent clicking sound triggers is developed to perform multi-target backdoor attacks. The attack is designed to work under varied signal-to-noise ratios and leverages cosine similarity for speaker verification tasks.

Result: The attack achieved success rates up to 95.04% for speaker identification and up to 90% for speaker verification when target and enrolled speakers have high similarity.

Conclusion: The technique demonstrates the feasibility and effectiveness of multi-target backdoor attacks in realistic conditions, emphasizing the trade-off between stealth and efficacy.

Abstract: In this work, we propose a multi-target backdoor attack against speaker
identification using position-independent clicking sounds as triggers. Unlike
previous single-target approaches, our method targets up to 50 speakers
simultaneously, achieving success rates of up to 95.04%. To simulate more
realistic attack conditions, we vary the signal-to-noise ratio between speech
and trigger, demonstrating a trade-off between stealth and effectiveness. We
further extend the attack to the speaker verification task by selecting the
most similar training speaker - based on cosine similarity - as the target. The
attack is most effective when target and enrolled speaker pairs are highly
similar, reaching success rates of up to 90% in such cases.

*Yahya Sherif Solayman Mohamed Saleh,Ahmed Mohammed Dabbous,Lama Alkhaled,Hum Yan Chai,Muhammad Ehsan Rana,Hamam Mokayed*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: This paper aims to improve the accuracy of COVID-19 detection through cough analysis by synthesizing data using ACGAN to augment training datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this paper is to address the challenge of data scarcity during health crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, for building reliable ML models in healthcare.

Method: The paper employs an Auxiliary Classification GAN (ACGAN) to generate synthetic Mel spectrograms of healthy and COVID-19 coughs. These synthetic data augment the training set for a CNN classifier.

Result: Using synthetic data, the CNN classifier's test accuracy improved from 72% to 75%.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that synthetic data can enhance the performance of ML models in detecting COVID-19 through cough analysis and discusses strategies for handling inconsistencies in training data.

Abstract: One of the fastest-growing domains in AI is healthcare. Given its importance,
it has been the interest of many researchers to deploy ML models into the
ever-demanding healthcare domain to aid doctors and increase accessibility.
Delivering reliable models, however, demands a sizable amount of data, and the
recent COVID-19 pandemic served as a reminder of the rampant and scary nature
of healthcare that makes training models difficult. To alleviate such scarcity,
many published works attempted to synthesize radiological cough data to train
better COVID-19 detection models on the respective radiological data. To
accommodate the time sensitivity expected during a pandemic, this work focuses
on detecting COVID-19 through coughs using synthetic data to improve the
accuracy of the classifier. The work begins by training a CNN on a balanced
subset of the Coughvid dataset, establishing a baseline classification test
accuracy of 72%. The paper demonstrates how an Auxiliary Classification GAN
(ACGAN) may be trained to conditionally generate novel synthetic Mel
Spectrograms of both healthy and COVID-19 coughs. These coughs are used to
augment the training dataset of the CNN classifier, allowing it to reach a new
test accuracy of 75%. The work highlights the expected messiness and
inconsistency in training and offers insights into detecting and handling such
shortcomings.

### [312] [QAMRO: Quality-aware Adaptive Margin Ranking Optimization for Human-aligned Assessment of Audio Generation Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08957)
*Chien-Chun Wang,Kuan-Tang Huang,Cheng-Yeh Yang,Hung-Shin Lee,Hsin-Min Wang,Berlin Chen*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: This paper proposes QAMRO, a novel framework to enhance the evaluation of audio generation systems by addressing limitations in existing mean opinion score (MOS) regression approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluation methods for audio generation systems fail to capture the relative and multi-dimensional aspects of human perceptual judgment, leading to suboptimal alignment with human evaluations.

Method: The proposed QAMRO framework implements Quality-aware Adaptive Margin Ranking Optimization, incorporating regression objectives that highlight perceptual differences, and leverages pre-trained audio-text models like CLAP and Audiobox-Aesthetics.

Result: QAMRO demonstrates superior alignment with human evaluations across all dimensions and significantly outperforms existing strong baseline models.

Conclusion: QAMRO effectively addresses the shortcomings of traditional MOS prediction methodologies, providing a more accurate and perceptually-relevant evaluation framework for audio generation systems.

Abstract: Evaluating audio generation systems, including text-to-music (TTM),
text-to-speech (TTS), and text-to-audio (TTA), remains challenging due to the
subjective and multi-dimensional nature of human perception. Existing methods
treat mean opinion score (MOS) prediction as a regression problem, but standard
regression losses overlook the relativity of perceptual judgments. To address
this limitation, we introduce QAMRO, a novel Quality-aware Adaptive Margin
Ranking Optimization framework that seamlessly integrates regression objectives
from different perspectives, aiming to highlight perceptual differences and
prioritize accurate ratings. Our framework leverages pre-trained audio-text
models such as CLAP and Audiobox-Aesthetics, and is trained exclusively on the
official AudioMOS Challenge 2025 dataset. It demonstrates superior alignment
with human evaluations across all dimensions, significantly outperforming
robust baseline models.

### [313] [Opening Musical Creativity? Embedded Ideologies in Generative-AI Music Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08805)
*Liam Pram,Fabio Morreale*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper examines claims of 'democratization' in generative-AI music systems (AIVA, Stable Audio, Suno, Udio) and reveals incongruities between marketed inclusivity and actual ideological practices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the ideologies driving the development and adoption of generative-AI music systems, particularly the rhetoric of democratization.

Method: The study employs a combination of autoethnography and digital ethnography to analyze divergences between promotional claims and functionality of AI music systems.

Result: The analysis maps a shared ideology—individualist, globalist, techno-liberal, and ethically evasive—among both creators and users of AI music systems, which obfuscates responsibility and reframes musical practices to fit generative outputs.

Conclusion: Current generative-AI systems' marketed inclusivity is undermined by ideologies that prioritize technological outputs over genuine democratization, reshaping the nature of music-making in ethically questionable ways.

Abstract: AI systems for music generation are increasingly common and easy to use,
granting people without any musical background the ability to create music.
Because of this, generative-AI has been marketed and celebrated as a means of
democratizing music making. However, inclusivity often functions as marketable
rhetoric rather than a genuine guiding principle in these industry settings. In
this paper, we look at four generative-AI music making systems available to the
public as of mid-2025 (AIVA, Stable Audio, Suno, and Udio) and track how they
are rhetoricized by their developers, and received by users. Our aim is to
investigate ideologies that are driving the early-stage development and
adoption of generative-AI in music making, with a particular focus on
democratization. A combination of autoethnography and digital ethnography is
used to examine patterns and incongruities in rhetoric when positioned against
product functionality. The results are then collated to develop a nuanced,
contextual discussion. The shared ideology we map between producers and
consumers is individualist, globalist, techno-liberal, and ethically evasive.
It is a 'total ideology' which obfuscates individual responsibility, and
through which the nature of music and musical practice is transfigured to suit
generative outcomes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation lies in improving the efficiency of π computation by discovering new Machin-like arctangent relations with low Lehmer measures.

Method: A combination of the PSLQ integer-relation algorithm and number-theoretic filters based on Gaussian integer algebra was used for large-scale searches. Additionally, algorithmic extensions were employed to generate longer formulae.

Result: The approach discovered new 5 and 6-term relations with record-low Lehmer measures of 1.4572 and 1.3291.

Conclusion: The framework provides an effective technique for discovering efficient π computation formulas and enables further exploration through a combination of constrained searches and algorithmic extensions.

Abstract: Machin-like arctangent relations are classical tools for computing $\pi$,
with efficiency quantified by the Lehmer measure ($\lambda$). We present a
framework for discovering low-measure relations by coupling the PSLQ
integer-relation algorithm with number-theoretic filters derived from the
algebraic structure of Gaussian integers, making large scale search tractable.
Our search yields new 5 and 6 term relations with record-low Lehmer measures
($\lambda=1.4572, \lambda=1.3291$). We also demonstrate how discovered
relations can serve as a basis for generating new, longer formulae through
algorithmic extensions. This combined approach of a constrained PSLQ search and
algorithmic extension provides a robust method for future explorations.

Main category: cs.CG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a pre-simplification strategy to reduce memory overhead in distributed hierarchical contour trees for scalable scientific data analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods using contour trees for large-scale scientific datasets face challenges with memory usage and scalability, especially with advanced analytical tasks.

Method: The proposed approach involves a pre-simplification strategy tailored for distributed hierarchical contour trees to alleviate memory consumption during analytical tasks.

Result: The method enabled the construction of the largest known contour tree with over half a trillion nodes in under 15 minutes on a 550 billion-element dataset, demonstrating improved scalability.

Conclusion: Pre-simplification significantly improves memory efficiency, making large-scale analysis of scientific datasets computationally feasible with distributed contour tree methods.

Abstract: Contour trees offer an abstract representation of the level set topology in
scalar fields and are widely used in topological data analysis and
visualization. However, applying contour trees to large-scale scientific
datasets remains challenging due to scalability limitations. Recent
developments in distributed hierarchical contour trees have addressed these
challenges by enabling scalable computation across distributed systems.
Building on these structures, advanced analytical tasks -- such as volumetric
branch decomposition and contour extraction -- have been introduced to
facilitate large-scale scientific analysis. Despite these advancements, such
analytical tasks substantially increase memory usage, which hampers
scalability. In this paper, we propose a pre-simplification strategy to
significantly reduce the memory overhead associated with analytical tasks on
distributed hierarchical contour trees. We demonstrate enhanced scalability
through strong scaling experiments, constructing the largest known contour tree
-- comprising over half a trillion nodes with complex topology -- in under 15
minutes on a dataset containing 550 billion elements.

Main category: cs.CG

TL;DR: The paper addresses irregular cutting and packing (C&P) problems by introducing a collision detection engine (CDE) to separate geometric challenges from optimization tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To simplify and advance irregular C&P optimization problems by decoupling the geometric determination from the optimization challenge.

Method: The authors propose core principles for a generalized CDE design and provide an open-source implementation named $	exttt{jagua-rs}$.

Result: The resulting CDE abstracts geometry challenges, enabling focus on optimization and supporting advancements across optimization algorithms.

Conclusion: The developed CDE, along with its implementation, is set to act as a solid foundation and encourage future progress in irregular C&P problems.

Abstract: Addressing irregular cutting and packing (C&P) optimization problems poses
two distinct challenges: the geometric challenge of determining whether or not
an item can be placed feasibly at a certain position, and the optimization
challenge of finding a good solution according to some objective function.
Until now, those tackling such problems have had to address both challenges
simultaneously, requiring two distinct sets of expertise and a lot of research
& development effort. One way to lower this barrier is to decouple the two
challenges. In this paper we introduce a powerful collision detection engine
(CDE) for 2D irregular C&P problems which assumes full responsibility for the
geometric challenge. The CDE (i) allows users to focus with full confidence on
their optimization challenge by abstracting geometry away and (ii) enables
independent advances to propagate to all optimization algorithms built atop it.
We present a set of core principles and design philosophies to model a general
and adaptable CDE focused on maximizing performance, accuracy and robustness.
These principles are accompanied by a concrete open-source implementation
called $\texttt{jagua-rs}$. This paper together with its implementation serves
as a catalyst for future advances in irregular C&P problems by providing a
solid foundation which can either be used as it currently exists or be further
improved upon.

TL;DR: The paper explores emergent properties in systems where the whole exhibits characteristics beyond its individual components. It details their traits, theoretical understanding, and practical significance across sciences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address and understand emergent properties across diverse scientific disciplines and their impact on real-world challenges.

Method: The study explores emergence through the stratification of reality across scales, introduces concepts like effective theories and toy models (e.g., the Ising model), and identifies intermediate mesoscopic scales to connect microscopic and macroscopic phenomena.

Result: Emergent phenomena play pivotal roles in fields like condensed matter physics, neural networks, and social sciences. The paper highlights the theoretical and practical importance of studying emergence.

Conclusion: Adopting an emergent perspective is critical for advancing scientific thought, methodology, and application, with the ultimate goal of designing and controlling emergent properties.

Abstract: Many systems involve numerous interacting parts and the whole system can have
properties that the individual parts do not. I take this novelty as the
defining characteristic of an emergent property. Other characteristics
associated with emergence discussed include universality, order, complexity,
unpredictability, irreducibility, diversity, self-organisation,
discontinuities, and singularities. Emergent phenomena are widespread across
physics, biology, social sciences, and computing, and are central to major
scientific and societal challenges. Understanding emergence involves
considering the stratification of reality across different scales (energy,
time, length, complexity), each with its distinct ontology and epistemology,
leading to semi-autonomous scientific disciplines. A central challenge is
bridging the gap between macroscopic emergent properties and microscopic
component interactions. Identifying an intermediate mesoscopic scale where new,
weakly interacting entities or modular structures emerge is key. Theoretical
approaches, such as effective theories (describing phenomena at a specific
scale) and toy models (simplified systems for analysis), are vital. The Ising
model exemplifies how toy models can elucidate emergence characteristics.
Emergence is central to condensed matter physics, chaotic systems, fluid
dynamics, nuclear physics, quantum gravity, neural networks, protein folding,
and social segregation. An emergent perspective should influence scientific
strategy by shaping research questions, methodologies, priorities, and resource
allocation. An elusive goal is the design and control of emergent properties.

TL;DR: The paper introduces ReQuestNet, a neural network architecture for channel estimation in advanced wireless systems, overcoming key limitations of conventional MMSE solutions and delivering significant improvements in performance across diverse scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Channel estimation in 5G and beyond faces challenges like handling dynamic scenarios (e.g., variable resource blocks and transmit layers) and the limitations of traditional linear MMSE methods. A unified, more efficient model to address these challenges is needed.

Method: The authors propose ReQuestNet, composed of CoarseNet and RefinementNet, which perform initial channel estimation and refine it by leveraging inter-PRG and cross-MIMO correlations. It accommodates dynamic configurations and simplifies the CE pipeline.

Result: Simulation experiments show that ReQuestNet outperforms genie MMSE solutions, achieving up to 10dB gain at high SNRs and generalizing well to unseen channel conditions.

Conclusion: ReQuestNet is an effective and versatile solution for channel estimation, offering enhanced performance and adaptability compared to legacy MMSE techniques, making it suitable for future wireless communication systems.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel neural architecture for channel estimation
(CE) in 5G and beyond, the Recurrent Equivariant UERS Estimation Network
(ReQuestNet). It incorporates several practical considerations in wireless
communication systems, such as ability to handle variable number of resource
block (RB), dynamic number of transmit layers, physical resource block groups
(PRGs) bundling size (BS), demodulation reference signal (DMRS) patterns with a
single unified model, thereby, drastically simplifying the CE pipeline. Besides
it addresses several limitations of the legacy linear MMSE solutions, for
example, by being independent of other reference signals and particularly by
jointly processing MIMO layers and differently precoded channels with unknown
precoding at the receiver. ReQuestNet comprises of two sub-units, CoarseNet
followed by RefinementNet. CoarseNet performs per PRG, per transmit-receive
(Tx-Rx) stream channel estimation, while RefinementNet refines the CoarseNet
channel estimate by incorporating correlations across differently precoded
PRGs, and correlation across multiple input multiple output (MIMO) channel
spatial dimensions (cross-MIMO). Simulation results demonstrate that ReQuestNet
significantly outperforms genie minimum mean squared error (MMSE) CE across a
wide range of channel conditions, delay-Doppler profiles, achieving up to 10dB
gain at high SNRs. Notably, ReQuestNet generalizes effectively to unseen
channel profiles, efficiently exploiting inter-PRG and cross-MIMO correlations
under dynamic PRG BS and varying transmit layer allocations.

Conclusion: Multimodal sensor integration can significantly improve real-time tissue boundary delineation in surgical applications, offering a scalable solution for advancing sensor fusion technology in this field.

Abstract: Robot-assisted neurological surgery is receiving growing interest due to the
improved dexterity, precision, and control of surgical tools, which results in
better patient outcomes. However, such systems often limit surgeons' natural
sensory feedback, which is crucial in identifying tissues -- particularly in
oncological procedures where distinguishing between healthy and tumorous tissue
is vital. While imaging and force sensing have addressed the lack of sensory
feedback, limited research has explored multimodal sensing options for accurate
tissue boundary delineation. We present a user-friendly, modular test bench
designed to evaluate and integrate complementary multimodal sensors for tissue
identification. Our proposed system first uses vision-based guidance to
estimate boundary locations with visual cues, which are then refined using data
acquired by contact microphones and a force sensor. Real-time data acquisition
and visualization are supported via an interactive graphical interface.
Experimental results demonstrate that multimodal fusion significantly improves
material classification accuracy. The platform provides a scalable
hardware-software solution for exploring sensor fusion in surgical applications
and demonstrates the potential of multimodal approaches in real-time tissue
boundary delineation.

### [321] [Evaluating Imputation Techniques for Short-Term Gaps in Heart Rate Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08268)
*Vaibhav Gupta,Maria Maleshkova*

Main category: stat.AP

TL;DR: This study evaluates statistical imputation methods for handling missing heart rate data from wearable devices, focusing on both predictive accuracy and statistical structure metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Imputation techniques for wearable device data often lack robust evaluation frameworks that account for the statistical complexity of physiological signals.

Method: The paper analyzes four imputation techniques—linear interpolation, KNN, PCHIP, and B splines—using predictive accuracy metrics and statistical measures like CDT and JS Distance on specified datasets.

Result: Findings highlight the weaknesses in current imputation methods and the need for improved evaluation methods tailored to physiological signal data.

Conclusion: A foundational framework for developing composite evaluation metrics to better assess imputation performance in heart rate data is proposed.

Abstract: Recent advances in wearable technology have enabled the continuous monitoring
of vital physiological signals, essential for predictive modeling and early
detection of extreme physiological events. Among these physiological signals,
heart rate (HR) plays a central role, as it is widely used in monitoring and
managing cardiovascular conditions and detecting extreme physiological events
such as hypoglycemia. However, data from wearable devices often suffer from
missing values. To address this issue, recent studies have employed various
imputation techniques. Traditionally, the effectiveness of these methods has
been evaluated using predictive accuracy metrics such as RMSE, MAPE, and MAE,
which assess numerical proximity to the original data. While informative, these
metrics fail to capture the complex statistical structure inherent in
physiological signals. This study bridges this gap by presenting a
comprehensive evaluation of four statistical imputation methods, linear
interpolation, K Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Piecewise Cubic Hermite Interpolating
Polynomial (PCHIP), and B splines, for short term HR data gaps. We assess their
performance using both predictive accuracy metrics and statistical distance
measures, including the Cohen Distance Test (CDT) and Jensen Shannon Distance
(JS Distance), applied to HR data from the D1NAMO dataset and the BIG IDEAs Lab
Glycemic Variability and Wearable Device dataset. The analysis reveals
limitations in existing imputation approaches and the absence of a robust
framework for evaluating imputation quality in physiological signals. Finally,
this study proposes a foundational framework to develop a composite evaluation
metric to assess imputation performance.

*Wenqi Jiang*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: This paper focuses on improving the efficiency of modern machine learning systems, with special attention to retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and large-scale recommender systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the increasing complexity of AI systems (e.g., RAG) and the challenge of maintaining efficiency amid diverse hardware and the end of Moore's Law.

Method: The paper employs a cross-stack optimization approach spanning algorithms, systems, and hardware. It includes specific solutions such as PipeRAG, RAGO, and Chameleon for RAG efficiency, FANNS and Falcon for vector search, and MicroRec and FleetRec for recommender systems.

Result: The paper details tangible improvements in computational efficiency across various ML systems, leveraging the proposed methods to reduce bottlenecks related to data movement, computation, and hardware heterogeneity.

Conclusion: This research demonstrates the need for and efficacy of a cross-stack approach to addressing challenges in ML system efficiency, offering practical solutions for modern, vector-centric AI systems.

Abstract: Today, two major trends are shaping the evolution of ML systems. First,
modern AI systems are becoming increasingly complex, often integrating
components beyond the model itself. A notable example is Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG), which incorporates not only multiple models but also vector
databases, leading to heterogeneity in both system components and underlying
hardware. Second, with the end of Moore's Law, achieving high system efficiency
is no longer feasible without accounting for the rapid evolution of the
hardware landscape.
  Building on the observations above, this thesis adopts a cross-stack approach
to improving ML system efficiency, presenting solutions that span algorithms,
systems, and hardware. First, it introduces several pioneering works about RAG
serving efficiency across the computing stack. PipeRAG focuses on
algorithm-level improvements, RAGO introduces system-level optimizations, and
Chameleon explores heterogeneous accelerator systems for RAG. Second, this
thesis investigates algorithm-hardware co-design for vector search.
Specifically, FANNS and Falcon optimize quantization-based and graph-based
vector search, the two most popular paradigms of retrieval algorithms. Third,
this thesis addresses the serving efficiency of recommender systems, another
example of vector-centric ML systems, where the memory-intensive lookup
operations on embedding vector tables often represent a major performance
bottleneck. MicroRec and FleetRec propose solutions at the hardware and system
levels, respectively, optimizing both data movement and computation to enhance
the efficiency of large-scale recommender models.

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: The paper presents 'Tagore,' a GPU-accelerated library for constructing graph indexes like NSG and Vamana, optimizing the approximate nearest neighbor search.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the high indexing overhead and dynamic adjustment demands of graph-based ANNS due to exponential data growth.

Method: Developed GPU-specific algorithm GNN-Descent for k-NN graph initialization and a universal computing procedure (CFS) with specialized GPU kernels. Proposed an indexing framework to handle large datasets beyond GPU memory.

Result: Tagore achieved a speedup of 1.32x to 112.79x across 7 datasets without compromising index quality.

Conclusion: Tagore effectively improves the efficiency of graph-based indexing for ANNS while maintaining accuracy, even with large datasets.

Abstract: Approximate nearest neighbor search (ANNS) in high-dimensional vector spaces
has a wide range of real-world applications. Numerous methods have been
proposed to handle ANNS efficiently, while graph-based indexes have gained
prominence due to their high accuracy and efficiency. However, the indexing
overhead of graph-based indexes remains substantial. With exponential growth in
data volume and increasing demands for dynamic index adjustments, this overhead
continues to escalate, posing a critical challenge. In this paper, we introduce
Tagore, a fast library accelerated by GPUs for graph indexing, which has
powerful capabilities of constructing refinement-based graph indexes such as
NSG and Vamana. We first introduce GNN-Descent, a GPU-specific algorithm for
efficient k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN) graph initialization. GNN-Descent speeds up
the similarity comparison by a two-phase descent procedure and enables highly
parallelized neighbor updates. Next, aiming to support various k-NN graph
pruning strategies, we formulate a universal computing procedure termed CFS and
devise two generalized GPU kernels for parallel processing complex dependencies
in neighbor relationships. For large-scale datasets exceeding GPU memory
capacity, we propose an asynchronous GPU-CPU-disk indexing framework with a
cluster-aware caching mechanism to minimize the I/O pressure on the disk.
Extensive experiments on 7 real-world datasets exhibit that Tagore achieves
1.32x-112.79x speedup while maintaining the index quality.

*Ning Li,Kounianhua Du,Han Zhang,Quan Gan,Minjie Wang,David Wipf,Weinan Zhang*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: The paper introduces SRP, a predictive modeling framework for relational databases, which captures unary and composite dependencies to improve predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Relational databases are heavily utilized, but their rigid structure limits leveraging advanced deep learning methods, leaving certain relational and predictive potentials unexplored.

Method: SRP synthesizes unary dependencies, retrieves composite dependencies, and propagates messages on a graph constructed from the database to extract a broad range of dependency patterns.

Result: Comprehensive experiments on five real-world datasets showcase SRP's effectiveness in improving predictions and its adaptability for industrial applications.

Conclusion: SRP extends the predictive modeling capabilities for relational databases, leveraging both unary and composite dependencies, and it provides actionable insights for improved database analytics.

Abstract: Relational databases (RDBs) have become the industry standard for storing
massive and heterogeneous data. However, despite the widespread use of RDBs
across various fields, the inherent structure of relational databases hinders
their ability to benefit from flourishing deep learning methods. Previous
research has primarily focused on exploiting the unary dependency among
multiple tables in a relational database using the primary key - foreign key
relationships, either joining multiple tables into a single table or
constructing a graph among them, which leaves the implicit composite relations
among different tables and a substantial potential of improvement for
predictive modeling unexplored. In this paper, we propose SRP, a unified
predictive modeling framework that synthesizes features using the unary
dependency, retrieves related information to capture the composite dependency,
and propagates messages across a constructed graph to learn adjacent patterns
for prediction on relation databases. By introducing a new retrieval mechanism
into RDB, SRP is designed to fully capture both the unary and the composite
dependencies within a relational database, thereby enhancing the receptive
field of tabular data prediction. In addition, we conduct a comprehensive
analysis on the components of SRP, offering a nuanced understanding of model
behaviors and practical guidelines for future applications. Extensive
experiments on five real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of SRP
and its potential applicability in industrial scenarios. The code is released

### [325] [E3-Rewrite: Learning to Rewrite SQL for Executability, Equivalence,and Efficiency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09023)
*Dongjie Xu,Yue Cui,Weijie Shi,Qingzhi Ma,Hanghui Guo,Jiaming Li,Yao Zhao,Ruiyuan Zhang,Shimin Di,Jia Zhu,Kai Zheng,Jiajie Xu*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: E3-Rewrite is a novel framework that uses large language models (LLMs) and reinforcement learning to improve SQL query rewriting, achieving substantial benefits in execution efficiency and handling complex queries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses fundamental limitations in traditional rule-based SQL query rewriting methods, which struggle to generalize to novel or complex query patterns and fail to fully capture diverse rewriting strategies.

Method: The proposed framework, E3-Rewrite, employs LLMs for rewriting SQL. It integrates a context construction module to build bottleneck-aware prompts and a reinforcement learning framework with a custom reward function focusing on executability, equivalence, and efficiency through a staged curriculum.

Result: E3-Rewrite achieves up to a 25.6% reduction in query execution time and expands rewrite coverage by up to 24.4% for complex queries compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: E3-Rewrite successfully overcomes the limitations of rule-based approaches by leveraging LLMs and reinforcement learning, demonstrating significant improvements in efficiency and handling complex queries that previous systems struggled with.

Abstract: SQL query rewriting aims to reformulate a query into a more efficient form
while preserving equivalence. Most existing methods rely on predefined rewrite
rules. However, such rule-based approaches face fundamental limitations: (1)
fixed rule sets generalize poorly to novel query patterns and struggle with
complex queries; (2) a wide range of effective rewriting strategies cannot be
fully captured by declarative rules. To overcome these issues, we propose using
large language models (LLMs) to generate rewrites. LLMs can capture complex
strategies, such as evaluation reordering and CTE rewriting. Despite this
potential, directly applying LLMs often results in suboptimal or non-equivalent
rewrites due to a lack of execution awareness and semantic grounding. To
address these challenges, We present E3-Rewrite, an LLM-based SQL rewriting
framework that produces executable, equivalent, and efficient queries. It
integrates two core components: a context construction module and a
reinforcement learning framework. First, the context module leverages execution
plans and retrieved demonstrations to build bottleneck-aware prompts that guide
inference-time rewriting. Second, we design a reward function targeting
executability, equivalence, and efficiency, evaluated via syntax checks,
equivalence verification, and cost estimation. Third, to ensure stable
multi-objective learning, we adopt a staged curriculum that first emphasizes
executability and equivalence, then gradually incorporates efficiency.
Extensive experiments show that E3-Rewrite achieves up to a 25.6\% reduction in
query execution time compared to state-of-the-art methods across multiple SQL
benchmarks. Moreover, it delivers up to 24.4\% more successful rewrites,
expanding coverage to complex queries that previous systems failed to handle.

*Fengran Mo,Yuchen Hui,Yuxing Tian,Zhaoxuan Tan,Chuan Meng,Zhan Su,Kaiyu Huang,Jian-Yun Nie*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: This paper introduces APCIR, a framework that adaptively applies personalization in conversational information retrieval based on query-specific needs, offering enhanced results compared to other approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CIR methods apply a blanket personalization strategy using large language models, which can lead to ineffective personalization for certain queries.

Method: The APCIR framework first assesses the personalization needs of a query, reformulates queries accordingly, and utilizes a personalization-aware ranking fusion to dynamically prioritize reformulated queries.

Result: Experiments on TREC iKAT datasets indicate that APCIR surpasses state-of-the-art techniques in effectiveness.

Conclusion: Adaptive personalization tailored to query-specific requirements can significantly improve conversational information retrieval performance, validating APCIR as an effective approach.

Abstract: Personalized conversational information retrieval (CIR) systems aim to
satisfy users' complex information needs through multi-turn interactions by
considering user profiles. However, not all search queries require
personalization. The challenge lies in appropriately incorporating
personalization elements into search when needed. Most existing studies
implicitly incorporate users' personal information and conversational context
using large language models without distinguishing the specific requirements
for each query turn. Such a ``one-size-fits-all'' personalization strategy
might lead to sub-optimal results. In this paper, we propose an adaptive
personalization method, in which we first identify the required personalization
level for a query and integrate personalized queries with other query
reformulations to produce various enhanced queries. Then, we design a
personalization-aware ranking fusion approach to assign fusion weights
dynamically to different reformulated queries, depending on the required
personalization level. The proposed adaptive personalized conversational
information retrieval framework APCIR is evaluated on two TREC iKAT datasets.
The results confirm the effectiveness of adaptive personalization of APCIR by
outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

### [327] [Generating Query-Relevant Document Summaries via Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08404)
*Nitin Yadav,Changsung Kang,Hongwei Shang,Ming Sun*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper proposes a reinforcement learning-based framework, ReLSum, to generate query-relevant summaries of product descriptions to enhance e-commerce search engine relevance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: E-commerce search engines often rely only on product titles, which lack detail for optimal query intent matching. Product descriptions offer richer content but are too verbose and unsuitable for real-time search ranking.

Method: The study introduces ReLSum, a reinforcement learning framework that generates concise, query-relevant summaries of detailed product descriptions using trainable large language models.

Result: ReLSum improved search relevance, demonstrated through better offline metrics like recall and NDCG, and increased online user engagement metrics.

Conclusion: The proposed framework is a scalable, efficient solution for improving search relevance in large-scale e-commerce search systems by aligning summarization with ranking goals.

Abstract: E-commerce search engines often rely solely on product titles as input for
ranking models with latency constraints. However, this approach can result in
suboptimal relevance predictions, as product titles often lack sufficient
detail to capture query intent. While product descriptions provide richer
information, their verbosity and length make them unsuitable for real-time
ranking, particularly for computationally expensive architectures like
cross-encoder ranking models. To address this challenge, we propose ReLSum, a
novel reinforcement learning framework designed to generate concise,
query-relevant summaries of product descriptions optimized for search
relevance. ReLSum leverages relevance scores as rewards to align the objectives
of summarization and ranking, effectively overcoming limitations of prior
methods, such as misaligned learning targets. The framework employs a trainable
large language model (LLM) to produce summaries, which are then used as input
for a cross-encoder ranking model. Experimental results demonstrate significant
improvements in offline metrics, including recall and NDCG, as well as online
user engagement metrics. ReLSum provides a scalable and efficient solution for
enhancing search relevance in large-scale e-commerce systems.

*Milad Sabouri,Masoud Mansoury,Kun Lin,Bamshad Mobasher*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: This paper introduces LLM-TUP, a method for creating user profiles in recommender systems by combining short-term and long-term preferences using timestamps and language model embeddings, achieving improvements in recommendation accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing user profiling methods often fail to account for the nuanced interaction between short-term and long-term preferences.

Method: The approach involves leveraging large language models to create natural language representations of user histories, encoding those into embeddings via pre-trained BERT, and employing an attention mechanism to fuse temporal user profiles.

Result: LLM-TUP demonstrates significant performance improvements over baselines in various real-world datasets.

Conclusion: LLM-TUP's temporally aware and semantically rich user profiles enhance personalized recommendations in content-based systems.

Abstract: Accurately modeling user preferences is crucial for improving the performance
of content-based recommender systems. Existing approaches often rely on
simplistic user profiling methods, such as averaging or concatenating item
embeddings, which fail to capture the nuanced nature of user preference
dynamics, particularly the interactions between long-term and short-term
preferences. In this work, we propose LLM-driven Temporal User Profiling
(LLM-TUP), a novel method for user profiling that explicitly models short-term
and long-term preferences by leveraging interaction timestamps and generating
natural language representations of user histories using a large language model
(LLM). These representations are encoded into high-dimensional embeddings using
a pre-trained BERT model, and an attention mechanism is applied to dynamically
fuse the short-term and long-term embeddings into a comprehensive user profile.
Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate that LLM-TUP achieves
substantial improvements over several baselines, underscoring the effectiveness
of our temporally aware user-profiling approach and the use of semantically
rich user profiles, generated by LLMs, for personalized content-based
recommendation.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: This paper investigates Large Language Models (LLMs) for creating time-aware, semantically rich user profiles for recommendations by separating short-term and long-term preferences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional user profiling struggles to capture temporal and nuanced user preferences, necessitating better methods, especially for dynamic and evolving environments.

Method: The researchers assess LLMs' ability to model user contexts by disentangling short-term from long-term preferences and dynamically fusing these for user embeddings.

Result: LLMs show promise in dense data domains like Movies&TV but are less effective in sparse environments such as Video Games; user interaction history richness is pivotal to performance.

Conclusion: LLMs hold potential for adaptive, context-aware recommendations; however, their success depends heavily on domain-specific dataset richness and temporal dynamics.

Abstract: Effective recommender systems demand dynamic user understanding, especially
in complex, evolving environments. Traditional user profiling often fails to
capture the nuanced, temporal contextual factors of user preferences, such as
transient short-term interests and enduring long-term tastes. This paper
presents an assessment of Large Language Models (LLMs) for generating
semantically rich, time-aware user profiles. We do not propose a novel
end-to-end recommendation architecture; instead, the core contribution is a
systematic investigation into the degree of LLM effectiveness in capturing the
dynamics of user context by disentangling short-term and long-term preferences.
This approach, framing temporal preferences as dynamic user contexts for
recommendations, adaptively fuses these distinct contextual components into
comprehensive user embeddings. The evaluation across Movies&TV and Video Games
domains suggests that while LLM-generated profiles offer semantic depth and
temporal structure, their effectiveness for context-aware recommendations is
notably contingent on the richness of user interaction histories. Significant
gains are observed in dense domains (e.g., Movies&TV), whereas improvements are
less pronounced in sparse environments (e.g., Video Games). This work
highlights LLMs' nuanced potential in enhancing user profiling for adaptive,
context-aware recommendations, emphasizing the critical role of dataset
characteristics for practical applicability.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: This paper introduces a method using Large Language Models (LLMs) as offline judges to evaluate podcast recommendations effectively. LLMs are guided by natural-language user profiles distilled from listening history to improve interpretability and judgment accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the challenges of evaluating personalized podcast recommendations, where traditional offline metrics suffer from exposure bias and online methods like A/B testing are costly and operationally difficult.

Method: The method includes a two-stage profile-aware framework. First, it creates natural-language user profiles summarizing topical interests and behavioral patterns from 90 days of listening history. These profiles then guide the LLM to make pointwise and pairwise judgments to determine alignment between user preferences and recommended episodes.

Result: In a controlled study with 47 participants, the proposed framework matched human judgments with high fidelity and outperformed or equaled another variant using raw listening histories.

Conclusion: The framework effectively leverages LLMs for scalable and interpretable evaluation of podcast recommendations, enabling efficient iterations and model selection in recommender systems.

Abstract: Evaluating personalized recommendations remains a central challenge,
especially in long-form audio domains like podcasts, where traditional offline
metrics suffer from exposure bias and online methods such as A/B testing are
costly and operationally constrained. In this paper, we propose a novel
framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) as offline judges to
assess the quality of podcast recommendations in a scalable and interpretable
manner. Our two-stage profile-aware approach first constructs natural-language
user profiles distilled from 90 days of listening history. These profiles
summarize both topical interests and behavioral patterns, serving as compact,
interpretable representations of user preferences. Rather than prompting the
LLM with raw data, we use these profiles to provide high-level, semantically
rich context-enabling the LLM to reason more effectively about alignment
between a user's interests and recommended episodes. This reduces input
complexity and improves interpretability. The LLM is then prompted to deliver
fine-grained pointwise and pairwise judgments based on the profile-episode
match. In a controlled study with 47 participants, our profile-aware judge
matched human judgments with high fidelity and outperformed or matched a
variant using raw listening histories. The framework enables efficient,
profile-aware evaluation for iterative testing and model selection in
recommender systems.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: Proposes a novel framework (SPARC) to dynamically model and retrieve user interests, employing RQ-VAE and a probabilistic interest module to improve user engagement and business metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multi-interest retrieval methods lack adaptability to evolving user preferences, fail to explore novel interests, and rely heavily on predefined knowledge.

Method: Introduces SPARC, which employs Residual Quantized Variational Autoencoder (RQ-VAE) for discretized interest space, and a probabilistic interest module for efficient interest discovery and dynamic adaptability.

Result: Achieved measurable gains in online A/B testing on a large industrial platform (e.g., +0.9% user view duration) and showed consistent improvements on offline metrics (e.g., Recall@K) using Amazon Product datasets.

Conclusion: SPARC enhances multi-interest modeling by shifting from passive to proactive interest exploration, demonstrating its practical value and impact in real-world recommendation systems.

Abstract: Modeling multi-interests has arisen as a core problem in real-world RS.
Current multi-interest retrieval methods pose three major challenges: 1)
Interests, typically extracted from predefined external knowledge, are
invariant. Failed to dynamically evolve with users' real-time consumption
preferences. 2) Online inference typically employs an over-exploited strategy,
mainly matching users' existing interests, lacking proactive exploration and
discovery of novel and long-tail interests. To address these challenges, we
propose a novel retrieval framework named SPARC(Soft Probabilistic Adaptive
Retrieval Model via Codebooks). Our contribution is two folds. First, the
framework utilizes Residual Quantized Variational Autoencoder (RQ-VAE) to
construct a discretized interest space. It achieves joint training of the
RQ-VAE with the industrial large scale recommendation model, mining
behavior-aware interests that can perceive user feedback and evolve
dynamically. Secondly, a probabilistic interest module that predicts the
probability distribution over the entire dynamic and discrete interest space.
This facilitates an efficient "soft-search" strategy during online inference,
revolutionizing the retrieval paradigm from "passive matching" to "proactive
exploration" and thereby effectively promoting interest discovery. Online A/B
tests on an industrial platform with tens of millions daily active users, have
achieved substantial gains in business metrics: +0.9% increase in user view
duration, +0.4% increase in user page views (PV), and a +22.7% improvement in
PV500(new content reaching 500 PVs in 24 hours). Offline evaluations are
conducted on open-source Amazon Product datasets. Metrics, such as Recall@K and
Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain@K(NDCG@K), also showed consistent
improvement. Both online and offline experiments validate the efficacy and
practical value of the proposed method.

Motivation: The paper aims to address the gap in evaluating the psychometric quality of AI-generated exam questions in real-world educational settings, recognizing the potential of LLMs in scaling high-quality instruction.

Method: The researchers used an iterative refinement strategy where LLMs generate, critique, and improve exam questions in cycles. They assessed the quality of these questions in a field study across 91 classes in diverse subjects, using item response theory for analysis.

Result: The AI-generated questions performed comparably to expert-created questions for students in the study sample, suggesting comparable psychometric quality.

Conclusion: Iterative LLM-driven question generation can produce high-quality assessments, highlighting the potential of AI to enhance accessibility and quality in education.

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) challenge conventional methods of teaching
and learning, they present an exciting opportunity to improve efficiency and
scale high-quality instruction. One promising application is the generation of
customized exams, tailored to specific course content. There has been
significant recent excitement on automatically generating questions using
artificial intelligence, but also comparatively little work evaluating the
psychometric quality of these items in real-world educational settings. Filling
this gap is an important step toward understanding generative AI's role in
effective test design. In this study, we introduce and evaluate an iterative
refinement strategy for question generation, repeatedly producing, assessing,
and improving questions through cycles of LLM-generated critique and revision.
We evaluate the quality of these AI-generated questions in a large-scale field
study involving 91 classes -- covering computer science, mathematics,
chemistry, and more -- in dozens of colleges across the United States,
comprising nearly 1700 students. Our analysis, based on item response theory
(IRT), suggests that for students in our sample the AI-generated questions
performed comparably to expert-created questions designed for standardized

*Ahmed Tlili*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: This study uses Monster theory to analyze AI's complex nature, likening its perception and development to cultural interpretations of monsters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper explores the conflicting perspectives on AI by using Monster theory, aiming to deepen understanding of AI's inherent complexity and societal effects.

Method: The study applies Monster theory's seven theses to examine AI, drawing parallels between cultural representations of monsters and AI perceptions.

Result: AI is found to be multifaceted, requiring analysis within societal or cultural contexts, akin to the differing interpretations of monsters.

Conclusion: AI parallels monsters in its complex societal representation, suggesting that it cannot be studied in isolation but must be examined in cultural frameworks.

Abstract: With the increasing adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in all fields
and daily activities, a heated debate is found about the advantages and
challenges of AI and the need for navigating the concerns associated with AI to
make the best of it. To contribute to this literature and the ongoing debate
related to it, this study draws on the Monster theory to explain the
conflicting representation of AI. It suggests that studying monsters in popular
culture can provide an in-depth understanding of AI and its monstrous effects.
Specifically, this study aims to discuss AI perception and development through
the seven theses of Monster theory. The obtained results revealed that, just
like monsters, AI is complex in nature, and it should not be studied as a
separate entity but rather within a given society or culture. Similarly,
readers may perceive and interpret AI differently, just as readers may
interpret monsters differently. The relationship between AI and monsters, as
depicted in this study, does not seem to be as odd as it might be at first.

*David-Doron Yaacov*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: The paper proposes a moral reasoning system combining deliberation and intuition, designed for morally complex, high-stakes situations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of moral decision-making in complex and time-constrained scenarios while ensuring alignment with diverse ethical perspectives.

Method: Developing a dual-hybrid system architecture that integrates a deliberative moral reasoning framework with faster, intuitive models, encompassing both universal and culturally specific considerations.

Result: The proposed framework links moral reasoning to action, balancing deep reflection and real-time responsiveness by training intuitive models guided by a deliberative layer.

Conclusion: The system offers a principled approach to moral complexity, enabling morally grounded decisions that accommodate diverse ethical and contextual factors.

Abstract: The conceptual framework proposed in this paper centers on the development of
a deliberative moral reasoning system - one designed to process complex moral
situations by generating, filtering, and weighing normative arguments drawn
from diverse ethical perspectives. While the framework is rooted in Machine
Ethics, it also makes a substantive contribution to Value Alignment by
outlining a system architecture that links structured moral reasoning to action
under time constraints. Grounded in normative moral pluralism, this system is
not constructed to imitate behavior but is built on reason-sensitive
deliberation over structured moral content in a transparent and principled
manner. Beyond its role as a deliberative system, it also serves as the
conceptual foundation for a novel two-level architecture: functioning as a
moral reasoning teacher envisioned to train faster models that support
real-time responsiveness without reproducing the full structure of deliberative
reasoning. Together, the deliberative and intuitive components are designed to
enable both deep reflection and responsive action. A key design feature is the
dual-hybrid structure: a universal layer that defines a moral threshold through
top-down and bottom-up learning, and a local layer that learns to weigh
competing considerations in context while integrating culturally specific
normative content, so long as it remains within the universal threshold. By
extending the notion of moral complexity to include not only conflicting
beliefs but also multifactorial dilemmas, multiple stakeholders, and the
integration of non-moral considerations, the framework aims to support morally
grounded decision-making in realistic, high-stakes contexts.

### [336] [Algorithmic Fairness amid Social Determinants: Reflection, Characterization, and Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08337)
*Zeyu Tang,Alex John London,Atoosa Kasirzadeh,Sanmi Koyejo,Peter Spirtes,Kun Zhang*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: This paper emphasizes the importance of incorporating social determinants, such as regional context, into algorithmic fairness studies rather than focusing solely on sensitive attributes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous works in algorithmic fairness have largely overlooked the role of social determinants, focusing primarily on sensitive attributes. This paper aims to address this gap with a rigorous methodological approach.

Method: The paper uses a region-based analysis with Gamma distribution parameterization to model the impact of social determinants on individual outcomes in the context of college admissions.

Result: The proposed method replicates nuanced insights from prior qualitative research and highlights limitations of current fairness approaches. It suggests mitigation solely focusing on sensitive attributes may lead to new structural injustices.

Conclusion: Incorporating both sensitive attributes and social determinants provides a more holistic understanding of fairness, mitigating risks of structural injustice and ensuring transparent fairness outcomes.

Abstract: Social determinants are variables that, while not directly pertaining to any
specific individual, capture key aspects of contexts and environments that have
direct causal influences on certain attributes of an individual. Previous
algorithmic fairness literature has primarily focused on sensitive attributes,
often overlooking the role of social determinants. Our paper addresses this gap
by introducing formal and quantitative rigor into a space that has been shaped
largely by qualitative proposals regarding the use of social determinants. To
demonstrate theoretical perspectives and practical applicability, we examine a
concrete setting of college admissions, using region as a proxy for social
determinants. Our approach leverages a region-based analysis with Gamma
distribution parameterization to model how social determinants impact
individual outcomes. Despite its simplicity, our method quantitatively recovers
findings that resonate with nuanced insights in previous qualitative debates,
that are often missed by existing algorithmic fairness approaches. Our findings
suggest that mitigation strategies centering solely around sensitive attributes
may introduce new structural injustice when addressing existing discrimination.
Considering both sensitive attributes and social determinants facilitates a
more comprehensive explication of benefits and burdens experienced by
individuals from diverse demographic backgrounds as well as contextual
environments, which is essential for understanding and achieving fairness
effectively and transparently.

*Jennifer Wang,Kayla Huang,Kevin Klyman,Rishi Bommasani*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: This paper evaluates AI companies' adherence to their voluntary commitments to the White House, finding broad variability across companies and recommending improvements for public accountability and transparency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the issue of accountability in international AI governance by examining how AI companies adhere to their self-declared commitments, as voluntary guidelines are increasingly central to this domain.

Method: A rubric was developed to score major AI companies based on their publicly disclosed adherence to eight specific voluntary commitments to the White House in 2023.

Result: OpenAI scores highest at 83%, with the average company score being just 52%. Companies perform particularly poorly on model weight security (average score: 17%), with 11 out of 16 scoring 0%.

Conclusion: To strengthen AI governance, the paper recommends clearer commitment specifications, addressing AI supply chain complexities, and promoting publicly verifiable disclosures to ensure accountability and transparency.

Abstract: Voluntary commitments are central to international AI governance, as
demonstrated by recent voluntary guidelines from the White House to the G7,
from Bletchley Park to Seoul. How do major AI companies make good on their
commitments? We score companies based on their publicly disclosed behavior by
developing a detailed rubric based on their eight voluntary commitments to the
White House in 2023. We find significant heterogeneity: while the
highest-scoring company (OpenAI) scores a 83% overall on our rubric, the
average score across all companies is just 52%. The companies demonstrate
systemically poor performance for their commitment to model weight security
with an average score of 17%: 11 of the 16 companies receive 0% for this
commitment. Our analysis highlights a clear structural shortcoming that future
AI governance initiatives should correct: when companies make public
commitments, they should proactively disclose how they meet their commitments
to provide accountability, and these disclosures should be verifiable. To
advance policymaking on corporate AI governance, we provide three directed
recommendations that address underspecified commitments, the role of complex AI
supply chains, and public transparency that could be applied towards AI
governance initiatives worldwide.

*Vibeke Binz Vallevik,Anne Kjersti C. Befring,Severin Elvatun,Jan Franz Nygaard*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: This paper explores whether synthetic data should be classified as personal data under GDPR, using legal analysis and empirical inference attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address uncertainties under GDPR, which obstruct sharing synthetic data that preserves privacy while advancing AI in healthcare.

Method: The study systematically analyzes legal sources and performs an empirical investigation via inference attacks on synthetic data.

Result: Findings suggest synthetic data can likely be classified as anonymous depending on specific factors, but regulatory uncertainties persist.

Conclusion: The study recommends clearer GDPR regulations to ensure privacy protection without hindering AI-driven healthcare innovation.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to transform healthcare, but
it requires access to health data. Synthetic data that is generated through
machine learning models trained on real data, offers a way to share data while
preserving privacy. However, uncertainties in the practical application of the
General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) create an administrative burden,
limiting the benefits of synthetic data. Through a systematic analysis of
relevant legal sources and an empirical study, this article explores whether
synthetic data should be classified as personal data under the GDPR. The study
investigates the residual identification risk through generating synthetic data
and simulating inference attacks, challenging common perceptions of technical
identification risk. The findings suggest synthetic data is likely anonymous,
depending on certain factors, but highlights uncertainties about what
constitutes reasonably likely risk. To promote innovation, the study calls for
clearer regulations to balance privacy protection with the advancement of AI in
healthcare.

*Avni Kothari,Patrick Vossler,Jean Digitale,Mohammad Forouzannia,Elise Rosenberg,Michele Lee,Jennee Bryant,Melanie Molina,James Marks,Lucas Zier,Jean Feng*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: This study presents a co-design framework for developing LLM-based applications tailored to underserved communities, addressing constraints in communication and domain expertise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the challenges of designing LLM-based applications for underserved communities, especially the disconnect between LLM developers and local experts with limited time/resources.

Method: A co-design framework is proposed that includes decomposing summary generation tasks into attributes and refining/validating them via a multi-tier cascading approach.

Result: The framework enhances LLM applications' accuracy, comprehensiveness, and verifiability by systematically specifying the information to surface to providers.

Conclusion: A novel co-design framework can bridge the gap between LLM developers and domain experts in resource-constrained environments, ensuring meaningful and applicable LLM solutions.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have the potential to address social and
behavioral determinants of health by transforming labor intensive workflows in
resource-constrained settings. Creating LLM-based applications that serve the
needs of underserved communities requires a deep understanding of their local
context, but it is often the case that neither LLMs nor their developers
possess this local expertise, and the experts in these communities often face
severe time/resource constraints. This creates a disconnect: how can one engage
in meaningful co-design of an LLM-based application for an under-resourced
community when the communication channel between the LLM developer and domain
expert is constrained? We explored this question through a real-world case
study, in which our data science team sought to partner with social workers at
a safety net hospital to build an LLM application that summarizes patients'
social needs. Whereas prior works focus on the challenge of prompt tuning, we
found that the most critical challenge in this setting is the careful and
precise specification of \what information to surface to providers so that the
LLM application is accurate, comprehensive, and verifiable. Here we present a
novel co-design framework for settings with limited access to domain experts,
in which the summary generation task is first decomposed into
individually-optimizable attributes and then each attribute is efficiently
refined and validated through a multi-tier cascading approach.

*Mark O. Riedl,Deven R. Desai*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: This paper examines how technical and legal understandings of 'agency' converge and diverge, discussing gaps in AI regarding loyalty and third-party interactions relevant in agency law, and proposes steps for responsible AI agent development.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the technical and socio-legal challenges AI systems face as they become more capable of directly executing tasks on behalf of users.

Method: The paper employs an interdisciplinary approach by correlating technical principles like value-alignment in AI with legal concepts such as implied authority, while identifying gaps concerning disclosure and loyalty.

Result: The authors reveal that while computer science and law overlap in addressing under-specification issues, the CS field has under-theorized loyalty and third-party interactions critical in agency law.

Conclusion: Highlighting these gaps illuminates a path forward for developing and deploying AI agents responsibly, with better alignment to legal norms and societal expectations.

Abstract: As AI becomes more "agentic," it faces technical and socio-legal issues it
must address if it is to fulfill its promise of increased economic productivity
and efficiency. This paper uses technical and legal perspectives to explain how
things change when AI systems start being able to directly execute tasks on
behalf of a user. We show how technical conceptions of agents track some, but
not all, socio-legal conceptions of agency. That is, both computer science and
the law recognize the problems of under-specification for an agent, and both
disciplines have robust conceptions of how to address ensuring an agent does
what the programmer, or in the law, the principal desires and no more. However,
to date, computer science has under-theorized issues related to questions of
loyalty and to third parties that interact with an agent, both of which are
central parts of the law of agency. First, we examine the correlations between
implied authority in agency law and the principle of value-alignment in AI,
wherein AI systems must operate under imperfect objective specification.
Second, we reveal gaps in the current computer science view of agents
pertaining to the legal concepts of disclosure and loyalty, and how failure to
account for them can result in unintended effects in AI ecommerce agents. In
surfacing these gaps, we show a path forward for responsible AI agent
development and deployment.

### [341] [Who pays the RENT? Implications of Spatial Inequality for Prediction-Based Allocation Policies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08573)
*Tasfia Mashiat,Patrick J. Fowler,Sanmay Das*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: This paper explores how spatial inequality impacts the effectiveness of AI-based targeting in allocation policies, proposing the RENT metric to evaluate individual versus neighborhood targeting in preventing evictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address conflicting results in prior research about targeting high-risk individuals in resource allocation and understand spatial inequality's role in these outcomes.

Method: The paper uses a stylized framework based on the Mallows model, introducing the Relative Efficiency of Non-Targeting (RENT) metric, and calibrates these parameters with real eviction court data.

Result: The study finds considerable gains in targeting high-risk households via individual models, even in spatially segregated areas, and reconciles discrepancies in current literature using deployment cost factors and risk concentration characteristics.

Conclusion: Insights from this paper guide the deployment of AI-based solutions that account for spatial inequality and offer tailored approaches in social services like eviction prevention.

Abstract: AI-powered scarce resource allocation policies rely on predictions to target
either specific individuals (e.g., high-risk) or settings (e.g.,
neighborhoods). Recent research on individual-level targeting demonstrates
conflicting results; some models show that targeting is not useful when
inequality is high, while other work demonstrates potential benefits. To study
and reconcile this apparent discrepancy, we develop a stylized framework based
on the Mallows model to understand how the spatial distribution of inequality
affects the effectiveness of door-to-door outreach policies. We introduce the
RENT (Relative Efficiency of Non-Targeting) metric, which we use to assess the
effectiveness of targeting approaches compared with neighborhood-based
approaches in preventing tenant eviction when high-risk households are more
versus less spatially concentrated. We then calibrate the model parameters to
eviction court records collected in a medium-sized city in the USA. Results
demonstrate considerable gains in the number of high-risk households canvassed
through individually targeted policies, even in a highly segregated metro area
with concentrated risks of eviction. We conclude that apparent discrepancies in
the prior literature can be reconciled by considering 1) the source of
deployment costs and 2) the observed versus modeled concentrations of risk. Our
results inform the deployment of AI-based solutions in social service provision
that account for particular applications and geographies.

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: The paper investigates the cybersecurity vulnerabilities of Educational Large Language Models (eLLMs) by categorizing fifty attacks and assessing their severity using the DREAD framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into education offers efficiency and productivity gains but poses significant cybersecurity risks.

Method: The study develops a taxonomy of fifty attacks on eLLMs, categorizing them as targeting either the model or its infrastructure, and evaluates their impact using the DREAD risk assessment framework.

Result: Critical vulnerabilities identified include token smuggling, adversarial prompts, direct injection, and multi-step jailbreak, which are deemed high-risk for the educational sector.

Conclusion: The paper provides a taxonomy of attacks and a risk assessment framework to guide academic and industry professionals in creating secure eLLM environments.

Abstract: Due to perceptions of efficiency and significant productivity gains, various
organisations, including in education, are adopting Large Language Models
(LLMs) into their workflows. Educator-facing, learner-facing, and
institution-facing LLMs, collectively, Educational Large Language Models
(eLLMs), complement and enhance the effectiveness of teaching, learning, and
academic operations. However, their integration into an educational setting
raises significant cybersecurity concerns. A comprehensive landscape of
contemporary attacks on LLMs and their impact on the educational environment is
missing. This study presents a generalised taxonomy of fifty attacks on LLMs,
which are categorized as attacks targeting either models or their
infrastructure. The severity of these attacks is evaluated in the educational
sector using the DREAD risk assessment framework. Our risk assessment indicates
that token smuggling, adversarial prompts, direct injection, and multi-step
jailbreak are critical attacks on eLLMs. The proposed taxonomy, its application
in the educational environment, and our risk assessment will help academic and
industrial practitioners to build resilient solutions that protect learners and
institutions.

*Ziyi Guo,Yan Wang*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: The paper presents Urban-STA4CLC, a theory-guided spatio-temporal model, to predict post-disaster commercial land use changes, achieving a 19% improvement in F1 score.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the need for better modeling to capture the complex interactions between human activity and commercial land use changes driven by natural disasters.

Method: The Urban-STA4CLC integrates spatio-temporal attention mechanisms informed by urban theories, including resilience theory, spatial economic theory, and diffusion theory.

Result: The model achieves a 19% improvement in F1 score, demonstrating better prediction of commercial land use changes under recurrent disasters compared to non-theory-based baselines.

Conclusion: Incorporating urban theory significantly enhances commercial land use change modeling, contributing to disaster-resilient urban planning and land use research.

Abstract: Natural disasters such as hurricanes and wildfires increasingly introduce
unusual disturbance on economic activities, which are especially likely to
reshape commercial land use pattern given their sensitive to customer
visitation. However, current modeling approaches are limited in capturing such
complex interplay between human activities and commercial land use change under
and following disturbances. Such interactions have been more effectively
captured in current resilient urban planning theories. This study designs and
calibrates a Urban Theory-Informed Spatio-Temporal Attention Model for
Predicting Post-Disaster Commercial Land Use Change (Urban-STA4CLC) to predict
both the yearly decline and expansion of commercial land use at census block
level under cumulative impact of disasters on human activities over two years.
Guided by urban theories, Urban-STA4CLC integrates both spatial and temporal
attention mechanisms with three theory-informed modules. Resilience theory
guides a disaster-aware temporal attention module that captures visitation
dynamics. Spatial economic theory informs a multi-relational spatial attention
module for inter-block representation. Diffusion theory contributes a
regularization term that constrains land use transitions. The model performs
significantly better than non-theoretical baselines in predicting commercial
land use change under the scenario of recurrent hurricanes, with around 19%
improvement in F1 score (0.8763). The effectiveness of the theory-guided
modules was further validated through ablation studies. The research
demonstrates that embedding urban theory into commercial land use modeling
models may substantially enhance the capacity to capture its gains and losses.
These advances in commercial land use modeling contribute to land use research
that accounts for cumulative impacts of recurrent disasters and shifts in
economic activity patterns.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if large language models (LLMs) can effectively support privacy professionals in areas such as regulatory compliance, privacy management, and AI governance.

Method: The study benchmarks ten LLMs from companies like OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google using official IAPP certification exams (CIPP/US, CIPM, CIPT, AIGP) in a closed-book format and compares results to human passing thresholds.

Result: Models such as OpenAI’s GPT-5 and Gemini 2.5 Pro consistently exceeded professional human certification standards, showcasing strong capabilities in privacy law, technical controls, and AI governance.

Conclusion: LLMs exhibit noteworthy strengths in high-stakes data governance roles, but their domain-specific limitations should be considered; the study offers practical insights for integrating these tools into professional contexts.

Abstract: The rapid emergence of large language models (LLMs) has raised urgent
questions across the modern workforce about this new technology's strengths,
weaknesses, and capabilities. For privacy professionals, the question is
whether these AI systems can provide reliable support on regulatory compliance,
privacy program management, and AI governance. In this study, we evaluate ten
leading open and closed LLMs, including models from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google
DeepMind, Meta, and DeepSeek, by benchmarking their performance on
industry-standard certification exams: CIPP/US, CIPM, CIPT, and AIGP from the
International Association of Privacy Professionals (IAPP). Each model was
tested using official sample exams in a closed-book setting and compared to
IAPP's passing thresholds. Our findings show that several frontier models such
as Gemini 2.5 Pro and OpenAI's GPT-5 consistently achieve scores exceeding the
standards for professional human certification - demonstrating substantial
expertise in privacy law, technical controls, and AI governance. The results
highlight both the strengths and domain-specific gaps of current LLMs and offer
practical insights for privacy officers, compliance leads, and technologists
assessing the readiness of AI tools for high-stakes data governance roles. This
paper provides an overview for professionals navigating the intersection of AI
advancement and regulatory risk and establishes a machine benchmark based on

TL;DR: The paper examines a temporal voting model focusing on public chores and analyzes the computational challenges of optimizing welfare measures, with an emphasis on fairness and strategic agent behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to study the challenges and solutions in optimizing social welfare in scenarios involving public projects that have societal benefits but impose individual costs.

Method: The paper explores the computational complexity of optimizing utilitarian and egalitarian welfare, analyzes fairness measures, investigates strategic agent behaviors, and assesses the effectiveness of online algorithms in this setting.

Result: While optimizing utilitarian welfare is computationally simple, minimizing egalitarian welfare is computationally hard, with exceptions identified for specific cases where efficient solutions or approximations are found.

Conclusion: The paper provides insights into computational challenges, fairness measures, and strategic behaviors in dynamic public decision-making, offering both theoretical and practical implications.

Abstract: We study a temporal voting model where voters have dynamic preferences over a
set of public chores -- projects that benefit society, but impose individual
costs on those affected by their implementation. We investigate the
computational complexity of optimizing utilitarian and egalitarian welfare. Our
results show that while optimizing the former is computationally
straightforward, minimizing the latter is computationally intractable, even in
very restricted cases. Nevertheless, we identify several settings where this
problem can be solved efficiently, either exactly or by an approximation
algorithm. We also examine the effects of enforcing temporal fairness and its
impact on social welfare, and analyze the competitive ratio of online
algorithms. We then explore the strategic behavior of agents, providing
insights into potential malfeasance in such decision-making environments.
Finally, we discuss a range of fairness measures and their suitability for our
setting.

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: EGGCodec is a novel neural framework designed for reconstructing EGG signals and extracting F0 with improved accuracy and efficiency, outperforming prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address limitations in conventional F0 extraction methods by directly leveraging reconstructed EGG signals instead of extracted features, improving accuracy and efficiency.

Method: EGGCodec utilizes multi-scale frequency-domain and time-domain correlation loss functions, removes the GAN discriminator from training, and applies extensive evaluations on an EGG-inclusive dataset.

Result: EGGCodec demonstrated superior performance over state-of-the-art methods, reducing MAE in F0 extraction and significantly improving VDE metrics.

Conclusion: EGGCodec proves to be an efficient and improved framework for EGG signal reconstruction and F0 extraction, validated through extensive ablation experiments.

Abstract: This letter introduces EGGCodec, a robust neural Encodec framework engineered
for electroglottography (EGG) signal reconstruction and F0 extraction. We
propose a multi-scale frequency-domain loss function to capture the nuanced
relationship between original and reconstructed EGG signals, complemented by a
time-domain correlation loss to improve generalization and accuracy. Unlike
conventional Encodec models that extract F0 directly from features, EGGCodec
leverages reconstructed EGG signals, which more closely correspond to F0. By
removing the conventional GAN discriminator, we streamline EGGCodec's training
process without compromising efficiency, incurring only negligible performance
degradation. Trained on a widely used EGG-inclusive dataset, extensive
evaluations demonstrate that EGGCodec outperforms state-of-the-art F0
extraction schemes, reducing mean absolute error (MAE) from 14.14 Hz to 13.69
Hz, and improving voicing decision error (VDE) by 38.2\%. Moreover, extensive
ablation experiments validate the contribution of each component of EGGCodec.

Main category: cs.DS

TL;DR: The paper introduces a deterministic compiler that ensures any computation in the Congested Clique model is robust against adversarial crash faults. Using locally-decodable codes (LDCs), the method achieves fault tolerance while maintaining low complexity overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Building robust algorithms for the Congested Clique model that can efficiently handle adversarial crash faults while preserving computation properties and scalability.

Method: Using locally-decodable codes (LDCs), the authors design a compiler that encodes data across the network, derandomizes query sets to avoid erasures, and employs an adaptive doubling strategy when decoding attempts face adversarial crashes.

Result: The compiler allows computations in the faulty Congested Clique model to be completed with a polynomial overhead concerning the resilience to node crashes and low communication complexity.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates that classical locally-decodable code constructions can be adapted for adversarial crash fault scenarios, ensuring resilient and efficient distributed computations in the Congested Clique model.

Abstract: We design a deterministic compiler that makes any computation in the
Congested Clique model robust to a constant fraction $\alpha<1$ of adversarial
crash faults. In particular, we show how a network of $n$ nodes can compute any
circuit of depth $d$, width $\omega$, and gate total fan $\Delta$, in
$d\cdot\lceil\frac{\omega}{n^2}+\frac{\Delta}{n}\rceil\cdot
2^{O(\sqrt{\log{n}}\log\log{n})}$ rounds in such a faulty model. As a
corollary, any $T$-round Congested Clique algorithm can be compiled into an
algorithm that completes in $T^2 n^{o(1)}$ rounds in this model.
  Our compiler obtains resilience to node crashes by coding information across
the network, where we leverage locally-decodable codes (LDCs) to maintain a low
complexity overhead, as these allow recovering the information needed at each
computational step by querying only small parts of the codeword.
  The main technical contribution is that because erasures occur in known
locations, which correspond to crashed nodes, we can derandomize classical LDC
constructions by deterministically selecting query sets that avoid sufficiently
many erasures. Moreover, when decoding multiple codewords in parallel, our
derandomization load-balances the queries per-node, thereby preventing
congestion and maintaining a low round complexity.
  Deterministic decoding of LDCs presents a new challenge: the adversary can
target precisely the (few) nodes that are queried for decoding a certain
codeword. We overcome this issue via an adaptive doubling strategy: if a
decoding attempt for a codeword fails, the node doubles the number of its
decoding attempts. Similarly, when the adversary crashes the decoding node
itself, we replace it dynamically with two other non-crashed nodes. By
carefully combining these two doubling processes, we overcome the challenges
posed by the combination of a deterministic LDC with a worst case pattern of
crashes.

*Jiarong Xing,Yifan Qiao,Simon Mo,Xingqi Cui,Gur-Eyal Sela,Yang Zhou,Joseph Gonzalez,Ion Stoica*

Main category: cs.OS

TL;DR: The paper argues for transitioning GPUs from singletasking to multitasking to meet modern AI demands, suggesting the need for a resource management layer similar to a CPU OS.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current GPU singletasking is inefficient and unsustainable for growing hardware and diverse modern AI workloads. GPUs must transition to multitasking to stay relevant.

Method: The authors analyze key requirements for GPU multitasking, evaluate past approaches, and propose a resource management framework akin to a CPU operating system.

Result: The paper identifies challenges in adopting GPU multitasking and proposes potential solutions for resource sharing and management.

Conclusion: For GPUs to align with modern workflows, transitioning to multitasking via a robust resource management system is essential and should drive future research efforts.

Abstract: GPU singletasking is becoming increasingly inefficient and unsustainable as
hardware capabilities grow and workloads diversify. We are now at an inflection
point where GPUs must embrace multitasking, much like CPUs did decades ago, to
meet the demands of modern AI workloads. In this work, we highlight the key
requirements for GPU multitasking, examine prior efforts, and discuss why they
fall short. To advance toward efficient and practical GPU multitasking, we
envision a resource management layer, analogous to a CPU operating system, to
handle various aspects of GPU resource management and sharing. We outline the
challenges and potential solutions, and hope this paper inspires broader
community efforts to build the next-generation GPU compute paradigm grounded in
multitasking.

*Zhuohan Wang,Carmine Ventre*

Main category: q-fin.TR

TL;DR: The paper introduces DiffVolume, a conditional diffusion model for realistic and controllable generation of limit order book (LOB) volume snapshots, outperforming previous methods in realism, counterfactual generation, and improving downstream liquidity forecasting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding and modeling limit order book dynamics is key to market microstructure research, where generating high-dimensional LOB volume snapshots with temporal and liquidity patterns remains a major challenge.

Method: The authors propose DiffVolume, a conditional diffusion model, which generates future LOB volume snapshots by conditioning on past volume history, time of day, and a target future liquidity profile for hypothetical scenarios.

Result: DiffVolume achieves better statistical matching to real volume data, enables controllable counterfactual generation, and improves liquidity forecasting when using synthetic data as input.

Conclusion: DiffVolume is a robust tool that provides realistic and adjustable volume generation for LOBs, advancing research and applications in market microstructure analysis.

Abstract: Modeling limit order books (LOBs) dynamics is a fundamental problem in market
microstructure research. In particular, generating high-dimensional volume
snapshots with strong temporal and liquidity-dependent patterns remains a
challenging task, despite recent work exploring the application of Generative
Adversarial Networks to LOBs. In this work, we propose a conditional
\textbf{Diff}usion model for the generation of future LOB \textbf{Volume}
snapshots (\textbf{DiffVolume}). We evaluate our model across three axes: (1)
\textit{Realism}, where we show that DiffVolume, conditioned on past volume
history and time of day, better reproduces statistical properties such as
marginal distribution, spatial correlation, and autocorrelation decay; (2)
\textit{Counterfactual generation}, allowing for controllable generation under
hypothetical liquidity scenarios by additionally conditioning on a target
future liquidity profile; and (3) \textit{Downstream prediction}, where we show
that the synthetic counterfactual data from our model improves the performance
of future liquidity forecasting models. Together, these results suggest that
DiffVolume provides a powerful and flexible framework for realistic and
controllable LOB volume generation.

TL;DR: This paper introduces Capybara, an AI-powered AR programming tool enabling children to create and animate 3D characters and interactive AR experiences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI-enabled AR technologies often position children as consumers, not creators, limiting their creative potential.

Method: Capybara was developed to allow children to use text-to-3D generative AI, auto-rigging, body tracking, and vision-based AI for creating and programming interactive AR content.

Result: User studies with 20 children showed Capybara empowers them to create personalized and engaging AR experiences blending virtual and physical worlds.

Conclusion: Capybara demonstrates the potential of AI tools to transform children from AR consumers to creators, fostering creativity and engagement.

Abstract: Despite their potential to enhance children's learning experiences,
AI-enabled AR technologies are predominantly used in ways that position
children as consumers rather than creators. We introduce Capybara, an AR-based
and AI-powered visual programming environment that empowers children to create,
customize, and program 3D characters overlaid onto the physical world. Capybara
enables children to create virtual characters and accessories using text-to-3D
generative AI models, and to animate these characters through auto-rigging and
body tracking. In addition, our system employs vision-based AI models to
recognize physical objects, allowing children to program interactive behaviors
between virtual characters and their physical surroundings. We demonstrate the
expressiveness of Capybara through a set of novel AR experiences. We conducted
user studies with 20 children in the United States and Argentina. Our findings
suggest that Capybara can empower children to harness AI in authoring
personalized and engaging AR experiences that seamlessly bridge the virtual and
physical worlds.

TL;DR: The paper discusses the environmental concerns of Generative AI deployment and how deceptive design strategies are used to impose its adoption in digital services.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation lies in addressing the environmental harm caused by large-scale generative AI deployment and how tech companies use deceptive patterns to impose its use.

Method: The paper identifies and analyzes two main design strategies: replacing non-AI features with AI features and promoting narratives that encourage adoption despite environmental consequences.

Result: The authors document that these strategies align with deceptive design practices and emphasize the risks of unregulated AI proliferation.

Conclusion: The paper concludes by advocating for regulatory measures to prevent the imposed use of AI, emphasizing the environmental implications and ethical concerns.

Abstract: Generative AI is being massively deployed in digital services, at a scale
that will result in significant environmental harm. We document how tech
companies are transforming established user interfaces to impose AI use and
show how and to what extent these strategies fit within established deceptive
pattern categories. We identify two main design strategies that are implemented
to impose AI use in both personal and professional contexts: imposing AI
features in interfaces at the expense of existing non-AI features and promoting
narratives about AI that make it harder to resist using it. We discuss
opportunities for regulating the imposed adoption of AI features, which would
inevitably lead to negative environmental effects.

*Nicholas Sukiennik,Yichuan Xu,Yuqing Kan,Jinghua Piao,Yuwei Yan,Chen Gao,Yong Li*

Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: This paper introduces the first framework to model the large-scale evolution of American opinions towards China using LLMs over a 20-year period.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the potential of LLMs in simulating complex cognitive trends in human opinion evolution, particularly US citizens' perspectives on China over a long timeframe.

Method: The framework integrates media data, user profile creation, and LLM-based cognitive modeling to simulate and analyze opinion trends and the effects of biased framing on attitudes, alongside methods for debiasing media exposure.

Result: Simulation results validated the framework, demonstrating how biased media can shape opinions and shedding light on rare attitude shifts from negative to positive.

Conclusion: This research provides a new LLM-based paradigm for modeling opinion evolution in cross-border, long-term contexts, offering insights into mitigating biases and fostering cross-cultural understanding.

Abstract: The rise of LLMs poses new possibilities in modeling opinion evolution, a
long-standing task in simulation, by leveraging advanced reasoning abilities to
recreate complex, large-scale human cognitive trends. While most prior works
focus on opinion evolution surrounding specific isolated events or the views
within a country, ours is the first to model the large-scale attitude evolution
of a population representing an entire country towards another -- US citizens'
perspectives towards China. To tackle the challenges of this broad scenario, we
propose a framework that integrates media data collection, user profile
creation, and cognitive architecture for opinion updates to successfully
reproduce the real trend of US attitudes towards China over a 20-year period
from 2005 to today. We also leverage LLMs' capabilities to introduce debiased
media exposure, extracting neutral events from typically subjective news
contents, to uncover the roots of polarized opinion formation, as well as a
devils advocate agent to help explain the rare reversal from negative to
positive attitudes towards China, corresponding with changes in the way
Americans obtain information about the country. The simulation results, beyond
validating our framework architecture, also reveal the impact of biased framing
and selection bias in shaping attitudes. Overall, our work contributes to a new
paradigm for LLM-based modeling of cognitive behaviors in a large-scale,
long-term, cross-border social context, providing insights into the formation
of international biases and offering valuable implications for media consumers
to better understand the factors shaping their perspectives, and ultimately
contributing to the larger social need for bias reduction and cross-cultural
tolerance.

### [355] [Subsampling Factorization Machine Annealing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08778)
*Yusuke Hama,Tadashi Kadowaki*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper introduces Subsampling Factorization Machine Annealing (SFMA), an improvement on Factorization Machine Annealing (FMA) for black-box optimization that enhances exploration-exploitation balance, accuracy, and computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of this study is to develop a hybrid algorithm combining quantum computing and machine learning to address black-box optimization problems, providing efficient solutions to complex challenges and improving scalability for large-scale problems.

Method: The paper modifies FMA by conducting training on a subdataset sampled probabilistically from the full dataset, leading to SFMA's balanced exploitation-exploration performance. It also evaluates SFMA by benchmarking its performance against FMA.

Result: The results demonstrate that SFMA outperforms FMA in exploration-exploitation functionality, speed, and accuracy. Additionally, a strategy using sequential subsampling datasets of different sizes further enhances performance and reduces computational cost.

Conclusion: SFMA proves effective for large-scale black-box optimization problems, offering improved scalability and computational efficiency while maintaining high solution accuracy.

Abstract: Quantum computing and machine learning are state-of-the-art technologies
which have been investigated intensively in both academia and industry. The
hybrid technology of these two ingredients is expected to be a powerful tool to
solve complex problems in many branches of science and engineering such as
combinatorial optimization problems and accelerate the creation of
next-generation technologies. In this work, we develop an algorithm to solve a
black-box optimization problem by improving Factorization Machine Annealing
(FMA) such that the training of a machine learning model called Factorization
Machine is performed not by a full dataset but by a subdataset which is sampled
from a full dataset: Subsampling Factorization Machine Annealing (SFMA).
According to such a probabilistic training process, the performance of FMA on
exploring a solution space gets enhanced. As a result, SFMA exhibits balanced
performance of exploration and exploitation which we call
exploitation-exploration functionality. We conduct numerical benchmarking tests
to compare the performance of SFMA with that of FMA. Consequently, SFMA
certainly exhibits the exploration-exploitation functionality and outperforms
FMA in speed and accuracy. In addition, the performance of SFMA can be further
improved by sequentially using two subsampling datasets with different sizes
such that the size of the latter dataset is substantially smaller than the
former. Such a substantial reduction not only enhances the exploration
performance of SFMA but also enables us to run it with correspondingly low
computational cost even for a large-scale problem. These results indicate the
effectiveness of SFMA in a certain class of black-box optimization problems of
significant size: the potential scalability of SFMA in solving large-scale
problems with correspondingly low computational cost.

TL;DR: The paper benchmarks quantum-classical algorithms for optimizing a dual chemical potential problem in thermodynamic systems. It explores applications in designing quantum Hamiltonians and stabilizer thermodynamic systems, verifying their efficiency through examples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine the minimum energy of quantum thermodynamic systems under constraints, benchmark algorithms addressing this problem, and explore their practical applications.

Method: The paper employs first- and second-order quantum-classical algorithms, running tests on models like quantum Heisenberg systems and stabilizer thermodynamic systems, and interprets these as tools for optimizing Hamiltonians and encoding stabilizer codes.

Result: Algorithms were benchmarked, showing their utility in designing ground and thermal states, as well as stabilizer thermodynamic systems. They also enabled effective encoding of qubits into stabilizer codes.

Conclusion: The hybrid algorithms are effective in optimizing energy-constrained thermodynamic systems, offering practical techniques for quantum material design and stabilizer code encoding processes.

Abstract: A quantum thermodynamic system is described by a Hamiltonian and a list of
conserved, non-commuting charges, and a fundamental goal is to determine the
minimum energy of the system subject to constraints on the charges. Recently,
[Liu et al., arXiv:2505.04514] proposed first- and second-order classical and
hybrid quantum-classical algorithms for solving a dual chemical potential
maximization problem, and they proved that these algorithms converge to global
optima by means of gradient-ascent approaches. In this paper, we benchmark
these algorithms on several problems of interest in thermodynamics, including
one- and two-dimensional quantum Heisenberg models with nearest and
next-to-nearest neighbor interactions and with the charges set to the total
$x$, $y$, and $z$ magnetizations. We also offer an alternative compelling
interpretation of these algorithms as methods for designing ground and thermal
states of controllable Hamiltonians, with potential applications in molecular
and material design. Furthermore, we introduce stabilizer thermodynamic systems
as thermodynamic systems based on stabilizer codes, with the Hamiltonian
constructed from a given code's stabilizer operators and the charges
constructed from the code's logical operators. We benchmark the aforementioned
algorithms on several examples of stabilizer thermodynamic systems, including
those constructed from the one-to-three-qubit repetition code, the perfect
one-to-five-qubit code, and the two-to-four-qubit error-detecting code.
Finally, we observe that the aforementioned hybrid quantum-classical
algorithms, when applied to stabilizer thermodynamic systems, can serve as
alternative methods for encoding qubits into stabilizer codes at a fixed
temperature, and we provide an effective method for warm-starting these
encoding algorithms whenever a single qubit is encoded into multiple physical
qubits.

### [357] [Algorithmic Collusion of Pricing and Advertising on E-commerce Platforms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08325)
*Hangcheng Zhao,Ron Berman*

Main category: econ.GN

TL;DR: This paper explores the effects of AI algorithms on pricing and advertising in e-commerce, finding both concerns and potential benefits for algorithms enhancing consumer and market outcomes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether AI algorithms used by online sellers for pricing and advertising inadvertently lead to harmful collusion or can instead benefit consumers, sellers, and platforms.

Method: They used multi-agent reinforcement learning calibrated with a large-scale Amazon.com dataset to study pricing and advertising decisions made by competing AI algorithms.

Result: The study finds that under certain conditions, algorithms can reduce advertising costs and lead to prices lower than competitive ones, benefiting all parties. Empirical analysis also highlights significant consumer search costs and a negative correlation between these costs and algorithm adoption.

Conclusion: While alleviating some concerns about harmful effects of AI algorithms, the paper suggests strategic responses for platforms (e.g., commission policy changes) and offers insights for sellers and policymakers regarding algorithm regulation.

Abstract: Online sellers have been adopting AI learning algorithms to automatically
make product pricing and advertising decisions on e-commerce platforms. When
sellers compete using such algorithms, one concern is that of tacit collusion -
the algorithms learn to coordinate on higher than competitive. We empirically
investigate whether these concerns are valid when sellers make pricing and
advertising decisions together, i.e., two-dimensional decisions. Our empirical
strategy is to analyze competition with multi-agent reinforcement learning,
which we calibrate to a large-scale dataset collected from Amazon.com products.
Our first contribution is to find conditions under which learning algorithms
can facilitate win-win-win outcomes that are beneficial for consumers, sellers,
and even the platform, when consumers have high search costs. In these cases
the algorithms learn to coordinate on prices that are lower than competitive
prices. The intuition is that the algorithms learn to coordinate on lower
advertising bids, which lower advertising costs, leading to lower prices. Our
second contribution is an analysis of a large-scale, high-frequency
keyword-product dataset for more than 2 million products on Amazon.com. Our
estimates of consumer search costs show a wide range of costs for different
product keywords. We generate an algorithm usage and find a negative
interaction between the estimated consumer search costs and the algorithm usage
index, providing empirical evidence of beneficial collusion. Finally, we
analyze the platform's strategic response. We find that reserve price
adjustments will not increase profits for the platform, but commission
adjustments will. Our analyses help alleviate some worries about the
potentially harmful effects of competing learning algorithms, and can help
sellers, platforms and policymakers to decide on whether to adopt or regulate
such algorithms.

*Wei Wang,Jialong Shi,Jianyong Sun,Arnaud Liefooghe,Qingfu Zhang*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: The paper addresses solutions for combinatorial optimization problems (COPs) by extending homotopic convex (HC) transformations to unconstrained binary quadratic programming (UBQP) and introducing new algorithms like LSILS and its parallel variant PC-LSILS.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: COPs are challenging to solve due to the numerous local optima in their solution space; the paper seeks better smoothing methods to improve solution efficacy.

Method: The authors develop and prove the unimodality of a toy UBQP, apply HC transformation for smoothing UBQPs, and introduce LSILS and PC-LSILS frameworks for optimization.

Result: Experimental analyses on UBQP and TSP instances reveal that LSILS is effective, while PC-LSILS enhances both HC transformation smoothing and overall algorithm performance.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates the utility and effectiveness of HC transformations for UBQP and TSP optimization, especially with the more robust PC-LSILS variant.

Abstract: Combinatorial optimization problem (COP) is difficult to solve because of the
massive number of local optimal solutions in his solution space. Various
methods have been put forward to smooth the solution space of COPs, including
homotopic convex (HC) transformation for the traveling salesman problem (TSP).
This paper extends the HC transformation approach to unconstrained binary
quadratic programming (UBQP) by proposing a method to construct a unimodal toy
UBQP of any size. We theoretically prove the unimodality of the constructed toy
UBQP. After that, we apply this unimodal toy UBQP to smooth the original UBQP
by using the HC transformation framework and empirically verify the smoothing
effects. Subsequently, we introduce an iterative algorithmic framework
incorporating HC transformation, referred as landscape smoothing iterated local
search (LSILS). Our experimental analyses, conducted on various UBQP instances
show the effectiveness of LSILS. Furthermore, this paper proposes a parallel
cooperative variant of LSILS, denoted as PC-LSILS and apply it to both the UBQP
and the TSP. Our experimental findings highlight that PC-LSILS improves the
smoothing performance of the HC transformation, and further improves the
overall performance of the algorithm.

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: The study examines the impact of landscape smoothing in solving UBQP problems by testing different toy UBQP constructions, revealing that LSILS performs best with matrices constructed using "+/-i".


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: UBQP problems are challenging due to their rugged landscapes, making optimization difficult; the study aims to investigate smoothing techniques to ease the optimization process.

Method: Different toy UBQP matrices (^Q1, ^Q2, and ^Q3) were tested for landscape flatness and subsequently used in the LSILS algorithm to evaluate optimization efficiency.

Result: Toy UBQP with ^Q1 is the flattest, while ^Q3 is the least flat. LSILS performs best with ^Q2 (constructed using "+/-i") and worst with randomly constructed ^Q3.

Conclusion: Smoothing techniques using specific toy UBQP constructions can enhance optimization of UBQP problems, with "+/-i" matrices proving most effective.

Abstract: The hardness of the Unconstrained Binary Quadratic Program (UBQP) problem is
due its rugged landscape. Various algorithms have been proposed for UBQP,
including the Landscape Smoothing Iterated Local Search (LSILS). Different from
other UBQP algorithms, LSILS tries to smooth the rugged landscape by building a
convex combination of the original UBQP and a toy UBQP. In this paper, our
study further investigates the impact of smoothing rugged landscapes using
different toy UBQP problems, including a toy UBQP with matrix ^Q1 (construct by
"+/-1"), a toy UBQP with matrix ^Q2 (construct by "+/-i") and a toy UBQP with
matrix ^Q3 (construct randomly). We first assess the landscape flatness of the
three toy UBQPs. Subsequently, we test the efficiency of LSILS with different
toy UBQPs. Results reveal that the toy UBQP with ^Q1 (construct by "+/-1")
exhibits the flattest landscape among the three, while the toy UBQP with ^Q3
(construct randomly) presents the most non-flat landscape. Notably, LSILS using
the toy UBQP with ^Q2 (construct by "+/-i") emerges as the most effective,
while ^Q3 (construct randomly) has the poorest result. These findings
contribute to a detailed understanding of landscape smoothing techniques in
optimizing UBQP.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a Topic-Method Composition (TMC) framework to analyze the interplay of research topics and corresponding methods in Digital Humanities (DH), offering deeper insights into technological advancements and topic development.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous studies in DH using bibliometric analysis provided limited interpretability regarding the interaction between methods and topics, leaving a gap in understanding their integration.

Method: The study introduces a TMC-based workflow that combines bibliometric analysis, topic modeling, and network analysis to examine knowledge structures and developmental patterns in DH.

Result: The TMC-based workflow was applied to large-scale bibliometric data, enabling a granular understanding of the hybrid structures of methods and topics, showing clearer intersections of technologies and humanities.

Conclusion: The proposed TMC framework offers interpretability in DH research while providing adaptability to analyze developments in other fields.

Abstract: Digital Humanities (DH) is an interdisciplinary field that integrates
computational methods with humanities scholarship to investigate innovative
topics. Each academic discipline follows a unique developmental path shaped by
the topics researchers investigate and the methods they employ. With the help
of bibliometric analysis, most of previous studies have examined DH across
multiple dimensions such as research hotspots, co-author networks, and
institutional rankings. However, these studies have often been limited in their
ability to provide deep insights into the current state of technological
advancements and topic development in DH. As a result, their conclusions tend
to remain superficial or lack interpretability in understanding how methods and
topics interrelate in the field. To address this gap, this study introduced a
new concept of Topic-Method Composition (TMC), which refers to a hybrid
knowledge structure generated by the co-occurrence of specific research topics
and the corresponding method. Especially by analyzing the interaction between
TMCs, we can see more clearly the intersection and integration of digital
technology and humanistic subjects in DH. Moreover, this study developed a
TMC-based workflow combining bibliometric analysis, topic modeling, and network
analysis to analyze the development characteristics and patterns of research
disciplines. By applying this workflow to large-scale bibliometric data, it
enables a detailed view of the knowledge structures, providing a tool adaptable
to other fields.

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: The paper introduces a kernel-based two-sample test with spectral decomposition of MMD to boost efficacy in high-dimensional or unbalanced samples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address estimation variability in directional components of MMD, aiming for better reliability and power in kernel-based statistical tests.

Method: Developed a new test leveraging spectral decomposition, multiple kernels, and a multiplier bootstrap for faster and theoretically sound critical value approximations.

Result: Achieves nominal Type I error rate with superior power demonstrated through simulations and microarray data.

Conclusion: The proposed test outperforms existing MMD tests in power and robustness while being computationally efficient.

Abstract: We propose a novel kernel-based two-sample test that leverages the spectral
decomposition of the maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) statistic to identify and
utilize well-estimated directional components in reproducing kernel Hilbert
space (RKHS). Our approach is motivated by the observation that the estimation
quality of these components varies significantly, with leading eigen-directions
being more reliably estimated in finite samples. By focusing on these
directions and aggregating information across multiple kernels, the proposed
test achieves higher power and improved robustness, especially in
high-dimensional and unbalanced sample settings. We further develop a
computationally efficient multiplier bootstrap procedure for approximating
critical values, which is theoretically justified and significantly faster than
permutation-based alternatives. Extensive simulations and empirical studies on
microarray datasets demonstrate that our method maintains the nominal Type I
error rate and delivers superior power compared to other existing MMD-based
tests.

*Sourabh Balgi,Marc Braun,Jose M. Peña,Adel Daoud*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: The paper introduces the \( \rho \)-GNF method for sensitivity analysis in causal inference using a Gaussian copula and provides both graphical and Bayesian approaches to estimate causal effect under unobserved confounding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the challenge of estimating causal effects accurately in the presence of unobserved confounders by introducing a novel method to analyze confounding sensitivity.

Method: The proposed method, \( \rho \)-GNF, is a causal graphical normalizing flow using the Gaussian copula to model the relationship between exposure and outcome under different confounding strengths (\( \rho \)). It provides both a graphical sensitivity analysis output (\( \rho_{curve} \)) and a Bayesian approach for posterior distributions.

Result: The \( \rho \)-GNF effectively derives bounds for average causal effects under various confounding scenarios and identifies confounding strengths that can nullify the causal effect. Experimental validation is demonstrated on simulated and real-world data.

Conclusion: The method proves to be a robust tool for sensitivity analysis in causal inference, offering researchers a quantitative, flexible approach to assess the impact of unobserved confounders on causal effect estimates.

Abstract: We propose a novel method for sensitivity analysis to unobserved confounding
in causal inference. The method builds on a copula-based causal graphical
normalizing flow that we term $\rho$-GNF, where $\rho \in [-1,+1]$ is the
sensitivity parameter. The parameter represents the non-causal association
between exposure and outcome due to unobserved confounding, which is modeled as
a Gaussian copula. In other words, the $\rho$-GNF enables scholars to estimate
the average causal effect (ACE) as a function of $\rho$, accounting for various
confounding strengths. The output of the $\rho$-GNF is what we term the
$\rho_{curve}$, which provides the bounds for the ACE given an interval of
assumed $\rho$ values. The $\rho_{curve}$ also enables scholars to identify the
confounding strength required to nullify the ACE. We also propose a Bayesian
version of our sensitivity analysis method. Assuming a prior over the
sensitivity parameter $\rho$ enables us to derive the posterior distribution
over the ACE, which enables us to derive credible intervals. Finally,
leveraging on experiments from simulated and real-world data, we show the
benefits of our sensitivity analysis method.

TL;DR: The study introduces an agent-driven approach leveraging large language models to improve communication efficiency and user experience in edge-assisted mobile augmented reality (MAR).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to address inefficiencies in communication overhead and ensure quality of experience (QoE) for MAR users in edge-assisted environments, recognizing MAR's integral role in 6G applications.

Method: A digital agent powered by large language models bridges MAR services with network domains, coupled with a personalized QoE modeling method to manage user-dependent communication demands.

Result: Simulations show improved accuracy in user-level QoE modeling and better communication resource efficiency compared to conventional methods.

Conclusion: The agent-driven approach effectively enhances communication service provisioning for MAR, paving the way for optimized resource management and improved user QoE in emerging 6G networks.

Abstract: Mobile augmented reality (MAR) is envisioned as a key immersive application
in 6G, enabling virtual content rendering aligned with the physical environment
through device pose estimation. In this paper, we propose a novel agent-driven
communication service provisioning approach for edge-assisted MAR, aiming to
reduce communication overhead between MAR devices and the edge server while
ensuring the quality of experience (QoE). First, to address the inaccessibility
of MAR application-specific information to the network controller, we establish
a digital agent powered by large language models (LLMs) on behalf of the MAR
service provider, bridging the data and function gap between the MAR service
and network domains. Second, to cope with the user-dependent and dynamic nature
of data traffic patterns for individual devices, we develop a user-level QoE
modeling method that captures the relationship between communication resource
demands and perceived user QoE, enabling personalized, agent-driven
communication resource management. Trace-driven simulation results demonstrate
that the proposed approach outperforms conventional LLM-based QoE-aware service
provisioning methods in both user-level QoE modeling accuracy and communication
resource efficiency.

*Zihan Fang,Zheng Lin,Senkang Hu,Yihang Tao,Yiqin Deng,Xianhao Chen,Yuguang Fang*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: DUAL-Health is a new uncertainty-aware multimodal fusion framework that improves outdoor health monitoring under dynamic and noisy conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing frameworks for outdoor health monitoring lack effective methods to handle sensor noise and multimodal fusion challenges in dynamic environments.

Method: DUAL-Health quantifies modality uncertainty, customizes fusion weights based on uncertainty, and aligns modality distributions within a semantic space.

Result: DUAL-Health outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in detection accuracy and robustness.

Conclusion: The framework effectively addresses challenges of noise and dynamic environments, demonstrating its potential for reliable outdoor health monitoring.

Abstract: Outdoor health monitoring is essential to detect early abnormal health status
for safeguarding human health and safety. Conventional outdoor monitoring
relies on static multimodal deep learning frameworks, which requires extensive
data training from scratch and fails to capture subtle health status changes.
Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) emerge as a promising alternative,
utilizing only small datasets to fine-tune pre-trained information-rich models
for enabling powerful health status monitoring. Unfortunately, MLLM-based
outdoor health monitoring also faces significant challenges: I) sensor data
contains input noise stemming from sensor data acquisition and fluctuation
noise caused by sudden changes in physiological signals due to dynamic outdoor
environments, thus degrading the training performance; ii) current transformer
based MLLMs struggle to achieve robust multimodal fusion, as they lack a design
for fusing the noisy modality; iii) modalities with varying noise levels hinder
accurate recovery of missing data from fluctuating distributions. To combat
these challenges, we propose an uncertainty-aware multimodal fusion framework,
named DUAL-Health, for outdoor health monitoring in dynamic and noisy
environments. First, to assess the impact of noise, we accurately quantify
modality uncertainty caused by input and fluctuation noise with current and
temporal features. Second, to empower efficient muitimodal fusion with
low-quality modalities,we customize the fusion weight for each modality based
on quantified and calibrated uncertainty. Third, to enhance data recovery from
fluctuating noisy modalities, we align modality distributions within a common
semantic space. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our DUAL-Health
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in detection accuracy and robustness.

TL;DR: The paper introduces SpectraLLM, a large language model designed for multi-modal spectroscopic structure elucidation, which outperforms existing methods and offers robustness in identifying molecular structures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing structure elucidation methods heavily rely on prior knowledge or databases, struggle with unknown structures, and are costly in terms of time, expertise, and resources, especially for complex structures requiring multi-modal spectroscopic analysis.

Method: SpectraLLM integrates data from multiple spectroscopic modalities into a shared semantic space, enabling it to identify consistent substructural patterns through pretraining and fine-tuning on small molecules. The model supports both single and multi-spectral inputs for end-to-end inference.

Result: SpectraLLM surpassed state-of-the-art approaches in six public chemical datasets, demonstrating strong robustness for single-spectrum tasks and improved accuracy for multi-modal structure prediction.

Conclusion: SpectraLLM offers a powerful and efficient solution for molecular structure elucidation, reducing dependency on prior knowledge and expert analysis, while excelling in both single-spectrum and multi-modal scenarios.

Abstract: Structure elucidation is a fundamental technique for understanding the
microscopic composition of matter and is widely applied across various
disciplines in the natural sciences and engineering. However, existing methods
often rely heavily on prior databases or known structural information, making
it difficult to resolve unknown structures. In addition, complex structures
typically require the joint analysis of multiple spectroscopic modalities. This
process heavily depends on expert domain knowledge and is often accompanied by
high costs in terms of both time and instrumentation. To address these
challenges, we propose SpectraLLM, the first large language model designed to
support multi-modal spectroscopic joint reasoning. SpectraLLM is capable of
processing either single or multiple spectroscopic inputs and performing
end-to-end structure elucidation. By integrating continuous and discrete
spectroscopic modalities into a shared semantic space, SpectraLLM learns to
uncover substructural patterns that are consistent and complementary across
spectra, enabling precise molecular structure elucidation. We pretrain and
fine-tune SpectraLLM in the domain of small molecules, and evaluate it on six
standardized, publicly available chemical datasets. The model achieves
state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming existing approaches
trained on single modalities. Notably, SpectraLLM demonstrates strong
robustness and generalization even for single-spectrum inference, while its
multi-modal reasoning capability further improves the accuracy of structural
prediction.

TL;DR: SharpXR, a novel U-Net model, effectively denoises low-dose pediatric chest X-rays, improving pneumonia diagnosis accuracy in low-resource settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pediatric chest X-rays are vital for early diagnosis in low-resource settings, but low-dose protocols introduce noise that hampers accuracy.

Method: SharpXR employs a dual-decoder U-Net with a Laplacian-guided edge-preserving decoder and a learnable fusion module, trained on simulated noisy data.

Result: SharpXR enhanced pneumonia classification accuracy from 88.8% to 92.5%, outperforming state-of-the-art denoising methods on multiple metrics.

Conclusion: SharpXR effectively balances noise suppression and detail retention, making it a valuable tool for pediatric care in resource-constrained environments.

Abstract: Pediatric chest X-ray imaging is essential for early diagnosis, particularly
in low-resource settings where advanced imaging modalities are often
inaccessible. Low-dose protocols reduce radiation exposure in children but
introduce substantial noise that can obscure critical anatomical details.
Conventional denoising methods often degrade fine details, compromising
diagnostic accuracy. In this paper, we present SharpXR, a structure-aware
dual-decoder U-Net designed to denoise low-dose pediatric X-rays while
preserving diagnostically relevant features. SharpXR combines a
Laplacian-guided edge-preserving decoder with a learnable fusion module that
adaptively balances noise suppression and structural detail retention. To
address the scarcity of paired training data, we simulate realistic
Poisson-Gaussian noise on the Pediatric Pneumonia Chest X-ray dataset. SharpXR
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across all evaluation metrics while
maintaining computational efficiency suitable for resource-constrained
settings. SharpXR-denoised images improved downstream pneumonia classification
accuracy from 88.8% to 92.5%, underscoring its diagnostic value in low-resource
pediatric care.

*Conor Rowan,Sumedh Soman,John A. Evans*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel approach using the Deep Ritz method for variational volume reconstruction from sparse and noisy slice data, particularly in MRI-based imaging applications, addressing challenges of image segmentation, sparse data reconstruction, and computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research is motivated by the need for improved methods in biomedical imaging applications like MRI slice-to-volume reconstruction, aiming to overcome limitations such as image segmentation reliance, sparse slice data, and high computational costs of traditional techniques.

Method: The authors propose a variational objective combining a regression loss to directly handle noisy slice data and a modified Cahn-Hilliard energy with anisotropic diffusion for geometry regularization. The method employs neural network-based discretization, Monte Carlo integration for approximation, and uses ADAM optimizer for minimization.

Result: The method reliably produces high-quality reconstructed volumes in seconds, even with sparse and noisy slice data, highlighting its efficiency and robustness.

Conclusion: This novel approach offers a significant improvement in volume reconstruction, removing reliance on segmentation and demonstrating speed and performance in challenging biomedical imaging scenarios.

Abstract: We present a novel approach to variational volume reconstruction from sparse,
noisy slice data using the Deep Ritz method. Motivated by biomedical imaging
applications such as MRI-based slice-to-volume reconstruction (SVR), our
approach addresses three key challenges: (i) the reliance on image segmentation
to extract boundaries from noisy grayscale slice images, (ii) the need to
reconstruct volumes from a limited number of slice planes, and (iii) the
computational expense of traditional mesh-based methods. We formulate a
variational objective that combines a regression loss designed to avoid image
segmentation by operating on noisy slice data directly with a modified
Cahn-Hilliard energy incorporating anisotropic diffusion to regularize the
reconstructed geometry. We discretize the phase field with a neural network,
approximate the objective at each optimization step with Monte Carlo
integration, and use ADAM to find the minimum of the approximated variational
objective. While the stochastic integration may not yield the true solution to
the variational problem, we demonstrate that our method reliably produces
high-quality reconstructed volumes in a matter of seconds, even when the slice
data is sparse and noisy.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a preprocessing algorithm to reduce scale-induced spectral variability in hyperspectral imaging, addressing challenges like topography and shadowing to improve unmixing algorithm performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the detrimental impacts of scale-induced spectral variability, such as topography and shadowing, on the accuracy of hyperspectral unmixing algorithms.

Method: The paper proposes a preprocessing technique that isolates and compensates for large-scale multiplicative effects affecting spectral signatures to facilitate improved unmixing.

Result: The preprocessing algorithm significantly enhances the performance of various unmixing algorithms, achieving error reductions close to 50% in many cases on both synthetic and real datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed preprocessing step is a complementary enhancement to current unmixing methods, making it a key addition to hyperspectral unmixing pipelines. Its generality and impact are validated, and the code will be publicly available upon publication.

Abstract: Spectral variability significantly impacts the accuracy and convergence of
hyperspectral unmixing algorithms. While many methods address complex spectral
variability, large-scale variations in spectral signature scale caused by
factors such as topography, illumination, and shadowing remain a major
challenge. These variations often degrade unmixing performance and complicate
model fitting. In this paper, we propose a novel preprocessing algorithm that
corrects scale-induced spectral variability prior to unmixing. By isolating and
compensating for these large-scale multiplicative effects, the algorithm
provides a cleaner input, enabling unmixing methods to focus more effectively
on modeling nonlinear spectral variability and abundance estimation. We present
a rigorous mathematical framework to describe scale variability and extensive
experimental validation of the proposed algorithm. Furthermore, the algorithm's
impact is evaluated across a broad spectrum of state-of-the-art unmixing
algorithms on two synthetic and two real hyperspectral datasets. The proposed
preprocessing step consistently improves the performance of these algorithms,
including those specifically designed to handle spectral variability, with
error reductions close to 50% in many cases. This demonstrates that scale
correction acts as a complementary step, facilitating more accurate unmixing by
existing methods. The algorithm's generality and significant impact highlight
its potential as a key component in practical hyperspectral unmixing pipelines.
The implementation code will be made publicly available upon publication.

*Yingxue Pang,Shijie Zhao,Haiqiang Wang,Gen Zhan,Junlin Li,Li Zhang*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper introduces FreqSP, a method to optimize video sharpening levels for better quality while controlling bitrate.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge is to enhance video quality through proper sharpening levels without incurring excessive bitrate and avoiding over-sharpening.

Method: The authors present FreqSP, which uses labeled video data, CNN features, and high-frequency components to predict optimal sharpening levels.

Result: Experiments show the effectiveness of FreqSP in achieving a balance between video quality and bitrate.

Conclusion: FreqSP is a practical solution to optimize video sharpening levels, balancing quality and bitrate effectively.

Abstract: Sharpening is a widely adopted technique to improve video quality, which can
effectively emphasize textures and alleviate blurring. However, increasing the
sharpening level comes with a higher video bitrate, resulting in degraded
Quality of Service (QoS). Furthermore, the video quality does not necessarily
improve with increasing sharpening levels, leading to issues such as
over-sharpening. Clearly, it is essential to figure out how to boost video
quality with a proper sharpening level while also controlling bandwidth costs
effectively. This paper thus proposes a novel Frequency-assisted Sharpening
level Prediction model (FreqSP). We first label each video with the sharpening
level correlating to the optimal bitrate and quality tradeoff as ground truth.
Then taking uncompressed source videos as inputs, the proposed FreqSP leverages
intricate CNN features and high-frequency components to estimate the optimal
sharpening level. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our
method.

*Conall Daly,Anil Kokaram*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: This paper explores frame synthesis, comparing frame interpolation methods with view synthesis techniques using a novel multi-camera dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors were motivated by the challenge of fair comparison between frame interpolation and view synthesis methods due to biases in existing datasets.

Method: They built a dense linear multi-camera array dataset and evaluated classical, deep learning frame interpolation methods, and 3D Gaussian Splatting for view synthesis.

Result: Deep learning methods showed no significant advantage over classical methods on real image data, while 3D Gaussian Splatting underperformed by 3.5 dB PSNR. Conversely, in synthetic scenes, 3D Gaussian Splatting outperformed by 5 dB PSNR.

Conclusion: The performance of frame synthesis methods depends significantly on the data type, highlighting trade-offs between real and synthetic image scenarios.

Abstract: Many methods exist for frame synthesis in image sequences but can be broadly
categorised into frame interpolation and view synthesis techniques.
Fundamentally, both frame interpolation and view synthesis tackle the same
task, interpolating a frame given surrounding frames in time or space. However,
most frame interpolation datasets focus on temporal aspects with single cameras
moving through time and space, while view synthesis datasets are typically
biased toward stereoscopic depth estimation use cases. This makes direct
comparison between view synthesis and frame interpolation methods challenging.
In this paper, we develop a novel multi-camera dataset using a custom-built
dense linear camera array to enable fair comparison between these approaches.
We evaluate classical and deep learning frame interpolators against a view
synthesis method (3D Gaussian Splatting) for the task of view in-betweening.
Our results reveal that deep learning methods do not significantly outperform
classical methods on real image data, with 3D Gaussian Splatting actually
underperforming frame interpolators by as much as 3.5 dB PSNR. However, in
synthetic scenes, the situation reverses -- 3D Gaussian Splatting outperforms
frame interpolation algorithms by almost 5 dB PSNR at a 95% confidence level.

*Conall Daly,Darren Ramsook,Anil Kokaram*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a simple motion field-based quality metric for assessing perceptual quality of video frame interpolation algorithms, showing reasonable correlation with perceptual scores and better computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is an ongoing need for effective and computationally efficient methods to assess the perceptual quality of interpolated video frames.

Method: The paper explores motion field processing techniques to derive a novel motion metric, measuring the divergence of motion fields.

Result: The proposed metric achieves a PLCC correlation of 0.51 with perceptual scores and demonstrates a 2.7x computational speedup compared to FloLPIPS metric.

Conclusion: The proposed motion metric favors perceptually pleasing frame interpolations, offering a practical and efficient quality assessment tool despite its limited alignment with conventional PSNR or SSIM measures.

Abstract: Video frame interpolation (VFI) offers a way to generate intermediate frames
between consecutive frames of a video sequence. Although the development of
advanced frame interpolation algorithms has received increased attention in
recent years, assessing the perceptual quality of interpolated content remains
an ongoing area of research. In this paper, we investigate simple ways to
process motion fields, with the purposes of using them as video quality metric
for evaluating frame interpolation algorithms. We evaluate these quality
metrics using the BVI-VFI dataset which contains perceptual scores measured for
interpolated sequences. From our investigation we propose a motion metric based
on measuring the divergence of motion fields. This metric correlates reasonably
with these perceptual scores (PLCC=0.51) and is more computationally efficient
(x2.7 speedup) compared to FloLPIPS (a well known motion-based metric). We then
use our new proposed metrics to evaluate a range of state of the art frame
interpolation metrics and find our metrics tend to favour more perceptual
pleasing interpolated frames that may not score highly in terms of PSNR or
SSIM.

*Abrar Rahman Abir,Sajib Acharjee Dip,Liqing Zhang*

Main category: q-bio.GN

TL;DR: CFM-GP is a scalable method predicting gene perturbations across various cell types using a single model, outperforming existing techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of understanding gene perturbation effects across diverse cellular contexts, critical for therapeutic discovery and precision medicine.

Method: The study introduces CFM-GP, a model employing time-dependent transformations and a flow matching objective to predict gene perturbation dynamics for all cell types using single-cell data.

Result: CFM-GP demonstrates superior performance in R-squared and Spearman correlation metrics across five datasets, recovering essential biological pathways.

Conclusion: CFM-GP offers a robust, scalable approach that generalizes gene perturbation predictions across cell types, ensuring biological fidelity.

Abstract: Understanding gene perturbation effects across diverse cellular contexts is a
central challenge in functional genomics, with important implications for
therapeutic discovery and precision medicine. Single-cell technologies enable
high-resolution measurement of transcriptional responses, but collecting such
data is costly and time-consuming, especially when repeated for each cell type.
Existing computational methods often require separate models per cell type,
limiting scalability and generalization. We present CFM-GP, a method for cell
type-agnostic gene perturbation prediction. CFM-GP learns a continuous,
time-dependent transformation between unperturbed and perturbed gene expression
distributions, conditioned on cell type, allowing a single model to predict
across all cell types. Unlike prior approaches that use discrete modeling,
CFM-GP employs a flow matching objective to capture perturbation dynamics in a
scalable manner. We evaluate on five datasets: SARS-CoV-2 infection, IFN-beta
stimulated PBMCs, glioblastoma treated with Panobinostat, lupus under IFN-beta
stimulation, and Statefate progenitor fate mapping. CFM-GP consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in R-squared and Spearman correlation,
and pathway enrichment analysis confirms recovery of key biological pathways.
These results demonstrate the robustness and biological fidelity of CFM-GP as a
scalable solution for cross-cell type gene perturbation prediction.
