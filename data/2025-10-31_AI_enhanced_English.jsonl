The realization of\nartificial neural network algorithms in a massively parallel and fully\ndistributed hardware has been the goal of neural network computing researchers.\nThis is because a parallel and distributed computation of artificial neural\nnetwork algorithms could not have been achieved against all the advancements in\nsilicon- or optics-based computing. Accordingly, artificial neural networks\ncould not be applied to very large-scale problems for real time computation of\nsolutions. This hindered the development of neural algorithms for affordable\nand practical solutions of challenging problems since often special-purpose\ncomputing approaches in hardware, software or hybrid (non-neural) had to be\ndeveloped for and fine-tuned to specific problems that are very large-scale and\nhighly complex.

The key idea is\nto model a conditional distribution as a smooth probability trajectory defined\nby a weighted sum of Gaussian components whose parameters -- the mean and\ncovariance -- are functions of the input variable constructed using Bernstein\npolynomials. The loss function is the averaged squared Wasserstein distance\nbetween the predicted Gaussian distributions and the empirical data, which\ntakes into account the geometry of the distributions. An autodiff-based\noptimization method is used to train the model. Experiments on synthetic\ndatasets that include complex trajectories demonstrated that the proposed\nmethod provides competitive approximation quality in terms of the Wasserstein\ndistance, Energy Distance, and RMSE metrics, especially in cases of pronounced\nnonlinearity. The model demonstrates trajectory smoothness that is better than\nor comparable to alternatives and robustness to changes in data structure,\nwhile maintaining high interpretability due to explicit parameterization via\ncontrol points.

Unfortunately, classical high-resolution\ntechniques require multi-element arrays and extensive snapshot collection,\nwhile generic Machine Learning (ML) approaches often yield black-box models\nthat lack physical interpretability. To address these limitations, we propose a\nSymbolic Regression (SR)-based ML framework. Namely, Symbolic Regression-based\nAngle of Arrival and Beam Pattern Estimator (SABER), a constrained\nsymbolic-regression framework that automatically discovers closed-form beam\npattern and AoA models from path loss measurements with interpretability. SABER\nachieves high accuracy while bridging the gap between opaque ML methods and\ninterpretable physics-driven estimators. First, we validate our approach in a\ncontrolled free-space anechoic chamber, showing that both direct inversion of\nthe known $\\cos^n$ beam and a low-order polynomial surrogate achieve sub-0.5\ndegree Mean Absolute Error (MAE). A purely unconstrained SR method can further\nreduce the error of the predicted angles, but produces complex formulas that\nlack physical insight. Then, we implement the same SR-learned inversions in a\nreal-world, Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS)-aided indoor testbed.\nSABER and unconstrained SR models accurately recover the true AoA with\nnear-zero error.
