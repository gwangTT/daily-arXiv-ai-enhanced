When two instances with di erent treatments\nare grouped into the same leaf across a su cient number of causal trees, they\nare treated as counterfactual outcomes of each other. Through this clustering\nmechanism, LILI clustering reduces bias present in traditional causal tree\nmethods and enhances the prediction accuracy for the average treatment e ect\n(ATE). By integrating LILIs into a causal forest, we develop an e cient causal\ninference method. Moreover, we explore several key properties of LILI by\nrelating it to the concepts of limit inferior and limit superior in the set\ntheory.

In this setting, an LLM\nagent is tasked with making a prediction by sequentially querying relevant\ninformation from the user, as opposed to a single-turn conversation. This paper\nexplores sequential querying strategies that aim to minimize the expected\nnumber of queries. One such strategy is Information Pursuit (IP), a greedy\nalgorithm that at each iteration selects the query that maximizes information\ngain or equivalently minimizes uncertainty. However, obtaining accurate\nestimates of mutual information or conditional entropy for LLMs is very\ndifficult in practice due to over- or under-confident LLM probabilities, which\nleads to suboptimal query selection and predictive performance. To better\nestimate the uncertainty at each iteration, we propose Conformal Information\nPursuit (C-IP), an alternative approach to sequential information gain based on\nconformal prediction sets.

We evaluate RefineX across from-scratch\npre-training at multiple model scales and find that it consistently outperforms\nmodels trained on raw, filtered, or alternatively refined data across diverse\ndownstream tasks. On the 750M model, RefineX yields 2.6%-7.2% average gains on\nlighteval tasks, and achieves comparable performance using significantly fewer\ntraining tokens. Further analysis shows that RefineX reliably enhances text\nquality with both high efficiency and precision, outperforming prior approaches\nsuch as end-to-end generation and Prox-C.

Our\nframework leverages a multimodal Proximal Policy Optimization agent that\nprocesses both semantic image sequences and scalar vehicle states. The proposed\ndynamic and relative strategies incorporate real-time action masking based on\ncontext and state transitions, preserving action consistency while eliminating\ninvalid or suboptimal choices. Through comprehensive experiments across diverse\ndriving routes, we show that action space reduction significantly improves\ntraining stability and policy performance. The dynamic and relative schemes, in\nparticular, achieve a favorable balance between learning speed, control\nprecision, and generalization.

We introduce a\n2.5D object detection framework, tailored specifically for infrastructure\nroadside-mounted cameras. Unlike conventional 2D or 3D object detection, we\nemploy a prediction approach to detect ground planes of vehicles as\nparallelograms in the image frame. The parallelogram preserves the planar\nposition, size, and orientation of objects while omitting their height, which\nis unnecessary for most downstream applications. For training, a mix of\nreal-world and synthetically generated scenes is leveraged. We evaluate\ngeneralizability on a held-out camera viewpoint and in adverse-weather\nscenarios absent from the training set. Our results show high detection\naccuracy, strong cross-viewpoint generalization, and robustness to diverse\nlighting and weather conditions.

Traffic data\noften consists of several interrelated measurements - such as speed, flow and\noccupancy - yet many deep-learning approaches either predict only one of these\nvariables or require a separate model for each. This limits their ability to\ncapture joint patterns across channels. To address this, we introduce the\nMulti-Channel Spatio-Temporal (MCST) Mamba model, a forecasting framework built\non the Mamba selective state-space architecture that natively handles\nmultivariate inputs and simultaneously models all traffic features. The\nproposed MCST-Mamba model integrates adaptive spatio-temporal embeddings and\nseparates the modeling of temporal sequences and spatial sensor interactions\ninto two dedicated Mamba blocks, improving representation learning. Unlike\nprior methods that evaluate on a single channel, we assess MCST-Mamba across\nall traffic features at once, aligning more closely with how congestion arises\nin practice.

Furthermore, no existing benchmarks cover all four\ncompetencies. Therefore, we introduce MemoryAgentBench, a new benchmark\nspecifically designed for memory agents. Our benchmark combines reformulated\nexisting datasets with newly constructed ones, covering the above four memory\ncompetencies, providing a systematic and challenging testbed for assessing\nmemory quality. We evaluate a diverse set of memory agents, ranging from simple\ncontext-based and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems to advanced\nagents with external memory modules and tool integration.

First, current methods often rely on only\none simple lan-guage prompt and basic cosine similarity, which fails to learn\nfine-grained associ-ations between multi-faceted linguistic information and\nvisual features within WSI, resulting in inadequate vision-language alignment.\nSecond, these methods primarily exploit patch-level information, overlooking\nthe intrinsic hierarchy of WSIs and their interactions, causing ineffective\nmodeling of hierarchical interac-tions. To tackle these problems, we propose a\nnovel Hierarchical vision-Language collaboration (HiLa) framework for improved\nsurvival prediction. Specifically, HiLa employs pretrained feature extractors\nto generate hierarchical visual features from WSIs at both patch and region\nlevels. At each level, a series of language prompts describing various\nsurvival-related attributes are constructed and aligned with visual features\nvia Optimal Prompt Learning (OPL). This ap-proach enables the comprehensive\nlearning of discriminative visual features cor-responding to different\nsurvival-related attributes from prompts, thereby improv-ing vision-language\nalignment. Furthermore, we introduce two modules, i.e., Cross-Level Propagation\n(CLP) and Mutual Contrastive Learning (MCL) to maximize hierarchical\ncooperation by promoting interactions and consistency be-tween patch and region\nlevels. Experiments on three TCGA datasets demonstrate our SOTA performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper proposes a method using hierarchical vision-language collaboration to improve survival prediction from WSIs by optimizing visual-linguistic alignment and modeling hierarchical interactions.", "motivation": "Existing methods for survival prediction from WSIs are limited due to sparse slide-level labels and insufficient vision-language alignment, hindering discriminative feature representation from gigapixel images.", "method": "The proposed HiLa framework utilizes hierarchical visual features from WSIs at patch and region levels, aligns these with language prompts using Optimal Prompt Learning, and incorporates two modules\u2014Cross-Level Propagation and Mutual Contrastive Learning\u2014for enhanced hierarchical interactions.", "result": "Experiments on three TCGA datasets show that HiLa achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in survival prediction.", "conclusion": "HiLa effectively addresses limitations in vision-language alignment and hierarchical modeling, making it a promising solution for survival prediction using WSIs."}}

However, the main challenge of using machine learning algorithms\nis that most of them have many parameters and without optimizing these\nparameters, developing a high-performance model is not possible. This paper\nproposes an approach to optimize the hyperparameters of machine learning. The\nmetaheuristic optimization algorithms simulated annealing (SA) and adaptive\nsimulated annealing (ASA) are proposed to optimize the parameters of extreme\ngradient boosting (XGB) and categorical boosting (CaB). The newly proposed\nalgorithms are SA-XGB, ASA-XGB, SA-CaB, ASA-CaB. Grid search (GS), which is a\ntraditional approach used for machine learning fine-tunning is also used to\nfine-tune the parameters of XGB and CaB, which are named GS-XGB and GS-CaB. The\nsix algorithms are trained and tested using eight data groups obtained from the\nfeature selection phase. The results show ASA-CaB outperformed all the proposed\nalgorithms with accuracy, precision, recall, and f1 of 83.3%, 83.2%, 83.3%,\n83.2%, respectively.", "AI": {"tldr": "This paper leverages machine learning with metaheuristic optimization techniques to develop an e-triage tool for emergency departments, achieving significant improvements in predictive performance.", "motivation": "The paper aims to address the critical need for efficient and automated patient triage systems in emergency departments by enhancing existing tools with machine learning techniques.", "method": "The approach involves metaheuristic optimization algorithms (SA and ASA) to fine-tune machine learning models (XGB and CaB).

Furthermore, to better preserve the coherence and integrity of\nvascular topology, the HTC\n  module incorporates hierarchical topological constraints-spanning linear,\nplanar, and volumetric\n  levels-which serve to regularize the network's representation of vascular\ncontinuity and structural\n  consistency. We replaced the standard convolutional layers in U-Net, FCN,\nU-Mamba, and nnUNet\n  with SSL convolutions, leading to consistent performance improvements across\nall architectures.\n  Furthermore, when integrated into the nnUNet framework, our method\noutperformed other methods\n  on multiple metrics, achieving state-of-the-art vascular segmentation\nperformance.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper presents PASC Net, a novel vessel segmentation framework that addresses challenges like missing small vascular branches and incorrect topology in blood vessel segmentation through advanced convolutional optimization and topology constraints.", "motivation": "Current vessel segmentation methods struggle with accurately capturing small vascular branches and maintaining the vascular tree's complex topology, leading to incomplete and incorrect segmentation.", "method": "The framework incorporates two modules: the shape self-learning (SSL) module, which uses learnable strip convolutions for fine-grained feature capture, and the hierarchical topological constraint (HTC) module, which enforces vascular continuity across multiple structural levels.", "result": "Replacing standard convolutional layers in segmentation architectures with SSL convolutions showed consistent improvements.
