How can an\nAI system determine which viewpoint offers the most valuable insight for\naccurate and efficient 3D object reconstruction? Active view selection (AVS)\nfor 3D reconstruction remains a fundamental challenge in computer vision.

Instead of learning radiance fields, like NeRF or 3D Gaussian\nSplatting, from a current observation and computing uncertainty for each\ncandidate viewpoint, we introduce a novel AVS approach guided by neural\nuncertainty maps predicted by a lightweight feedforward deep neural network,\nnamed UPNet. UPNet takes a single input image of a 3D object and outputs a\npredicted uncertainty map, representing uncertainty values across all possible\ncandidate viewpoints.

Furthermore, C-AFBiFPN innovatively\nintegrates BiFormer attention within the fusion strategy of BiFPN, creating the\nAFBiFPN network. AFBiFPN improves the global modeling capability of cross-scale\nfeature fusion and can adaptively focus on critical feature regions.

While generative AI\ncan produce visually appealing images they often lack actionable data for\ndesigners In this work, we propose a novel pipeline that integrates DALL-E 3\nwith a materials dataset to enrich AI-generated designs with sustainability\nmetrics and material usage insights. After the model generates an interior\ndesign image, a post-processing module identifies the top ten materials present\nand pairs them with carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) values from a general\nmaterials dictionary. This approach allows designers to immediately evaluate\nenvironmental impacts and refine prompts accordingly. We evaluate the system\nthrough three user tests: (1) no mention of sustainability to the user prior to\nthe prompting process with generative AI, (2) sustainability goals communicated\nto the user before prompting, and (3) sustainability goals communicated along\nwith quantitative CO2e data included in the generative AI outputs. Our\nqualitative and quantitative analyses reveal that the introduction of\nsustainability metrics in the third test leads to more informed design\ndecisions, however, it can also trigger decision fatigue and lower overall\nsatisfaction. Nevertheless, the majority of participants reported incorporating\nsustainability principles into their workflows in the third test, underscoring\nthe potential of integrated metrics to guide more ecologically responsible\npractices.
