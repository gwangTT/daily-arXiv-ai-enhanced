Our method involves detecting Regions of Interest (RoIs)\nusing YOLOv11, cropping relevant image segments, and converting them into\ncompact embedding vectors using a Vision Transformer (ViT). These embeddings\nare then transmitted to the cloud, where an image decoder reconstructs the\ncropped images. The reconstructed images are processed by a multimodal LLM to\ngenerate traffic condition descriptions. This approach achieves a 99.9%\nreduction in data transmission size while maintaining an LLM response accuracy\nof 89% for reconstructed cropped images, compared to 93% accuracy with original\ncropped images.
