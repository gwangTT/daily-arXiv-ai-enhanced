In this\npaper, we address this challenge by first identifying and quantifying a\ncritical failure mode we term Document-Level Retrieval Mismatch (DRM), where\nthe retriever selects information from entirely incorrect source documents. To\nmitigate DRM, we investigate a simple and computationally efficient technique\nwhich we refer to as Summary-Augmented Chunking (SAC). This method enhances\neach text chunk with a document-level synthetic summary, thereby injecting\ncrucial global context that would otherwise be lost during a standard chunking\nprocess. Our experiments on a diverse set of legal information retrieval tasks\nshow that SAC greatly reduces DRM and, consequently, also improves text-level\nretrieval precision and recall. Interestingly, we find that a generic\nsummarization strategy outperforms an approach that incorporates legal expert\ndomain knowledge to target specific legal elements.

When instructions\nprovide only a general and abstract goal without specific details about\npotential issues in the response, LLMs must rely on their internal knowledge to\nimprove response quality, a process referred to as intrinsic self-correction.\nThe empirical success of intrinsic self-correction is evident in various\napplications, but how and why it is effective remains unknown. Focusing on\nmoral self-correction in LLMs, we reveal a key characteristic of intrinsic\nself-correction: performance convergence through multi-round interactions; and\nprovide a mechanistic analysis of this convergence behavior. Based on our\nexperimental results and analysis, we uncover the underlying mechanism of\nconvergence: consistently injected self-correction instructions activate moral\nconcepts that reduce model uncertainty, leading to converged performance as the\nactivated moral concepts stabilize over successive rounds.
