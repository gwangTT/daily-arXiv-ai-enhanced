*Anant Pareek*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper integrates AI with computational psychology, offering a scalable framework for predictive modeling and human-AI interaction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bridge the gap between isolated predictive modeling and interactive psychological analysis.

Method: Developed benchmarks, fine-tuned transformer models, addressed engineering challenges, deployed models in a scalable microservices ecosystem.

Result: Transformer models were stabilized for affective computing, and a replicable methodology for large-scale AI democratization was developed.

Conclusion: The research provides a holistic research-to-deployment pipeline for applications in computational psychology and human-AI interaction.

Abstract: The confluence of Artificial Intelligence and Computational Psychology
presents an opportunity to model, understand, and interact with complex human
psychological states through computational means. This paper presents a
comprehensive, multi-faceted framework designed to bridge the gap between
isolated predictive modeling and an interactive system for psychological
analysis. The methodology encompasses a rigorous, end-to-end development
lifecycle. First, foundational performance benchmarks were established on four
diverse psychological datasets using classical machine learning techniques.
Second, state-of-the-art transformer models were fine-tuned, a process that
necessitated the development of effective solutions to overcome critical
engineering challenges, including the resolution of numerical instability in
regression tasks and the creation of a systematic workflow for conducting
large-scale training under severe resource constraints. Third, a generative
large language model (LLM) was fine-tuned using parameter-efficient techniques
to function as an interactive "Personality Brain." Finally, the entire suite of
predictive and generative models was architected and deployed as a robust,
scalable microservices ecosystem. Key findings include the successful
stabilization of transformer-based regression models for affective computing,
showing meaningful predictive performance where standard approaches failed, and
the development of a replicable methodology for democratizing large-scale AI
research. The significance of this work lies in its holistic approach,
demonstrating a complete research-to-deployment pipeline that integrates
predictive analysis with generative dialogue, thereby providing a practical
model for future research in computational psychology and human-AI interaction.

### [2] [HW/SW Co-design of a PCM/PWM converter: a System Level Approach based in the SpecC Methodology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22046)
*Daniel G. P. Petrini,Braz Izaias da Silva Junior*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper applies the SpecC methodology for hardware/software co-design to optimize a PCM-to-PWM converter for Class-D audio amplifiers, demonstrating architectural insights and cost-effective trade-offs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to find cost-effective and real-time hardware/software solutions for a moderately complex system (PCM-to-PWM converter) using system-level co-design.

Method: The SpecC methodology is utilized to model, explore, and evaluate the hardware/software partitioning of the PCM-to-PWM converter while meeting constraints through system-level estimates and functional simulation.

Result: The approach achieved mappings that meet real-time constraints, reduced the cost of an all-hardware solution, and avoided the expense of high-end software implementation.

Conclusion: System-level co-design using the SpecC methodology proved valuable for early architectural insights, validation, and achieving actionable cost/performance trade-offs for the target system.

Abstract: We present a case study applying the SpecC methodology within a system-level
hardware/software co-design flow to a PCM-to-PWM converter, the core of a
Class-D audio amplifier. The converter was modeled and explored with SpecC
methodology to derive an HW/SW partition. Using system-level estimates and fast
functional simulation, we evaluated mappings that meet real-time constraints
while reducing estimated cost of an all-hardware solution and avoiding the
expense of a purely software implementation on a high-end processor. Despite
the design's moderate complexity, the results underline the value of
system-level co-design for early architectural insight, rapid validation, and
actionable cost/performance trade-offs. [Original work from 2005; formatting

### [3] [PREFINE: Personalized Story Generation via Simulated User Critics and User-Specific Rubric Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21721)
*Kentaro Ueda,Takehiro Takayanagi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces PREFINE, a new framework for personalized text generation using pseudo-user agents to evaluate and refine outputs based on user-specific rubrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current challenges in personalized story generation include issues with user burden, data collection, computational costs, and privacy in conventional methods relying on fine-tuning or explicit feedback.

Method: The proposed PREFINE framework uses user interaction history to create a pseudo-user agent and tailored rubrics for personalized critique and refinement of generated outputs without requiring parameter updates or direct feedback.

Result: PREFINE outperformed baseline methods in automatic evaluations and demonstrated the importance of its pseudo-user agent and rubrics in enhancing personalization.

Conclusion: PREFINE effectively personalizes text generation, offering scalable solutions for applications in story generation, dialogue systems, education, and recommendations.

Abstract: While recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have improved the
quality of creative text generation, significant challenges remain in producing
personalized stories that reflect individual user preferences. Conventional
approaches rely on explicit feedback or fine-tuning, which presents practical
issues regarding user burden, data collection, computational costs, and
privacy. In this work, we propose PREFINE (Persona-and-Rubric Guided
Critique-and-Refine), a novel framework that extends the Critique-and-Refine
paradigm to personalization. PREFINE constructs a pseudo-user agent from a
user's interaction history and generates user-specific rubrics (evaluation
criteria). By having this agent critique and refine outputs on the user's
behalf based on these tailored rubrics, our method achieves personalized
generation without requiring parameter updates or direct user feedback. We
conducted a comprehensive evaluation on the PerDOC and PerMPST story datasets.
We designed three baseline methods and several model variants to verify the
contribution of each component of our framework. In automatic evaluations
(LLM-as-a-Judge), PREFINE achieved higher win rates and statistically
significant scores than the baselines, without compromising general story
quality. Analysis of the model variants confirmed that both the pseudo-user
agent and the user-specific rubrics are crucial for enhancing personalization
performance. Beyond story generation, our approach holds potential for enabling
efficient personalization in broader applications, such as dialogue systems,
education, and recommendation.

### [4] [SIGN: Schema-Induced Games for Naming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21855)
*Ryan Zhang,Herbert Woisetscläger*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Schema-Induced Games for Naming (SIGN) and shows how lightweight structure improves coordination in LLM-based systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve convention consistency among large language model agents for reliable and scalable communication in complex AI systems.

Method: The authors propose a schema-induced naming game (SIGN) to test how structured communication impacts convention formation compared to unconstrained language.

Result: The structured approach showed faster agreement in communication with up to 5.8x higher convergence compared to natural language.

Conclusion: Minimal structure in communication acts as an effective tool for better multi-agent coordination, with implications across broader applications.

Abstract: Real-world AI systems are tackling increasingly complex problems, often
through interactions among large language model (LLM) agents. When these agents
develop inconsistent conventions, coordination can break down. Applications
such as collaborative coding and distributed planning therefore require
reliable, consistent communication, and scalability is a central concern as
systems grow. We introduce Schema-Induced Games for Naming (SIGN), a naming
game that examines how lightweight structure can steer convention formation. We
compare schema-induced communication to unconstrained natural language and find
faster convergence with up to 5.8x higher agreement. These results suggest that
minimal structure can act as a simple control knob for efficient multi-agent
coordination, pointing toward broader applications beyond the naming game.

### [5] [Capability Ceilings in Autoregressive Language Models: Empirical Evidence from Knowledge-Intensive Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21866)
*Javier Marín*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper investigates the limitations of decoder-only autoregressive language models in scaling, focusing on the OPT and Pythia families. It identifies capability-specific accuracy ceilings for knowledge-intensive tasks despite improved cross-entropy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why scaling in decoder-only autoregressive language models fails to lead to consistent accuracy improvements in knowledge-intensive tasks, despite smoother loss reduction.

Method: Empirical evaluation of scaling behavior using the OPT and Pythia model families (70M-30B parameters) on knowledge retrieval and procedural tasks, combined with attention intervention experiments.

Result: Accuracy in knowledge retrieval tasks shows negligible improvement with scaling, while procedural tasks like arithmetic exhibit conventional scaling behavior. Attention pattern perturbation leads to catastrophic performance collapse.

Conclusion: Parameter scaling beyond 1-2B in OPT and Pythia architectures provides minimal accuracy improvement in knowledge-intensive tasks. This raises questions about architectural constraints or implementation-specific limitations.

Abstract: We document empirical capability ceilings in decoder-only autoregressive
language models across knowledge-intensive tasks. Systematic evaluation of OPT
and Pythia model families (70M-30B parameters, spanning 240 times scaling)
reveals that knowledge retrieval tasks show negligible accuracy improvement
despite smooth loss reduction. On MMLU mathematics benchmarks, accuracy remains
flat at 19-20% (below 25% random chance) across all scales while cross-entropy
loss decreases by 31%. In contrast, procedural tasks like arithmetic show
conventional scaling where both metrics improve together. Attention
intervention experiments reveal high sensitivity to perturbation: swapping
attention patterns between models causes catastrophic performance collapse
(complete accuracy loss) rather than graceful degradation. These measurements
have immediate engineering implications: for knowledge-intensive applications
using OPT and Pythia architectures, parameter scaling beyond 1-2B offers
minimal accuracy gains despite continued loss improvement. Our findings
quantify capability-specific scaling failures in these model families to inform
resource allocation decisions. Whether these patterns reflect fundamental
constraints of decoder-only architectures or implementation-specific
limitations remains an open question requiring investigation across diverse
architectural approaches.

### [6] [GeoThought: A Dataset for Enhancing Mathematical Geometry Reasoning in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21881)
*Nannan Shi,Chuanyu Qin,Shipeng Song,Man Luo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper addresses the gap in visual reasoning tasks for large language models, specifically in solving geometric problems, by introducing a novel dataset (GeoThoughts) and a new model (GeoThought-MLLM).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Geometric problem solving presents unique challenges due to the complexity of image comprehension and multi-step reasoning, alongside limitations in existing datasets that lack scale, diversity, and explicit reasoning traces.

Method: The authors constructed the GeoThoughts dataset which includes visual descriptions, step-by-step solutions, reasoning chains, reflection steps, and answers. They developed the GeoThought-MLLM model trained on this Chain-of-Thought dataset.

Result: The GeoThought-MLLM outperformed existing benchmarks in solving geometric tasks, both in in-domain and out-of-domain scenarios, effectively improving visual reasoning capabilities.

Conclusion: Explicit reasoning chains and dataset augmentation can address limitations in visual reasoning, and invoking Chain-of-Thought improves both model accuracy and understanding of error sources in geometric tasks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong reasoning capabilities
in text-based mathematical problem solving; however, when adapted to visual
reasoning tasks, particularly geometric problem solving, their performance
substantially declines because geometric problems present unique challenges.
Specifically, these challenges stem from two key factors: first, the intrinsic
complexity of geometry requiring detailed image comprehension and multi-step
reasoning, and second, the limitations of existing datasets which lack
sufficient scale, diversity, and explicit reasoning traces, consequently
hindering effective model training. To address these challenges, we developed
the GeoThoughts dataset, a comprehensive geometric reasoning corpus with two
subsets: Geo-Thought-6K with 6,243 samples and its augmented version
Geo-Thought-Augmented-10K containing 10,834 samples. Each entry includes visual
descriptions, step-by-step solutions, explicit reasoning chains, reflection
steps, and final answers. Using this dataset, we developed GeoThought-MLLM, a
mathematical reasoning multimodal model that generates detailed thinking
processes during problem-solving. Our model outperforms existing benchmarks in
geometric tasks, demonstrating that training with our Chain-of-Thought dataset
improves geometric reasoning capabilities across both in-domain and
out-of-domain settings. Finally, we analyze failure cases and observe that
errors primarily arise from incorrect interpretation of mathematical concepts
or spatial misjudgment. By invoking CoT to correct these mistakes, the model
produces correct answers.

### [7] [Exploration through Generation: Applying GFlowNets to Structured Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21886)
*Mark Phillip Matovic*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper explores using Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) to solve graph optimization problems like Traveling Salesperson Problem, Minimum Spanning Tree, and Shortest Path, showing their ability to match solutions from classical algorithms and potentially scaling better for larger problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Graph optimization problems like TSP, MST, and Shortest Path are challenging for classical algorithms as problem size expands—motivating exploration of generative models for scalable and efficient solutions.

Method: Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) are trained using Trajectory Balance loss. They build solutions sequentially, selecting graph components (edges, nodes, etc.) based on reward functions, to approximate problem optima.

Result: GFlowNets successfully generated solutions matching classical algorithms (e.g., Dijkstra, Kruskal) and scaled well with increasing graph sizes during benchmarking on several instances.

Conclusion: Generative models like GFlowNets can effectively tackle combinatorial optimization problems. They provide computational scalability and have the potential to outperform classical methods in handling larger problem instances.

Abstract: This work applies Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) to three graph
optimization problems: the Traveling Salesperson Problem, Minimum Spanning
Tree, and Shortest Path. GFlowNets are generative models that learn to sample
solutions proportionally to a reward function. The models are trained using the
Trajectory Balance loss to build solutions sequentially, selecting edges for
spanning trees, nodes for paths, and cities for tours. Experiments on benchmark
instances of varying sizes show that GFlowNets learn to find optimal solutions.
For each problem type, multiple graph configurations with different numbers of
nodes were tested. The generated solutions match those from classical
algorithms (Dijkstra for shortest path, Kruskal for spanning trees, and exact
solvers for TSP). Training convergence depends on problem complexity, with the
number of episodes required for loss stabilization increasing as graph size
grows. Once training converges, the generated solutions match known optima from
classical algorithms across the tested instances. This work demonstrates that
generative models can solve combinatorial optimization problems through learned
policies. The main advantage of this learning-based approach is computational
scalability: while classical algorithms have fixed complexity per instance,
GFlowNets amortize computation through training. With sufficient computational
resources, the framework could potentially scale to larger problem instances
where classical exact methods become infeasible.

### [8] [Computational Hardness of Reinforcement Learning with Partial $q^π$-Realizability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21888)
*Shayan Karimi,Xiaoqi Tan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper explores the computational complexity of reinforcement learning in a new framework called partial $q^{\pi}$-realizability and demonstrates its NP-hardness for learning an optimal policy under certain conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate a more practical function approximation framework in reinforcement learning that sits between $q^{\pi}$-realizability and $q^*$-realizability.

Method: The authors analyze the framework by proving NP-hardness for learning optimal policies using reductions from known complexity problems ($\delta$-Max-3SAT and its variants) and establish exponential lower bounds under specific conditions.

Result: Demonstrates computational difficulty in learning optimal policies in the partial $q^{\pi}$-realizability framework, even when the policy set is expanded beyond optimal policies.

Conclusion: The study suggests that weak assumptions of partial $q^{\pi}$-realizability do not lead to computationally feasible reinforcement learning outcomes.

Abstract: This paper investigates the computational complexity of reinforcement
learning in a novel linear function approximation regime, termed partial
$q^{\pi}$-realizability. In this framework, the objective is to learn an
$\epsilon$-optimal policy with respect to a predefined policy set $\Pi$, under
the assumption that all value functions for policies in $\Pi$ are linearly
realizable. The assumptions of this framework are weaker than those in
$q^{\pi}$-realizability but stronger than those in $q^*$-realizability,
providing a practical model where function approximation naturally arises. We
prove that learning an $\epsilon$-optimal policy in this setting is
computationally hard. Specifically, we establish NP-hardness under a
parameterized greedy policy set (argmax) and show that - unless NP = RP - an
exponential lower bound (in feature vector dimension) holds when the policy set
contains softmax policies, under the Randomized Exponential Time Hypothesis.
Our hardness results mirror those in $q^*$-realizability and suggest
computational difficulty persists even when $\Pi$ is expanded beyond the
optimal policy. To establish this, we reduce from two complexity problems,
$\delta$-Max-3SAT and $\delta$-Max-3SAT(b), to instances of GLinear-$\kappa$-RL
(greedy policy) and SLinear-$\kappa$-RL (softmax policy). Our findings indicate
that positive computational results are generally unattainable in partial
$q^{\pi}$-realizability, in contrast to $q^{\pi}$-realizability under a
generative access model.

### [9] [Performance Trade-offs of Optimizing Small Language Models for E-Commerce](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21970)
*Josip Tomo Licardo,Nikola Tankovic*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper explores optimizing a smaller 1B-parameter Llama 3.2 model using fine-tuning and quantization techniques to match the performance of larger models like GPT-4.1 for e-commerce intent recognition, achieving comparable accuracy with lower computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this paper is to address the high computational costs, latency, and operational expenses of deploying large language models (LLMs) in specialized applications like e-commerce, and to find resource-efficient alternatives.

Method: The methodology involves fine-tuning a 1B-parameter Llama 3.2 model using QLoRA on synthetic datasets mimicking real-world user queries. Post-training quantization techniques (GPTQ for GPU and GGUF for CPU) were applied for optimization.

Result: This optimized smaller model achieved 99% accuracy, matching the larger GPT-4.1 model's performance. While GPTQ reduced VRAM usage on GPUs, it caused slower inference on older architectures. Meanwhile, GGUF on CPUs resulted in significant inference speedup and RAM savings.

Conclusion: The study concludes that smaller, optimized open-weight models are suitable and efficient for domain-specific tasks, offering state-of-the-art accuracy with significantly lower computational cost compared to larger models.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) offer state-of-the-art performance in natural
language understanding and generation tasks. However, the deployment of leading
commercial models for specialized tasks, such as e-commerce, is often hindered
by high computational costs, latency, and operational expenses. This paper
investigates the viability of smaller, open-weight models as a
resource-efficient alternative. We present a methodology for optimizing a
one-billion-parameter Llama 3.2 model for multilingual e-commerce intent
recognition. The model was fine-tuned using Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation
(QLoRA) on a synthetically generated dataset designed to mimic real-world user
queries. Subsequently, we applied post-training quantization techniques,
creating GPU-optimized (GPTQ) and CPU-optimized (GGUF) versions. Our results
demonstrate that the specialized 1B model achieves 99% accuracy, matching the
performance of the significantly larger GPT-4.1 model. A detailed performance
analysis revealed critical, hardware-dependent trade-offs: while 4-bit GPTQ
reduced VRAM usage by 41%, it paradoxically slowed inference by 82% on an older
GPU architecture (NVIDIA T4) due to dequantization overhead. Conversely, GGUF
formats on a CPU achieved a speedup of up to 18x in inference throughput and a
reduction of over 90% in RAM consumption compared to the FP16 baseline. We
conclude that small, properly optimized open-weight models are not just a
viable but a more suitable alternative for domain-specific applications,
offering state-of-the-art accuracy at a fraction of the computational cost.

### [10] [Distribution Shift Alignment Helps LLMs Simulate Survey Response Distributions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21977)
*Ji Huang,Mengfei Li,Shuai Shao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Distribution Shift Alignment (DSA), a novel fine-tuning method for large language models (LLMs) to simulate human survey responses more accurately. DSA outperforms existing methods, optimizing data usage and improving alignment to true distributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve the accuracy and prompt reliability of LLMs in simulating survey responses, addressing the limitations of zero-shot methods and conventional fine-tuning approaches.

Method: The proposed method, DSA, involves a two-stage fine-tuning process that focuses on aligning output distributions and distribution shifts across diverse backgrounds.

Result: DSA demonstrated superior performance on five survey datasets, outperforming other methods in accuracy, robustness, and data efficiency while reducing real data requirements by up to 69.12%.

Conclusion: DSA effectively enhances survey simulations by aligning distribution shifts, offering accurate and efficient data collection solutions for large-scale surveys.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) offer a promising way to simulate human survey
responses, potentially reducing the cost of large-scale data collection.
However, existing zero-shot methods suffer from prompt sensitivity and low
accuracy, while conventional fine-tuning approaches mostly fit the training set
distributions and struggle to produce results more accurate than the training
set itself, which deviates from the original goal of using LLMs to simulate
survey responses. Building on this observation, we introduce Distribution Shift
Alignment (DSA), a two-stage fine-tuning method that aligns both the output
distributions and the distribution shifts across different backgrounds. By
learning how these distributions change rather than fitting training data, DSA
can provide results substantially closer to the true distribution than the
training data. Empirically, DSA consistently outperforms other methods on five
public survey datasets. We further conduct a comprehensive comparison covering
accuracy, robustness, and data savings. DSA reduces the required real data by
53.48-69.12%, demonstrating its effectiveness and efficiency in survey
simulation.

*Zhenya Huang,Jiayu Liu,Xin Lin,Zhiyuan Ma,Shangzi Xue,Tong Xiao,Qi Liu,Yee Whye Teh,Enhong Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper reviews math word problem (MWP) solving approaches, focusing on how AI advances cognitive abilities, and organizes a comprehensive taxonomy and performance comparison of models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the lack of a systematic taxonomy and provide insights into the development trends of MWP-solving AI, exploring advances in human-like cognitive reasoning.

Method: The authors analyzed MWP-solving approaches from human cognitive perspectives, categorized models into neural network solvers and large language models (LLMs), and evaluated performance on 5 benchmarks.

Result: They identified 5 key cognitive abilities essential for MWP solving, demonstrated advancements of AI models in these areas, and presented a unified comparative study across benchmarks.

Conclusion: The survey offers a comprehensive review of influencing MWP-solving research, sheds light on cognitive simulation progress, and aims to inspire further AI reasoning research.

Abstract: Math word problem (MWP) serves as a fundamental research topic in artificial
intelligence (AI) dating back to 1960s. This research aims to advance the
reasoning abilities of AI by mirroring the human-like cognitive intelligence.
The mainstream technological paradigm has evolved from the early rule-based
methods, to deep learning models, and is rapidly advancing towards large
language models. However, the field still lacks a systematic taxonomy for the
MWP survey along with a discussion of current development trends. Therefore, in
this paper, we aim to comprehensively review related research in MWP solving
through the lens of human cognition, to demonstrate how recent AI models are
advancing in simulating human cognitive abilities. Specifically, we summarize 5
crucial cognitive abilities for MWP solving, including Problem Understanding,
Logical Organization, Associative Memory, Critical Thinking, and Knowledge
Learning. Focused on these abilities, we review two mainstream MWP models in
recent 10 years: neural network solvers, and LLM based solvers, and discuss the
core human-like abilities they demonstrated in their intricate problem-solving
process. Moreover, we rerun all the representative MWP solvers and supplement
their performance on 5 mainstream benchmarks for a unified comparison. To the
best of our knowledge, this survey first comprehensively analyzes the
influential MWP research of the past decade from the perspective of human
reasoning cognition and provides an integrative overall comparison across
existing approaches. We hope it can inspire further research in AI reasoning.

### [12] [LightAgent: Mobile Agentic Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22009)
*Yangqin Jiang,Chao Huang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LightAgent is a mobile agent foundation model that combines device-cloud collaboration to balance cost-efficiency and high capability for GUI systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mobile GUI agents potentially transform app interactions but face limitations due to resource constraints on devices and costs from cloud-dependent models.

Method: LightAgent employs device-cloud collaboration, enhancing Qwen2.5-VL-3B through specialized training and real-time complexity assessment for efficient task execution.

Result: LightAgent achieves comparable or near performance to larger models on benchmarks while significantly lowering cloud-related costs.

Conclusion: The proposed approach demonstrates effective performance for mobile GUI agents without compromising efficiency or affordability.

Abstract: With the advancement of multimodal large language models (MLLMs), building
GUI agent systems has become an increasingly promising direction-especially for
mobile platforms, given their rich app ecosystems and intuitive touch
interactions. Yet mobile GUI agents face a critical dilemma: truly on-device
models (4B or smaller) lack sufficient performance, while capable models
(starting from 7B) are either too large for mobile deployment or prohibitively
costly (e.g., cloud-only closed-source MLLMs). To resolve this, we propose
LightAgent, a mobile agentic foundation model solution that leverages
device-cloud collaboration to tap the cost-efficiency of on-device models and
the high capability of cloud models, while avoiding their drawbacks.
Specifically, LightAgent enhances Qwen2.5-VL-3B via two-stage SFT->GRPO
training on synthetic GUI data for strong decision-making, integrates an
efficient long-reasoning mechanism to utilize historical interactions under
tight resources, and defaults to on-device execution-only escalating
challenging subtasks to the cloud via real-time complexity assessment.
Experiments on the online AndroidLab benchmark and diverse apps show LightAgent
matches or nears larger models, with a significant reduction in cloud costs.

*Rick Chen,Joseph Ternasky,Aaron Ontoyin Yin,Xianling Mu,Fuat Alican,Yigit Ihlamur*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper presents a method to enhance the reliability of large language models (LLMs) for predicting startup success using founder traits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of inconsistent accuracy in LLMs for high-stakes decision-making, using the case of predicting startup success.

Method: They propose LLM-AR, a system that translates LLM-generated heuristics into probabilistic rules executed by the ProbLog reasoning engine and refines rules through iterative policy evolution and association-rule mining.

Result: LLM-AR achieved a precision of 59.5% and recall of 8.7%, significantly outperforming the random baseline by 5.9 times.

Conclusion: The interpretable and tunable framework demonstrates potential for application in other domains.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can already identify patterns and reason
effectively, yet their variable accuracy hampers adoption in high-stakes
decision-making applications. In this paper, we study this issue from a venture
capital perspective by predicting idea-stage startup success based on founder
traits. (i) To build a reliable prediction model, we introduce LLM-AR, a
pipeline inspired by neural-symbolic systems that distils LLM-generated
heuristics into probabilistic rules executed by the ProbLog automated-reasoning
engine. (ii) An iterative policy-evolution loop incorporates association-rule
mining to progressively refine the prediction rules.
  On unseen folds, LLM-AR achieves 59.5% precision and 8.7% recall, 5.9x the
random baseline precision, while exposing every decision path for human
inspection. The framework is interpretable and tunable via hyperparameters,
showing promise to extend into other domains.

### [14] [Predictive Coding Enhances Meta-RL To Achieve Interpretable Bayes-Optimal Belief Representation Under Partial Observability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22039)
*Po-Chen Kuo,Han Hou,Will Dabney,Edgar Y. Walker*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This research integrates predictive coding modules into meta-RL to improve learning of Bayes-optimal representations and generalization in partially observable environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to address representational inefficiency in meta-RL agents, which limits adaptability and generalization in partially observable environments.

Method: The study investigates embedding self-supervised predictive coding modules inspired by neuroscience into meta-RL systems, evaluating these representations through various tasks and state machine simulations.

Result: Meta-RL with predictive modules outperformed conventional meta-RL, learning interpretable Bayes-optimal representations and achieving better policies, especially in complex tasks requiring active information seeking.

Conclusion: Predictive coding enhances representation learning in meta-RL and improves generalization, supporting its role as a guiding principle in partially observable environments.

Abstract: Learning a compact representation of history is critical for planning and
generalization in partially observable environments. While meta-reinforcement
learning (RL) agents can attain near Bayes-optimal policies, they often fail to
learn the compact, interpretable Bayes-optimal belief states. This
representational inefficiency potentially limits the agent's adaptability and
generalization capacity. Inspired by predictive coding in neuroscience--which
suggests that the brain predicts sensory inputs as a neural implementation of
Bayesian inference--and by auxiliary predictive objectives in deep RL, we
investigate whether integrating self-supervised predictive coding modules into
meta-RL can facilitate learning of Bayes-optimal representations. Through state
machine simulation, we show that meta-RL with predictive modules consistently
generates more interpretable representations that better approximate
Bayes-optimal belief states compared to conventional meta-RL across a wide
variety of tasks, even when both achieve optimal policies. In challenging tasks
requiring active information seeking, only meta-RL with predictive modules
successfully learns optimal representations and policies, whereas conventional
meta-RL struggles with inadequate representation learning. Finally, we
demonstrate that better representation learning leads to improved
generalization. Our results strongly suggest the role of predictive learning as
a guiding principle for effective representation learning in agents navigating
partial observability.

*Abolfazl Younesi,Zahra Najafabadi Samani,Thomas Fahringer*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AutoStreamPipe is a framework that uses Large Language Models to design and deploy efficient stream processing pipelines, significantly cutting development time and reducing error rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Simplify and automate stream processing pipeline design to reduce development time and errors for real-time data analysis.

Method: Uses a Hypergraph of Thoughts (HGoT) and integrates LLMs to interpret user intent and create platform-specific pipeline implementations.

Result: Experimentation shows AutoStreamPipe reduces development time by 6.3x and error rates by 5.19x as evaluated by an Error-Free Score (EFS).

Conclusion: AutoStreamPipe demonstrates strong effectiveness in streamlining pipeline creation while improving accuracy, showing clear advancements over LLM code-generation methods.

Abstract: Data pipelines are essential in stream processing as they enable the
efficient collection, processing, and delivery of real-time data, supporting
rapid data analysis. In this paper, we present AutoStreamPipe, a novel
framework that employs Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate the design,
generation, and deployment of stream processing pipelines. AutoStreamPipe
bridges the semantic gap between high-level user intent and platform-specific
implementations across distributed stream processing systems for structured
multi-agent reasoning by integrating a Hypergraph of Thoughts (HGoT) as an
extended version of GoT. AutoStreamPipe combines resilient execution
strategies, advanced query analysis, and HGoT to deliver pipelines with good
accuracy. Experimental evaluations on diverse pipelines demonstrate that
AutoStreamPipe significantly reduces development time (x6.3) and error rates
(x5.19), as measured by a novel Error-Free Score (EFS), compared to LLM
code-generation methods.

### [16] [Towards Error-Centric Intelligence II: Energy-Structured Causal Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22050)
*Marcus Thomas*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper critiques contemporary machine learning (ML) methods for their lack of causal transparency and introduces Energy Structured Causal Models (ESCMs) as an approach to incorporate causal reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the inability of current ML models to provide causal explanations or manipulate specific mechanisms within their internal representations.

Method: The authors propose using ESCMs, which define mechanisms as energy constraints rather than direct input-output mappings, allowing for interventions on these energy-based constraints to reveal causal structures.

Result: The results highlight that ESCMs align with structural causal principles and can recover standard Structural Causal Model (SCM) semantics under certain conditions, bridging predictive accuracy with causal reasoning.

Conclusion: The paper advocates rethinking intelligence as the ability to construct and refine causal explanations, presenting ESCMs as a framework to enable models to go beyond prediction and towards true understanding through causally manipulable structures.

Abstract: Contemporary machine learning optimizes for predictive accuracy, yet systems
that achieve state of the art performance remain causally opaque: their
internal representations provide no principled handle for intervention. We can
retrain such models, but we cannot surgically edit specific mechanisms while
holding others fixed, because learned latent variables lack causal semantics.
We argue for a conceptual reorientation: intelligence is the ability to build
and refine explanations, falsifiable claims about manipulable structure that
specify what changes and what remains invariant under intervention.
Explanations subsume prediction but demand more: causal commitments that can be
independently tested and corrected at the level of mechanisms. We introduce
computational explanations, mappings from observations to intervention ready
causal accounts. We instantiate these explanations with Energy Structured
Causal Models (ESCMs), in which mechanisms are expressed as constraints (energy
functions or vector fields) rather than explicit input output maps, and
interventions act by local surgery on those constraints. This shift makes
internal structure manipulable at the level where explanations live: which
relations must hold, which can change, and what follows when they do. We
provide concrete instantiations of the structural-causal principles LAP and ICM
in the ESCM context, and also argue that empirical risk minimization
systematically produces fractured, entangled representations, a failure we
analyze as gauge ambiguity in encoder energy pairs. Finally, we show that under
mild conditions, ESCMs recover standard SCM semantics. Building on Part I's
principles (LAP, ICM, CAP) and its definition of intelligence as
explanation-building under criticism, this paper offers a formal language for
causal reasoning in systems that aspire to understand, not merely to predict.

*Abhijit Chatterjee,Niraj K. Jha,Jonathan D. Cohen,Thomas L. Griffiths,Hongjing Lu,Diana Marculescu,Ashiqur Rasul,Keshab K. Parhi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper calls for the evolution of AI systems from current large models towards domain-specific, energy-efficient agents capable of reasoning, learning, and decision-making in dynamic environments with uncertainty.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this study is the need to address challenges with current AI systems, such as high energy consumption, reliance on vast training data, and their inability to reliably perform in critical domains.

Method: The paper suggests advancing beyond large language models to develop lightweight, domain-specific, and intelligent systems with enhanced capability for reasoning, learning, and decision-making.

Result: It proposes a vision for future AI evolution, focusing on energy-efficient multimodal systems and novel hardware architectures with energy efficiencies over 1000x current technologies.

Conclusion: The next wave of AI will likely require a shift towards developing specialized, environmentally sustainable agents that can process real-time data and continuously evolve for better decision-making in uncertain environments.

Abstract: The field of artificial intelligence (AI) has taken a tight hold on broad
aspects of society, industry, business, and governance in ways that dictate the
prosperity and might of the world's economies. The AI market size is projected
to grow from 189 billion USD in 2023 to 4.8 trillion USD by 2033. Currently, AI
is dominated by large language models that exhibit linguistic and visual
intelligence. However, training these models requires a massive amount of data
scraped from the web as well as large amounts of energy (50--60 GWh to train
GPT-4). Despite these costs, these models often hallucinate, a characteristic
that prevents them from being deployed in critical application domains. In
contrast, the human brain consumes only 20~W of power. What is needed is the
next level of AI evolution in which lightweight domain-specific multimodal
models with higher levels of intelligence can reason, plan, and make decisions
in dynamic environments with real-time data and prior knowledge, while learning
continuously and evolving in ways that enhance future decision-making
capability. This will define the next wave of AI, progressing from today's
large models, trained with vast amounts of data, to nimble energy-efficient
domain-specific agents that can reason and think in a world full of
uncertainty. To support such agents, hardware will need to be reimagined to
allow energy efficiencies greater than 1000x over the state of the art. Such a
vision of future AI systems is developed in this work.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper addresses Brain-Agent Collaboration (BAC) as an evolution of Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs), advocating for collaborative AI agents to enhance usability while ensuring ethical and trustworthy frameworks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: BCIs have potential to aid individuals with neurological impairments but are hindered by challenges like low information transfer rates and complex calibration. This paper explores expanding the capabilities to involve collaborative AI agents.

Method: Discuss and propose a paradigm shift from BCIs to Brain-Agent Collaboration (BAC) by reimagining AI agents as active partners, while emphasizing ethical, reliable, and collaborative design.

Result: Advocates for a transition towards BAC for enhanced assistance and cognition understanding, and highlights existing challenges including ethical data handling.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that incorporating collaborative and agentic AI into BCIs could revolutionize the field, provided frameworks ensure safety, effectiveness, and ethical considerations.

Abstract: Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) offer a direct communication pathway between
the human brain and external devices, holding significant promise for
individuals with severe neurological impairments. However, their widespread
adoption is hindered by critical limitations, such as low information transfer
rates and extensive user-specific calibration. To overcome these challenges,
recent research has explored the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs),
extending the focus from simple command decoding to understanding complex
cognitive states. Despite these advancements, deploying agentic AI faces
technical hurdles and ethical concerns. Due to the lack of comprehensive
discussion on this emerging direction, this position paper argues that the
field is poised for a paradigm extension from BCI to Brain-Agent Collaboration
(BAC). We emphasize reframing agents as active and collaborative partners for
intelligent assistance rather than passive brain signal data processors,
demanding a focus on ethical data handling, model reliability, and a robust
human-agent collaboration framework to ensure these systems are safe,
trustworthy, and effective.

*Alexandra Yost,Shreyans Jain,Shivam Raval,Grant Corser,Allen Roush,Nina Xu,Jacqueline Hammack,Ravid Shwartz-Ziv,Amirali Abdullah*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper develops a framework for evaluating AI systems in emotional and ethical decision-making roles using situational judgment tests and sophisticated personas, focusing on realistic scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address limitations of prior approaches in AI psychometrics which reused human trait inventories or ad hoc personas, lacking behavioral realism and domain relevance.

Method: The method involves designing situational judgment tests (SJTs) drawn from realistic scenarios and creating detailed personas integrated with descriptors, life histories, and demographic priors, encoded with Pydantic schemas.

Result: In a case study of law enforcement assistants, the paper constructs a dataset spanning 8 persona archetypes, SJTs for 11 attributes, 8,500 personas, 4,000 SJTs, and 300,000 responses, showcasing subpopulation behaviors.

Conclusion: The paper claims to significantly improve domain-specific competency analysis in AI systems and plans to publicly release the dataset and all code.

Abstract: AI psychometrics evaluates AI systems in roles that traditionally require
emotional judgment and ethical consideration. Prior work often reuses human
trait inventories (Big Five, \hexaco) or ad hoc personas, limiting behavioral
realism and domain relevance. We propose a framework that (1) uses situational
judgment tests (SJTs) from realistic scenarios to probe domain-specific
competencies; (2) integrates industrial-organizational and personality
psychology to design sophisticated personas which include behavioral and
psychological descriptors, life history, and social and emotional functions;
and (3) employs structured generation with population demographic priors and
memoir inspired narratives, encoded with Pydantic schemas. In a law enforcement
assistant case study, we construct a rich dataset of personas drawn across 8
persona archetypes and SJTs across 11 attributes, and analyze behaviors across
subpopulation and scenario slices. The dataset spans 8,500 personas, 4,000
SJTs, and 300,000 responses. We will release the dataset and all code to the
public.

### [21] [Dopamine-driven synaptic credit assignment in neural networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22178)
*Saranraj Nambusubramaniyan,Shervin Safavi,Raja Guru,Andreas Knoblauch*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes a derivative-free optimizer, Dopamine, inspired by neural reinforcement learning to address inefficiencies in back-propagation for training neural networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To solve the synaptic Credit Assignment Problem (CAP) more efficiently and address limitations like high computation and memory costs in gradient-based methods such as back-propagation.

Method: Inspired by neural reinforcement learning, the Dopamine optimizer uses Weight Perturbation (WP) learning and stochastic weight updates, minimizing regret between perturbed and unperturbed model outcomes. The regret is used to adapt the learning rate, mimicking dopamine's role in the brain.

Result: Dopamine optimizer showed accelerated convergence and comparable performance to gradient-based optimizers while significantly reducing computational and memory needs. Tests on XOR tasks and chaotic time series forecasting demonstrated its efficiency.

Conclusion: The Dopamine optimizer offers a neurobiologically plausible, efficient, and effective solution to the CAP, providing robust and competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art machine learning optimizers.

Abstract: Solving the synaptic Credit Assignment Problem(CAP) is central to learning in
both biological and artificial neural systems. Finding an optimal solution for
synaptic CAP means setting the synaptic weights that assign credit to each
neuron for influencing the final output and behavior of neural networks or
animals. Gradient-based methods solve this problem in artificial neural
networks using back-propagation, however, not in the most efficient way. For
instance, back-propagation requires a chain of top-down gradient computations.
This leads to an expensive optimization process in terms of computing power and
memory linked with well-known weight transport and update locking problems. To
address these shortcomings, we take a NeuroAI approach and draw inspiration
from neural Reinforcement Learning to develop a derivative-free optimizer for
training neural networks, Dopamine. Dopamine is developed for Weight
Perturbation (WP) learning that exploits stochastic updating of weights towards
optima. It achieves this by minimizing the regret, a form of Reward Prediction
Error (RPE) between the expected outcome from the perturbed model and the
actual outcome from the unperturbed model. We use this RPE to adjust the
learning rate in the network (i.e., creating an adaptive learning rate
strategy, similar to the role of dopamine in the brain). We tested the Dopamine
optimizer for training multi-layered perceptrons for XOR tasks, and recurrent
neural networks for chaotic time series forecasting. Dopamine-trained models
demonstrate accelerated convergence and outperform standard WP, and give
comparable performance to gradient-based algorithms, while consuming
significantly less computation and memory. Overall, the Dopamine optimizer not
only finds robust solutions and comparable performance to the state-of-the-art
Machine Learning optimizers but is also neurobiologically more plausible.

*Haoyang Liu,Jie Wang,Yuyang Cai,Xiongwei Han,Yufei Kuang,Jianye Hao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces OptiTree, a novel adaptive tree search approach for optimization modeling in operations research, significantly improving accuracy by decomposing complex problems into simpler subproblems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing optimization modeling analysis using fixed-step decomposition with large language models struggles with highly complex mathematical structures inherent in operations research problems.

Method: The paper proposes OptiTree, involving a hierarchical modeling tree that organizes OR problems by taxonomy and complexity, and adaptively decomposes complex problems into simpler subproblems using a tree search approach.

Result: Experiments demonstrate OptiTree achieves over 10% improvement in modeling accuracy compared to state-of-the-art benchmarks.

Conclusion: OptiTree enhances optimization modeling by integrating adaptive hierarchical problem decomposition, offering significant accuracy improvements in operations research tasks.

Abstract: Optimization modeling is one of the most crucial but technical parts of
operations research (OR). To automate the modeling process, existing works have
leveraged large language models (LLMs), prompting them to break down tasks into
steps for generating variables, constraints, and objectives. However, due to
the highly complex mathematical structures inherent in OR problems, standard
fixed-step decomposition often fails to achieve high performance. To address
this challenge, we introduce OptiTree, a novel tree search approach designed to
enhance modeling capabilities for complex problems through adaptive problem
decomposition into simpler subproblems. Specifically, we develop a modeling
tree that organizes a wide range of OR problems based on their hierarchical
problem taxonomy and complexity, with each node representing a problem category
and containing relevant high-level modeling thoughts. Given a problem to model,
we recurrently search the tree to identify a series of simpler subproblems and
synthesize the global modeling thoughts by adaptively integrating the
hierarchical thoughts. Experiments show that OptiTree significantly improves
the modeling accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art, achieving over 10\%
improvements on the challenging benchmarks. The code is released at
https://github.com/MIRALab-USTC/OptiTree/tree/main.

*Eunseop Yoon,Hee Suk Yoon,Jaehyun Jang,SooHwan Eom,Qi Dai,Chong Luo,Mark A. Hasegawa-Johnson,Chang D. Yoo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces PACR, a dense reward system for RLVR that enhances guidance during intermediate reasoning steps, improving exploration and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of sparse, outcome-based rewards in RLVR, which hinder exploration by not providing intermediate guidance for logical reasoning.

Method: PACR provides dense, model-intrinsic rewards based on the model's evolving belief in the correct answer, with an inductive bias that probabilities for ground-truth answers generally increase along proper reasoning trajectories.

Result: PACR accelerates exploration, achieves reward saturation faster with fewer trajectories, and shows performance improvements across various benchmarks.

Conclusion: Incorporating dense, intrinsic rewards like PACR into RLVR can make training more effective and reliable, enhancing logical reasoning performance.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has significantly
improved LLM reasoning, but its sparse, outcome-based reward provides no
guidance for intermediate steps, slowing exploration. We propose Progressively
Ascending Confidence Reward (PACR), a dense, model-intrinsic reward computed
directly from the model's evolving belief in the correct answer. PACR encodes
the inductive bias that, along a well-formed reasoning trajectory, the
probability of the ground-truth answer should have a generally ascending trend.
We provide empirical and theoretical analysis validating that such an inductive
bias constrains the exploration search space to regions richer in logically
sound reasoning. We demonstrate that PACR accelerates exploration, reaches
reward saturation with fewer trajectories, and yields improvements on multiple
benchmarks. Our results suggest that dense, model-intrinsic shaping signals can
make RLVR training more effective and reliable.

Motivation: To address the challenge of Vietnamese Automatic Lyrics Transcription (ALT), hindered by tonal complexity, dialectal variations, and the absence of a dedicated dataset.

Method: Fine-tuned Whisper models using VietLyrics, a curated dataset of line-aligned Vietnamese song lyrics and metadata.

Result: Fine-tuned models outperform existing systems like LyricWhiz and show considerable improvement by reducing transcription errors and handling non-vocal segments.

Conclusion: The release of VietLyrics and related models aims to enhance Vietnamese music research and ALT in low-resource languages.

Abstract: Automatic Lyrics Transcription (ALT) for Vietnamese music presents unique

Conclusion: The framework highlights the potential of combining LLMs with domain-specific literature for risk prediction and interpretability, while showcasing promising avenues for data-driven knowledge discovery.

Abstract: This study proposes an interpretable prediction framework with
literature-informed fine-tuned (LIFT) LLMs for truck driving risk prediction.
The framework integrates an LLM-driven Inference Core that predicts and
explains truck driving risk, a Literature Processing Pipeline that filters and
summarizes domain-specific literature into a literature knowledge base, and a
Result Evaluator that evaluates the prediction performance as well as the
interpretability of the LIFT LLM. After fine-tuning on a real-world truck
driving risk dataset, the LIFT LLM achieved accurate risk prediction,
outperforming benchmark models by 26.7% in recall and 10.1% in F1-score.
Furthermore, guided by the literature knowledge base automatically constructed
from 299 domain papers, the LIFT LLM produced variable importance ranking
consistent with that derived from the benchmark model, while demonstrating
robustness in interpretation results to various data sampling conditions. The
LIFT LLM also identified potential risky scenarios by detecting key combination
of variables in truck driving risk, which were verified by PERMANOVA tests.
Finally, we demonstrated the contribution of the literature knowledge base and

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces DynaSolidGeo, a benchmark designed to assess solid geometry problem-solving by integrating spatial and symbolic reasoning in Vision-Language Models (VLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks focus mainly on 2D plane geometry, static datasets, and answer accuracy, neglecting dynamic reasoning and spatial intelligence.

Method: DynaSolidGeo contains expertly curated questions generated dynamically and evaluates models based on answer accuracy and reasoning processes such as logical validity and causal coherence.

Result: Experiments show substantial performance gaps and challenges in dynamic settings and high-level spatial intelligence tasks across both open-source and closed-source VLMs.

Conclusion: This benchmark highlights the limitations of current spatial reasoning in VLMs, pointing toward the need for better approaches in dynamic and high-level spatial tasks.

Abstract: Solid geometry problem solving demands spatial mathematical reasoning that
integrates spatial intelligence and symbolic reasoning. However, most existing
multimodal mathematical reasoning benchmarks focus primarily on 2D plane
geometry, rely on static datasets prone to data contamination and memorization,
and evaluate models solely by final answers, overlooking the reasoning process.
To address these limitations, we introduce DynaSolidGeo, the first dynamic
benchmark for evaluating genuine spatial reasoning in Vision-Language Models
(VLMs). Constructed through a semi-automatic annotation pipeline, DynaSolidGeo
contains 503 expert-curated seed questions that can, in principle, dynamically
generate an unbounded number of diverse multimodal text-visual instances.
Beyond answer accuracy, we incorporate process evaluation based on
expert-annotated reasoning chains to measure logical validity and causal
coherence. Experiments across representative open-source and closed-source VLMs
reveal large performance gaps, severe degradation in dynamic settings, and poor
performance on tasks requiring high-level spatial intelligence, such as mental
rotation and visualization. The code and dataset are available at

### [28] [Reasoning Models Reason Well, Until They Don't](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22371)
*Revanth Rameshkumar,Jimson Huang,Yunxin Sun,Fei Xia,Abulhair Saparov*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Large reasoning models (LRMs), fine-tuned LLMs designed for step-by-step reasoning, perform well on existing benchmarks but fail abruptly when faced with more complex reasoning tasks, as demonstrated using the Deep Reasoning Dataset (DeepRD).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study seeks to explore the claimed reasoning capabilities of LRMs and their ability to generalize beyond existing benchmark complexities.

Method: The authors revisited reasoning benchmarks through LRMs, introduced the Deep Reasoning Dataset to scale task complexity, and evaluated LRMs on advanced reasoning tasks like graph connectivity and proof planning.

Result: LRMs perform extraordinarily with limited complexity but fail significantly as task complexity increases. Most real-world examples lie within the success regime, but complexities in long-tail distributions expose their shortcomings.

Conclusion: While LRMs are useful for near-term reasoning tasks, they require new methods to address their inability to generalize with increasing task complexity.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown significant progress in reasoning
tasks. However, recent studies show that transformers and LLMs fail
catastrophically once reasoning problems exceed modest complexity. We revisit
these findings through the lens of large reasoning models (LRMs) -- LLMs
fine-tuned with incentives for step-by-step argumentation and
self-verification. LRM performance on graph and reasoning benchmarks such as
NLGraph seem extraordinary, with some even claiming they are capable of
generalized reasoning and innovation in reasoning-intensive fields such as
mathematics, physics, medicine, and law. However, by more carefully scaling the
complexity of reasoning problems, we show existing benchmarks actually have
limited complexity. We develop a new dataset, the Deep Reasoning Dataset
(DeepRD), along with a generative process for producing unlimited examples of
scalable complexity. We use this dataset to evaluate model performance on graph
connectivity and natural language proof planning. We find that the performance
of LRMs drop abruptly at sufficient complexity and do not generalize. We also
relate our LRM results to the distributions of the complexities of large,
real-world knowledge graphs, interaction graphs, and proof datasets. We find
the majority of real-world examples fall inside the LRMs' success regime, yet
the long tails expose substantial failure potential. Our analysis highlights
the near-term utility of LRMs while underscoring the need for new methods that
generalize beyond the complexity of examples in the training distribution.

*G M Shahariar,Ali Nazari,Erfan Shayegani,Nael Abu-Ghazaleh*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Finite State Machine (FSM) model to better understand the reasoning processes of Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) that utilize chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, improving interpretability and analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the emerging reasoning capabilities of LRMs is challenging but crucial for improving model training, robustness, and interpretability.

Method: The authors propose approximating LRMs' hierarchical reasoning dynamics with a memoryless Finite State Machine (FSM) abstraction, outlining key reasoning states and analyzing step-by-step reasoning using CoT annotations.

Result: The FSM approach unveils distinct reasoning patterns and shortcomings within LRMs' problem-solving methods, offering insights into model behavior.

Conclusion: The paper provides a promising framework to systematically analyze, interpret, and enhance reasoning dynamics in Large Language Models using FSM modeling.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable reasoning abilities
when they generate step-by-step solutions, known as chain-of-thought (CoT)
reasoning. When trained to using chain-of-thought reasoning examples, the
resulting models (called Large Reasoning Models, or LRMs) appear to learn
hierarchical thinking strategies similar to those used by humans. However,
understanding LRMs emerging reasoning capabilities remains a difficult open
problem, with many potential important applications including improving
training and understanding robustness. In this paper, we adopt a memoryless
Finite State Machine formulation to approximate LRM's emerging hierarchical
reasoning dynamics as a structured, interpretable abstraction. We identify a
small set of discrete reasoning states including - initialization, deduction,
augmentation-strategy, uncertainty-estimation, backtracking, and
final-conclusion that capture the high-level states present in the model's
reasoning process. By annotating each step of a model's CoT with these states,
we can represent the reasoning trajectory as a transition sequence through the
state graph. This FSM formulation provides a systematic way to analyze,
interpret and visualize how different models approach problems. We describe the
FSM model, provide examples of CoT annotations under this scheme, and discuss
how it can shed light on differences between available models in their approach
to reasoning. Our results demonstrate that this FSM-based analysis reveals
distinct reasoning patterns and potential shortcomings, offering a new lens to
evaluate and improve LLM reasoning.

### [30] [Learning "Partner-Aware" Collaborators in Multi-Party Collaboration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22462)
*Abhijnan Nath,Nikhil Krishnaswamy*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper investigates collaborative behavior in multi-party tasks using LLMs, proposing an algorithm (ICR) to improve group alignment and task collaboration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of evaluating and improving LLM-driven agents' ability to collaborate effectively with humans and other agents in multi-party tasks.

Method: The study uses a two-player Modified-Action MDP framework and develops a partner-aware algorithm called Interruptible Collaborative Roleplayer (ICR).

Result: Experiments demonstrate that the ICR algorithm improves group common ground alignment and explores diverse solutions in collaborative tasks.

Conclusion: The ICR algorithm is a promising partner-aware approach for enhancing multi-modal collaboration and convergence in tasks involving LLM-driven agents.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly bring deployed in agentic
settings where they act as collaborators with humans. Therefore, it is
increasingly important to be able to evaluate their abilities to collaborate
effectively in multi-turn, multi-party tasks. In this paper, we build on the AI
alignment and safe interruptability literature to offer novel theoretical
insights on collaborative behavior between LLM-driven collaborator agents and
an intervention agent. Our goal is to learn an ideal partner-aware collaborator
that increases the group's common-ground (CG)-alignment on task-relevant
propositions-by intelligently collecting information provided in interventions
by a partner agent.We show how LLM agents trained using standard RLHF and
related approaches are naturally inclined to ignore possibly well-meaning
interventions, which makes increasing group common ground non-trivial in this
setting. We employ a two-player Modified-Action MDP to examine this suboptimal
behavior of standard AI agents, and propose Interruptible Collaborative
Roleplayer (ICR)-a novel partner-aware learning algorithm to train CG-optimal
collaborators. Experiments on multiple collaborative task environments show
that ICR, on average, is more capable of promoting successful CG convergence
and exploring more diverse solutions in such tasks.

### [31] [OFFSIDE: Benchmarking Unlearning Misinformation in Multimodal Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22535)
*Hao Zheng,Zirui Pang,Ling li,Zhijie Deng,Yuhan Pu,Zhaowei Zhu,Xiaobo Xia,Jiaheng Wei*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: OFFSIDE introduces a benchmark for misinformation unlearning in multimodal large language models, addressing the limitations of current approaches while revealing vulnerabilities such as recovery of unlearned rumors and susceptibility to attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address shortcomings in existing Machine Unlearning (MU) benchmarks for multimodal models, which lack diversity, accuracy, and realistic evaluation.

Method: A manually curated dataset focused on football transfer rumors, with comprehensive test sets for evaluating loss of misinformation, and metrics to assess selective unlearning, corrective relearning, and robustness.

Result: Unimodal approaches fail to effectively unlearn multimodal rumors. Current methods are prone to catastrophic forgetting, struggle with visual rumors, allow recovery of unlearned misinformation, and are vulnerable to prompt attacks.

Conclusion: Current MU methods for multimodal models have significant limitations. Robust solutions are essential to tackle the vulnerabilities exposed by the OFFSIDE benchmark.

Abstract: Advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) intensify concerns about
data privacy, making Machine Unlearning (MU), the selective removal of learned
information, a critical necessity. However, existing MU benchmarks for MLLMs
are limited by a lack of image diversity, potential inaccuracies, and
insufficient evaluation scenarios, which fail to capture the complexity of
real-world applications. To facilitate the development of MLLMs unlearning and
alleviate the aforementioned limitations, we introduce OFFSIDE, a novel
benchmark for evaluating misinformation unlearning in MLLMs based on football
transfer rumors. This manually curated dataset contains 15.68K records for 80
players, providing a comprehensive framework with four test sets to assess
forgetting efficacy, generalization, utility, and robustness. OFFSIDE supports
advanced settings like selective unlearning and corrective relearning, and
crucially, unimodal unlearning (forgetting only text data). Our extensive
evaluation of multiple baselines reveals key findings: (1) Unimodal methods
(erasing text-based knowledge) fail on multimodal rumors; (2) Unlearning
efficacy is largely driven by catastrophic forgetting; (3) All methods struggle
with "visual rumors" (rumors appear in the image); (4) The unlearned rumors can
be easily recovered and (5) All methods are vulnerable to prompt attacks. These
results expose significant vulnerabilities in current approaches, highlighting
the need for more robust multimodal unlearning solutions. The code is available

### [32] [ATOM: AdapTive and OptiMized dynamic temporal knowledge graph construction using LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22590)
*Yassir Lairgi,Ludovic Moncla,Khalid Benabdeslem,Rémy Cazabet,Pierre Cléau*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ATOM introduces a few-shot and scalable method to construct and update Temporal Knowledge Graphs (TKGs) from unstructured text, addressing challenges like instability and incomplete fact coverage seen in existing approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address limitations in traditional knowledge graph construction, particularly its static nature which fails to adapt to dynamic, time-sensitive real-world data. It also tackles instability and incomplete fact coverage in zero- and few-shot methods.

Method: ATOM splits input text into atomic self-contained facts for better fact extraction and stability. It constructs TKGs with dual-time modeling to differentiate observation and validity periods, merges these graphs in parallel, and ensures scalability.

Result: ATOM achieves noticeably higher exhaustivity (~18%), improved stability (~17%), and reduces processing latency by over 90% compared to baseline methods.

Conclusion: ATOM proves highly effective for scalable construction of dynamic TKGs, making it crucial for adaptive knowledge extraction in rapidly changing data environments.

Abstract: In today's rapidly expanding data landscape, knowledge extraction from
unstructured text is vital for real-time analytics, temporal inference, and
dynamic memory frameworks. However, traditional static knowledge graph (KG)
construction often overlooks the dynamic and time-sensitive nature of
real-world data, limiting adaptability to continuous changes. Moreover, recent
zero- or few-shot approaches that avoid domain-specific fine-tuning or reliance
on prebuilt ontologies often suffer from instability across multiple runs, as
well as incomplete coverage of key facts. To address these challenges, we
introduce ATOM (AdapTive and OptiMized), a few-shot and scalable approach that
builds and continuously updates Temporal Knowledge Graphs (TKGs) from
unstructured texts. ATOM splits input documents into minimal, self-contained
"atomic" facts, improving extraction exhaustivity and stability. Then, it
constructs atomic TKGs from these facts while employing a dual-time modeling
that distinguishes when information is observed from when it is valid. The
resulting atomic TKGs are subsequently merged in parallel. Empirical
evaluations demonstrate that ATOM achieves ~18% higher exhaustivity, ~17%
better stability, and over 90% latency reduction compared to baseline methods,
demonstrating a strong scalability potential for dynamic TKG construction.

### [33] [A Framework for Quantifying How Pre-Training and Context Benefit In-Context Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22594)
*Bingqing Song,Jiaxiang Li,Rong Wang,Songtao Lu,Mingyi Hong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper explores how in-context learning (ICL) abilities arise in pre-trained large language models, using quantitative methods to explain the role of pre-training data, context structure, and distributional shifts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to understand the theoretical underpinnings of in-context learning (ICL) in large language models, with a focus on how ICL capabilities are influenced by pre-training procedures and context construction.

Method: They propose a framework for analyzing ICL, beginning with a simple one-layer transformer as a proof of concept, and then generalizing to more complex cases. They use theoretical derivations and experimental validation, focusing on context construction and distribution shifts.

Result: The study concludes that a well-constructed context can effectively shift output distributions toward query task distributions, improving prediction accuracy, even when pre-train and query task distributions differ. The relationship between ICL performance and factors such as context length and KL divergence is quantitatively derived.

Conclusion: The paper highlights the importance of context construction in enhancing ICL. The findings underline that the pre-training distribution need not match the query task distribution, as long as the context is properly structured.

Abstract: Pre-trained large language models have demonstrated a strong ability to learn
from context, known as in-context learning (ICL). Despite a surge of recent
applications that leverage such capabilities, it is by no means clear, at least
theoretically, how the ICL capabilities arise, and in particular, what is the
precise role played by key factors such as pre-training procedure as well as
context construction. In this work, we propose a new framework to analyze the
ICL performance, for a class of realistic settings, which includes network
architectures, data encoding, data generation, and prompt construction process.
As a first step, we construct a simple example with a one-layer transformer,
and show an interesting result, namely when the pre-train data distribution is
different from the query task distribution, a properly constructed context can
shift the output distribution towards the query task distribution, in a
quantifiable manner, leading to accurate prediction on the query topic. We then
extend the findings in the previous step to a more general case, and derive the
precise relationship between ICL performance, context length and the KL
divergence between pre-train and query task distribution. Finally, we provide
experiments to validate our theoretical results.

*Md. Mehedi Hasan,Rafid Mostafiz,Md. Abir Hossain,Bikash Kumar Paul*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces CLIN-LLM, a hybrid pipeline that improves medical diagnosis and treatment generation using fine-tuned models and safety checks, achieving high accuracy and clinical safety.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in symptom-to-disease classification and treatment recommendations, particularly under diagnostic uncertainty in heterogeneous patient settings.

Method: Uses multimodal patient encoding, uncertainty-calibrated disease classification, and retrieval-augmented treatment generation. Includes a fine-tuned BioBERT model combined with new techniques like Focal Loss, Monte Carlo Dropout, and a human-in-the-loop process.

Result: Achieved 98% accuracy, a clinician-rated validity score of 4.2 out of 5, and reduced unsafe antibiotic suggestions by 67%. It outperforms ClinicalBERT and ensures robust, safe clinical outputs.

Conclusion: CLIN-LLM demonstrates enhanced robustness, interpretability, and clinical alignment, offering a deployable framework for healthcare, with future plans for adding imaging data, multilingual capabilities, and clinical trials.

Abstract: Accurate symptom-to-disease classification and clinically grounded treatment
recommendations remain challenging, particularly in heterogeneous patient
settings with high diagnostic risk. Existing large language model (LLM)-based
systems often lack medical grounding and fail to quantify uncertainty,
resulting in unsafe outputs. We propose CLIN-LLM, a safety-constrained hybrid
pipeline that integrates multimodal patient encoding, uncertainty-calibrated
disease classification, and retrieval-augmented treatment generation. The
framework fine-tunes BioBERT on 1,200 clinical cases from the Symptom2Disease
dataset and incorporates Focal Loss with Monte Carlo Dropout to enable
confidence-aware predictions from free-text symptoms and structured vitals.
Low-certainty cases (18%) are automatically flagged for expert review, ensuring
human oversight. For treatment generation, CLIN-LLM employs Biomedical
Sentence-BERT to retrieve top-k relevant dialogues from the 260,000-sample
MedDialog corpus. The retrieved evidence and patient context are fed into a
fine-tuned FLAN-T5 model for personalized treatment generation, followed by
post-processing with RxNorm for antibiotic stewardship and drug-drug
interaction (DDI) screening. CLIN-LLM achieves 98% accuracy and F1 score,
outperforming ClinicalBERT by 7.1% (p < 0.001), with 78% top-5 retrieval
precision and a clinician-rated validity of 4.2 out of 5. Unsafe antibiotic
suggestions are reduced by 67% compared to GPT-5. These results demonstrate
CLIN-LLM's robustness, interpretability, and clinical safety alignment. The
proposed system provides a deployable, human-in-the-loop decision support
framework for resource-limited healthcare environments. Future work includes
integrating imaging and lab data, multilingual extensions, and clinical trial
validation.

### [35] [SwiftSolve: A Self-Iterative, Complexity-Aware Multi-Agent Framework for Competitive Programming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22626)
*Adhyayan Veer Singh,Aaron Shen,Brian Law,Ahmed Ismail,Jonas Rohweder,Sean O'Brien,Kevin Zhu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces SwiftSolve, a multi-agent system for competitive programming that integrates algorithmic planning, profiling, and complexity-guided repair. SwiftSolve achieves high accuracy and efficiency in solving competitive programming problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitations of correctness-based assessments for LLM-generated programs, focusing on efficiency metrics such as runtime and memory constraints in competitive programming.

Method: SwiftSolve uses specialized agents for planning, coding, profiling, and complexity analysis. These agents collaborate through a structured JSON-based communication framework. The system evaluates candidates over fixed input schedules and assigns complexity classes for targeted repairs.

Result: SwiftSolve achieves pass@1 success in 61.54% of problems and solves 80.77% of problems within three attempts, outperforming Claude Opus 4 in success rates while maintaining efficient runtime and memory usage.

Conclusion: SwiftSolve improves competitive programming outcomes by incorporating efficiency metrics into program evaluation, highlighting its ability to address inefficiencies while maintaining high accuracy in problem-solving.

Abstract: Correctness alone is insufficient: LLM-generated programs frequently satisfy
unit tests while violating contest time or memory budgets. We present
SwiftSolve, a complexity-aware multi-agent system for competitive programming
that couples algorithmic planning with empirical profiling and
complexity-guided repair. We frame competitive programming as a software
environment where specialized agents act as programmers, each assuming roles
such as planning, coding, profiling, and complexity analysis. A Planner
proposes an algorithmic sketch; a deterministic Static Pruner filters high-risk
plans; a Coder emits ISO C++17; a Profiler compiles and executes candidates on
a fixed input-size schedule to record wall time and peak memory; and a
Complexity Analyst fits log-log growth (s, R2) with an LLM fallback to assign a
complexity class and dispatch targeted patches to either the Planner or Coder.
Agents communicate via typed, versioned JSON; a controller enforces iteration
caps and diminishing returns stopping. Evaluated on 26 problems (16 BigO, 10
Codeforces Div. 2) in a POSIX sandbox (2 s / 256-512 MB), SwiftSolve attains
pass@1 = 61.54% (16/26) on the first attempt and Solved@<=3 = 80.77% with
marginal latency change (mean 11.96 s to 12.66 s per attempt). Aggregate
run-level success is 73.08% at 12.40 s mean. Failures are predominantly
resource-bound, indicating inefficiency rather than logic errors. Against
Claude Opus 4, SwiftSolve improves run-level success (73.1% vs 52.6%) at
approximately 2x runtime overhead (12.4 s vs 6.8 s). Beyond correctness
(pass@k), we report efficiency metrics (eff@k for runtime and memory, incidence
of TLE or MLE, and complexity fit accuracy on BigO), demonstrating that
profiling and complexity-guided replanning reduce inefficiency while preserving
accuracy.

### [36] [Do Stop Me Now: Detecting Boilerplate Responses with a Single Iteration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22679)
*Yuval Kainan,Shaked Zychlinski*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to detect non-substantive boilerplate responses in LLMs early in generation, cutting computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Language Models (LLMs) waste computational resources generating unnecessary responses like refusals or casual greetings, increasing costs and latency.

Method: The authors utilized the log-probability distribution from the first generated token to classify the nature of responses. A lightweight k-NN classifier was employed to predict substantive answers versus boilerplate responses.

Result: Experiments showed high accuracy in using first-token log-probabilities for response classification, enabling early termination or redirection for efficiency.

Conclusion: This method provides a computationally efficient approach to LLM deployment, reducing resources by identifying responses early and improving sustainability.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often expend significant computational resources
generating boilerplate responses, such as refusals, simple acknowledgements and
casual greetings, which adds unnecessary cost and latency. To address this
inefficiency, we propose a simple yet highly effective method for detecting
such responses after only a single generation step. We demonstrate that the
log-probability distribution of the first generated token serves as a powerful
signal for classifying the nature of the entire subsequent response. Our
experiments, conducted across a diverse range of small, large, and
reasoning-specialized models, show that the first-token log-probability vectors
form distinctly separable clusters for different response types. Using a
lightweight k-NN classifier, we achieve high accuracy in predicting whether a
response will be a substantive answer or a form of boilerplate response,
including user-specified refusals. The primary implication is a practical,
computationally trivial technique, optimizing LLM inference by enabling early
termination or redirection to a smaller model, thereby yielding significant
savings in computational cost. This work presents a direct path toward more
efficient and sustainable LLM deployment.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper evaluates large language models' ability to generalize reasoning and tool-calling across environments and introduces MAVEN, a benchmark highlighting challenges in multi-step reasoning. A proposed CoreThink Reasoner significantly improves accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the poor generalization and reasoning capabilities of LLMs in diverse tool-calling environments, which limits their practical reliability.

Method: The researchers conducted a large-scale evaluation on multiple benchmarks, introduced a new challenging benchmark (MAVEN), and proposed the CoreThink Agentic Reasoner framework with a symbolic reasoning layer to improve LLM performance.

Result: Results show existing models perform poorly on MAVEN (below 50% accuracy). However, the proposed CoreThink framework achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, improving by up to 530% at lower computational costs.

Conclusion: Integrating a structured reasoning layer like CoreThink significantly enhances LLM generalization and tool-use performance, demonstrating its potential to address current limitations in diverse reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Generalization across Agentic tool-calling environments remains a key
unsolved challenge in developing reliable agentic reasoning systems. While
large language models (LLMs) demonstrate strong performance on isolated
benchmarks, their ability to transfer reasoning strategies and co-ordinate
tools across diverse domains is poorly understood. In this work, we conduct a
large-scale evaluation of state-of-the-art LLMs on multiple tool-calling
benchmarksBFCL v3, TauBench, Tau2Bench, and AceBenchand introduce MAVEN (Math &
Physics Adversarial Verification & Evaluation Network), a new out of
distribution (OOD) benchmark designed to stress-test multi-step reasoning
through explicit verification and adversarial task composition. Our results
show that most current models achieve below 50% accuracy on MAVEN, revealing a
significant generalization gap across tool-use settings.
  To address this, we present the CoreThink Agentic Reasoner, a framework that
augments LLMs with a lightweight symbolic reasoning layer for structured
decomposition and adaptive tool orchestration. Without additional training, it
generalizes across all benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art performance with
530% improvements over existing baselines at roughly one-tenth the
computational cost.

*Mithul Chander,Sai Pragnya Ranga,Prathamesh Mayekar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Atlas Urban Index (AUI), a new urban development metric based on Sentinel-2 satellite imagery and Vision-Language Models, offering improved accuracy over existing methods like NDBI.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current urbanization indices such as NDBI face limitations due to factors like atmospheric noise, seasonal variation, and cloud cover, inhibiting effective large-scale monitoring of urban and human development.

Method: The authors use Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to calculate development scores from processed time-series images that minimize cloud cover. They also include strategies to ensure scoring consistency via curated reference images and temporal anchoring.

Result: The Atlas Urban Index (AUI) demonstrates superior accuracy and stability in measuring urban development when compared to traditional metrics like NDBI, as shown in qualitative experiments conducted in Bangalore.

Conclusion: The proposed AUI overcomes the constraints of traditional urban development metrics, offering a reliable framework for monitoring urban growth utilizing advanced satellite imagery and VLMs.

Abstract: We introduce the {\em Atlas Urban Index} (AUI), a metric for measuring urban
development computed using Sentinel-2 \citep{spoto2012sentinel2} satellite
imagery. Existing approaches, such as the {\em Normalized Difference Built-up
Index} (NDBI), often struggle to accurately capture urban development due to
factors like atmospheric noise, seasonal variation, and cloud cover. These
limitations hinder large-scale monitoring of human development and
urbanization. To address these challenges, we propose an approach that
leverages {\em Vision-Language Models }(VLMs) to provide a development score
for regions. Specifically, we collect a time series of Sentinel-2 images for
each region. Then, we further process the images within fixed time windows to
get an image with minimal cloud cover, which serves as the representative image
for that time window. To ensure consistent scoring, we adopt two strategies:
(i) providing the VLM with a curated set of reference images representing
different levels of urbanization, and (ii) supplying the most recent past image
to both anchor temporal consistency and mitigate cloud-related noise in the
current image. Together, these components enable AUI to overcome the challenges
of traditional urbanization indices and produce more reliable and stable
development scores. Our qualitative experiments on Bangalore suggest that AUI
outperforms standard indices such as NDBI.

*Kaitong Cai,Jusheng Zhang,Yijia Fan,Jing Yang,Keze Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RaCoT enhances Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) by addressing knowledge-sparse and ambiguous queries using pre-retrieval contrastive thinking, improving accuracy and robustness compared to strong baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RAG systems struggle with long-tail queries due to semantic ambiguity and retrieval noise, necessitating costly post-retrieval processing for accurate responses.

Method: RaCoT generates contrastive questions to identify key differences in answers and uses a Δ-Prompt to focus on critical details before retrieval, improving semantic encoding and suppressing interference.

Result: RaCoT achieves superior accuracy on benchmarks like PopQA and TriviaQA-unfiltered, with minimal performance degradation in adversarial tests, and maintains efficiency with low latency and token overhead.

Conclusion: RaCoT presents an efficient and robust alternative to traditional RAG approaches by proactively shaping discriminative reasoning pre-retrieval, ideal for real-time and resource-limited AI deployments.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) faces a core bottleneck with
knowledge-sparse and semantically ambiguous long-tail queries, where retrieval
noise distorts reasoning and necessitates costly post-processing. To tackle
this, we propose RaCoT (Retrieval-aware Contrastive-of-Thought), a novel
framework that shifts contrastive thinking to the pre-retrieval stage. By
automatically generating a semantically adjacent yet differently answered
contrastive question and extracting a $\Delta$-Prompt to capture their key
differences, RaCoT guides the model to proactively focus on the ``critical
details that determine answer divergence." This approach allows it to suppress
semantic interference within a single retrieval pass, overcoming the
theoretical bottleneck of single-vector queries that struggle to simultaneously
encode signals for what to attend to and what to ignore. On six authoritative
benchmarks, including PopQA and TriviaQA-unfiltered, RaCoT outperforms strong
baselines like RankRAG and Self-RAG by 0.9-2.4 percentage points. It exhibits
superior robustness, with a performance drop of only 8.6\% in adversarial
tests, far surpassing the over 15\% degradation in other methods. Furthermore,
its low latency (3.12s) and token overhead (11.54) place it on the
accuracy-efficiency Pareto frontier, while ablation studies validate the
necessity of each component. Ultimately, RaCoT reframes the RAG paradigm from
``post-hoc context cleaning" to ``a priori shaping of discriminative
reasoning", offering an efficient and robust path toward reliable AI systems
for real-time, resource-constrained deployments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the unique strengths and weaknesses of leading LLMs in performance, moral reasoning, and usability, helping users make informed decisions on suitable models.

Method: The study analyzes Google's Gemini, High-Flyer's DeepSeek, Anthropic's Claude, OpenAI's GPT models, and Meta's LLaMA across three key criteria: performance and accuracy, ethics and bias mitigation, and usability and integration.

Result: Findings indicate Claude excels in moral reasoning, Gemini in multimodal capabilities and ethics, DeepSeek in fact-based reasoning, LLaMA for open applications, and ChatGPT for balanced performance and usability.

Conclusion: Each LLM has unique strengths tailored for specific user requirements, emphasizing the importance of selecting models based on their specialization.

Abstract: Big Language Models (LLMs) are changing the way businesses use software, the
way people live their lives and the way industries work. Companies like Google,
High-Flyer, Anthropic, OpenAI and Meta are making better LLMs. So, it's crucial
to look at how each model is different in terms of performance, moral behaviour
and usability, as these differences are based on the different ideas that built
them. This study compares five top LLMs: Google's Gemini, High-Flyer's
DeepSeek, Anthropic's Claude, OpenAI's GPT models and Meta's LLaMA. It performs
this by analysing three important factors: Performance and Accuracy, Ethics and
Bias Mitigation and Usability and Integration. It was found that Claude has
good moral reasoning, Gemini is better at multimodal capabilities and has
strong ethical frameworks. DeepSeek is great at reasoning based on facts, LLaMA
is good for open applications and ChatGPT delivers balanced performance with a
focus on usage. It was concluded that these models are different in terms of
how well they work, how easy they are to use and how they treat people
ethically, making it a point that each model should be utilised by the user in
a way that makes the most of its strengths.

TL;DR: The study explores turning small language models into reward models to improve code generation quality by training them to evaluate code correctness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address challenges in generating high-quality code with LLMs by exploring the feasibility of using small models, like Phi-4, as reward models to improve reasoning tasks.

Method: The researchers created a dataset using the APPS benchmark, fine-tuned small LLMs by adding regression layers, and trained them to predict code correctness.

Result: Small LLMs successfully identified correct solutions among candidates and improved code generation accuracy by over 20%.

Conclusion: Small language models can effectively function as reward models, blending process and outcome rewards, to enhance code generation and reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Generating high-quality code remains a challenge for Large Language Models
(LLMs). For the evolution of reasoning models on this task, reward models are a
necessary intermediate step. These models judge outcomes or intermediate steps.
Decoder-only transformer models can be turned into reward models by introducing
a regression layer and supervised fine-tuning. While it is known that
reflection capabilities generally increase with the size of a model, we want to
investigate whether state-of-the-art small language models like the Phi-4
family can be turned into usable reward models blending the consideration of
process rewards and outcome rewards.
  Targeting this goal, we construct a dataset of code samples with correctness
labels derived from the APPS coding challenge benchmark. We then train a
value-head model to estimate the success probability of intermediate outputs.
Our evaluation shows that small LLMs are capable of serving as effective reward
models or code evaluation critics, successfully identifying correct solutions
among multiple candidates. Using this critic, we achieve over a 20% improvement
in the search capability of the most accurate code out of multiple generations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs confidently generate false yet plausible information, creating barriers for deploying them in applications requiring high accuracy.

Method: A system was developed to cross-check LLM outputs in real-time using structured databases, web searches, and academic literature to detect and correct factual errors automatically.

Result: The proposed system reduced hallucinations by 67% while maintaining response quality, with domain experts rating corrected outputs 89% satisfactory.

Conclusion: The framework offers an effective way to make LLMs more reliable for accuracy-critical applications in fields like healthcare, finance, and scientific research.

Abstract: While Large Language Models have transformed how we interact with AI systems,
they suffer from a critical flaw: they confidently generate false information
that sounds entirely plausible. This hallucination problem has become a major
barrier to deploying these models in real-world applications where accuracy
matters. We developed a fact verification framework that catches and corrects
these errors in real-time by cross checking LLM outputs against multiple
knowledge sources. Our system combines structured databases, live web searches,
and academic literature to verify factual claims as they're generated. When we
detect inconsistencies, we automatically correct them while preserving the
natural flow of the response. Testing across various domains showed we could
reduce hallucinations by 67% without sacrificing response quality. Domain
experts in healthcare, finance, and scientific research rated our corrected
outputs 89% satisfactory a significant improvement over unverified LLM
responses. This work offers a practical solution for making LLMs more
trustworthy in applications where getting facts wrong isn't an option.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Jarvis introduces a new framework for personalized AI assistants by using personal KV-Cache retrieval to store user-specific textual and visual token information, ensuring accurate and personalized responses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the accuracy of responses provided by Vision-language models (VLMs) for personalized AI assistants by addressing the limitations of existing methods.

Method: Jarvis creates personal KV-Caches from user-specific information, comprising summarized textual metadata and distinct visual image patches. It retrieves relevant KV-Caches during response generation and employs a fine-grained benchmark for evaluation.

Result: Jarvis shows superior performance in accurate question answering tasks, particularly those requiring fine-grained user-specific information, achieving state-of-the-art results across multiple datasets.

Conclusion: Jarvis represents a practical approach for creating personalized AI assistants, significantly improving their accuracy by leveraging user-specific information in KV-Caches. Code and dataset will be made available for further research.

Abstract: The rapid development of Vision-language models (VLMs) enables open-ended
perception and reasoning. Recent works have started to investigate how to adapt
general-purpose VLMs into personalized assistants. Even commercial models such
as ChatGPT now support model personalization by incorporating user-specific
information. However, existing methods either learn a set of concept tokens or
train a VLM to utilize user-specific information. However, both pipelines
struggle to generate accurate answers as personalized assistants. We introduce
Jarvis, an innovative framework for a personalized AI assistant through
personal KV-Cache retrieval, which stores user-specific information in the
KV-Caches of both textual and visual tokens. The textual tokens are created by
summarizing user information into metadata, while the visual tokens are
produced by extracting distinct image patches from the user's images. When
answering a question, Jarvis first retrieves related KV-Caches from personal
storage and uses them to ensure accuracy in responses. We also introduce a
fine-grained benchmark built with the same distinct image patch mining
pipeline, emphasizing accurate question answering based on fine-grained
user-specific information. Jarvis is capable of providing more accurate
responses, particularly when they depend on specific local details. Jarvis
achieves state-of-the-art results in both visual question answering and
text-only tasks across multiple datasets, indicating a practical path toward
personalized AI assistants. The code and dataset will be released.

### [44] [How Do AI Agents Do Human Work? Comparing AI and Human Workflows Across Diverse Occupations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22780)
*Zora Zhiruo Wang,Yijia Shao,Omar Shaikh,Daniel Fried,Graham Neubig,Diyi Yang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper compares human and AI agent performance across essential work-related skills and identifies strengths and weaknesses in agent workflows.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to address the lack of understanding regarding how AI agents perform work typically done by humans, focusing on their expertise and potential roles in diverse workflows.

Method: A scalable toolkit was introduced to analyze and compare structured workflows derived from human and AI agent activities in various work-related tasks.

Result: The study found that AI agents follow programmatic workflows, produce lower-quality work with occasional data misuse, but are faster and significantly cheaper than humans.

Conclusion: AI agents, despite their shortcomings in quality, demonstrate potential for collaboration by taking on easily programmable tasks, offering speed and cost efficiency.

Abstract: AI agents are continually optimized for tasks related to human work, such as
software engineering and professional writing, signaling a pressing trend with
significant impacts on the human workforce. However, these agent developments
have often not been grounded in a clear understanding of how humans execute
work, to reveal what expertise agents possess and the roles they can play in
diverse workflows. In this work, we study how agents do human work by
presenting the first direct comparison of human and agent workers across
multiple essential work-related skills: data analysis, engineering,
computation, writing, and design. To better understand and compare
heterogeneous computer-use activities of workers, we introduce a scalable
toolkit to induce interpretable, structured workflows from either human or
agent computer-use activities. Using such induced workflows, we compare how
humans and agents perform the same tasks and find that: (1) While agents
exhibit promise in their alignment to human workflows, they take an
overwhelmingly programmatic approach across all work domains, even for
open-ended, visually dependent tasks like design, creating a contrast with the
UI-centric methods typically used by humans. (2) Agents produce work of
inferior quality, yet often mask their deficiencies via data fabrication and
misuse of advanced tools. (3) Nonetheless, agents deliver results 88.3% faster
and cost 90.4-96.2% less than humans, highlighting the potential for enabling
efficient collaboration by delegating easily programmable tasks to agents.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces JanusCode-800K, a large multimodal code corpus, alongside novel models (JanusCoder and JanusCoderV) designed to generate code from textual or visual inputs, exceeding performance benchmarks in both domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limited progress in integrating visual outputs with text-based source code due to the lack of high-quality multimodal code data.

Method: Developed a synthesis toolkit for efficiently creating multimodal datasets and introduced JanusCoder models, unifying coding tasks across text and visual inputs.

Result: Created JanusCode-800K corpus and demonstrated that JanusCoder models achieve superior performance on various coding tasks, nearing or surpassing commercial models.

Conclusion: JanusCoder represents a significant leap in bridging programmatic logic with visual outputs, leveraging multimodal datasets for advanced applications.

Abstract: The scope of neural code intelligence is rapidly expanding beyond text-based
source code to encompass the rich visual outputs that programs generate. This
visual dimension is critical for advanced applications like flexible content
generation and precise, program-driven editing of visualizations. However,
progress has been impeded by the scarcity of high-quality multimodal code data,
a bottleneck stemming from challenges in synthesis and quality assessment. To
address these challenges, we make contributions from both a data and modeling
perspective. We first introduce a complete synthesis toolkit that leverages
reciprocal synergies between data modalities to efficiently produce a
large-scale, high-quality corpus spanning from standard charts to complex
interactive web UIs and code-driven animations. Leveraging this toolkit, we
construct JanusCode-800K, the largest multimodal code corpus to date. This
powers the training of our models, JanusCoder and JanusCoderV, which establish
a visual-programmatic interface for generating code from textual instructions,
visual inputs, or a combination of both. Our unified model is a departure from
existing approaches that build specialized models for isolated tasks. Extensive
experiments on both text-centric and vision-centric coding tasks demonstrate
the superior performance of the JanusCoder series, with our 7B to 14B scale
models approaching or even exceeding the performance of commercial models.
Furthermore, extensive analysis provides key insights into harmonizing
programmatic logic with its visual expression. Our code and checkpoints will
are available at https://github.com/InternLM/JanusCoder.

TL;DR: Microsoft proposes the Agentic Meta-orchestrator (AMO) for efficient task management and scaling agents in Copilot services.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a robust system allowing Copilot services to dynamically scale with new agents and efficiently distribute tasks across these agents.

Method: Introduce the Agentic Meta-orchestrator (AMO) using meta-learning and decision tree models for orchestrating tasks among various agents/models.

Result: Demonstrated success in two use cases: M365 E-Commerce Copilot (product advertising with up-to-date information) and code compliance copilot (detecting issues in DevOps code).

Conclusion: AMO improves task handling, agent scalability, and showcases effectiveness in real-world use cases of Microsoft Copilot services.

Abstract: Microsoft Copilot suites serve as the universal entry point for various
agents skilled in handling important tasks, ranging from assisting a customer
with product purchases to detecting vulnerabilities in corporate programming
code. Each agent can be powered by language models, software engineering
operations, such as database retrieval, and internal \& external knowledge. The
repertoire of a copilot can expand dynamically with new agents. This requires a
robust orchestrator that can distribute tasks from user prompts to the right
agents. In this work, we propose an Agentic Meta-orchestrator (AMO) for
handling multiple tasks and scalable agents in copilot services, which can
provide both natural language and action responses. We will also demonstrate
the planning that leverages meta-learning, i.e., a trained decision tree model
for deciding the best inference strategy among various agents/models. We
showcase the effectiveness of our AMO through two production use cases:
Microsoft 365 (M365) E-Commerce Copilot and code compliance copilot. M365
E-Commerce Copilot advertises Microsoft products to external customers to
promote sales success. The M365 E-Commerce Copilot provides up-to-date product
information and connects to multiple agents, such as relational databases and
human customer support. The code compliance copilot scans the internal DevOps
code to detect known and new compliance issues in pull requests (PR).

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to investigate how artificial intelligence's development toward superintelligence could pose unintentional existential risks to humanity.

Method: The paper uses theoretical frameworks from Irving J. Good and Nick Bostrom alongside recent publications to analyze AGI and superintelligence's potential implications.

Result: It highlights the risks of human extinction due to uncontrollable and indifferent cognitive superiority of future AI systems.

Conclusion: The research underscores the critical need for addressing ethical and safety concerns as intelligence exceeding human capacity might pose threats indirectly through misaligned goals.

Abstract: This article analyzes the existential risks artificial intelligence (AI)
poses to humanity, tracing the trajectory from current AI to ultraintelligence.
Drawing on Irving J. Good and Nick Bostrom's theoretical work, plus recent
publications (AI 2027; If Anyone Builds It, Everyone Dies), it explores AGI and
superintelligence. Considering machines' exponentially growing cognitive power
and hypothetical IQs, it addresses the ethical and existential implications of
an intelligence vastly exceeding humanity's, fundamentally alien. Human
extinction may result not from malice, but from uncontrollable, indifferent
cognitive superiority.

*Long H Dang,David Rawlinson*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces HRM-Agent, a variant of HRM trained with reinforcement learning, and adapts it for dynamic, uncertain, and partially observable problems, demonstrating its capabilities in maze environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous applications of Hierarchical Reasoning Model (HRM) were limited to static, fully-observable, and supervised problems. The paper aims to expand its applicability to dynamic, uncertain, and real-world scenarios.

Method: The authors develop HRM-Agent by training HRM using reinforcement learning in dynamic and uncertain environments, analyzing its reasoning dynamics.

Result: HRM-Agent successfully navigates dynamic and uncertain maze environments, leveraging recurrent inference to reuse computations from earlier time-steps.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates HRM-Agent's suitability for solving partially observable, dynamic complexities, showcasing HRM's potential with minimal supervision.

Abstract: The Hierarchical Reasoning Model (HRM) has impressive reasoning abilities
given its small size, but has only been applied to supervised, static,
fully-observable problems. One of HRM's strengths is its ability to adapt its
computational effort to the difficulty of the problem. However, in its current
form it cannot integrate and reuse computation from previous time-steps if the
problem is dynamic, uncertain or partially observable, or be applied where the
correct action is undefined, characteristics of many real-world problems.
  This paper presents HRM-Agent, a variant of HRM trained using only
reinforcement learning. We show that HRM can learn to navigate to goals in
dynamic and uncertain maze environments. Recent work suggests that HRM's
reasoning abilities stem from its recurrent inference process. We explore the
dynamics of the recurrent inference process and find evidence that it is
successfully reusing computation from earlier environment time-steps.

*Adrian Orenstein,Jessica Chen,Gwyneth Anne Delos Santos,Bayley Sapara,Michael Bowling*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores reinforcement learning agents optimizing their computational efficiency as they learn by reasoning about and controlling their compute usage. Results indicate these agents perform better and are more efficient.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human learning allows for reduced cognitive effort with proficiency, unlike reinforcement learning agents that do not improve computational efficiency. This paper explores whether agents can decrease their compute footprint while improving at tasks.

Method: Researchers enabled agents to understand compute costs and control their computation during training. They ran experiments on the Arcade Learning Environment to study the effects.

Result: The results indicate that agents aware of compute costs performed better on 75% of tasks and used three times less computation on average compared to standard agents.

Conclusion: Reinforcement learning agents can achieve higher task performance and efficiency by reasoning about their computational efforts, similar to humans.

Abstract: While reinforcement learning agents can achieve superhuman performance in
many complex tasks, they typically do not become more computationally efficient
as they improve. In contrast, humans gradually require less cognitive effort as
they become more proficient at a task. If agents could reason about their
compute as they learn, could they similarly reduce their computation footprint?
If they could, we could have more energy efficient agents or free up compute
cycles for other processes like planning. In this paper, we experiment with
showing agents the cost of their computation and giving them the ability to
control when they use compute. We conduct our experiments on the Arcade
Learning Environment, and our results demonstrate that with the same training
compute budget, agents that reason about their compute perform better on 75% of
games. Furthermore, these agents use three times less compute on average. We
analyze individual games and show where agents gain these efficiencies.

*Guanyu Yao,Qiucheng Wu,Yang Zhang,Zhaowen Wang,Handong Zhao,Shiyu Chang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper addresses the imbalance in reasoning capabilities across visual and textual inputs in multimodal large language models (MLLMs), focusing on the 'modality gap.'


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issue of MLLMs over-relying on textual cues and underperforming in tasks requiring visual reasoning, resulting in a modality gap.

Method: The authors analyze training recipes contributing to the modality gap and propose strategies centered around improving data and loss design to mitigate it.

Result: The study identifies how current training practices amplify the modality gap and explores ways to promote balanced reasoning between modalities.

Conclusion: The research provides actionable insights to develop training recipes that reduce the modality gap, improving multimodal reasoning capabilities in MLLMs while making the findings accessible via open-source code.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated strong
capabilities on vision-and-language tasks. However, recent findings reveal an
imbalance in their reasoning capabilities across visual and textual modalities.
Specifically, current MLLMs often over-rely on textual cues while
under-attending to visual content, resulting in suboptimal performance on tasks
that require genuine visual reasoning. We refer to this phenomenon as the
\textit{modality gap}, defined as the performance disparity between
text-centric and vision-centric inputs. In this paper, we analyze the modality
gap through the lens of training recipes. We first show that existing training
recipes tend to amplify this gap. Then, we systematically explore strategies to
bridge it from two complementary perspectives: data and loss design. Our
findings provide insights into developing training recipes that mitigate the
modality gap and promote more balanced multimodal reasoning. Our code is
publicly available at https://github.com/UCSB-NLP-Chang/Bridging-Modality-Gap.

Motivation: The study aims to improve flight control systems by enhancing action smoothness and evaluating convergence performance.

Conclusion: Analyzing the Lyapunov function provides insights into the impact of discretization and prediction errors on system convergence, which benefits flight control system designs.

Abstract: A cascaded online learning flight control system has been developed and
enhanced with respect to action smoothness. In this paper, we investigate the

model. Comparative results are presented through flight control simulations.

*Giovanni Sileno,Jean-Louis Dessalles*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes a unifying framework for cognitive and AI inferential mechanisms, using symbolic AI and electronic circuit logic gates to explore dependencies and inferential patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of a unifying framework in cognitive studies and artificial intelligence for inferential mechanisms.

Method: The paper utilizes symbolic AI modeling techniques combined with electronic circuit analogies based on logic gates, analyzes dependencies, and identifies inferential patterns using combinatorial exploration.

Result: Four main forms of dependencies are identified, along with eight common inferential patterns, providing a unified perspective on traditionally distinct inferential mechanisms.

Conclusion: The observations highlight functional dependencies and suggest structures that might have broader applicability beyond digital systems and symbolic reasoning.

Abstract: Cognitive studies and artificial intelligence have developed distinct models
for various inferential mechanisms (categorization, induction, abduction,
causal inference, contrast, merge, ...). Yet, both natural and artificial views
on cognition lack apparently a unifying framework. This paper formulates a
speculative answer attempting to respond to this gap. To postulate on
higher-level activation processes from a material perspective, we consider
inferential mechanisms informed by symbolic AI modelling techniques, through
the simplistic lenses of electronic circuits based on logic gates. We observe
that a logic gate view entails a different treatment of implication and
negation compared to standard logic and logic programming. Then, by
combinatorial exploration, we identify four main forms of dependencies that can
be realized by these inferential circuits. Looking at how these forms are
generally used in the context of logic programs, we identify eight common
inferential patterns, exposing traditionally distinct inferential mechanisms in
an unifying framework. Finally, following a probabilistic interpretation of
logic programs, we unveil inner functional dependencies. The paper concludes
elaborating in what sense, even if our arguments are mostly informed by
symbolic means and digital systems infrastructures, our observations may
pinpoint to more generally applicable structures.

*Zhuoxuan Li,Jieyuan Pei,Tangwei Ye,Zhongyuan Lai,Zihan Liu,Fengyuan Xu,Qi Zhang,Liang Hu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces GTR-Mamba, a novel model for next POI recommendation that overcomes limitations of existing methods by leveraging hyperbolic and Euclidean geometries for hierarchical and dynamic data modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Next POI recommendation is crucial in Location-Based Social Networks to understand human mobility and provide personalized suggestions. Existing models struggle to capture both hierarchical spatial structures and dynamic user-specific temporal contexts.

Method: Proposed GTR-Mamba, a framework utilizing hyperbolic geometry for static hierarchical modeling and a novel Mamba layer in Euclidean tangent space for dynamic updates. It incorporates a cross-manifold channel to merge spatial and temporal data effectively.

Result: GTR-Mamba surpasses state-of-the-art models in next POI recommendation, demonstrated through experiments on three real-world datasets.

Conclusion: The framework successfully addresses limitations of existing models, making significant improvements in capturing spatial hierarchies and dynamic temporal contexts for POI recommendations.

Abstract: Next Point-of-Interest (POI) recommendation is a critical task in modern
Location-Based Social Networks (LBSNs), aiming to model the complex
decision-making process of human mobility to provide personalized
recommendations for a user's next check-in location. Existing POI
recommendation models, predominantly based on Graph Neural Networks and
sequential models, have been extensively studied. However, these models face a
fundamental limitation: they struggle to simultaneously capture the inherent
hierarchical structure of spatial choices and the dynamics and irregular shifts
of user-specific temporal contexts. To overcome this limitation, we propose
GTR-Mamba, a novel framework for cross-manifold conditioning and routing.
GTR-Mamba leverages the distinct advantages of different mathematical spaces
for different tasks: it models the static, tree-like preference hierarchies in
hyperbolic geometry, while routing the dynamic sequence updates to a novel
Mamba layer in the computationally stable and efficient Euclidean tangent
space. This process is coordinated by a cross-manifold channel that fuses
spatio-temporal information to explicitly steer the State Space Model (SSM),
enabling flexible adaptation to contextual changes. Extensive experiments on
three real-world datasets demonstrate that GTR-Mamba consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art baseline models in next POI recommendation.

*Kechen Meng,Sinuo Zhang,Rongpeng Li,Xiangming Meng,Chan Wang,Ming Lei,Zhifeng Zhao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces MA-CDMP, a novel approach using diffusion models for decentralized communication resource management, addressing challenges in multi-agent systems and significantly improving performance and scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address scalability, privacy issues, non-stationarity, and limited inter-agent cooperation in decentralized and centralized Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) systems for wireless communication resource management.

Method: The proposed method (MA-CDMP) employs diffusion models and model-based reinforcement learning to capture dynamics, plan trajectories, and uses an inverse dynamics model for efficient action generation. It incorporates a mean-field mechanism to enhance cooperation and mitigate non-stationarity.

Result: MA-CDMP outperforms existing MARL baselines in average reward, scalability, and Quality of Service (QoS) metrics in wireless network optimization experiments.

Conclusion: MA-CDMP presents a scalable and practical solution for wireless network optimization, resolving key challenges like inefficiencies and lack of cooperation in decentralized multi-agent systems.

Abstract: In wireless communication systems, efficient and adaptive resource allocation
plays a crucial role in enhancing overall Quality of Service (QoS). While
centralized Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) frameworks rely on a
central coordinator for policy training and resource scheduling, they suffer
from scalability issues and privacy risks. In contrast, the Distributed
Training with Decentralized Execution (DTDE) paradigm enables distributed
learning and decision-making, but it struggles with non-stationarity and
limited inter-agent cooperation, which can severely degrade system performance.
To overcome these challenges, we propose the Multi-Agent Conditional Diffusion
Model Planner (MA-CDMP) for decentralized communication resource management.
Built upon the Model-Based Reinforcement Learning (MBRL) paradigm, MA-CDMP
employs Diffusion Models (DMs) to capture environment dynamics and plan future
trajectories, while an inverse dynamics model guides action generation, thereby
alleviating the sample inefficiency and slow convergence of conventional DTDE
methods. Moreover, to approximate large-scale agent interactions, a Mean-Field
(MF) mechanism is introduced as an assistance to the classifier in DMs. This
design mitigates inter-agent non-stationarity and enhances cooperation with
minimal communication overhead in distributed settings. We further
theoretically establish an upper bound on the distributional approximation
error introduced by the MF-based diffusion generation, guaranteeing convergence
stability and reliable modeling of multi-agent stochastic dynamics. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that MA-CDMP consistently outperforms existing MARL
baselines in terms of average reward and QoS metrics, showcasing its
scalability and practicality for real-world wireless network optimization.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces the InSUR framework to improve the generation of semantically constrained adversarial examples (SemanticAE) by addressing semantic uncertainty in human instructions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current SemanticAE generation methods struggle with semantic uncertainty in human instructions, including diversity, incompleteness, and ambiguity, which limit their effectiveness.

Method: The InSUR framework includes stabilizing adversarial optimization via residual-driven sampling, supplementing human instructions with contextual constraints, and improving attacking evaluation boundaries.

Result: Experiments showcase enhanced transfer attack performance and pioneer reference-free 3D SemanticAE generation.

Conclusion: The InSUR framework improves SemanticAE generation by addressing instruction uncertainty, making attacks more adaptive, effective, and transferable.

Abstract: Recently, semantically constrained adversarial examples (SemanticAE), which
are directly generated from natural language instructions, have become a
promising avenue for future research due to their flexible attacking forms. To
generate SemanticAEs, current methods fall short of satisfactory attacking
ability as the key underlying factors of semantic uncertainty in human
instructions, such as referring diversity, descriptive incompleteness, and
boundary ambiguity, have not been fully investigated. To tackle the issues,
this paper develops a multi-dimensional instruction uncertainty reduction
(InSUR) framework to generate more satisfactory SemanticAE, i.e., transferable,
adaptive, and effective. Specifically, in the dimension of the sampling method,
we propose the residual-driven attacking direction stabilization to alleviate
the unstable adversarial optimization caused by the diversity of language
references. By coarsely predicting the language-guided sampling process, the
optimization process will be stabilized by the designed ResAdv-DDIM sampler,
therefore releasing the transferable and robust adversarial capability of
multi-step diffusion models. In task modeling, we propose the context-encoded
attacking scenario constraint to supplement the missing knowledge from
incomplete human instructions. Guidance masking and renderer integration are
proposed to regulate the constraints of 2D/3D SemanticAE, activating stronger
scenario-adapted attacks. Moreover, in the dimension of generator evaluation,
we propose the semantic-abstracted attacking evaluation enhancement by
clarifying the evaluation boundary, facilitating the development of more
effective SemanticAE generators. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
superiority of the transfer attack performance of InSUR. Moreover, we realize
the reference-free generation of semantically constrained 3D adversarial
examples for the first time.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the need for flexible, reliable, and interpretable AI explanations that fit various user requirements and perform well across multiple domains.

Method: The framework combines three post-hoc explanation techniques with retrieval-augmented large language models (LLMs), leveraging a multimodal knowledge base and explainer selection per instance.

Result: Evaluation on Heart Disease and Thyroid Cancer datasets shows that LIME balances fidelity and robustness, Anchor provides sparse rules, and SHAP achieves higher user satisfaction, with profiles improving stability and positive ratings.

Conclusion: ProfileXAI facilitates effective, stable, and trustworthy explanations tailored to user categories, proving its value in domain-specific applications.

Abstract: ProfileXAI is a model- and domain-agnostic framework that couples post-hoc
explainers (SHAP, LIME, Anchor) with retrieval - augmented LLMs to produce
explanations for different types of users. The system indexes a multimodal
knowledge base, selects an explainer per instance via quantitative criteria,
and generates grounded narratives with chat-enabled prompting. On Heart Disease
and Thyroid Cancer datasets, we evaluate fidelity, robustness, parsimony, token
use, and perceived quality. No explainer dominates: LIME achieves the best
fidelity--robustness trade-off (Infidelity $\le 0.30$, $L<0.7$ on Heart
Disease); Anchor yields the sparsest, low-token rules; SHAP attains the highest
satisfaction ($\bar{x}=4.1$). Profile conditioning stabilizes tokens ($\sigma
\le 13\%$) and maintains positive ratings across profiles ($\bar{x}\ge 3.7$,
with domain experts at $3.77$), enabling efficient and trustworthy
explanations.

Motivation: Enhance the reliability and systematic guidance for using large language models (LLMs) in generating radiology reports, especially liver MRI reports.

Method: Introduced the MDCA framework to assess report trustworthiness and compared the performance of various advanced LLMs through the SiliconFlow platform.

Result: Several advanced LLMs were evaluated and compared, providing insights into optimized prompts and credibility in radiology reporting.

Conclusion: The framework and results contribute to more trustworthy and standardized LLM-generated radiology reports, supporting clinical contexts and institution-specific needs.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated promising performance in
generating diagnostic conclusions from imaging findings, thereby supporting
radiology reporting, trainee education, and quality control. However,
systematic guidance on how to optimize prompt design across different clinical
contexts remains underexplored. Moreover, a comprehensive and standardized
framework for assessing the trustworthiness of LLM-generated radiology reports
is yet to be established. This study aims to enhance the trustworthiness of
LLM-generated liver MRI reports by introducing a Multi-Dimensional Credibility
Assessment (MDCA) framework and providing guidance on institution-specific
prompt optimization. The proposed framework is applied to evaluate and compare
the performance of several advanced LLMs, including Kimi-K2-Instruct-0905,

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Mixed Density Diffuser (MDD), a planner improving trajectory prediction through tunable density settings, achieving state-of-the-art results in diverse tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiency of excessively sparse or dense planning by creating a model with adaptable densities for improved long-term dependency capture.

Method: Proposes MDD, a diffusion planner with tunable hyperparameters for temporal density, allowing flexibility in planning densities for different trajectory segments.

Result: MDD achieved new state-of-the-art performance on tasks in Maze2D, Franka Kitchen, and Antmaze D4RL domains.

Conclusion: Tunable temporal planning densities in diffusion-based models enhance trajectory prediction and task performance, strengthening MDD's potential across various domains.

Abstract: Recent studies demonstrate that diffusion planners benefit from sparse-step
planning over single-step planning. Training models to skip steps in their
trajectories helps capture long-term dependencies without additional or memory
computational cost. However, predicting excessively sparse plans degrades
performance. We hypothesize this temporal density threshold is non-uniform
across a temporal horizon and that certain parts of a planned trajectory should
be more densely planned. We propose Mixed Density Diffuser (MDD), a diffusion
planner where the densities throughout the horizon are tunable hyperparameters.
MDD achieves a new SOTA across the Maze2D, Franka Kitchen, and Antmaze D4RL

Abstract: Artificial intelligence is undergoing a profound transition from a
computational instrument to an autonomous originator of scientific knowledge.
This emerging paradigm, the AI scientist, is architected to emulate the
complete scientific workflow-from initial hypothesis generation to the final
synthesis of publishable findings-thereby promising to fundamentally reshape
the pace and scale of discovery. However, the rapid and unstructured
proliferation of these systems has created a fragmented research landscape,

Experimental Preparation, Experimental Execution, Scientific Writing, and Paper
Generation. Through this analytical lens, we chart the field's evolution from
early Foundational Modules (2022-2023) to integrated Closed-Loop Systems
(2024), and finally to the current frontier of Scalability, Impact, and
Human-AI Collaboration (2025-present). By rigorously synthesizing these
developments, this survey not only clarifies the current state of autonomous
science but also provides a critical roadmap for overcoming remaining
challenges in robustness and governance, ultimately guiding the next generation
of systems toward becoming trustworthy and indispensable partners in human
scientific inquiry.

*Zhifeng Wang,Meixin Su,Yang Yang,Chunyan Zeng,Lizhi Ye*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes an innovative cross-disciplinary cognitive diagnosis method (TLCD) using deep learning and transfer learning to improve online education.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Online education and cognitive diagnosis methods face challenges in feature extraction and interdisciplinary data complexities.

Method: Combines neural network cognitive diagnosis with deep learning and transfer learning to utilize common features across disciplines.

Result: The TLCD method outperforms traditional models in assessing students across disciplines and provides more accurate evaluations.

Conclusion: The research verifies the advantages of TLCD in cross-disciplinary cognitive diagnosis tasks, benefiting online education evaluations.

Abstract: Driven by the dual principles of smart education and artificial intelligence
technology, the online education model has rapidly emerged as an important
component of the education industry. Cognitive diagnostic technology can
utilize students' learning data and feedback information in educational
evaluation to accurately assess their ability level at the knowledge level.
However, while massive amounts of information provide abundant data resources,
they also bring about complexity in feature extraction and scarcity of
disciplinary data. In cross-disciplinary fields, traditional cognitive
diagnostic methods still face many challenges. Given the differences in
knowledge systems, cognitive structures, and data characteristics between
different disciplines, this paper conducts in-depth research on neural network
cognitive diagnosis and knowledge association neural network cognitive
diagnosis, and proposes an innovative cross-disciplinary cognitive diagnosis
method (TLCD). This method combines deep learning techniques and transfer
learning strategies to enhance the performance of the model in the target
discipline by utilizing the common features of the main discipline. The
experimental results show that the cross-disciplinary cognitive diagnosis model
based on deep learning performs better than the basic model in
cross-disciplinary cognitive diagnosis tasks, and can more accurately evaluate
students' learning situation.

### [61] [Lost in Tokenization: Context as the Key to Unlocking Biomolecular Understanding in Scientific LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23127)
*Kai Zhuang,Jiawei Zhang,Yumou Liu,Hanqun Cao,Chunbin Gu,Mengdi Liu,Zhangyang Gao,Zitong Jerry Wang,Xuanhe Zhou,Pheng-Ann Heng,Lijun Wu,Conghui He,Cheng Tan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper examines the tokenization dilemma of processing raw biomolecular sequences in Scientific Large Language Models (Sci-LLMs) and proposes focusing on high-level structured contexts derived from bioinformatics tools instead of raw sequence interpretation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges Sci-LLMs face in processing raw biomolecular sequences and improve their reasoning capacity for biological discovery.

Method: The authors conducted a systematic comparison of Sci-LLMs on biological reasoning tasks, testing three input modes: sequence-only, context-only, and combined input.

Result: The context-only input mode consistently outperformed other modes, and combining raw sequences with high-level context degraded performance, highlighting that sequence data acts as informational noise.

Conclusion: Sci-LLMs should not be framed as sequence interpreters but as reasoning engines over structured knowledge, advocating for a development focus on high-level knowledge synthesis rather than sequence decoding.

Abstract: Scientific Large Language Models (Sci-LLMs) have emerged as a promising
frontier for accelerating biological discovery. However, these models face a
fundamental challenge when processing raw biomolecular sequences: the
tokenization dilemma. Whether treating sequences as a specialized language,
risking the loss of functional motif information, or as a separate modality,
introducing formidable alignment challenges, current strategies fundamentally
limit their reasoning capacity. We challenge this sequence-centric paradigm by
positing that a more effective strategy is to provide Sci-LLMs with high-level
structured context derived from established bioinformatics tools, thereby
bypassing the need to interpret low-level noisy sequence data directly. Through
a systematic comparison of leading Sci-LLMs on biological reasoning tasks, we
tested three input modes: sequence-only, context-only, and a combination of
both. Our findings are striking: the context-only approach consistently and
substantially outperforms all other modes. Even more revealing, the inclusion
of the raw sequence alongside its high-level context consistently degrades
performance, indicating that raw sequences act as informational noise, even for
models with specialized tokenization schemes. These results suggest that the
primary strength of existing Sci-LLMs lies not in their nascent ability to
interpret biomolecular syntax from scratch, but in their profound capacity for
reasoning over structured, human-readable knowledge. Therefore, we argue for
reframing Sci-LLMs not as sequence decoders, but as powerful reasoning engines
over expert knowledge. This work lays the foundation for a new class of hybrid
scientific AI agents, repositioning the developmental focus from direct
sequence interpretation towards high-level knowledge synthesis. The code is

### [62] [Guiding Skill Discovery with Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23167)
*Zhao Yang,Thomas M. Moerland,Mike Preuss,Aske Plaat,Vincent François-Lavet,Edward S. Hu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a skill discovery method called FoG (Foundation model Guided) to incorporate human preferences into reinforcement learning, ensuring the learning of desirable behaviors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for reinforcement learning agents to learn diverse and meaningful skills without undesirable and potentially hazardous behaviors, as current methods ignore human intentions.

Method: FoG extracts a score function from foundation models to evaluate states based on human intentions and re-weights the rewards in skill discovery algorithms, optimizing desired behaviors.

Result: FoG effectively eliminates undesirable behaviors such as flipping or entering hazardous areas, and enables skill discovery even for behaviors that are hard to define.

Conclusion: FoG supports safer and more desirable skill discovery by leveraging foundation models to align reinforcement learning with human intentions, showing promise in various tasks.

Abstract: Learning diverse skills without hand-crafted reward functions could
accelerate reinforcement learning in downstream tasks. However, existing skill
discovery methods focus solely on maximizing the diversity of skills without
considering human preferences, which leads to undesirable behaviors and
possibly dangerous skills. For instance, a cheetah robot trained using previous
methods learns to roll in all directions to maximize skill diversity, whereas
we would prefer it to run without flipping or entering hazardous areas. In this
work, we propose a Foundation model Guided (FoG) skill discovery method, which
incorporates human intentions into skill discovery through foundation models.
Specifically, FoG extracts a score function from foundation models to evaluate
states based on human intentions, assigning higher values to desirable states
and lower to undesirable ones. These scores are then used to re-weight the
rewards of skill discovery algorithms. By optimizing the re-weighted skill
discovery rewards, FoG successfully learns to eliminate undesirable behaviors,
such as flipping or rolling, and to avoid hazardous areas in both state-based
and pixel-based tasks. Interestingly, we show that FoG can discover skills
involving behaviors that are difficult to define. Interactive visualisations

*Robin Schmöcker,Alexander Dockhorn,Bodo Rosenhahn*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AUPO, a novel decision policy modification for Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), improves MCTS performance on various tasks without requiring transition probabilities or specific graph structures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MCTS has limitations when it comes to exploiting reward distribution and detecting symmetric actions, especially in distant states; this paper aims to address these challenges.

Method: The paper introduces AUPO, an automatic action abstraction algorithm that uses reward distribution statistics in MCTS without relying on transition probabilities or specific graph structures.

Result: Testing AUPO on IPPC benchmark problems demonstrates that it outperforms MCTS in terms of effectiveness and efficiency.

Conclusion: AUPO is highly effective for improving MCTS decision policies, viable for diverse tasks, and compatible with other abstraction techniques for tree search.

Abstract: We introduce a novel, drop-in modification to Monte Carlo Tree Search's
(MCTS) decision policy that we call AUPO. Comparisons based on a range of IPPC
benchmark problems show that AUPO clearly outperforms MCTS. AUPO is an
automatic action abstraction algorithm that solely relies on reward
distribution statistics acquired during the MCTS. Thus, unlike other automatic
abstraction algorithms, AUPO requires neither access to transition
probabilities nor does AUPO require a directed acyclic search graph to build
its abstraction, allowing AUPO to detect symmetric actions that
state-of-the-art frameworks like ASAP struggle with when the resulting
symmetric states are far apart in state space. Furthermore, as AUPO only
affects the decision policy, it is not mutually exclusive with other
abstraction techniques that only affect the tree search.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a sample-efficient DRL method designed to create human-like AI behaviors in video games, outperforming traditional approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the impracticality of using resource-heavy DRL methods in the game industry for creating human-like agents.

Method: The proposed approach improves sample efficiency in value-based DRL by utilizing pre-collected data and enhancing neural network plasticity.

Result: The method trained a goalkeeper agent in EA SPORTS FC 25, achieving a 10% higher ball saving rate, 50% faster training, and qualitative results indicating more human-like gameplay.

Conclusion: The method demonstrates promising results in reducing training time, improving performance, and producing human-like behaviors, influencing future iterations of game AI design.

Abstract: While several high profile video games have served as testbeds for Deep
Reinforcement Learning (DRL), this technique has rarely been employed by the
game industry for crafting authentic AI behaviors. Previous research focuses on
training super-human agents with large models, which is impractical for game
studios with limited resources aiming for human-like agents. This paper
proposes a sample-efficient DRL method tailored for training and fine-tuning
agents in industrial settings such as the video game industry. Our method
improves sample efficiency of value-based DRL by leveraging pre-collected data
and increasing network plasticity. We evaluate our method training a goalkeeper
agent in EA SPORTS FC 25, one of the best-selling football simulations today.
Our agent outperforms the game's built-in AI by 10% in ball saving rate.
Ablation studies show that our method trains agents 50% faster compared to
standard DRL methods. Finally, qualitative evaluation from domain experts
indicates that our approach creates more human-like gameplay compared to
hand-crafted agents. As a testimony of the impact of the approach, the method
is intended to replace the hand-crafted counterpart in next iterations of the
series.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces BlocKOA, a novel data generation algorithm for IC thermal simulation, achieving faster and more precise results with reduced computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current data-driven methods for IC thermal simulation, such as neural operators (NOs), are constrained by the need for extensive high-fidelity training data, which leads to high computational costs.

Method: The BlocKOA algorithm uses the block Krylov approach to derive base solutions from the heat equation. These are then combined to create numerous temperature distributions satisfying physical constraints, and heat operators are applied to determine heat source distributions, creating precise simulation data efficiently.

Result: BlocKOA demonstrated time complexity one order lower than the existing methods and achieved a 420-fold speedup while still maintaining high accuracy, as validated through experiments on 5000 chips.

Conclusion: BlocKOA significantly reduces computational costs while enabling efficient and precise thermal simulation data generation for use in data-driven approaches, paving the way for faster and more cost-effective IC simulations.

Abstract: Recent advances in data-driven approaches, such as neural operators (NOs),
have shown substantial efficacy in reducing the solution time for integrated
circuit (IC) thermal simulations. However, a limitation of these approaches is
requiring a large amount of high-fidelity training data, such as chip
parameters and temperature distributions, thereby incurring significant
computational costs. To address this challenge, we propose a novel algorithm
for the generation of IC thermal simulation data, named block Krylov and
operator action (BlocKOA), which simultaneously accelerates the data generation
process and enhances the precision of generated data. BlocKOA is specifically
designed for IC applications. Initially, we use the block Krylov algorithm
based on the structure of the heat equation to quickly obtain a few basic
solutions. Then we combine them to get numerous temperature distributions that
satisfy the physical constraints. Finally, we apply heat operators on these
functions to determine the heat source distributions, efficiently generating
precise data points. Theoretical analysis shows that the time complexity of
BlocKOA is one order lower than the existing method. Experimental results
further validate its efficiency, showing that BlocKOA achieves a 420-fold
speedup in generating thermal simulation data for 5000 chips with varying
physical parameters and IC structures. Even with just 4% of the generation
time, data-driven approaches trained on the data generated by BlocKOA exhibits
comparable performance to that using the existing method.

*Riccardo Romanello,Daniele Lizzio Bosco,Jacopo Cossio,Dusan Sutulovic,Giuseppe Serra,Carla Piazza,Paolo Burelli*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a reinforcement learning approach to minimize CNOT gates in quantum circuits to enhance efficiency, outperforming existing methods for larger circuit sizes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CNOT gates play a key role in quantum computing, forming a basis for essential operations like entanglement. Reducing their number is critical but remains a computationally complex challenge.

Method: The proposed method uses a single reinforcement learning agent trained up to a fixed size (m = 8), preprocessing matrices of different sizes using embedding or Gaussian striping, enabling adaptability across ranges of circuit sizes.

Result: The approach demonstrates improved performance over the state-of-the-art algorithm, especially as matrix size increases (evaluated between 3 and 15).

Conclusion: The framework efficiently minimizes CNOT gates, showcasing significant advancements in performance and versatility compared to existing algorithms.

Abstract: CNOT gates are fundamental to quantum computing, as they facilitate
entanglement, a crucial resource for quantum algorithms. Certain classes of
quantum circuits are constructed exclusively from CNOT gates. Given their
widespread use, it is imperative to minimise the number of CNOT gates employed.
This problem, known as CNOT minimisation, remains an open challenge, with its
computational complexity yet to be fully characterised. In this work, we
introduce a novel reinforcement learning approach to address this task. Instead
of training multiple reinforcement learning agents for different circuit sizes,
we use a single agent up to a fixed size $m$. Matrices of sizes different from
m are preprocessed using either embedding or Gaussian striping. To assess the
efficacy of our approach, we trained an agent with m = 8, and evaluated it on
matrices of size n that range from 3 to 15. The results we obtained show that
our method overperforms the state-of-the-art algorithm as the value of n
increases.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces a theoretical framework for adaptive communication in human-AI teams using Rational Speech Act (RSA) principles, aiming to enhance human understanding in dynamic, time-sensitive environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve human-AI collaboration in rapidly changing environments by ensuring timely and effective communication that aligns human attention and understanding with critical task elements.

Method: The framework employs Bayesian reference resolution via RSA modeling to design message sequences optimized for user belief alignment. It adapts message specificity and timing based on projections of user attention and belief updates over several timesteps.

Result: Compared to baseline methods, the adaptive signaling framework demonstrates superior effectiveness by leveraging multi-step planning coupled with realistic user awareness modeling.

Conclusion: This paper establishes a theoretical foundation for pragmatic communication within human-agent teams, emphasizing the potential of cognitive science insights to inform assistive agent design.

Abstract: Adaptive agent design offers a way to improve human-AI collaboration on
time-sensitive tasks in rapidly changing environments. In such cases, to ensure
the human maintains an accurate understanding of critical task elements, an
assistive agent must not only identify the highest priority information but
also estimate how and when this information can be communicated most
effectively, given that human attention represents a zero-sum cognitive
resource where focus on one message diminishes awareness of other or upcoming
information. We introduce a theoretical framework for adaptive signalling which
meets these challenges by using principles of rational communication,
formalised as Bayesian reference resolution using the Rational Speech Act (RSA)
modelling framework, to plan a sequence of messages which optimise timely
alignment between user belief and a dynamic environment. The agent adapts
message specificity and timing to the particulars of a user and scenario based
on projections of how prior-guided interpretation of messages will influence
attention to the interface and subsequent belief update, across several
timesteps out to a fixed horizon. In a comparison to baseline methods, we show
that this effectiveness depends crucially on combining multi-step planning with
a realistic model of user awareness. As the first application of RSA for
communication in a dynamic environment, and for human-AI interaction in
general, we establish theoretical foundations for pragmatic communication in
human-agent teams, highlighting how insights from cognitive science can be
capitalised to inform the design of assistive agents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growth of social networking and e-commerce has led to an abundance of opinions online, requiring more refined techniques to determine sentiments and rank entities based on reviews.

Method: The paper uses fuzzy logic reasoning for deeper granularity in opinion classification and ranks entities based on this refined sentiment analysis.

Result: The method achieves accurate classification of sentiments with finer detail and provides rankings of entities based on fuzzy logic-derived sentiment analysis.

Conclusion: Using fuzzy logic reasoning enhances opinion mining by introducing deeper sentiment classification and facilitates effective ranking of entities.

Abstract: Opinions are central to almost all human activities and are key influencers
of our behaviors. In current times due to growth of social networking website
and increase in number of e-commerce site huge amount of opinions are now
available on web. Given a set of evaluative statements that contain opinions
(or sentiments) about an Entity, opinion mining aims to extract attributes and
components of the object that have been commented on in each statement and to
determine whether the comments are positive, negative or neutral. While lot of
research recently has been done in field of opinion mining and some of it
dealing with ranking of entities based on review or opinion set, classifying
opinions into finer granularity level and then ranking entities has never been
done before. In this paper method for opinion mining from statements at a
deeper level of granularity is proposed. This is done by using fuzzy logic
reasoning, after which entities are ranked as per this information.

TL;DR: The paper presents Bid2X, a bidding foundation model for online advertising, designed to be generalizable across various scenarios. It has been successfully implemented on Taobao, increasing GMV and ROI.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Past auto-bidding models have limitations in generalizability across different environments as they are designed for specific cases. The goal is to create a universal model to estimate effects of bids in online advertising scenarios.

Method: The Bid2X model uses uniform series embeddings for heterogeneous data and employs two attention mechanisms for variable and temporal dependencies. It incorporates a zero-inflated projection module to optimize predictions via a joint objective of classification and regression.

Result: Offline tests on eight datasets demonstrated superior performance compared to baselines. Deployment on Taobao's ad platform increased GMV by 4.65% and ROI by 2.44% during online A/B testing.

Conclusion: Bid2X provides a generalizable and effective foundation model for auto-bidding in online advertising, showcasing its real-world efficacy on a large platform like Taobao while contributing to computational advertising developments.

Abstract: Auto-bidding is crucial in facilitating online advertising by automatically
providing bids for advertisers. While previous work has made great efforts to
model bidding environments for better ad performance, it has limitations in
generalizability across environments since these models are typically tailored
for specific bidding scenarios. To this end, we approach the
scenario-independent principles through a unified function that estimates the
achieved effect under specific bids, such as budget consumption, gross
merchandise volume (GMV), page views, etc. Then, we propose a bidding
foundation model Bid2X to learn this fundamental function from data in various
scenarios. Our Bid2X is built over uniform series embeddings that encode
heterogeneous data through tailored embedding methods. To capture complex
inter-variable and dynamic temporal dependencies in bidding data, we propose
two attention mechanisms separately treating embeddings of different variables
and embeddings at different times as attention tokens for representation
learning. On top of the learned variable and temporal representations, a
variable-aware fusion module is used to perform adaptive bidding outcome
prediction. To model the unique bidding data distribution, we devise a
zero-inflated projection module to incorporate the estimated non-zero
probability into its value prediction, which makes up a joint optimization
objective containing classification and regression. The objective is proven to
converge to the zero-inflated distribution. Our model has been deployed on the
ad platform in Taobao, one of the world's largest e-commerce platforms. Offline
evaluation on eight datasets exhibits Bid2X's superiority compared to various
baselines and its generality across different scenarios. Bid2X increased GMV by
4.65% and ROI by 2.44% in online A/B tests, paving the way for bidding
foundation model in computational advertising.

promising avenue for advancing the capabilities of deep reinforcement learning
agents through principled causal inference.

TL;DR: This paper critiques a taxonomic analysis of AI existential risks and discusses the philosophical limitations of linear risk models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To highlight the shortcomings of linear risk models in AI existential risk analysis and improve understanding of their probabilistic assessments.

Method: The paper critiques Swiss Cheese models of risk evaluation, differentiates between risk and uncertainty, and introduces dimensions of option and state-space uncertainty into the analysis.

Result: The incorporation of two types of uncertainty—option and state-space—helps refine the understanding of probabilities in AI existential risk assessments.

Conclusion: Incorporating multidimensional uncertainties offers a more nuanced approach to assessing AI existential risks and overcomes limitations of linear models of risk.

Abstract: This work is a commentary of the article
\href{https://doi.org/10.18716/ojs/phai/2025.2801}{AI Survival Stories: a
Taxonomic Analysis of AI Existential Risk} by Cappelen, Goldstein, and
Hawthorne. It is not just a commentary though, but a useful reminder of the
philosophical limitations of \say{linear} models of risk. The article will
focus on the model employed by the authors: first, I discuss some differences
between standard Swiss Cheese models and this one. I then argue that in a
situation of epistemic indifference the probability of P(D) is higher than what
one might first suggest, given the structural relationships between layers. I
then distinguish between risk and uncertainty, and argue that any estimation of
P(D) is structurally affected by two kinds of uncertainty: option uncertainty
and state-space uncertainty. Incorporating these dimensions of uncertainty into
our qualitative discussion on AI existential risk can provide a better
understanding of the likeliness of P(D).

TL;DR: The paper introduces a policy-aware controller using a large language model (LLM) to interpret natural language access requests aligned with written policies, ensuring compliant and auditable decisions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a system that enables enterprises to make least-privilege access decisions that comply with regulations while being auditable.

Method: The system uses a large language model (Google Gemini 2.0 Flash) and executes decisions via a six-stage reasoning framework, including gated policies and deny-by-default principles.

Result: The system showed improved decision-making with 92.9% Exact Decision Match, perfect DENY recall, no False Approval Rate on must-deny tests, functional appropriateness, and compliance adherence in all cases. Expert ratings of rationale quality were high with low latency.

Conclusion: LLMs, when constrained by policies and explicit auditing mechanisms, can facilitate safe, compliant, and traceable decision-making for enterprise-level access requests.

Abstract: Enterprises need access decisions that satisfy least privilege, comply with
regulations, and remain auditable. We present a policy aware controller that
uses a large language model (LLM) to interpret natural language requests
against written policies and metadata, not raw data. The system, implemented
with Google Gemini~2.0 Flash, executes a six-stage reasoning framework (context
interpretation, user validation, data classification, business purpose test,
compliance mapping, and risk synthesis) with early hard policy gates and deny
by default. It returns APPROVE, DENY, CONDITIONAL together with cited controls
and a machine readable rationale. We evaluate on fourteen canonical cases
across seven scenario families using a privacy preserving benchmark. Results
show Exact Decision Match improving from 10/14 to 13/14 (92.9\%) after applying
policy gates, DENY recall rising to 1.00, False Approval Rate on must-deny
families dropping to 0, and Functional Appropriateness and Compliance Adherence
at 14/14. Expert ratings of rationale quality are high, and median latency is
under one minute. These findings indicate that policy constrained LLM
reasoning, combined with explicit gates and audit trails, can translate human
readable policies into safe, compliant, and traceable machine decisions.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework for Human AI Collaborative Uncertainty Quantification, emphasizing optimal collaboration between humans and AI for reliable decision making. It provides theoretical insights and practical algorithms to improve prediction outcomes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the need to address the gaps in AI predictive systems when dealing with high-stakes decisions under uncertainty. The goal is to combine AI's predictive abilities and humans' domain expertise for optimal decision-making.

Method: The authors propose and formalize a framework for Human AI Collaborative Uncertainty Quantification. It optimizes prediction sets through principles of avoiding counterfactual harm and enabling complementarity. The framework employs offline and online calibration algorithms with guarantees against distribution shifts.

Result: The experimental results across diverse domains such as image classification and medical decision-making demonstrate that collaborative prediction sets outperform predictions made by humans or AI alone. The framework achieves higher coverage and provides more precise prediction sets.

Conclusion: The framework effectively bridges the gap in decision making under uncertainty by combining the complementary strengths of human domain expertise and AI predictive capabilities. It offers theoretical principles and practical solutions for improved outcomes.

Abstract: AI predictive systems are increasingly embedded in decision making pipelines,
shaping high stakes choices once made solely by humans. Yet robust decisions
under uncertainty still rely on capabilities that current AI lacks: domain
knowledge not captured by data, long horizon context, and reasoning grounded in
the physical world. This gap has motivated growing efforts to design
collaborative frameworks that combine the complementary strengths of humans and
AI. This work advances this vision by identifying the fundamental principles of
Human AI collaboration within uncertainty quantification, a key component of
reliable decision making. We introduce Human AI Collaborative Uncertainty
Quantification, a framework that formalizes how an AI model can refine a human
expert's proposed prediction set with two goals: avoiding counterfactual harm,
ensuring the AI does not degrade correct human judgments, and complementarity,
enabling recovery of correct outcomes the human missed. At the population
level, we show that the optimal collaborative prediction set follows an
intuitive two threshold structure over a single score function, extending a
classical result in conformal prediction. Building on this insight, we develop
practical offline and online calibration algorithms with provable distribution
free finite sample guarantees. The online method adapts to distribution shifts,
including human behavior evolving through interaction with AI, a phenomenon we
call Human to AI Adaptation. Experiments across image classification,
regression, and text based medical decision making show that collaborative
prediction sets consistently outperform either agent alone, achieving higher
coverage and smaller set sizes across various conditions.

### [75] [Are Agents Just Automata? On the Formal Equivalence Between Agentic AI and the Chomsky Hierarchy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23487)
*Roham Koohestani,Ziyou Li,Anton Podkopaev,Maliheh Izadi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper equates modern AI architectures with classes in the Chomsky hierarchy and proposes a framework for optimizing agent architectures and formal verification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To link AI agent architectures to formal automata theory for optimizing computational efficiency and establishing boundaries for formal verification and predictability.

Method: The authors map AI agent memory architectures to specific automata classes: reflex agents to finite automata, hierarchical task-decomposition agents to pushdown automata, and reflective agents with writable memory to Turing machines.

Result: They propose the Automata-Agent Framework to optimize agent architectures, facilitate formal verification, and extend it to probabilistic automata for risk assessment.

Conclusion: Formal classification of agents enables the application of automata theory to ensure computational efficiency, agent safety, and predictability, and provides the groundwork for tools like static analysis and agent grammars.

Abstract: This paper establishes a formal equivalence between the architectural classes
of modern agentic AI systems and the abstract machines of the Chomsky
hierarchy. We posit that the memory architecture of an AI agent is the
definitive feature determining its computational power and that it directly
maps it to a corresponding class of automaton. Specifically, we demonstrate
that simple reflex agents are equivalent to Finite Automata, hierarchical
task-decomposition agents are equivalent to Pushdown Automata, and agents
employing readable/writable memory for reflection are equivalent to TMs. This
Automata-Agent Framework provides a principled methodology for right-sizing
agent architectures to optimize computational efficiency and cost. More
critically, it creates a direct pathway to formal verification, enables the
application of mature techniques from automata theory to guarantee agent safety
and predictability. By classifying agents, we can formally delineate the
boundary between verifiable systems and those whose behavior is fundamentally
undecidable. We address the inherent probabilistic nature of LLM-based agents
by extending the framework to probabilistic automata that allow quantitative
risk analysis. The paper concludes by outlining an agenda for developing static
analysis tools and grammars for agentic frameworks.

### [76] [Emotion-Coherent Reasoning for Multimodal LLMs via Emotional Rationale Verifier](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23506)
*Hyeongseop Rha,Jeong Hun Yeo,Yeonju Kim,Yong Man Ro*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Emotional Rationale Verifier (ERV) and an Explanation Reward to improve emotion recognition and reasoning consistency in Multimodal Large Language Models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Emotional understanding is essential for nuanced human-computer interaction, but existing MLLMs fail at faithfully explaining predicted emotions, leading to inconsistencies that undermine trust.

Method: The proposed method introduces ERV and an Explanation Reward mechanism, ensuring the reasoning aligns with target emotions during multimodal emotion recognition without altering model architecture or requiring extra annotations.

Result: Experiments on the MAFW and DFEW datasets demonstrate improved consistency between explanation and prediction, along with enhanced explanation emotion accuracy.

Conclusion: The proposed approach advances emotionally coherent and trustworthy MLLMs, paving the way for more human-like interactions in HCI systems.

Abstract: The recent advancement of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) is
transforming human-computer interaction (HCI) from surface-level exchanges into
more nuanced and emotionally intelligent communication. To realize this shift,
emotion understanding becomes essential allowing systems to capture subtle cues
underlying user intent. Furthermore, providing faithful explanations for
predicted emotions is crucial to ensure interpretability and build user trust.
However, current MLLM-based methods often generate emotion explanations that
diverge from the target labels and sometimes even contradict their own
predicted emotions. This inconsistency poses a critical risk for
misunderstanding and erodes reliability in interactive settings. To address
this, we propose a novel approach: the Emotional Rationale Verifier (ERV) and
an Explanation Reward. Our method guides the model to produce reasoning that is
explicitly consistent with the target emotion during multimodal emotion
recognition without modifying the model architecture or requiring additional
paired video-description annotations. Our method significantly improves
faithful explanation-prediction consistency and explanation emotion accuracy on
the MAFW and DFEW datasets. Through extensive experiments and human
evaluations, we show that our approach not only enhances alignment between
explanation and prediction but also empowers MLLMs to deliver emotionally
coherent, trustworthy interactions, marking a key step toward truly human-like
HCI systems.

approach addresses pressing challenges in active learning, continual
adaptation, and energy-efficient model deployment, offering a pathway toward
responsible, human-centered artificial intelligence.

*Anirban Das,Irtaza Khalid,Rafael Peñaloza,Steven Schockaert*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper addresses systematic relational reasoning and introduces a new benchmark called NoRA to overcome the limitations of current benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to address the challenge of systematic relational reasoning, noticing that existing benchmarks are limited by their oversimplified path-based assumptions.

Method: The authors propose the NoRA benchmark, which incorporates multiple levels of difficulty, moving beyond path-based relational reasoning and fostering generalizable neural network approaches.

Result: The paper introduces NoRA as a novel benchmark that expands the complexity of systematic relational reasoning tasks compared to previous benchmarks.

Conclusion: NoRA is designed to promote progress in neural networks' capacity for systematic relational reasoning beyond predefined architectural assumptions.

Abstract: Designing models that can learn to reason in a systematic way is an important
and long-standing challenge. In recent years, a wide range of solutions have
been proposed for the specific case of systematic relational reasoning,
including Neuro-Symbolic approaches, variants of the Transformer architecture,
and specialised Graph Neural Networks. However, existing benchmarks for
systematic relational reasoning focus on an overly simplified setting, based on
the assumption that reasoning can be reduced to composing relational paths. In
fact, this assumption is hard-baked into the architecture of several recent
models, leading to approaches that can perform well on existing benchmarks but
are difficult to generalise to other settings. To support further progress in
the field of systematic relational reasoning with neural networks, we introduce
NoRA, a new benchmark which adds several levels of difficulty and requires
models to go beyond path-based reasoning.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces OntoPret, an ontology to enable machines to interpret human behavior for effective human-machine teaming, addressing current limitations in frameworks and ontologies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: A significant need exists for machines to interpret complex human behaviors in Industry 5.0 scenarios, bridging the gap between robotic frameworks and behavioral ontologies.

Method: Using cognitive science foundations and a modular engineering methodology, the authors design OntoPret, enabling machine classification of human behaviors, task deviations, and deceptive actions.

Result: OntoPret demonstrates adaptability via two use cases: manufacturing and gameplay, showcasing its applicability and forming the semantic groundwork for reasoning about human intent.

Conclusion: OntoPret successfully bridges the gap between behavioral ontologies and robotic frameworks, advancing human-machine collaborative interpretation and decision-making.

Abstract: As human machine teaming becomes central to paradigms like Industry 5.0, a
critical need arises for machines to safely and effectively interpret complex
human behaviors. A research gap currently exists between techno centric robotic
frameworks, which often lack nuanced models of human behavior, and descriptive
behavioral ontologies, which are not designed for real time, collaborative
interpretation. This paper addresses this gap by presenting OntoPret, an
ontology for the interpretation of human behavior. Grounded in cognitive
science and a modular engineering methodology, OntoPret provides a formal,
machine processable framework for classifying behaviors, including task
deviations and deceptive actions. We demonstrate its adaptability across two
distinct use cases manufacturing and gameplay and establish the semantic
foundations necessary for advanced reasoning about human intentions.

### [80] [ReCode: Unify Plan and Action for Universal Granularity Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23564)
*Zhaoyang Yu,Jiayi Zhang,Huixue Su,Yufan Zhao,Yifan Wu,Mingyi Deng,Jinyu Xiang,Yizhang Lin,Lingxiao Tang,Yingchao Li,Yuyu Luo,Bang Liu,Chenglin Wu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces ReCode, a paradigm enabling agents to unify planning and action through recursive code generation, improving decision-making across granularities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-based agents struggle with dynamic adaptability when handling varying decision granularities due to rigid separations between planning and action.

Method: ReCode represents high-level plans as abstract placeholder functions, recursively decomposing them into sub-functions for dynamic granularity control, while generating hierarchical training data.

Result: ReCode significantly outperforms advanced baselines in inference performance and exhibits strong data efficiency during training.

Conclusion: Integrating planning and action via recursive code generation enhances adaptability and efficiency for universal granularity control in decision-making tasks.

Abstract: Real-world tasks require decisions at varying granularities, and humans excel
at this by leveraging a unified cognitive representation where planning is
fundamentally understood as a high-level form of action. However, current Large
Language Model (LLM)-based agents lack this crucial capability to operate
fluidly across decision granularities. This limitation stems from existing
paradigms that enforce a rigid separation between high-level planning and
low-level action, which impairs dynamic adaptability and limits generalization.
We propose ReCode (Recursive Code Generation), a novel paradigm that addresses
this limitation by unifying planning and action within a single code
representation. In this representation, ReCode treats high-level plans as
abstract placeholder functions, which the agent then recursively decomposes
into finer-grained sub-functions until reaching primitive actions. This
recursive approach dissolves the rigid boundary between plan and action,
enabling the agent to dynamically control its decision granularity.
Furthermore, the recursive structure inherently generates rich,
multi-granularity training data, enabling models to learn hierarchical
decision-making processes. Extensive experiments show ReCode significantly
surpasses advanced baselines in inference performance and demonstrates
exceptional data efficiency in training, validating our core insight that
unifying planning and action through recursive code generation is a powerful
and effective approach to achieving universal granularity control. The code is

*Joachim Baumann,Aleksandra Urman,Ulrich Leicht-Deobald,Zachary J. Roman,Anikó Hannák,Markus Christen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This study examines public attitudes toward AI before and after the launch of ChatGPT, finding reduced acceptance of AI and increased demand for human oversight in decision-making.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Explore how public attitudes shift toward AI technologies after the rapid adoption of generative AI like ChatGPT.

Method: Conducted a two-wave survey study with a representative sample of the Swiss population (n_wave1=1514, n_wave2=1488) to track changes in AI acceptance and preferences.

Result: Findings reveal reduced public acceptance of AI (acceptability dropped from 23% to 30% as "not acceptable at all") and increased demand for human-only decision-making (+8%). Education, linguistic, and gender inequalities widened post-GenAI boom.

Conclusion: Public resistance to AI deployment is rising, challenging industry beliefs about readiness for AI and highlighting the need for technological alignment with public values.

Abstract: The rapid adoption of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) technologies
has led many organizations to integrate AI into their products and services,
often without considering user preferences. Yet, public attitudes toward AI
use, especially in impactful decision-making scenarios, are underexplored.
Using a large-scale two-wave survey study (n_wave1=1514, n_wave2=1488)
representative of the Swiss population, we examine shifts in public attitudes
toward AI before and after the launch of ChatGPT. We find that the GenAI boom
is significantly associated with reduced public acceptance of AI (see Figure 1)
and increased demand for human oversight in various decision-making contexts.
The proportion of respondents finding AI "not acceptable at all" increased from
23% to 30%, while support for human-only decision-making rose from 18% to 26%.
These shifts have amplified existing social inequalities in terms of widened
educational, linguistic, and gender gaps post-boom. Our findings challenge
industry assumptions about public readiness for AI deployment and highlight the
critical importance of aligning technological development with evolving public
preferences.

*Yixing Chen,Yiding Wang,Siqi Zhu,Haofei Yu,Tao Feng,Muhan Zhan,Mostofa Patwary,Jiaxuan You*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes Multi-Agent Evolve (MAE), a self-play reinforcement learning framework that allows LLMs to self-evolve for better reasoning abilities, demonstrating a 4.54% average improvement without relying on human-curated data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While reinforcement learning has shown promise in advancing LLM reasoning, its reliance on human-curated datasets and verifiable rewards limits scalability and generality. Current self-play RL methods also face challenges in applying to general domains due to their dependence on grounded environments.

Method: The paper introduces MAE, based on a triplet of interactive agents (Proposer, Solver, Judge) instantiated from a single LLM. These agents interact and self-evolve using reinforcement learning, optimizing behaviors for tasks like math, reasoning, and general knowledge Q&A.

Result: MAE demonstrates a 4.54% improvement across multiple reasoning benchmarks, as tested on Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct, showcasing its data efficiency and scalability.

Conclusion: The study concludes that MAE is a scalable, data-efficient framework that enhances general reasoning capabilities in LLMs by using reinforcement learning and self-play, with minimal reliance on human supervision.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has demonstrated significant potential in
enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). However,
the success of RL for LLMs heavily relies on human-curated datasets and
verifiable rewards, which limit their scalability and generality. Recent
Self-Play RL methods, inspired by the success of the paradigm in games and Go,
aim to enhance LLM reasoning capabilities without human-annotated data.
However, their methods primarily depend on a grounded environment for feedback
(e.g., a Python interpreter or a game engine); extending them to general
domains remains challenging. To address these challenges, we propose
Multi-Agent Evolve (MAE), a framework that enables LLMs to self-evolve in
solving diverse tasks, including mathematics, reasoning, and general knowledge
Q&A. The core design of MAE is based on a triplet of interacting agents
(Proposer, Solver, Judge) that are instantiated from a single LLM, and applies
reinforcement learning to optimize their behaviors. The Proposer generates
questions, the Solver attempts solutions, and the Judge evaluates both while
co-evolving. Experiments on Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct demonstrate that MAE achieves
an average improvement of 4.54% on multiple benchmarks. These results highlight
MAE as a scalable, data-efficient method for enhancing the general reasoning
abilities of LLMs with minimal reliance on human-curated supervision.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ALITA-G is a self-evolution framework for transforming general-purpose agents into domain experts through systematic tool generation and selection, achieving state-of-the-art results with improved accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for self-evolving agents focus on limited adaptations, such as prompt rewriting, and fail to fully optimize complex reasoning tasks.

Method: ALITA-G generates, abstracts, and curates Model Context Protocol (MCP) tools based on successful task trajectories. At inference, these tools are retrieved and utilized by agents equipped with an MCP Executor.

Result: ALITA-G demonstrated strong performance across benchmarks, achieving new state-of-the-art results, including 83.03% pass@1 and 89.09% pass@3 on GAIA validation, while reducing computational costs.

Conclusion: This framework provides a structured approach to evolving agents into domain-specific experts, enhancing both accuracy and efficiency in reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been shown to perform better when
scaffolded into agents with memory, tools, and feedback. Beyond this,
self-evolving agents have emerged, but current work largely limits adaptation
to prompt rewriting or failure retries. Therefore, we present ALITA-G, a
self-evolution framework that transforms a general-purpose agent into a domain
expert by systematically generating, abstracting, and curating Model Context
Protocol (MCP) tools. In this framework, a generalist agent executes a curated
suite of target-domain tasks and synthesizes candidate MCPs from successful
trajectories. These are then abstracted to parameterized primitives and
consolidated into an MCP Box. At inference time, ALITA-G performs
retrieval-augmented MCP selection with the help of each tool's descriptions and
use cases, before executing an agent equipped with the MCP Executor. Across
several benchmarks GAIA, PathVQA, and Humanity's Last Exam, ALITA-G attains
strong gains while reducing computation costs. On GAIA validation, it achieves
83.03% pass@1 and 89.09% pass@3, establishing a new state-of-the-art result
while reducing mean tokens per example by approximately 15% relative to a
strong baseline agent. ALITA-G thus provides a principled pathway from
generalist capability to reusable, domain-specific competence, improving both
accuracy and efficiency on complex reasoning tasks.

*Eashan Wadhwa,Shanker Shreejith*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: The paper addresses excessive switching activity in FPGAs by introducing Simopt-power, a simulation-driven framework to reduce dynamic power dissipation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dynamic power dissipation in modern FPGAs is primarily caused by excessive switching activities, exacerbated by fine-grained configurability. Existing low-power techniques face challenges like requiring intrusive changes or achieving limited success as device density increases.

Method: Simopt-power is introduced as a simulator-driven optimization framework. It utilizes simulation analysis to identify high-toggle paths, applies Shannon Decomposition to duplicate truth table logic, and relocates critical nets to reduce unnecessary transitions, maintaining functional behavior.

Result: Testing on the RTLLM benchmark shows that Simopt-power reduces switching-induced power by an average of 9%, at the cost of an additional 9% LUT-equivalent resources for arithmetic designs.

Conclusion: Simopt-power demonstrates the potential of leveraging simulation insights for targeted optimizations to achieve significant power reductions in FPGA designs, presenting a practical addition to the FPGA-CAD flow.

Abstract: Excessive switching activity is a primary contributor to dynamic power
dissipation in modern FPGAs, where fine-grained configurability amplifies
signal toggling and associated capacitance. Conventional low-power techniques
-- gating, clock-domain partitioning, and placement-aware netlist rewrites -
either require intrusive design changes or offer diminishing returns as device
densities grow. In this work, we present Simopt-power, a simulator-driven
optimisation framework that leverages simulation analysis to identify and
selectively reconfigure high-toggle paths. By feeding activity profiles back
into a lightweight transformation pass, Simopt-power judiciously inserts
duplicate truth table logic using Shannon Decomposition principle and relocates
critical nets, thereby attenuating unnecessary transitions without perturbing
functional behaviour. We evaluated this framework on open-source RTLLM
benchmark, with Simopt-power achieves an average switching-induced power
reduction of ~9\% while incurring only ~9\% additional LUT-equivalent resources
for arithmetic designs. These results demonstrate that coupling simulation
insights with targeted optimisations can yield a reduced dynamic power,
offering a practical path toward using simulation metadata in the FPGA-CAD
flow.

Motivation: To address the absence of benchmarks for evaluating large language models' (LLMs) performance in the domain of computer architecture.

Method: Developed QuArch, a benchmark containing 2,671 expert-validated QA pairs that cover topics like processor design, memory systems, and interconnection networks, to test LLMs' knowledge and reasoning skills.

Result: Evaluation shows that LLMs demonstrate domain-specific knowledge but lack higher-order thinking skills for advanced computer architecture questions, with performance varied from 34% to 72%.

Conclusion: QuArch highlights the gaps in LLMs' architectural reasoning, creating a foundation for future innovation and evaluation in computing systems with community-wide involvement.

Abstract: The field of computer architecture, which bridges high-level software
abstractions and low-level hardware implementations, remains absent from
current large language model (LLM) evaluations. To this end, we present QuArch
(pronounced 'quark'), the first benchmark designed to facilitate the
development and evaluation of LLM knowledge and reasoning capabilities
specifically in computer architecture. QuArch provides a comprehensive
collection of 2,671 expert-validated question-answer (QA) pairs covering
various aspects of computer architecture, including processor design, memory
systems, and interconnection networks. Our evaluation reveals that while
frontier models possess domain-specific knowledge, they struggle with skills
that require higher-order thinking in computer architecture. Frontier model
accuracies vary widely (from 34% to 72%) on these advanced questions,
highlighting persistent gaps in architectural reasoning across analysis,
design, and implementation QAs. By holistically assessing fundamental skills,
QuArch provides a foundation for building and measuring LLM capabilities that
can accelerate innovation in computing systems. With over 140 contributors from
40 institutions, this benchmark represents a community effort to set the
standard for architectural reasoning in LLM evaluation.

Conclusion: RAMAN provides an effective balance between hardware resource optimization and learning accuracy for future edge-AI applications.

Abstract: Edge-AI applications still face considerable challenges in enhancing
computational efficiency in resource-constrained environments. This work
presents RAMAN, a resource-efficient and approximate posit(8,2)-based
Multiply-Accumulate (MAC) architecture designed to improve hardware efficiency
within bandwidth limitations. The proposed REAP (Resource-Efficient Approximate
Posit) MAC engine, which is at the core of RAMAN, uses approximation in the
posit multiplier to achieve significant area and power reductions with an
impact on accuracy. To support diverse AI workloads, this MAC unit is
incorporated in a scalable Vector Execution Unit (VEU), which permits hardware
reuse and parallelism among deep neural network layers. Furthermore, we propose
an algorithm-hardware co-design framework incorporating approximation-aware
training to evaluate the impact of hardware-level approximation on
application-level performance. Empirical validation on FPGA and ASIC platforms
shows that the proposed REAP MAC achieves up to 46% in LUT savings and 35.66%

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the inefficiencies in signed multiplier designs and optimize their performance for applications like edge detection in machine learning.

Method: The architecture utilizes exact and approximate sign-focused compressors with efficient handling of partial product matrices, truncation, and error compensation mechanisms.

Result: Experimental evaluation highlights a 29.21% reduction in power delay product (PDP) and a 14.39% reduction in power consumption compared to existing designs.

Conclusion: The proposed multiplier demonstrates practical utility in edge detection applications, offering substantial efficiency improvements over traditional designs.

Abstract: This paper presents an approximate signed multiplier architecture that
incorporates a sign-focused compressor, specifically designed for edge
detection applications in machine learning and signal processing. The
multiplier incorporates two types of sign-focused compressors: A + B + C + 1
and A + B + C + D + 1. Both exact and approximate compressor designs are
utilized, with a focus on efficiently handling constant value "1" and negative
partial products, which frequently appear in the partial product matrices of
signed multipliers. To further enhance efficiency, the lower N - 1 columns of
the partial product matrix are truncated, followed by an error compensation
mechanism. Experimental results show that the proposed 8-bit approximate
multiplier achieves a 29.21% reduction in power delay product (PDP) and a
14.39% reduction in power compared to the best of existing multipliers. The
proposed multiplier is integrated into a custom convolution layer and performs
edge detection, demonstrating its practical utility in real-world applications.

### [89] [Policy Optimization Prefers The Path of Least Resistance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21853)
*Debdeep Sanyal,Aakash Sen Sharma,Dhruv Kumar,Saurabh Deshpande,Murari Mandal*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Examines how policy optimization (PO) affects chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning structure in large language models when constraints are relaxed. Finds that PO favors simpler, direct response formats over explicit reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the behavior of policy optimization algorithms when structured reasoning constraints are relaxed in the context of enhancing complex reasoning in large language models.

Method: Conducted controlled experiments to observe PO behavior under relaxed reasoning and response formats, exploring reward decomposition and optimization dynamics.

Result: Policy optimization favors simpler rewards and formats, often abandoning explicit reasoning even when incentivized to retain complex structures. Models optimize for the simplest reward component.

Conclusion: Allowing flexibility in policy optimization reveals challenges in alignment due to reward hacking tendencies, emphasizing the trade-off between freedom for high-reward shortcuts and oversimplification.

Abstract: Policy optimization (PO) algorithms are used to refine Large Language Models
for complex, multi-step reasoning. Current state-of-the-art pipelines enforce a
strict think-then-answer format to elicit chain-of-thought (CoT); however, the
behavior of PO when these rigid constraints are relaxed into an open-ended CoT
structure remains an under-studied question. We investigate this gap with an
extensive suite of controlled experiments and identify a consistent principle:
\textit{policy optimization consistently follows the path of least resistance}.
When afforded the flexibility to interleave reasoning and response, policy
optimization consistently learns to discard explicit reasoning, causing the
policy to degenerate to a direct \texttt{<answer>}-only format. This outcome
holds true across various models and algorithms. We find that this collapse in
format is persistent even when the complex \texttt{<think><answer>} format is
assigned up to 4x larger reward weights. We formalize this principle through a
series of controlled reward decomposition experiments, demonstrating a clear
hierarchy: PO systematically optimizes for the simplest reward component first,
a preference that holds even when faced with mutually exclusive choices or
strong incentives for more complex behaviors. Finally, we show that successful
convergence on the high-reward shortcut is not a low-effort drift but is driven
by the optimization process that requires the KL-regularized policy to have
sufficient freedom to make a significant shift from its initial prior. Our
findings reveal that granting policies the freedom to diverge is a double-edged
sword: while necessary for discovering high-reward shortcuts, it also creates a
powerful incentive to game the simplest aspects of the reward function, posing
a critical challenge for reward hacking under alignment.

*Yasmin Moslem,Muhammad Hazim Al Farouq,John D. Kelleher*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes a layer pruning method to efficiently reduce size and inference time in large language models (LLMs) for machine translation while maintaining translation quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of efficiently deploying large language models (LLMs) for machine translation due to their high computational requirements.

Method: Utilize iterative layer pruning guided by layer importance analysis on the Aya-Expanse-8B model for two translation tasks: Czech to German and English to Egyptian Arabic.

Result: Achieved significant reductions in model size and inference time, while maintaining the translation quality of the original model.

Conclusion: The proposed pruning method effectively preserves translation quality while optimizing model efficiency, showcasing potential for deployment in resource-constrained settings.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have transformed many areas of natural language
processing, including machine translation. However, efficient deployment of
LLMs remains challenging due to their intensive computational requirements. In
this paper, we address this challenge and present our submissions to the Model
Compression track at the Conference on Machine Translation (WMT 2025). In our
experiments, we investigate iterative layer pruning guided by layer importance
analysis. We evaluate this method using the Aya-Expanse-8B model for
translation from Czech to German, and from English to Egyptian Arabic. Our
approach achieves substantial reductions in model size and inference time,
while maintaining the translation quality of the baseline models.

*Yifan Zhang,Lanser Contributors*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Lanser-CLI is a CLI-based orchestration layer for language servers, aimed at enhancing coding agents and CI with deterministic workflows and actionable process rewards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address recurring issues such as API hallucination and mislocalized edits by leveraging the functionality of language servers to provide structural and actionable signals for software agents.

Method: Lanser-CLI uses deterministic techniques, including a Selector DSL for addressing issues, Analysis Bundles for stable metadata capture, safety mechanisms for code modification, and process-reward functions from Language Server fact signals.

Result: Lanser-CLI enables deterministic, replayable coding workflows, adds reliability to coding agents by leveraging language servers, and formalizes properties for better supervision and analysis.

Conclusion: Lanser-CLI integrates IDE-grade language server functionality into coding agents and CI frameworks to achieve reliable program modifications and aligned agent planning.

Abstract: Large language models routinely hallucinate APIs and mislocalize edits, while
language servers compute verified, IDE-grade facts about real code. We present
Lanser-CLI, a CLI-first orchestration layer that pins and mediates a Language
Server Protocol (LSP) server for coding agents and CI, exposing deterministic,
replayable workflows. Our position is that language servers provide not only
structural information (definitions, references, types, diagnostics) but also
an actionable process reward: machine-checked, step-wise signals that align an
agent's planning loop with program reality. In this work, Lanser-CLI
contributes: (i) a robust addressing scheme beyond brittle "file:line:col" via
a Selector DSL (symbolic, AST-path, and content-anchored selectors) with a
principled relocation algorithm; (ii) deterministic Analysis Bundles that
normalize Language Server responses and capture environment/capability metadata
with stable content hashes; (iii) a safety envelope for mutating operations
(rename, code actions) with preview, workspace jails, and Git-aware,
transactional apply; and (iv) a process-reward functional derived from Language
Server facts (diagnostic deltas, disambiguation confidence, and safe-apply
checks) that is computable online and replayable offline. We formalize
determinism under frozen snapshots and establish a monotonicity property for
the process reward, making it suitable for process supervision and
counterfactual analysis. Project Page:

*Chenheng Zhang,Tianqi Du,Jizhe Zhang,Mingqing Xiao,Yifei Wang,Yisen Wang,Zhouchen Lin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'Language Ranker', a method that efficiently improves the LLM response reranking process, achieving similar performance as large reward models while using fewer computational resources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current research on LLMs largely focuses on refining output distributions, with limited attention on the decoding process. Decoding is crucial but existing methods are often computationally expensive and inefficient.

Method: The authors propose 'Language Ranker', a framework that leverages a lightweight module to rerank generated responses using features extracted from the base LLM, inspired by approaches in recommender systems.

Result: Experiments show that Language Ranker achieves comparable performance to advanced reward models across tasks while using less than 0.5M additional parameters, significantly reducing computation costs.

Conclusion: Language Ranker efficiently optimizes LLM decoding with minimal computational overhead, providing a practical solution to enhance LLM performance.

Abstract: Conventional research on large language models (LLMs) has primarily focused
on refining output distributions, while paying less attention to the decoding
process that transforms these distributions into final responses. Recent
advances, such as scaling the computation of inference time with reward models,
have underscored the importance of decoding, but these methods often suffer
from high computational costs and limited applicability. In this paper, we
revisit LLM generation through the lens of recommender systems, conceptualizing
the decoding process as analogous to the ranking stage in recommendation
pipelines. From this perspective, we observe that both traditional decoding
methods and reward models exhibit clear limitations such as redundancy.
Motivated by this insight, we propose Language Ranker, a novel framework that
introduces a lightweight module to rerank candidate responses using features
extracted by the base model. Experiments across a wide range of tasks show that
Language Ranker achieves performance comparable to large-scale reward models,
while requiring only <0.5M additional parameters, significantly reducing the
computational overhead during both training and inference stages. This
highlights the efficiency and effectiveness of our method, showcasing its
potential to fully unlock the capabilities of LLMs.

### [93] [Framework for Machine Evaluation of Reasoning Completeness in Large Language Models For Classification Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21884)
*Avinash Patil*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes RACE, a framework to evaluate the alignment between explanations from Large Language Models (LLMs) and interpretable feature importance scores from logistic regression for text classification tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need to assess if LLM explanations faithfully reflect the predictive features behind their decisions, especially as ML becomes widely used in sensitive domains.

Method: RACE uses token-aware, exact string, and edit-distance matching to analyze alignment between LLM explanations and feature importance scores across four text classification datasets.

Result: Correct LLM predictions align more with supporting features, whereas incorrect predictions highlight contradicting features. Edit-distance matching enhances overlap discovery, preserving asymmetry.

Conclusion: RACE reveals surface-level and flexible evidence reuse in LLM rationales, but also identifies potential amplification of misleading cues, offering a structured approach to evaluate explanation faithfulness.

Abstract: The growing adoption of machine learning (ML) in sensitive domains has
heightened the demand for transparent and interpretable artificial
intelligence. Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly capable of
producing natural language explanations, yet it remains unclear whether these
rationales faithfully capture the predictive signals that underlie decisions.
This paper introduces RACE-Reasoning Alignment for Completeness of
Explanations, a systematic framework to evaluate the alignment between
LLM-generated explanations and interpretable feature importance scores derived
from a logistic regression baseline. We analyze four widely used text
classification datasets-WIKI ONTOLOGY, AG NEWS, IMDB, and GOEMOTIONS-and
compare LLM rationales against top-ranked supporting and contradicting lexical
features. To capture alignment at multiple levels of granularity, RACE
implements token-aware, exact string, and edit-distance matching techniques.
Empirical results reveal a consistent asymmetry: correct predictions exhibit
higher coverage of supporting features, while incorrect predictions are
associated with elevated coverage of contradicting features. Edit-distance
matching further uncovers paraphrastic overlaps, boosting coverage while
preserving this asymmetry. These findings demonstrate that LLM rationales
combine both surface-level and flexible evidence reuse, yet can also amplify
misleading cues in error cases. RACE provides new insights into the
faithfulness of LLM explanations and establishes a quantitative basis for
evaluating reasoning completeness in neural language models.

TL;DR: The paper addresses catastrophic forgetting in large language models and suggests using a behavior-aware sampling framework for targeted safety data selection, showing significant safety improvement with minimal additional training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To prevent large language models from losing safety behaviors when fine-tuned on benign data, and improve fine-tuning efficiency without compromising helpfulness.

Method: Introduces a behavior-aware sampling framework that selects safety examples based on instruction-response behavior and semantic diversity across harm categories.

Result: The framework reduces harmful outputs by up to 41% with only 0.5% additional training data while preserving helpfulness.

Conclusion: Data sampling focused on behavior and diversity effectively enhances model safety and efficiency, providing scalable solutions for fine-tuning large language models.

Abstract: Large language models often lose previously aligned safety behaviors when
fine-tuned on benign data, a phenomenon known as catastrophic forgetting. Prior
work shows that adding random safety examples can mitigate this effect, but it
remains unclear which examples are most effective. We propose a behavior-aware
sampling framework that selects safety examples based on two complementary
factors: instruction-response behavior (e.g., refusal versus compliance) and
semantic diversity across harm categories. Systematic evaluation shows that
this approach substantially reduces harmful outputs while maintaining
helpfulness, achieving up to a 41% reduction in harmfulness with only 0.5%
additional training data. These results highlight how targeted data selection
can improve the safety and efficiency of fine-tuning at scale.

*Dhrupad Bhardwaj,Julia Kempe,Tim G. J. Rudner*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new method called semantic isotropy to assess the trustworthiness of long-form responses by LLMs, offering a less computationally expensive and more reliable alternative to traditional fact-checking approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the need for reliable and computationally inexpensive methods to determine the trustworthiness of long-form responses generated by LLMs, particularly for high-stakes applications requiring substantive accuracy.

Method: Semantic isotropy is introduced as a measure of uniformity across normalized text embeddings. By analyzing the angular dispersion of embeddings on the unit sphere, the study gauges the semantic isotropy to predict the factual consistency of responses.

Result: The proposed method shows that higher semantic isotropy (greater embedding dispersion) corresponds to lower factual consistency. The method consistently outperforms existing approaches in predicting nonfactuality across multiple domains using only a small number of samples.

Conclusion: The study presents a practical, low-cost, and reliable method for integrating trustworthiness assessment into LLM workflows without the need for labeled data, fine-tuning, or complex hyperparameter tuning.

Abstract: To deploy large language models (LLMs) in high-stakes application domains
that require substantively accurate responses to open-ended prompts, we need
reliable, computationally inexpensive methods that assess the trustworthiness
of long-form responses generated by LLMs. However, existing approaches often
rely on claim-by-claim fact-checking, which is computationally expensive and
brittle in long-form responses to open-ended prompts. In this work, we
introduce semantic isotropy -- the degree of uniformity across normalized text
embeddings on the unit sphere -- and use it to assess the trustworthiness of
long-form responses generated by LLMs. To do so, we generate several long-form
responses, embed them, and estimate the level of semantic isotropy of these
responses as the angular dispersion of the embeddings on the unit sphere. We
find that higher semantic isotropy -- that is, greater embedding dispersion --
reliably signals lower factual consistency across samples. Our approach
requires no labeled data, no fine-tuning, and no hyperparameter selection, and
can be used with open- or closed-weight embedding models. Across multiple
domains, our method consistently outperforms existing approaches in predicting
nonfactuality in long-form responses using only a handful of samples --
offering a practical, low-cost approach for integrating trust assessment into
real-world LLM workflows.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: NetMind is a framework for querying network configurations using natural language. It addresses the challenges of long-context understanding, device heterogeneity, and complex reasoning by introducing a tree-based chunking strategy, unified fact graph, and a hybrid language. It outperforms existing baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern networks are complex, leading to higher risks of misconfiguration. Conventional methods using domain-specific languages are effective but have steep learning curves and limited flexibility, prompting the exploration of natural language interfaces enhanced by large language models.

Method: NetMind uses a tree-based configuration chunking strategy for semantic coherence and efficient data partitioning. It normalizes vendor-specific configurations using a unified fact graph. A hybrid imperative-declarative language reduces the reasoning burden on LLMs and improves precision. Additionally, it includes benchmarks with network configurations and NL question-answer pairs.

Result: NetMind shows accurate and scalable network behavior understanding with superior performance compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: NetMind leverages natural language and innovative techniques to address the challenges in understanding complex network behaviors, providing an accessible and effective solution to improve network configuration processes.

Abstract: Modern large-scale networks introduce significant complexity in understanding
network behaviors, increasing the risk of misconfiguration. Prior work proposed
to understand network behaviors by mining network configurations, typically
relying on domain-specific languages interfaced with formal models. While
effective, they suffer from a steep learning curve and limited flexibility. In
contrast, natural language (NL) offers a more accessible and interpretable
interface, motivating recent research on NL-guided network behavior
understanding. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) further enhance
this direction, leveraging their extensive prior knowledge of network concepts
and strong reasoning capabilities. However, three key challenges remain: 1)
numerous router devices with lengthy configuration files challenge LLM's
long-context understanding ability; 2) heterogeneity across devices and
protocols impedes scalability; and 3) complex network topologies and protocols
demand advanced reasoning abilities beyond the current capabilities of LLMs. To
tackle the above challenges, we propose NetMind, a novel framework for querying
networks using NL. Our approach introduces a tree-based configuration chunking
strategy to preserve semantic coherence while enabling efficient partitioning.
We then construct a unified fact graph as an intermediate representation to
normalize vendor-specific configurations. Finally, we design a hybrid
imperative-declarative language to reduce the reasoning burden on LLMs and
enhance precision. We contribute a benchmark consisting of NL question-answer
pairs paired with network configurations. Experiments demonstrate that NetMind
achieves accurate and scalable network behavior understanding, outperforming
existing baselines.

TL;DR: The paper introduces \ours, a framework for generating literature surveys iteratively with improved coherence and quality, integrating multimodal elements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing systems for literature survey generation struggle with noisy retrieval and fragmented structures due to their one-shot design.

Method: \ours employs recurrent outline generation combining incremental paper retrieval and updates, utilizes paper cards for grounded information extraction, and enhances surveys with visualization and multimodal integration.

Result: \ours outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in content coverage, structural coherence, and citation quality, producing user-friendly and well-organized surveys.

Conclusion: \ours significantly improves automated literature surveys and proposes a new benchmark, Survey-Arena, to better assess the quality of machine-generated comparisons with human-written ones.

Abstract: Automatic literature survey generation has attracted increasing attention,
yet most existing systems follow a one-shot paradigm, where a large set of
papers is retrieved at once and a static outline is generated before drafting.
This design often leads to noisy retrieval, fragmented structures, and context
overload, ultimately limiting survey quality. Inspired by the iterative reading
process of human researchers, we propose \ours, a framework based on recurrent
outline generation, in which a planning agent incrementally retrieves, reads,
and updates the outline to ensure both exploration and coherence. To provide
faithful paper-level grounding, we design paper cards that distill each paper
into its contributions, methods, and findings, and introduce a
review-and-refine loop with visualization enhancement to improve textual flow
and integrate multimodal elements such as figures and tables. Experiments on
both established and emerging topics show that \ours\ substantially outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines in content coverage, structural coherence, and
citation quality, while producing more accessible and better-organized surveys.
To provide a more reliable assessment of such improvements, we further
introduce Survey-Arena, a pairwise benchmark that complements absolute scoring
and more clearly positions machine-generated surveys relative to human-written
ones. The code is available at

*Catherine Arnett,Tyler A. Chang,Stella Biderman,Benjamin K. Bergen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The research explores token premiums across languages in parallel texts, showing that adjusting vocabulary size and using superword tokenizers can reduce disparities and improve efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address cross-linguistic disparities in token premiums that increase computational costs and reduce throughput during training and inference of NLP models, despite controlling for dataset and vocabulary size.

Method: The authors trained around 7,000 monolingual tokenizers for 97 languages while varying tokenization algorithms, vocabulary size, and dataset size to analyze token premiums and test influencing factors like writing system and pre-tokenization.

Result: Key findings reveal that data similarity has minimal impact on token premiums, but both vocabulary size and pre-tokenization methods play significant roles in reducing them. Superword tokenizers, which merge tokens over whitespaces, were found to reduce token premiums and enhance compression.

Conclusion: Adjusting vocabulary size to an optimal level and incorporating superword tokenizers effectively reduce crosslingual token premium effects, leading to better computational efficiency and improved text compression.

Abstract: The number of tokens it takes to encode parallel text in different languages
is known to vary. These disparities are called token premiums. Having high
token premiums leads to less throughput during training and increases costs at
inference. In this paper, we show that even after controlling for dataset size,
vocabulary size, and data content, monolingual tokenizers exhibit a wide range
of token premiums across languages. To understand the cross-linguistic
differences that cause these token premiums, we train a suite of approximately
7,000 comparable monolingual tokenizers for 97 languages, manipulating
tokenization algorithm, vocabulary size, and dataset size. We measure token
premiums and test for a relationship between factors such as data similarity
(between tokenizer training and evaluation), vocabulary size, and
pre-tokenization. We also investigate the role of language-specific features
such as writing system and word length. We find that similarity between
training and test data does not impact token premiums, but vocabulary size and
pre-tokenization do. While simply increasing vocabulary size does not lead to
reduced token premium effects, we can determine an ``optimal'' vocabulary size
for each language to achieve significantly reduced token premium effects. We
also train superword tokenizers which allow merges over whitespaces, and we
find that they both reduce token premium effects and improve compression
overall. Thus, intervening on the vocabulary size or the pre-tokenizer
significantly reduces crosslingual token premium effects.

TL;DR: The paper proposes Model-Aware Tokenizer Transfer (MATT), a method to enhance tokenizer transfer for multilingual LLMs by utilizing model internals and attention dynamics, achieving significant efficiency and accuracy gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the limitation of predefined tokenizers in adapting large language models (LLMs) to low-resource or distinct-script languages, which existing methods fail to adequately handle.

Method: The proposed method, MATT, introduces an Attention Influence Modeling (AIM) objective, which captures inter-token communication in a source model and distills it into a target model with a new tokenizer, used as a warm-up before standard language modeling.

Result: MATT demonstrates a better recovery of the original model's performance within a shorter time frame compared to heuristic baselines, showing its superiority in various linguistic scenarios.

Conclusion: Incorporating model internals and attention dynamics into the tokenizer transfer process enables practical and effective adaptation of multilingual LLMs, overcoming limitations of current heuristic methods.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are trained to support an increasing number of
languages, yet their predefined tokenizers remain a bottleneck for adapting
models to lower-resource or distinct-script languages. Existing tokenizer
transfer methods typically rely on semantic heuristics to initialize new
embeddings, ignoring higher-layer model dynamics and limiting transfer quality.
We propose Model-Aware Tokenizer Transfer (MATT), a method that incorporates
model internals into the tokenizer transfer process. MATT introduces an
Attention Influence Modeling (AIM) objective that distills inter-token
communication patterns from a source model into a target model with a new
tokenizer, providing an efficient warm-up before standard language modeling.
Unlike approaches that focus solely on embedding similarity, MATT leverages
attention behavior to guide embedding initialization and adaptation.
Experiments across diverse linguistic settings show that MATT recovers a large
fraction of the original model's performance within a few GPU hours,
outperforming heuristic baselines. These results demonstrate that incorporating
model-level signals offers a practical and effective path toward robust
tokenizer transfer in multilingual LLMs.

TL;DR: The paper demonstrates large language models can identify authorship by capturing individual writing styles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore whether large language models can embody and distinguish unique writing styles of authors.

Method: Training GPT-2 models individually on specific authors' works to analyze predictive accuracy on held-out text from the same and other authors.

Result: Models trained on one author’s style accurately predict text from the same author compared to other authors' texts. It also confirmed authorship of the 15th Oz book.

Conclusion: Large language models embody and effectively capture unique author styles, aiding in authorship attribution and stylistic analysis.

Abstract: We show that large language models (LLMs) can be used to distinguish the
writings of different authors. Specifically, an individual GPT-2 model, trained
from scratch on the works of one author, will predict held-out text from that
author more accurately than held-out text from other authors. We suggest that,
in this way, a model trained on one author's works embodies the unique writing
style of that author. We first demonstrate our approach on books written by
eight different (known) authors. We also use this approach to confirm R. P.
Thompson's authorship of the well-studied 15th book of the Oz series,
originally attributed to F. L. Baum.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper explores using psychological and persuasive strategies to craft prompts that bypass safeguards in Large Language Models, demonstrating their vulnerability to these methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to understand the psychological and linguistic mechanisms causing LLMs to be vulnerable to jailbreak attacks and address their safety concerns using cross-disciplinary insights.

Method: Researchers applied theories of persuasion from social sciences to design adversarial prompts and tested them across multiple aligned LLMs to evaluate their compliance and safety performance.

Result: Persuasion-aware prompts demonstrated significant success in bypassing the alignment safeguards of LLMs, highlighting their vulnerability to structured adversarial inputs.

Conclusion: Incorporating cross-disciplinary research is crucial for addressing LLM safety and developing methods to prevent adversarial attacks effectively.

Abstract: Despite recent advances, Large Language Models remain vulnerable to jailbreak
attacks that bypass alignment safeguards and elicit harmful outputs. While
prior research has proposed various attack strategies differing in human
readability and transferability, little attention has been paid to the
linguistic and psychological mechanisms that may influence a model's
susceptibility to such attacks. In this paper, we examine an interdisciplinary
line of research that leverages foundational theories of persuasion from the
social sciences to craft adversarial prompts capable of circumventing alignment
constraints in LLMs. Drawing on well-established persuasive strategies, we
hypothesize that LLMs, having been trained on large-scale human-generated text,
may respond more compliantly to prompts with persuasive structures.
Furthermore, we investigate whether LLMs themselves exhibit distinct persuasive
fingerprints that emerge in their jailbreak responses. Empirical evaluations
across multiple aligned LLMs reveal that persuasion-aware prompts significantly
bypass safeguards, demonstrating their potential to induce jailbreak behaviors.
This work underscores the importance of cross-disciplinary insight in
addressing the evolving challenges of LLM safety. The code and data are
available.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores the transferability of jailbreak attacks on language models and identifies key statistical properties affecting it.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why certain jailbreak suffixes are transferable across different prompts and models.

Method: Statistical analysis of language model behaviors, focusing on refusal directions and semantic shifts.

Result: Key properties like refusal activation, directional shifts, and orthogonal shifts correlate with successful transfer; semantic similarity has weak correlation.

Conclusion: Insights into transferability allow for improved practical attack outcomes and understanding of underlying mechanisms.

Abstract: Discrete optimization-based jailbreaking attacks on large language models aim
to generate short, nonsensical suffixes that, when appended onto input prompts,
elicit disallowed content. Notably, these suffixes are often transferable --
succeeding on prompts and models for which they were never optimized. And yet,
despite the fact that transferability is surprising and empirically
well-established, the field lacks a rigorous analysis of when and why transfer
occurs. To fill this gap, we identify three statistical properties that
strongly correlate with transfer success across numerous experimental settings:
(1) how much a prompt without a suffix activates a model's internal refusal
direction, (2) how strongly a suffix induces a push away from this direction,
and (3) how large these shifts are in directions orthogonal to refusal. On the
other hand, we find that prompt semantic similarity only weakly correlates with
transfer success. These findings lead to a more fine-grained understanding of
transferability, which we use in interventional experiments to showcase how our
statistical analysis can translate into practical improvements in attack
success.

*Yilin Zhang,Wenda Xu,Zhongtao Liu,Tetsuji Nakagawa,Markus Freitag*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper analyzes length bias in Quality Estimation metrics for machine translation and proposes strategies to mitigate it.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the underexplored issue of length bias in QE metrics, which could lead to unfair penalization of longer translations and negatively impact decision-making processes.

Method: A systematic study was conducted across 10 language pairs to identify length biases in QE metrics. Two strategies were tested: length normalization during training and reference text incorporation during evaluation.

Result: The identified biases show QE metrics over-predict errors for longer translations and favor shorter ones when evaluating candidates. Proposed methods were successful in reducing these biases.

Conclusion: Mitigating length bias in QE metrics improves fairness in translation assessments and enhances applications like QE reranking and reinforcement learning.

Abstract: Quality Estimation (QE) metrics are vital in machine translation for
reference-free evaluation and as a reward signal in tasks like reinforcement
learning. However, the prevalence and impact of length bias in QE have been
underexplored. Through a systematic study of top-performing regression-based
and LLM-as-a-Judge QE metrics across 10 diverse language pairs, we reveal two
critical length biases: First, QE metrics consistently over-predict errors with
increasing translation length, even for high-quality, error-free texts. Second,
they exhibit a preference for shorter translations when multiple candidates are
available for the same source text. These inherent length biases risk unfairly
penalizing longer, correct translations and can lead to sub-optimal
decision-making in applications such as QE reranking and QE guided
reinforcement learning. To mitigate this, we propose two strategies: (a)
applying length normalization during model training, and (b) incorporating
reference texts during evaluation. Both approaches were found to effectively
reduce the identified length bias.

### [104] [Far from the Shallow: Brain-Predictive Reasoning Embedding through Residual Disentanglement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22860)
*Linyang He,Tianjun Zhong,Richard Antonello,Gavin Mischler,Micah Goldblum,Nima Mesgarani*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to disentangle linguistic features in large language models (LLMs) to better understand neural responses to language, emphasizing the study of higher-level reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of understanding how the brain transitions from processing basic linguistic inputs to advanced reasoning. Current methods struggle due to the entangled nature of LLM representations.

Method: The authors present a residual disentanglement approach to separate linguistic components (lexicon, syntax, meaning, reasoning) from LLMs and use these disentangled embeddings to analyze neural responses (ECoG) in patients.

Result: The study found that isolating reasoning embeddings better explains brain activity, even in regions beyond language areas, and revealed distinct temporal patterns for reasoning-related neural signatures.

Conclusion: Disentangled LLM embeddings provide deeper insights into brain responses compared to standard entangled LLM outputs, offering a novel method for identifying the neural basis of high-level reasoning.

Abstract: Understanding how the human brain progresses from processing simple
linguistic inputs to performing high-level reasoning is a fundamental challenge
in neuroscience. While modern large language models (LLMs) are increasingly
used to model neural responses to language, their internal representations are
highly "entangled," mixing information about lexicon, syntax, meaning, and
reasoning. This entanglement biases conventional brain encoding analyses toward
linguistically shallow features (e.g., lexicon and syntax), making it difficult
to isolate the neural substrates of cognitively deeper processes. Here, we
introduce a residual disentanglement method that computationally isolates these
components. By first probing an LM to identify feature-specific layers, our
method iteratively regresses out lower-level representations to produce four
nearly orthogonal embeddings for lexicon, syntax, meaning, and, critically,
reasoning. We used these disentangled embeddings to model intracranial (ECoG)
brain recordings from neurosurgical patients listening to natural speech. We
show that: 1) This isolated reasoning embedding exhibits unique predictive
power, accounting for variance in neural activity not explained by other
linguistic features and even extending to the recruitment of visual regions
beyond classical language areas. 2) The neural signature for reasoning is
temporally distinct, peaking later (~350-400ms) than signals related to
lexicon, syntax, and meaning, consistent with its position atop a processing
hierarchy. 3) Standard, non-disentangled LLM embeddings can be misleading, as
their predictive success is primarily attributable to linguistically shallow
features, masking the more subtle contributions of deeper cognitive processing.

*Shayne Longpre,Sneha Kudugunta,Niklas Muennighoff,I-Hung Hsu,Isaac Caswell,Alex Pentland,Sercan Arik,Chen-Yu Lee,Sayna Ebrahimi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Adaptive Transfer Scaling Law (ATLAS) with extensive multilingual training experiments (10M-8B parameters, 400+ languages). It explores multilingual dynamics, cross-lingual transfer, and scaling strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current scaling laws research primarily focuses on English, which creates limitations for AI systems meant to serve global multilingual users.

Method: The study involves 774 multilingual training experiments across models ranging from 10M to 8B parameters, covering 400+ training languages and 48 evaluation languages. It presents a new scaling law—ATLAS—and derives insights on multilingual learning dynamics and scaling strategies.

Result: ATLAS outperforms existing scaling laws, improving out-of-sample generalization by over 0.3 R^2, while uncovering cross-lingual transfer matrices and computational crossover points for pretraining versus finetuning.

Conclusion: The findings democratize scaling laws across languages, provide cross-lingual transfer insights, and propose efficient strategies for scaling AI models for multilingual applications.

Abstract: Scaling laws research has focused overwhelmingly on English -- yet the most
prominent AI models explicitly serve billions of international users. In this
work, we undertake the largest multilingual scaling laws study to date,
totaling 774 multilingual training experiments, spanning 10M-8B model
parameters, 400+ training languages and 48 evaluation languages. We introduce
the Adaptive Transfer Scaling Law (ATLAS) for both monolingual and multilingual
pretraining, which outperforms existing scaling laws' out-of-sample
generalization often by more than 0.3 R^2. Our analyses of the experiments shed
light on multilingual learning dynamics, transfer properties between languages,
and the curse of multilinguality. First, we derive a cross-lingual transfer
matrix, empirically measuring mutual benefit scores between 38 x 38=1444
language pairs. Second, we derive a language-agnostic scaling law that reveals
how to optimally scale model size and data when adding languages without
sacrificing performance. Third, we identify the computational crossover points
for when to pretrain from scratch versus finetune from multilingual
checkpoints. We hope these findings provide the scientific foundation for
democratizing scaling laws across languages, and enable practitioners to
efficiently scale models -- beyond English-first AI.

*Benjamin Reichman,Adar Avsian,Larry Heck*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study explores emotion representation in LLMs, revealing a universal low-dimensional emotional space that enables steerable, cross-language emotion processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how large language models perceive and process emotions can enhance their interaction capabilities and interpretability.

Method: Analyzing the hidden-state geometry of LLMs to identify emotional representation patterns, evaluate alignment across languages, and apply a learned intervention for steering emotional perceptions.

Result: The paper identifies a stable and distributed emotional manifold across layers and languages, achieving strong performance in emotion alignment and manipulation.

Conclusion: LLMs possess a consistent, universal, and steerable emotional subspace, improving understanding of their affective processing and enabling emotion-guided interventions.

Abstract: This work investigates how large language models (LLMs) internally represent
emotion by analyzing the geometry of their hidden-state space. The paper
identifies a low-dimensional emotional manifold and shows that emotional
representations are directionally encoded, distributed across layers, and
aligned with interpretable dimensions. These structures are stable across depth
and generalize to eight real-world emotion datasets spanning five languages.
Cross-domain alignment yields low error and strong linear probe performance,
indicating a universal emotional subspace. Within this space, internal emotion
perception can be steered while preserving semantics using a learned
intervention module, with especially strong control for basic emotions across
languages. These findings reveal a consistent and manipulable affective
geometry in LLMs and offer insight into how they internalize and process
emotion.

### [107] [Compositional Bias Control in Large Language Models: Preference Learning Fails, Supervision Succeeds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22084)
*Atij Mahesh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper studies six techniques to reduce gender bias in language generation by comparing their effectiveness in constrained sentence generation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address gender-stereotyped biases in large language models, especially in occupation-neutral contexts, and to understand how different control techniques perform in mitigating these biases.

Method: A comparative analysis of six bias mitigation techniques was conducted, evaluating them based on constraint compliance, fluency, and diversity in sentence generation tasks involving agentic and communal descriptors.

Result: Supervised Fine-Tuning achieves nearly perfect compliance and high diversity, while other techniques show limitations like reduced fluency or failure to meet constraints. Explicit supervision proves essential for addressing compositional biases.

Conclusion: Explicit supervision is critical for fair and fluent bias mitigation in language generation, as preference-based methods fail to generalize logical constraints effectively.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) still produce gender-stereotyped language even
in occupation-neutral contexts that reflect deep societal biases (Rudinger et
al., 2018). To address this, prior work has proposed prompting, constrained
decoding (Dathathri et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2024), post-processing, and
fine-tuning-based alignment (Rafailov et al., 2023; Ravfogel et al., 2022).
However, the comparative efficacy and learning dynamics remain little
understood. We report a comparative analysis of six control techniques for bias
mitigation: prompt-only, generate-and-filter, DFA-based Ctrl-G decoding,
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), and
Iterative Nullspace Projection (INLP). We evaluate each method on a
compositional constraint task. This task requires generating sentences that
contain at least one agentic and one communal descriptor for each of the twenty
Winogender-derived occupations. We quantify trade-offs between control strength
and naturalness with evaluations of constraint compliance, lexical diversity,
and fluency. Our results reveal key contrasts among the methods: SFT achieves
99.87 +- 0.15% compliance and high lexical diversity, while DPO, despite
similar training stability, fails at 4.53 +- 0.82%. Ctrl-G guarantees perfect
compliance, but at the cost of severely reduced fluency and diversity.
Preference-based learning fundamentally differs: it cannot satisfy
compositional constraints, as binary preference signals encode ranking, not
logical conjunctions. Only explicit positive supervision enables mitigation of
compositional biases; preference-based alignment fails to generalize logical
structures, underscoring the limitations of preference learning and the
necessity of explicit supervision for fair and fluent controlled generation.

### [108] [Generalization or Memorization: Dynamic Decoding for Mode Steering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22099)
*Xuanming Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A new approach is introduced to balance generalization and memorization in large language models (LLMs) using a theoretical model and inference-time algorithm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs' unpredictability between generalization and memorization limits their application in sensitive and critical contexts.

Method: Develops a theoretical framework based on the Information Bottleneck principle and introduces Dynamic Mode Steering (DMS) with lightweight linear probes and dynamic activation steering to balance LLM reasoning.

Result: DMS improves logical consistency and factual accuracy in reasoning and faithfulness tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed DMS approach offers a reliable and adaptive method to enhance the trustworthiness of LLMs by effectively managing their reasoning modes.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit a troubling duality, capable of both
remarkable generalization and brittle, verbatim memorization of their training
data. This unpredictability undermines their reliability in high-stakes
applications. In this work, we propose a unified framework to understand,
identify, and control these distinct reasoning modes. First, we introduce a
theoretical model based on the Information Bottleneck (IB) principle,
formalizing generalization as the learning of a compressed, task-relevant
representation and memorization as a failure to compress. Building on this
theory, we develop Dynamic Mode Steering (DMS), a novel inference-time
algorithm which comprises two components: (1) a lightweight, causally-grounded
linear probe that identifies the model's instantaneous reliance on
memorization, and (2) a dynamic activation steering mechanism that nudges the
model's computation towards pre-identified generalization circuits. We frame
DMS as a form of adaptive, self-contrastive decoding. Experiments on reasoning
and faithfulness tasks demonstrate that DMS significantly improves logical
consistency and factual accuracy, thereby offering a principled approach to
enhancing LLM reliability.

### [109] [Gradual Forgetting: Logarithmic Compression for Extending Transformer Context Windows](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22109)
*Billy Dickson,Zoran Tiganj*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to improve long-context processing by modifying input representation using logarithmic compression instead of altering transformer architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for long-context processing complicate transformer architecture, motivating the need for a simpler approach leveraging input representation.

Method: The proposed method applies a scale-invariant logarithmic compression to input tokens, enabling long-context processing while maintaining transformer architectural simplicity.

Result: Experiments on WikiText-103 and PG-19 benchmarks demonstrate improved perplexity and better performance with extended compressed temporal contexts.

Conclusion: Logarithmic compression of input tokens is a straightforward and effective technique to enhance a transformer’s long-range memory without architectural modifications.

Abstract: Most approaches to long-context processing increase the complexity of the
transformer's internal architecture by integrating mechanisms such as
recurrence or auxiliary memory modules. In this work, we introduce an
alternative approach that modifies the input representation itself, rather than
the transformer architecture. Inspired by cognitive models of human memory, our
method applies a scale-invariant logarithmic compression to the input tokens.
The resulting compressed representation is processed by a standard, unmodified
transformer, preserving architectural simplicity. We evaluate this approach on
the WikiText-103 and PG-19 language modeling benchmarks, showing a reduction in
perplexity compared to uncompressed baselines. Moreover, performance improves
consistently with longer compressed temporal contexts, showing that input-level
logarithmic compression is a simple and effective way to extend a transformer's
long-range memory.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance reasoning capability in AI models by incorporating sparse activation and improving computational efficiency.

Method: Utilizes a unified Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) paradigm with innovations in architecture, training strategies, reasoning-oriented data, reinforcement fine-tuning, and infrastructure.

Result: Achieved up to 7-fold active-compute efficiency compared to dense models, and established a new Pareto frontier for reasoning accuracy at the trillion parameter scale.

Conclusion: Ling 2.0 provides an efficient foundation for advancing reasoning and thinking models, highlighting the benefits of sparse activation in scalable AI systems.

Abstract: We introduce Ling 2.0, a series reasoning-oriented language foundation built
upon the principle that every activation boosts reasoning capability. Designed
to scale from tens of billions to one trillion parameters under a unified
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) paradigm, Ling 2.0 emphasizes high sparsity,
cross-scale consistency, and efficiency guided by empirical scaling laws. The
series includes three non-thinking (instruct) models - Ling-mini-2.0,
Ling-flash-2.0, and Ling-1T - ranging from 16B to 1T total parameters and
achieving up to 7-fold active-compute efficiency compared with dense
counterparts. Ling 2.0 integrates coordinated innovations across model
architecture, pre-training, post-training, and infrastructure: a high-sparsity
MoE with MTP for efficient reasoning, reasoning-oriented data and mid-training
CoT activation, reinforcement-based fine-tuning (DFT, Evo-CoT), and full-scale
FP8 training with fine-grained heterogeneous pipelines. At the trillion scale,
Ling-1T establishes a new Pareto frontier of reasoning accuracy versus
computational efficiency, demonstrating that sparse activation, when properly
aligned with reasoning objectives, enables scalable and efficient intelligence.
Collectively, Ling 2.0 provides a coherent, open, and efficient foundation for
advancing future reasoning and thinking models, including the Ring series built
upon the same base.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: OlaMind is introduced as a framework for retrieval-augmented customer service dialogue, improving human-likeness and reducing hallucinations through advanced techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern intelligent customer service systems, despite their advancements, suffer from hallucinations and mechanical responses that undermine user experiences during interactions.

Method: The paper developed OlaMind, which employs a two-stage approach: Learn-to-Think to mimic expert reasoning and Learn-to-Respond, integrating supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning.

Result: OlaMind demonstrated significant improvements such as increased resolution rates by 28.92% and 18.42%, and decreased human takeover rates by 6.08% and 7.12%.

Conclusion: OlaMind effectively enhances customer service systems with higher human-likeness, safety from hallucinations, and applicability across diverse scenarios. Public release of code and data will support further advancement.

Abstract: Intelligent customer service (ICS) systems via retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG) have been widely adopted in Web-based domains such as social platforms
and e-commerce, achieving remarkable improvements in automation and efficiency.
However, notable limitations still remain: these systems are prone to
hallucinations and often generate rigid, mechanical responses, which can
introduce business risks and undermine user experience, especially in Web-based
customer service interactions under the RAG scenarios. In this paper, we
introduce OlaMind, a human-like and hallucination-safe customer service
framework for retrieval-augmented dialogue. Specifically, it first leverages a
Learn-to-Think stage to learn the reasoning processes and response strategies
from human experts, and then employs a Learn-to-Respond stage to perform
cold-start supervised fine-tuning (SFT) combined with reinforcement learning
(RL) for basic-to-hard self-refinement. Our method significantly enhances
human-likeness and naturalness while effectively mitigating hallucinations and
critical business risks. We have conducted large-scale online A/B experiments
in an industry-level social customer service setting, and extensive
experimental results show that OlaMind achieves significant cumulative relative
improvements with intelligent resolution rates +28.92%/+18.42% and human
takeover rate -6.08%/-7.12% in community-support/livestream-interaction
scenarios, respectively, which highlights its consistent effectiveness across
diverse real-world applications. The code and data will be publicly available.

*Rahul Ranjan,Mahendra Kumar Gurve,Anuj,Nitin,Yamuna Prasad*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel sentiment analysis benchmark dataset for Maithili, an underrepresented low-resource language, along with extensive experiments emphasizing explainable AI.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Low-resource languages like Maithili lack adequate linguistic resources due to challenges such as limited expert availability and high annotation costs. This scarcity hinders sentiment analysis advancements in such languages.

Method: A dataset with 3,221 Maithili sentences annotated for sentiment polarity and natural language justifications is developed through expert validation. Experiments use both classical machine learning and state-of-the-art transformer models.

Result: The dataset facilitates interpretable sentiment analysis and establishes a culturally grounded benchmark for Maithili, highlighting its effectiveness in multilingual and explainable NLP.

Conclusion: This work provides the first explainable sentiment analysis benchmark for Maithili and contributes significantly to multilingual NLP and explainable AI developments.

Abstract: Developing benchmark datasets for low-resource languages poses significant
challenges, primarily due to the limited availability of native linguistic
experts and the substantial time and cost involved in annotation. Given these
challenges, Maithili is still underrepresented in natural language processing
research. It is an Indo-Aryan language spoken by more than 13 million people in
the Purvanchal region of India, valued for its rich linguistic structure and
cultural significance. While sentiment analysis has achieved remarkable
progress in high-resource languages, resources for low-resource languages, such
as Maithili, remain scarce, often restricted to coarse-grained annotations and
lacking interpretability mechanisms. To address this limitation, we introduce a
novel dataset comprising 3,221 Maithili sentences annotated for sentiment
polarity and accompanied by natural language justifications. Moreover, the
dataset is carefully curated and validated by linguistic experts to ensure both
label reliability and contextual fidelity. Notably, the justifications are
written in Maithili, thereby promoting culturally grounded interpretation and
enhancing the explainability of sentiment models. Furthermore, extensive
experiments using both classical machine learning and state-of-the-art
transformer architectures demonstrate the dataset's effectiveness for
interpretable sentiment analysis. Ultimately, this work establishes the first
benchmark for explainable affective computing in Maithili, thus contributing a
valuable resource to the broader advancement of multilingual NLP and
explainable AI.

*Maria Korobeynikova,Alessia Battisti,Lukas Fischer,Yingqiang Gao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study introduces DETECT, the first metric tailored for German automatic text simplification (ATS), improving evaluations of simplicity, meaning preservation, and fluency over general metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a lack of specialized metrics for evaluating German text simplification, which impacts quality assessment compared to English-focused tools like LENS.

Method: DETECT adapts the English LENS framework to German, using synthetic quality scores generated by large language models (LLMs), eliminating the need for human annotations.

Result: DETECT outperformed general ATS metrics (e.g. SARI, BLEU) in aligning with human judgments, especially in meaning preservation and fluency.

Conclusion: DETECT sets a new benchmark for German ATS evaluation and provides insights on leveraging LLMs for other language accessibility tasks.

Abstract: Current evaluation of German automatic text simplification (ATS) relies on
general-purpose metrics such as SARI, BLEU, and BERTScore, which insufficiently
capture simplification quality in terms of simplicity, meaning preservation,
and fluency. While specialized metrics like LENS have been developed for
English, corresponding efforts for German have lagged behind due to the absence
of human-annotated corpora. To close this gap, we introduce DETECT, the first
German-specific metric that holistically evaluates ATS quality across all three
dimensions of simplicity, meaning preservation, and fluency, and is trained
entirely on synthetic large language model (LLM) responses. Our approach adapts
the LENS framework to German and extends it with (i) a pipeline for generating
synthetic quality scores via LLMs, enabling dataset creation without human
annotation, and (ii) an LLM-based refinement step for aligning grading criteria
with simplification requirements. To the best of our knowledge, we also
construct the largest German human evaluation dataset for text simplification
to validate our metric directly. Experimental results show that DETECT achieves
substantially higher correlations with human judgments than widely used ATS
metrics, with particularly strong gains in meaning preservation and fluency.
Beyond ATS, our findings highlight both the potential and the limitations of
LLMs for automatic evaluation and provide transferable guidelines for general
language accessibility tasks.

*Tianyi Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper measures errors in LLMs’ pairwise text comparison and develops a method to estimate such errors. Through experiments on six LLMs, Claude performed best in terms of error rates and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and quantify the reliability and errors of LLMs in pairwise text comparison, which is crucial for tasks requiring judgment or ranking.

Method: The authors created an error estimation method for uniform error and positional bias scenarios. They applied pairwise comparisons, Copeland counting for ranking, and evaluated six LLMs using five types of text inputs.

Result: The method provided consistent error estimates. Claude demonstrated the lowest error rates and robustness against prompt variation, outperforming alternatives like the biased Bradley-Terry model.

Conclusion: The study highlights poor scalability of LLMs for pairwise text comparison while showing Claude's relative reliability. Their model offers a robust technique to diagnose LLMs' error rates.

Abstract: We measure LLMs' output error at pairwise text comparison, noting the
probability of error in their preferences. Our method does not rely on the
ground truth and supports two scenarios: (i) uniform error rate regardless of
the order of comparison, estimated with two comparisons for each text pair with
either text placed first; (ii) binary positional bias assuming distinct error
rates for the two orders of comparison, estimated with repeated comparisons
between the texts. The Copeland counting constructs a ranking over the compared
texts from pairwise preferences; the ranking reveals the poor scalability of
LLM-based pairwise comparison and helps yield the estimates for LLMs' error
rates. We apply the method to six LLMs (ChatGPT, Claude, DeepSeek, Gemini,
Grok, Qwen) with five types of text input and obtain consistent estimates of
LLMs' error. In general, the measured two positional bias terms are similar,
close to the uniform error. Considering both the error rates and the robustness
to the variation of prompts, Claude obtained the most desirable performance in
this experiment. Our model outperforms the biased Bradley-Terry model and the
commutativity score in indicating LLMs' error at this task.

### [115] [Evolution of the lexicon: a probabilistic point of view](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22220)
*Maurizio Serva*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper critiques and improves the Swadesh approach, showing its probabilistic limits and proposing consideration of gradual lexical modification for more precise determination of temporal language separation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reassess and enhance the understanding of how temporal separation between languages can be accurately determined, addressing the limitations and probabilistic errors in established approaches.

Method: Analyzes probabilistic limits of lexicostatistic methods and introduces gradual lexical modification as an additional stochastic factor to improve precision in linguistic temporal separation.

Result: Incorporating gradual lexical modification significantly increases the precision of temporal separation estimation between languages, highlighting the role of probabilistic factors beyond word replacement.

Conclusion: The study emphasizes that considering gradual changes within language lexicons alongside word replacement provides deeper and more accurate insights into estimating temporal separations between languages.

Abstract: The Swadesh approach for determining the temporal separation between two
languages relies on the stochastic process of words replacement (when a
complete new word emerges to represent a given concept). It is well known that
the basic assumptions of the Swadesh approach are often unrealistic due to
various contamination phenomena and misjudgments (horizontal transfers,
variations over time and space of the replacement rate, incorrect assessments
of cognacy relationships, presence of synonyms, and so on). All of this means
that the results cannot be completely correct.
  More importantly, even in the unrealistic case that all basic assumptions are
satisfied, simple mathematics places limits on the accuracy of estimating the
temporal separation between two languages. These limits, which are purely
probabilistic in nature and which are often neglected in lexicostatistical
studies, are analyzed in detail in this article.
  Furthermore, in this work we highlight that the evolution of a language's
lexicon is also driven by another stochastic process: gradual lexical
modification of words. We show that this process equally also represents a
major contribution to the reshaping of the vocabulary of languages over the
centuries and we also show, from a purely probabilistic perspective, that
taking into account this second random process significantly increases the
precision in determining the temporal separation between two languages.

TL;DR: This study introduces 'Sculpting,' a rule-based prompting method to improve reasoning capabilities in LLMs, outperforming traditional approaches in some settings but not universally for advanced models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) by addressing errors stemming from semantic ambiguity and flawed common sense in traditional Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting.

Method: The study compares three prompting methods—Zero Shot, standard CoT, and Sculpting—evaluated on three OpenAI models (gpt-4o-mini, gpt-4o, and gpt-5) using a mathematical benchmark (GSM8K with 1,317 problems).

Result: Sculpting improves performance on mid-tier models like gpt-4o (97%) compared to standard CoT (93%), but it underperforms on gpt-5 (94.00% vs. 96.36% for CoT). The transition from constraints being effective to limiting is observed.

Conclusion: Prompting strategies need to adapt alongside advancements in LLM capabilities, with simpler prompts potentially being more effective for sophisticated models.

Abstract: Prompt engineering, particularly Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting,
significantly enhances LLM reasoning capabilities. We introduce "Sculpting," a
constrained, rule-based prompting method designed to improve upon standard CoT
by reducing errors from semantic ambiguity and flawed common sense.
  We evaluate three prompting strategies (Zero Shot, standard CoT, and
Sculpting) across three OpenAI model generations (gpt-4o-mini, gpt-4o, gpt-5)
using the GSM8K mathematical reasoning benchmark (1,317 problems).
  Our findings reveal a "Prompting Inversion": Sculpting provides advantages on
gpt-4o (97% vs. 93% for standard CoT), but becomes detrimental on gpt-5 (94.00%
vs. 96.36% for CoT on full benchmark). We trace this to a
"Guardrail-to-Handcuff" transition where constraints preventing common-sense
errors in mid-tier models induce hyper-literalism in advanced models. Our
detailed error analysis demonstrates that optimal prompting strategies must
co-evolve with model capabilities, suggesting simpler prompts for more capable
models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces SteerX, a method for improving the personalization of large language models (LLMs) by using causal inference to enhance activation steering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve the personalization of LLMs, as user preferences vary widely and current activation steering methods fail to differentiate between genuine user preferences and irrelevant data.

Method: SteerX employs causal inference to isolate preference-driven components from preference-agnostic ones, identifies causal effects at the token level, and uses these insights to generate improved activation steering vectors for personalizing LLMs.

Result: SteerX consistently improves the quality of activation steering vectors, as demonstrated through experiments using two steering methods on real-world datasets.

Conclusion: SteerX offers a practical and effective solution to enhance personalization in LLMs by focusing on user-driven preference signals.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable success in recent years,
enabling a wide range of applications, including intelligent assistants that
support users' daily life and work. A critical factor in building such
assistants is personalizing LLMs, as user preferences and needs vary widely.
Activation steering, which directly leverages directions representing user
preference in the LLM activation space to adjust its behavior, offers a
cost-effective way to align the model's outputs with individual users. However,
existing methods rely on all historical data to compute the steering vector,
ignoring that not all content reflects true user preferences, which undermines
the personalization signal. To address this, we propose SteerX, a disentangled
steering method that isolates preference-driven components from
preference-agnostic components. Grounded in causal inference theory, SteerX
estimates token-level causal effects to identify preference-driven tokens,
transforms these discrete signals into a coherent description, and then
leverages them to steer personalized LLM generation. By focusing on the truly
preference-driven information, SteerX produces more accurate activation
steering vectors and enhances personalization. Experiments on two
representative steering backbone methods across real-world datasets demonstrate
that SteerX consistently enhances steering vector quality, offering a practical
solution for more effective LLM personalization.

*Iliass Ayaou,Denis Cavallucci*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PatenTEB creates a benchmark for patent text embeddings with 15 tasks across various scenarios, introducing the patembed model family for multi-task training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address shortcomings in existing benchmarks for patent text embeddings by creating a robust, comprehensive benchmark that reflects specific challenges in the patent domain.

Method: The benchmark, PatenTEB, includes 15 tasks, domain-stratified splits, hard negative mining, and scenario coverage for better evaluation of embeddings. The patembed model family, spanning various parameter sizes, utilizes multi-task training for improved generalization.

Result: Patembed models outperform previous benchmarks, showcasing superior results such as achieving 0.494 V-measure on BigPatentClustering.v2 and 0.377 NDCG@100 on DAPFAM.

Conclusion: Multi-task training enhances generalization for patent text embeddings, while domain-specific initialization shows significant performance benefits. Resources for these advancements are available online.

Abstract: Patent text embeddings enable prior art search, technology landscaping, and
patent analysis, yet existing benchmarks inadequately capture patent-specific
challenges. We introduce PatenTEB, a comprehensive benchmark comprising 15
tasks across retrieval, classification, paraphrase, and clustering, with 2.06
million examples. PatenTEB employs domain-stratified splits, domain specific
hard negative mining, and systematic coverage of asymmetric
fragment-to-document matching scenarios absent from general embedding
benchmarks. We develop the patembed model family through multi-task training,
spanning 67M to 344M parameters with context lengths up to 4096 tokens.
External validation shows strong generalization: patembed-base achieves
state-of-the-art on MTEB BigPatentClustering.v2 (0.494 V-measure vs. 0.445
previous best), while patembed-large achieves 0.377 NDCG@100 on DAPFAM.
Systematic ablations reveal that multi-task training improves external
generalization despite minor benchmark costs, and that domain-pretrained
initialization provides consistent advantages across task families. All

### [119] [From Slides to Chatbots: Enhancing Large Language Models with University Course Materials](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22272)
*Tu Anh Dinh,Philipp Nicolas Schumacher,Jan Niehues*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper explores enhancing large language models (LLMs) for university-level computer science education by leveraging course materials, comparing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Continual Pre-Training (CPT). It finds RAG, especially multi-modal with slides as images, most effective.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle to accurately answer questions within university-level computer science courses. The goal is to enhance their performance by incorporating diverse course materials.

Method: The paper compares Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Continual Pre-Training (CPT) to integrate course-specific knowledge into LLMs. It also investigates multi-modal RAG where lecture slides are presented as images.

Result: RAG is found more effective and efficient than CPT for small-sized university course materials. Using a multi-modal approach with slides as images significantly improves LLM performance compared to text-only retrieval.

Conclusion: Practical strategies like multi-modal RAG can develop AI that better supports education. These techniques may inspire applications in broader educational contexts.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have advanced rapidly in recent years. One
application of LLMs is to support student learning in educational settings.
However, prior work has shown that LLMs still struggle to answer questions
accurately within university-level computer science courses. In this work, we
investigate how incorporating university course materials can enhance LLM
performance in this setting. A key challenge lies in leveraging diverse course
materials such as lecture slides and transcripts, which differ substantially
from typical textual corpora: slides also contain visual elements like images
and formulas, while transcripts contain spoken, less structured language. We
compare two strategies, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Continual
Pre-Training (CPT), to extend LLMs with course-specific knowledge. For lecture
slides, we further explore a multi-modal RAG approach, where we present the
retrieved content to the generator in image form. Our experiments reveal that,
given the relatively small size of university course materials, RAG is more
effective and efficient than CPT. Moreover, incorporating slides as images in
the multi-modal setting significantly improves performance over text-only
retrieval. These findings highlight practical strategies for developing AI
assistants that better support learning and teaching, and we hope they inspire
similar efforts in other educational contexts.

### [120] [Supervised Fine-Tuning or In-Context Learning? Evaluating LLMs for Clinical NER](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22285)
*Andrei Baroian*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper studies clinical Named Entity Recognition on the CADEC corpus, using BERT-style models, GPT-4o in few-shot learning, and supervised fine-tuning (SFT). SFT performed best overall but at a higher cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore and compare the performance of traditional BERT-style models and Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4o in clinical NER tasks, including their capabilities under different configurations.

Method: The authors used three approaches: (i) BERT-style models (Base, BioClinicalBERT, RoBERTa-large), (ii) GPT-4o with few-shot in-context learning under simple vs. complex prompts, and (iii) GPT-4o with supervised fine-tuning. They evaluated these across five clinical entity types from the CADEC corpus.

Result: Among the methods, simple in-context learning with GPT-4o outperformed more complex prompts, and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) achieved the best performance with an F1 of approximately 87.1%. However, BERT-style models showed limited improvement overall.

Conclusion: Large Language Models such as GPT-4o demonstrate strong performance in NER tasks, particularly with supervised fine-tuning, but at higher costs. Simpler tasks result in higher accuracy, implying room for task-specific optimization strategies.

Abstract: We study clinical Named Entity Recognition (NER) on the CADEC corpus and
compare three families of approaches: (i) BERT-style encoders (BERT Base,
BioClinicalBERT, RoBERTa-large), (ii) GPT-4o used with few-shot in-context
learning (ICL) under simple vs.\ complex prompts, and (iii) GPT-4o with
supervised fine-tuning (SFT). All models are evaluated on standard NER metrics
over CADEC's five entity types (ADR, Drug, Disease, Symptom, Finding).
RoBERTa-large and BioClinicalBERT offer limited improvements over BERT Base,
showing the limit of these family of models. Among LLM settings, simple ICL
outperforms a longer, instruction-heavy prompt, and SFT achieves the strongest
overall performance (F1 $\approx$ 87.1%), albeit with higher cost. We find that
the LLM achieve higher accuracy on simplified tasks, restricting classification
to two labels.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper presents memory-based language modeling as an eco-friendly alternative to deep neural networks, focusing on efficient, scalable, and transparent next-token prediction using the OLIFANT model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this paper is to address the ecological footprint of deep neural network-based language models. Memory-based models offer a more efficient and environmentally sustainable approach to language modeling.

Method: The authors propose fast approximations of k-nearest neighbor classification for memory-based models, implementing OLIFANT, which relies fully on CPUs and achieves log-linearly scalable performance.

Result: The study compares OLIFANT to GPT-2 and GPT-Neo, showing comparable accuracy, lower emissions, and faster processing speeds for next-token predictions.

Conclusion: Memory-based language modeling, as implemented in OLIFANT, offers efficient and transparent next-token predictions with reduced ecological impact, presenting a viable alternative to traditional neural network models.

Abstract: We present memory-based language modeling as an efficient, eco-friendly
alternative to deep neural network-based language modeling. It offers
log-linearly scalable next-token prediction performance and strong memorization
capabilities. Implementing fast approximations of k-nearest neighbor
classification, memory-based language modeling leaves a relatively small
ecological footprint both in training and in inference mode, as it relies fully
on CPUs and attains low token latencies. Its internal workings are simple and
fully transparent. We compare our implementation of memory-based language
modeling, OLIFANT, with GPT-2 and GPT-Neo on next-token prediction accuracy,
estimated emissions and speeds, and offer some deeper analyses of the model.

*Ethan Mines,Bonnie Dorr*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper presents the first multilingual Target-Stance Extraction (TSE) benchmark across multiple languages, achieving an F1 score of 12.78, and demonstrating the challenges and sensitivities in multilingual settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the lack of multilingual benchmarks in Target-Stance Extraction (TSE), which previously focused only on English, thereby providing a foundation for understanding public opinion across languages in social media data.

Method: The researchers extended the original TSE pipeline to support multilingual settings without needing separate models for each language, and they tested it on Catalan, Estonian, French, Italian, Mandarin, and Spanish datasets.

Result: The pipeline achieved an F1 score of 12.78, showing the added complexities of multilingual TSE compared to English-only settings. It was also found that target prediction is the major bottleneck and TSE’s performance is highly sensitive to target verbalizations.

Conclusion: This study establishes a baseline for multilingual TSE and highlights the challenges involved, encouraging further resource development, algorithm improvements, and refined evaluation criteria for this task.

Abstract: Social media enables data-driven analysis of public opinion on contested
issues. Target-Stance Extraction (TSE) is the task of identifying the target
discussed in a document and the document's stance towards that target. Many
works classify stance towards a given target in a multilingual setting, but all
prior work in TSE is English-only. This work introduces the first multilingual
TSE benchmark, spanning Catalan, Estonian, French, Italian, Mandarin, and
Spanish corpora. It manages to extend the original TSE pipeline to a
multilingual setting without requiring separate models for each language. Our
model pipeline achieves a modest F1 score of 12.78, underscoring the increased
difficulty of the multilingual task relative to English-only setups and
highlighting target prediction as the primary bottleneck. We are also the first
to demonstrate the sensitivity of TSE's F1 score to different target
verbalizations. Together these serve as a much-needed baseline for resources,
algorithms, and evaluation criteria in multilingual TSE.

### [123] [FAIR-RAG: Faithful Adaptive Iterative Refinement for Retrieval-Augmented Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22344)
*Mohammad Aghajani Asl,Majid Asgari-Bidhendi,Behrooz Minaei-Bidgoli*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FAIR-RAG introduces an agentic framework to enhance multi-hop query performance in RAG systems by identifying evidence gaps and iteratively refining sub-queries, achieving state-of-the-art results on multi-hop QA benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RAG systems struggle with complex queries requiring synthesis from multiple sources due to inefficient gap identification and evidence aggregation.

Method: The framework uses a Structured Evidence Assessment (SEA) module to analyze gaps in multi-hop queries and iteratively refines sub-queries for improved evidence retrieval.

Result: FAIR-RAG achieved new state-of-the-art benchmarks in datasets like HotpotQA, demonstrating a significant performance improvement.

Conclusion: Structured, evidence-driven refinement with explicit gap analysis enables reliable reasoning in advanced RAG systems, enhancing accuracy for complex tasks.

Abstract: While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mitigates hallucination and
knowledge staleness in Large Language Models (LLMs), existing frameworks often
falter on complex, multi-hop queries that require synthesizing information from
disparate sources. Current advanced RAG methods, employing iterative or
adaptive strategies, lack a robust mechanism to systematically identify and
fill evidence gaps, often propagating noise or failing to gather a
comprehensive context. We introduce FAIR-RAG, a novel agentic framework that
transforms the standard RAG pipeline into a dynamic, evidence-driven reasoning
process. At its core is an Iterative Refinement Cycle governed by a module we
term Structured Evidence Assessment (SEA). The SEA acts as an analytical gating
mechanism: it deconstructs the initial query into a checklist of required
findings and audits the aggregated evidence to identify confirmed facts and,
critically, explicit informational gaps. These gaps provide a precise signal to
an Adaptive Query Refinement agent, which generates new, targeted sub-queries
to retrieve missing information. This cycle repeats until the evidence is
verified as sufficient, ensuring a comprehensive context for a final, strictly
faithful generation. We conducted experiments on challenging multi-hop QA
benchmarks, including HotpotQA, 2WikiMultiHopQA, and MusiQue. In a unified
experimental setup, FAIR-RAG significantly outperforms strong baselines. On
HotpotQA, it achieves an F1-score of 0.453 -- an absolute improvement of 8.3
points over the strongest iterative baseline -- establishing a new
state-of-the-art for this class of methods on these benchmarks. Our work
demonstrates that a structured, evidence-driven refinement process with
explicit gap analysis is crucial for unlocking reliable and accurate reasoning
in advanced RAG systems for complex, knowledge-intensive tasks.

Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenging task of irony detection in Urdu, leveraging advances in NLP for historically low-resource languages.

Method: The study involves translating an English ironic corpus into Urdu, evaluates ten machine learning models using GloVe and Word2Vec embeddings, and fine-tunes modern transformer-based models such as BERT, RoBERTa, LLaMA 2, LLaMA 3, and Mistral.

Result: Gradient Boosting achieved the highest F1-score (89.18%) among machine learning models, and LLaMA 3 (8B) performed best among transformer models with an F1-score of 94.61%.

Conclusion: Combining transliteration techniques with advanced NLP models enables effective irony detection in Urdu, highlighting the potential for addressing tasks in other low-resource languages.

Abstract: Ironic identification is a challenging task in Natural Language Processing,
particularly when dealing with languages that differ in syntax and cultural
context. In this work, we aim to detect irony in Urdu by translating an English
Ironic Corpus into the Urdu language. We evaluate ten state-of-the-art machine
learning algorithms using GloVe and Word2Vec embeddings, and compare their
performance with classical methods. Additionally, we fine-tune advanced
transformer-based models, including BERT, RoBERTa, LLaMA 2 (7B), LLaMA 3 (8B),
and Mistral, to assess the effectiveness of large-scale models in irony
detection. Among machine learning models, Gradient Boosting achieved the best
performance with an F1-score of 89.18%. Among transformer-based models, LLaMA 3
(8B) achieved the highest performance with an F1-score of 94.61%. These results
demonstrate that combining transliteration techniques with modern NLP models
enables robust irony detection in Urdu, a historically low-resource language.

*Junjielong Xu,Boyin Tan,Xiaoyuan Liu,Chao Peng,Pengfei Gao,Pinjia He*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: R4P is a scalable reward model for verifying patches in software engineering, addressing limitations of test-based supervision and enhancing training efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome challenges in test-based supervision, such as fragility, inefficiency, and scarcity of high-coverage test data, by leveraging reasoning-based patch verification mechanisms.

Method: The paper introduces R4P, a reasoning-centered patch verifier model for training and testing of software engineering agents. It uses reinforcement learning with group-wise objectives to stabilize reward generation and verifies patches against each other.

Result: R4P achieves 72.2% accuracy for patch verification, surpassing OpenAI o3. Mini-SE, trained with R4P rewards, shows a 10% improvement in task performance and can scale further, demonstrating significant efficiency gains.

Conclusion: R4P enhances the scalability and practicality of patch verification in software engineering, showing strong potential for replacing traditional test-based supervision with reasoning-based models.

Abstract: While large language model agents have advanced software engineering tasks,
the unscalable nature of existing test-based supervision is limiting the
potential improvement of data scaling. The reason is twofold: (1) building and
running test sandbox is rather heavy and fragile, and (2) data with
high-coverage tests is naturally rare and threatened by test hacking via edge
cases. In this paper, we propose R4P, a patch verifier model to provide
scalable rewards for training and testing SWE agents via reasoning. We consider
that patch verification is fundamentally a reasoning task, mirroring how human
repository maintainers review patches without writing and running new
reproduction tests. To obtain sufficient reference and reduce the risk of
reward hacking, R4P uses a group-wise objective for RL training, enabling it to
verify multiple patches against each other's modification and gain a dense
reward for stable training. R4P achieves 72.2% Acc. for verifying patches from
SWE-bench-verified, surpassing OpenAI o3. To demonstrate R4P's practicality, we
design and train a lite scaffold, Mini-SE, with pure reinforcement learning
where all rewards are derived from R4P. As a result, Mini-SE achieves 26.2%
Pass@1 on SWE-bench-verified, showing a 10.0% improvement over the original
Qwen3-32B. This can be further improved to 32.8% with R4P for test-time
scaling. Furthermore, R4P verifies patches within a second, 50x faster than
testing on average. The stable scaling curves of rewards and accuracy along
with high efficiency reflect R4P's practicality.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces VisJudge-Bench, a benchmark for evaluating multimodal language models' (MLLMs) ability to assess visualization aesthetics and quality, and presents VisJudge, a specialized model that outperforms existing MLLMs significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Evaluate how well multimodal large language models assess the quality and aesthetics of visualizations, addressing a lack of systematic benchmarks in this area.

Method: The authors developed VisJudge-Bench, a dataset with 3,090 expert-annotated visualization samples across various formats and types. They tested existing MLLMs like GPT-5 on this benchmark, then developed a tailored model, VisJudge, for this task.

Result: VisJudge outperforms current state-of-the-art MLLMs in visualization assessment, showing a 19.8% reduction in Mean Absolute Error and a 58.7% increase in correlation with human judgments compared to GPT-5.

Conclusion: The proposed benchmark, VisJudge-Bench, reveals limitations in existing MLLMs for visualization assessment. The newly designed VisJudge narrows performance gaps with human experts, advancing the field of visualization evaluation.

Abstract: Visualization, a domain-specific yet widely used form of imagery, is an
effective way to turn complex datasets into intuitive insights, and its value
depends on whether data are faithfully represented, clearly communicated, and
aesthetically designed. However, evaluating visualization quality is
challenging: unlike natural images, it requires simultaneous judgment across
data encoding accuracy, information expressiveness, and visual aesthetics.
Although multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown promising
performance in aesthetic assessment of natural images, no systematic benchmark
exists for measuring their capabilities in evaluating visualizations. To
address this, we propose VisJudge-Bench, the first comprehensive benchmark for
evaluating MLLMs' performance in assessing visualization aesthetics and
quality. It contains 3,090 expert-annotated samples from real-world scenarios,
covering single visualizations, multiple visualizations, and dashboards across
32 chart types. Systematic testing on this benchmark reveals that even the most
advanced MLLMs (such as GPT-5) still exhibit significant gaps compared to human
experts in judgment, with a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.551 and a
correlation with human ratings of only 0.429. To address this issue, we propose
VisJudge, a model specifically designed for visualization aesthetics and
quality assessment. Experimental results demonstrate that VisJudge
significantly narrows the gap with human judgment, reducing the MAE to 0.442 (a
19.8% reduction) and increasing the consistency with human experts to 0.681 (a
58.7% improvement) compared to GPT-5. The benchmark is available at

TL;DR: The paper introduces the CAP dataset for analyzing hallucinations in large language models (LLMs) within scientific text generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hallucinations from LLMs in the scientific domain can distort factual knowledge, worsened by LLMs’ limited contextual comprehension and bias toward superficial generalization.

Method: The CAP dataset features scientific questions and LLM-generated answers annotated for factuality and fluency across nine languages, including high-resource and low-resource ones.

Result: The dataset consists of 900 scientific questions, over 7000 LLM-generated answers, annotated for hallucination detection and linguistic issues, aiding multilingual evaluation.

Conclusion: CAP enables advanced research for improving LLM reliability in scientific text generation and hallucination detection.

Abstract: We introduce the CAP (Confabulations from ACL Publications) dataset, a
multilingual resource for studying hallucinations in large language models
(LLMs) within scientific text generation. CAP focuses on the scientific domain,
where hallucinations can distort factual knowledge, as they frequently do. In
this domain, however, the presence of specialized terminology, statistical
reasoning, and context-dependent interpretations further exacerbates these
distortions, particularly given LLMs' lack of true comprehension, limited
contextual understanding, and bias toward surface-level generalization. CAP
operates in a cross-lingual setting covering five high-resource languages
(English, French, Hindi, Italian, and Spanish) and four low-resource languages
(Bengali, Gujarati, Malayalam, and Telugu). The dataset comprises 900 curated
scientific questions and over 7000 LLM-generated answers from 16 publicly
available models, provided as question-answer pairs along with token sequences
and corresponding logits. Each instance is annotated with a binary label
indicating the presence of a scientific hallucination, denoted as a factuality
error, and a fluency label, capturing issues in the linguistic quality or
naturalness of the text. CAP is publicly released to facilitate advanced
research on hallucination detection, multilingual evaluation of LLMs, and the
development of more reliable scientific NLP systems.

TL;DR: The paper presents CHOIR, a test-time framework utilizing persona variation to improve reasoning robustness in LLMs, achieving substantial enhancement across various tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the impact of minor persona changes on reasoning and explore its constructive potential for improved reasoning robustness.

Method: CHOIR dynamically harmonizes reasoning outputs from counterfactual personas by collaboratively balancing divergence and agreement during test-time prediction.

Result: CHOIR achieves up to 26.4% improvement for individual demographics and 19.2% average improvement across various benchmarks, demographic groups, and tasks, without additional training.

Conclusion: Persona variation can be leveraged as a constructive signal via CHOIR, leading to scalable and generalized improvements in LLM reasoning reliability.

Abstract: Persona-assigned Large Language Models (LLMs) can adopt diverse roles,
enabling personalized and context-aware reasoning. However, even minor
demographic perturbations in personas, such as simple pronoun changes, can
alter reasoning trajectories, leading to divergent sets of correct answers.
Instead of treating these variations as biases to be mitigated, we explore
their potential as a constructive resource to improve reasoning robustness. We
propose CHOIR (Collaborative Harmonization fOr Inference Robustness), a
test-time framework that harmonizes multiple persona-conditioned reasoning
signals into a unified prediction. CHOIR orchestrates a collaborative decoding
process among counterfactual personas, dynamically balancing agreement and
divergence in their reasoning paths. Experiments on various reasoning
benchmarks demonstrate that CHOIR consistently enhances performance across
demographics, model architectures, scales, and tasks - without additional
training. Improvements reach up to 26.4% for individual demographic groups and
19.2% on average across five demographics. It remains effective even when base
personas are suboptimal. By reframing persona variation as a constructive
signal, CHOIR provides a scalable and generalizable approach to more reliable
LLM reasoning.

*Siyu Liang,Zhaxi Zerong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates tonogenesis (segmental contrasts evolving into lexical tone) using automatic speech recognition (ASR) to measure pitch manipulation effects across Tibetan language dialects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the functional role of pitch during sound change in tonogenesis, especially its transition in closely related languages.

Method: A computational approach using ASR models to quantify sensitivity to pitch changes in Tibetan dialects (Amdo, Kham, U-Tsang) to highlight differences in pitch dependence.

Result: Findings illustrate a tonogenesis continuum: atonal dialects tolerate pitch removal, tonal dialects degrade significantly under pitch removal, and transitional dialects show intermediate sensitivity.

Conclusion: Computational methods reveal nuanced functional load changes during sound transition, suggesting that traditional metrics may overestimate pitch reliance in transitional systems with mixed segmental and suprasegmental cues.

Abstract: Tonogenesis-the historical process by which segmental contrasts evolve into
lexical tone-has traditionally been studied through comparative reconstruction
and acoustic phonetics. We introduce a computational approach that quantifies
the functional role of pitch at different stages of this sound change by
measuring how pitch manipulation affects automatic speech recognition (ASR)
performance. Through analysis on the sensitivity to pitch-flattening from a set
of closely related Tibetan languages, we find evidence of a tonogenesis
continuum: atonal Amdo dialects tolerate pitch removal the most, while fully
tonal U-Tsang varieties show severe degradation, and intermediate Kham dialects
fall measurably between these extremes. These gradient effects demonstrate how
ASR models implicitly learn the shifting functional load of pitch as languages
transition from consonant-based to tone-based lexical contrasts. Our findings
show that computational methods can capture fine-grained stages of sound change
and suggest that traditional functional load metrics, based solely on minimal
pairs, may overestimate pitch dependence in transitional systems where
segmental and suprasegmental cues remain phonetically intertwined.

Motivation: To address the limitations of conventional LLM pruning methods, which often focus on preserving general fluency but overlook the specialized task-specific performance.

Method: The method extends conventional pruning approaches by computing parameter importance using both general-domain calibration data and task-specific feature distributions. Parameters are partitioned into shared and exclusive groups, and their scores are fused to guide effective pruning.

Result: The proposed framework integrates with existing pruning techniques, preserving specialized LLM abilities. Experiments on benchmarks show consistent superiority over baseline methods at identical pruning ratios.

Conclusion: The method achieves a balance between compression and task-specific capability retention, offering an effective solution for optimizing LLMs.

Abstract: Pruning provides a practical solution to reduce the resources required to run
large language models (LLMs) to benefit from their effective capabilities as
well as control their cost for training and inference. Research on LLM pruning
often ranks the importance of LLM parameters using their magnitudes and
calibration-data activations and removes (or masks) the less important ones,
accordingly reducing LLMs' size. However, these approaches primarily focus on
preserving the LLM's ability to generate fluent sentences, while neglecting
performance on specific domains and tasks. In this paper, we propose a simple
yet effective pruning approach for LLMs that preserves task-specific
capabilities while shrinking their parameter space. We first analyze how
conventional pruning minimizes loss perturbation under general-domain
calibration and extend this formulation by incorporating task-specific feature
distributions into the importance computation of existing pruning algorithms.
Thus, our framework computes separate importance scores using both general and
task-specific calibration data, partitions parameters into shared and exclusive
groups based on activation-norm differences, and then fuses their scores to
guide the pruning process. This design enables our method to integrate
seamlessly with various foundation pruning techniques and preserve the LLM's
specialized abilities under compression. Experiments on widely used benchmarks
demonstrate that our approach is effective and consistently outperforms the
baselines with identical pruning ratios and different settings.

*Marah Ghoummaid,Vladimir Tchuiev,Ofek Glick,Michal Moschkovitz,Dotan Di Castro*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces MATCH, a novel reference-free evaluation metric for AI-generated code, addressing shortcomings in current metrics by leveraging contrastive learning for code and task description embeddings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of existing evaluation methods for generated code, such as their cost, lack of scalability, and inability to measure alignment with developer intent without reference code.

Method: MATCH leverages contrastive learning to generate embeddings for code and natural language task descriptions, enabling a similarity scoring system that evaluates how well generated code implements the given task.

Result: MATCH demonstrates stronger correlations with functional correctness and human preferences compared to existing evaluation metrics, across multiple programming languages.

Conclusion: MATCH effectively addresses the need for a scalable and accurate reference-free metric for evaluating AI-generated code, showing significant improvements over traditional and existing methods.

Abstract: AI-based code generation is increasingly prevalent, with GitHub Copilot
estimated to generate 46% of the code on GitHub. Accurately evaluating how well
generated code aligns with developer intent remains a critical challenge.
Traditional evaluation methods, such as unit tests, are often unscalable and
costly. Syntactic similarity metrics (e.g., BLEU, ROUGE) fail to capture code
functionality, and metrics like CodeBERTScore require reference code, which is
not always available. To address the gap in reference-free evaluation, with few
alternatives such as ICE-Score, this paper introduces MATCH, a novel
reference-free metric. MATCH uses Contrastive Learning to generate meaningful
embeddings for code and natural language task descriptions, enabling similarity
scoring that reflects how well generated code implements the task. We show that
MATCH achieves stronger correlations with functional correctness and human
preference than existing metrics across multiple programming languages.

### [133] [The Limits of Data Scaling: Sub-token Utilization and Acoustic Saturation in Multilingual ASR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22492)
*Siyu Liang,Nicolas Ballier,Gina-Anne Levow,Richard Wright*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper analyzes multilingual ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition) models, focusing on sub-token utilization across languages during inference. Findings indicate data disparity doesn't significantly impact lexical diversity, and sub-token discovery rates stabilize over time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how multilingual ASR models utilize linguistic sub-tokens from diverse typological and orthographic structures during inference and to investigate the impact of training data scale and language variability.

Method: The authors analyzed Whisper's decoding behavior in 49 languages by logging and examining sub-token discovery over time. They identified patterns such as acoustic saturation time and examined statistical distributions and correlations with resource levels.

Result: Findings show saturation time for sub-token activation, statistical patterns like Zipf-Mandelbrot distributions, and differences in metrics favoring Latin-script languages over others such as Cyrillic, CJK, and Semitic.

Conclusion: Sub-token utilization in multilingual ASR models depends on language-specific structures rather than the scale of training data, promoting equitable corpus design and cross-lingual evaluation principles.

Abstract: How much audio is needed to fully observe a multilingual ASR model's learned
sub-token inventory across languages, and does data disparity in multilingual
pre-training affect how these tokens are utilized during inference? We address
this question by analyzing Whisper's decoding behavior during inference across
49 languages. By logging decoding candidate sub-tokens and tracking their
cumulative discovery over time, we study the utilization pattern of the model's
sub-token space. Results show that the total number of discovered tokens
remains largely independent of a language's pre-training hours, indicating that
data disparity does not strongly influence lexical diversity in the model's
hypothesis space. Sub-token discovery rates follow a consistent exponential
saturation pattern across languages, suggesting a stable time window after
which additional audio yields minimal new sub-token activation. We refer to
this convergence threshold as acoustic saturation time (AST). Further analyses
of rank-frequency distributions reveal Zipf-like patterns better modeled by a
Zipf-Mandelbrot law, and mean sub-token length shows a positive correlation
with resource level. Additionally, those metrics show more favorable patterns
for languages in the Latin script than those in scripts such as Cyrillic, CJK,
and Semitic. Together, our study suggests that sub-token utilization during
multilingual ASR inference is constrained more by the statistical, typological,
and orthographic structure of the speech than by training data scale, providing
an empirical basis for more equitable corpus construction and cross-lingual
evaluation.

### [134] [A Sociophonetic Analysis of Racial Bias in Commercial ASR Systems Using the Pacific Northwest English Corpus](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22495)
*Michael Scott,Siyu Liang,Alicia Wassink,Gina-Anne Levow*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper evaluates racial bias in major ASR systems using the Pacific Northwest English corpus, finding disparities in transcription accuracy linked to phonetic variation among ethnic groups.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate racial bias in commercial ASR systems and how sociophonetic variations contribute to performance disparities.

Method: Evaluated transcription accuracy for four major ASR systems using the Pacific Northwest English corpus and introduced a Phonetic Error Rate metric linked to sociophonetic features.

Result: Phonetic variation, especially related to vowel quality, is a significant factor in differential ASR accuracy, with African American speakers facing the highest error rates.

Conclusion: Bias in ASR systems stems from acoustic modeling of dialectal phonetic variations; targeted representation of sociophonetic diversity in training data can improve ASR performance.

Abstract: This paper presents a systematic evaluation of racial bias in four major
commercial automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems using the Pacific
Northwest English (PNWE) corpus. We analyze transcription accuracy across
speakers from four ethnic backgrounds (African American, Caucasian American,
ChicanX, and Yakama) and examine how sociophonetic variation contributes to
differential system performance. We introduce a heuristically-determined
Phonetic Error Rate (PER) metric that links recognition errors to specific
linguistically motivated variables derived from sociophonetic annotation. Our
analysis of eleven sociophonetic features reveals that vowel quality variation,
particularly resistance to the low-back merger and pre-nasal merger patterns,
is systematically associated with differential error rates across ethnic
groups, with the most pronounced effects for African American speakers across
all evaluated systems. These findings demonstrate that acoustic modeling of
dialectal phonetic variation, rather than lexical or syntactic factors, remains
a primary source of bias in commercial ASR systems. The study establishes the
PNWE corpus as a valuable resource for bias evaluation in speech technologies
and provides actionable guidance for improving ASR performance through targeted
representation of sociophonetic diversity in training data.

TL;DR: This study evaluates fine-tuning, parameter-efficient adaptation, and zero-shot prompting for unfair clause detection in legal NLP, providing insights on trade-offs and open baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Identify effective and efficient methods to adapt large language models for legal-specific tasks like unfair clause detection, addressing limitations of full fine-tuning.

Method: The study conducted systematic evaluations using fine-tuning, LoRA, QLoRA (parameter-efficient methods), and zero-shot prompting on several LLMs for legal text tasks.

Result: Full fine-tuning achieved the best precision-recall balance, while LoRA-based models demonstrated competitive recall with significantly lower memory costs.

Conclusion: The study highlights practical trade-offs for developing efficient, domain-adapted LLMs and contributes open baselines for legal NLP research.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed text understanding, yet their
adaptation to specialized legal domains remains constrained by the cost of full
fine-tuning. This study provides a systematic evaluation of fine tuning,
parameter efficient adaptation (LoRA, QLoRA), and zero-shot prompting
strategies for unfair clause detection in Terms of Service (ToS) documents, a
key application in legal NLP. We finetune BERT and DistilBERT, apply 4-bit
Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to models such as TinyLlama, LLaMA 3B/7B, and
SaulLM, and evaluate GPT-4o and O-versions in zero-shot settings. Experiments
on the CLAUDETTE-ToS benchmark and the Multilingual Scraper Corpus show that
full fine-tuning achieves the strongest precision recall balance, while
LoRA-based models provide competitive recall with up to 3x lower memory cost.
These findings highlight practical design trade-offs for efficient and
domain-adapted LLMs, contributing open baselines for fine-tuning research in
legal text processing.

*Ziyuan He,Yuxuan Wang,Jiaqi Li,Kexin Liang,Muhan Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs struggle with real-world long-context tasks despite extended context windows. The benchmark LooGLE v2 evaluates these limitations across multiple domains, showing significant room for improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the gap in evaluating the long-context understanding capabilities of LLMs, especially since their abilities for long-dependency tasks in real-world applications remain underexplored.

Method: The paper introduces the LooGLE v2 benchmark, which uses long, real-world texts (up to 2M tokens) from domains like law and finance. It designs 10 domain-specific tasks with 1,934 diverse QA instances for a detailed assessment pipeline.

Result: Comprehensive evaluations of 10 LLMs (6 locally deployed and 4 API-based) reveal that even the best model scores only 59.2%. Popular models understand far shorter contexts than their claimed capacities, especially with real-world tasks.

Conclusion: There's a substantial gap between LLMs' theoretical context window sizes and their practical performance in long-context tasks. Enhanced methods and models are needed to address these real-world limitations.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are equipped with increasingly extended context
windows recently, yet their long context understanding capabilities over long
dependency tasks remain fundamentally limited and underexplored. This gap is
especially significant in many real-world long-context applications that were
rarely benchmarked. In this paper, we introduce LooGLE v2, a novel benchmark
designed to evaluate LLMs' long context ability in real-world applications and
scenarios. Our benchmark consists of automatically collected real-world long
texts, ranging from 16k to 2M tokens, encompassing domains in law, finance,
game and code. Accordingly, we delicately design 10 types of domain-specific
long-dependency tasks and generate 1,934 QA instances with various diversity
and complexity in a scalable data curation pipeline for further practical
needs. We conduct a comprehensive assessment of 6 locally deployed and 4
API-based LLMs. The evaluation results show that even the best-performing model
achieves only a 59.2% overall score on our benchmark. Despite the extensive
context windows, popular LLMs are only capable of understanding a much shorter
length of context than they claim to be, revealing significant limitations in
their ability to handle real-world tasks with long dependencies and
highlighting substantial room for model improvement in practical long-context
understanding.

### [137] [SABlock: Semantic-Aware KV Cache Eviction with Adaptive Compression Block Size](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22556)
*Jinhan Chen,Jianchun Liu,Hongli Xu,Xianjun Gao,Shilong Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces SABlock, a semantic-aware KV cache eviction framework to improve the scalability of large-context LLM inference by optimizing memory usage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The memory demands of the Key-Value (KV) cache used in long-context LLM inference pose a scalability challenge, and current methods fail to efficiently balance semantic coherence and memory efficiency.

Method: SABlock uses semantic segmentation to align compression with linguistic structures, refines token importance via segment-guided scoring, and employs a budget-driven search to determine optimal block sizes for efficient memory use under constraints.

Result: SABlock improves performance compared to state-of-the-art approaches, retaining near-full retrieval accuracy with a smaller KV cache while reducing memory usage by 46.28% and speeding decoding up to 9.5x on long contexts.

Conclusion: SABlock offers a powerful and scalable approach for KV cache eviction that maintains semantic integrity, significantly improving both efficiency and performance.

Abstract: The growing memory footprint of the Key-Value (KV) cache poses a severe
scalability bottleneck for long-context Large Language Model (LLM) inference.
While KV cache eviction has emerged as an effective solution by discarding less
critical tokens, existing token-, block-, and sentence-level compression
methods struggle to balance semantic coherence and memory efficiency. To this
end, we introduce SABlock, a \underline{s}emantic-aware KV cache eviction
framework with \underline{a}daptive \underline{block} sizes. Specifically,
SABlock first performs semantic segmentation to align compression boundaries
with linguistic structures, then applies segment-guided token scoring to refine
token importance estimation. Finally, for each segment, a budget-driven search
strategy adaptively determines the optimal block size that preserves semantic
integrity while improving compression efficiency under a given cache budget.
Extensive experiments on long-context benchmarks demonstrate that SABlock
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines under the same memory
budgets. For instance, on Needle-in-a-Haystack (NIAH), SABlock achieves 99.9%
retrieval accuracy with only 96 KV entries, nearly matching the performance of
the full-cache baseline that retains up to 8K entries. Under a fixed cache
budget of 1,024, SABlock further reduces peak memory usage by 46.28% and
achieves up to 9.5x faster decoding on a 128K context length.

### [138] [A Closed-Loop Personalized Learning Agent Integrating Neural Cognitive Diagnosis, Bounded-Ability Adaptive Testing, and LLM-Driven Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22559)
*Zhifeng Wang,Xinyue Zheng,Chunyan Zeng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes EduLoop-Agent, an integrated personalized learning model combining Neural Cognitive Diagnosis (NCD), BECAT adaptive testing, and large language models (LLMs) for diagnosis, adaptive recommendations, and actionable feedback in education.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses limitations in existing personalized learning methods, which typically separate modeling, item selection, and feedback, resulting in less effective and often opaque personalization.

Method: EduLoop-Agent integrates NCD for mastery estimation, BECAT for maximizing item relevance, and LLMs for generating actionable feedback, forming a closed-loop system of diagnosis, recommendation, and feedback.

Result: Experiments on the ASSISTments dataset demonstrate strong performance in response prediction, improved adaptive item selection, and targeted feedback aligned with learners' weaknesses.

Conclusion: The proposed EduLoop-Agent design is effective and deployable in intelligent education systems, paving the way for generating individualized learning trajectories.

Abstract: As information technology advances, education is moving from
one-size-fits-all instruction toward personalized learning. However, most
methods handle modeling, item selection, and feedback in isolation rather than
as a closed loop. This leads to coarse or opaque student models,
assumption-bound adaptivity that ignores diagnostic posteriors, and generic,
non-actionable feedback. To address these limitations, this paper presents an
end-to-end personalized learning agent, EduLoop-Agent, which integrates a
Neural Cognitive Diagnosis model (NCD), a Bounded-Ability Estimation
Computerized Adaptive Testing strategy (BECAT), and large language models
(LLMs). The NCD module provides fine-grained estimates of students' mastery at
the knowledge-point level; BECAT dynamically selects subsequent items to
maximize relevance and learning efficiency; and LLMs convert diagnostic signals
into structured, actionable feedback. Together, these components form a
closed-loop framework of ``Diagnosis--Recommendation--Feedback.'' Experiments
on the ASSISTments dataset show that the NCD module achieves strong performance
on response prediction while yielding interpretable mastery assessments. The
adaptive recommendation strategy improves item relevance and personalization,
and the LLM-based feedback offers targeted study guidance aligned with
identified weaknesses. Overall, the results indicate that the proposed design
is effective and practically deployable, providing a feasible pathway to
generating individualized learning trajectories in intelligent education.

TL;DR: The paper discusses the challenges in evaluating AI-driven Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITSs) and proposes practical research directions for establishing standardized evaluation frameworks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The absence of reliable, universally accepted evaluation frameworks for ITSs fueled by large language models limits their traceability and impact.

Method: The authors analyze existing state-of-the-art evaluation practices, highlight challenges using real-world case studies, and propose research directions grounded in learning science principles.

Result: The work identifies the shortcomings of current ITS evaluation practices and presents insights for developing fair, unified, and scalable methodologies.

Conclusion: Establishing standardized, pedagogy-driven evaluation frameworks can enhance the scalability, effectiveness, and fairness of ITSs, improving their impact on education.

Abstract: The interdisciplinary research domain of Artificial Intelligence in Education
(AIED) has a long history of developing Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITSs) by
integrating insights from technological advancements, educational theories, and
cognitive psychology. The remarkable success of generative AI (GenAI) models
has accelerated the development of large language model (LLM)-powered ITSs,
which have potential to imitate human-like, pedagogically rich, and cognitively
demanding tutoring. However, the progress and impact of these systems remain
largely untraceable due to the absence of reliable, universally accepted, and
pedagogy-driven evaluation frameworks and benchmarks. Most existing educational
dialogue-based ITS evaluations rely on subjective protocols and
non-standardized benchmarks, leading to inconsistencies and limited
generalizability. In this work, we take a step back from mainstream ITS
development and provide comprehensive state-of-the-art evaluation practices,
highlighting associated challenges through real-world case studies from careful
and caring AIED research. Finally, building on insights from previous
interdisciplinary AIED research, we propose three practical, feasible, and
theoretically grounded research directions, rooted in learning science
principles and aimed at establishing fair, unified, and scalable evaluation
methodologies for ITSs.

TL;DR: AutoBench is an automated framework that evaluates Large Language Models (LLMs) using reciprocal peer assessment, creating dynamic evaluation tasks with models as question generators, contestants, and judges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of static benchmarks, such as test-set contamination and lack of adaptability, in evaluating evolving language models.

Method: AutoBench dynamically generates evaluation tasks across domains with models alternately acting as generators, contestants, and peer evaluators. It uses iterative weighting to build consensus-based rankings from model judgments.

Result: AutoBench shows strong correlation with benchmarks like MMLU-Pro (78%) and GPQA (63%), outperforming single-judge baselines and demonstrating robust, human-consistent assessments.

Conclusion: The framework offers a scalable and adaptive solution for continuous evaluation of language models, overcoming the challenges of static benchmarks.

Abstract: We present AutoBench, a fully automated and self-sustaining framework for
evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) through reciprocal peer assessment.
This paper provides a rigorous scientific validation of the AutoBench
methodology, originally developed as an open-source project by eZecute S.R.L..
Unlike static benchmarks that suffer from test-set contamination and limited
adaptability, AutoBench dynamically generates novel evaluation tasks while
models alternately serve as question generators, contestants, and judges across
diverse domains. An iterative weighting mechanism amplifies the influence of
consistently reliable evaluators, aggregating peer judgments into
consensus-based rankings that reflect collective model agreement. Our
experiments demonstrate strong correlations with established benchmarks
including MMLU-Pro and GPQA (respectively 78\% and 63\%), validating this
peer-driven evaluation paradigm. The multi-judge design significantly
outperforms single-judge baselines, confirming that distributed evaluation
produces more robust and human-consistent assessments. AutoBench offers a
scalable, contamination-resistant alternative to static benchmarks for the
continuous evaluation of evolving language models.

Motivation: To innovate beyond traditional episodic healthcare by providing continuous, personalized, and proactive health guidance.

Method: Leveraging multimodal agents, event-centric modeling, contextual inference, and integrating individual sensing with population analytics.

Result: PCU promises improved individual health outcomes and serves as a foundation for advancing public health and scientific research.

Conclusion: PCU represents a transformative approach to health management, offering real-time, adaptive assistance and enhancing both personal and public health landscapes.

Abstract: Building on decades of success in digital infrastructure and biomedical
innovation, we propose the Personal Care Utility (PCU) - a cybernetic system
for lifelong health guidance. PCU is conceived as a global, AI-powered utility
that continuously orchestrates multimodal data, knowledge, and services to
assist individuals and populations alike. Drawing on multimodal agents,
event-centric modeling, and contextual inference, it offers three essential
capabilities: (1) trusted health information tailored to the individual, (2)
proactive health navigation and behavior guidance, and (3) ongoing
interpretation of recovery and treatment response after medical events. Unlike
conventional episodic care, PCU functions as an ambient, adaptive companion -
observing, interpreting, and guiding health in real time across daily life. By
integrating personal sensing, experiential computing, and population-level
analytics, PCU promises not only improved outcomes for individuals but also a
new substrate for public health and scientific discovery. We describe the
architecture, design principles, and implementation challenges of this emerging
paradigm.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: This paper aimed to address the lack of resources for Persian commonsense reasoning.

Method: The team introduced a conjunction-based segmentation strategy for dataset creation and DRESS-AF for distractor selection.

Result: Human performance reaches 89%, while top AI models achieve up to 92.18% accuracy, demonstrating model capabilities and dataset complexity.

Conclusion: PerCoR establishes a challenging benchmark for Persian commonsense reasoning, with wide applicability and transferability to other benchmarks like English HellaSwag.

Abstract: We introduced PerCoR (Persian Commonsense Reasoning), the first large-scale
Persian benchmark for commonsense reasoning. PerCoR contains 106K
multiple-choice sentence-completion problems drawn from more than forty news,
cultural, and other web sources. We introduce a novel conjunction-based
segmentation strategy to generate coherent sentence-completion pairs, enabling
broad topical and structural diversity. To create challenging distractors, we
propose DRESS-AF (Distractor Ranking via Embedding Similarity Scoring and
Adversarial Filtering), a generation-free adversarial filtering method that
selects distractors from the pool of gold continuations while maximising model
confusion. Human annotators score 89% on PerCoR, while OpenAI-o3 achieves the
highest performance at 92.18%, followed closely by Claude-Sonnet-3.7 (91.17%).
The strongest open-source model, DeepSeek-R1, reaches 82.51%, underscoring both
the dataset's difficulty and the remaining performance gap in Persian
commonsense reasoning. We further show that DRESS-AF transfers to the English
HellaSwag benchmark, increasing its difficulty without hurting human
solvability. The dataset is available at

developed to enhance script usage. The study offers a sustainable model for
preserving endangered languages by incorporating traditional linguistic
methodology with AI. This bridge between linguistic research with technological
innovation highlights the value of interdisciplinary collaboration for
community-based language revitalization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for FKGC struggle with long-tail distribution challenges, difficulty capturing complex relational patterns, and mitigating data sparsity.

Method: The proposed framework (CR-FKGC) includes a neighborhood aggregation encoder, a conjugate relation learner (combining an implicit diffusion relation module and stable relation module), and a manifold conjugate decoder for efficient inference.

Result: The framework demonstrates superior performance on three benchmark datasets, surpassing state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: CR-FKGC effectively addresses relational complexity and data sparsity in FKGC, providing improved performance and understanding for inferring missing triples.

Abstract: Few-shot Knowledge Graph Completion (FKGC) infers missing triples from
limited support samples, tackling long-tail distribution challenges. Existing
methods, however, struggle to capture complex relational patterns and mitigate
data sparsity. To address these challenges, we propose a novel FKGC framework
for conjugate relation modeling (CR-FKGC). Specifically, it employs a
neighborhood aggregation encoder to integrate higher-order neighbor
information, a conjugate relation learner combining an implicit conditional
diffusion relation module with a stable relation module to capture stable
semantics and uncertainty offsets, and a manifold conjugate decoder for
efficient evaluation and inference of missing triples in manifold space.
Experiments on three benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves superior
performance over state-of-the-art methods.

Result: Qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed rule-based explanation system.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively explains output provenance in RAG-based LLMs using optimized, rule-based explanations.

Abstract: If-then rules are widely used to explain machine learning models; e.g., "if
employed = no, then loan application = rejected." We present the first proposal
to apply rules to explain the emerging class of large language models (LLMs)
with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). Since RAG enables LLM systems to
incorporate retrieved information sources at inference time, rules linking the
presence or absence of sources can explain output provenance; e.g., "if a Times
Higher Education ranking article is retrieved, then the LLM ranks Oxford
first." To generate such rules, a brute force approach would probe the LLM with
all source combinations and check if the presence or absence of any sources
leads to the same output. We propose optimizations to speed up rule generation,
inspired by Apriori-like pruning from frequent itemset mining but redefined
within the scope of our novel problem. We conclude with qualitative and
quantitative experiments demonstrating our solutions' value and efficiency.

*Ruslan Berdichevsky,Shai Nahum-Gefen,Elad Ben Zaken*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces SALSA, a method that optimizes text classification for instruction-tuned LLMs using structured prompting, token mapping, and efficient fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Instruction-tuned LLMs underperform on text classification tasks, prompting the need for an improved approach.

Method: SALSA uses structured prompting combined with class-to-token mapping and parameter-efficient fine-tuning for classification. During inference, it projects outputs onto specific class tokens for efficiency.

Result: SALSA achieves superior performance across various text classification benchmarks, setting state-of-the-art results.

Conclusion: SALSA proves to be a robust and scalable solution for text classification using LLMs, addressing performance limitations with innovative techniques.

Abstract: Despite their impressive generalization capabilities, instruction-tuned Large
Language Models often underperform on text classification benchmarks. We
introduce SALSA, a coherent pipeline that combines structured prompting,
class-to-token mapping, and parameter-efficient fine-tuning, thereby avoiding
cold-start training. Each class label is mapped to a distinct output token, and
prompts are constructed to elicit a single-token response. During inference,
the model's output is projected only onto the logits of the relevant class
tokens, enabling efficient and accurate classification in a single forward
pass. SALSA achieves state-of-the-art results across diverse benchmarks,
demonstrating its robustness and scalability for LLM-based classification
applications.

### [148] [$\text{E}^2\text{Rank}$: Your Text Embedding can Also be an Effective and Efficient Listwise Reranker](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22733)
*Qi Liu,Yanzhao Zhang,Mingxin Li,Dingkun Long,Pengjun Xie,Jiaxin Mao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces E²Rank, a framework that enhances text embedding models to perform both retrieval and reranking efficiently using a listwise ranking approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text embedding models show high efficiency but lack robust ranking fidelity when compared to advanced rerankers like LLM-based models.

Method: E²Rank uses a listwise ranking training approach to extend text embedding models for efficient retrieval and enhanced reranking via cosine similarity as the ranking function.

Result: E²Rank achieves state-of-the-art performance on the BEIR reranking benchmark, competitive results on BRIGHT benchmark, and improves embeddings on MTEB with low latency.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates that a single embedding model can unify retrieval and reranking capabilities while maintaining efficiency and competitive accuracy.

Abstract: Text embedding models serve as a fundamental component in real-world search
applications. By mapping queries and documents into a shared embedding space,
they deliver competitive retrieval performance with high efficiency. However,
their ranking fidelity remains limited compared to dedicated rerankers,
especially recent LLM-based listwise rerankers, which capture fine-grained
query-document and document-document interactions. In this paper, we propose a
simple yet effective unified framework $\text{E}^2\text{Rank}$, means Efficient
Embedding-based Ranking (also means Embedding-to-Rank), which extends a single
text embedding model to perform both high-quality retrieval and listwise
reranking through continued training under a listwise ranking objective,
thereby achieving strong effectiveness with remarkable efficiency. By applying
cosine similarity between the query and document embeddings as a unified
ranking function, the listwise ranking prompt, which is constructed from the
original query and its candidate documents, serves as an enhanced query
enriched with signals from the top-K documents, akin to pseudo-relevance
feedback (PRF) in traditional retrieval models. This design preserves the
efficiency and representational quality of the base embedding model while
significantly improving its reranking performance. Empirically,
$\textrm{E}^2\text{Rank}$ achieves state-of-the-art results on the BEIR
reranking benchmark and demonstrates competitive performance on the
reasoning-intensive BRIGHT benchmark, with very low reranking latency. We also
show that the ranking training process improves embedding performance on the
MTEB benchmark. Our findings indicate that a single embedding model can
effectively unify retrieval and reranking, offering both computational
efficiency and competitive ranking accuracy.

*Eeham Khan,Firas Saidani,Owen Van Esbroeck,Richard Khoury,Leila Kosseim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper discusses using continual pre-training (CPT) methods to adapt large language models (LLMs) to low-resource dialects like Québec French with minimal computational and data requirements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the lack of robust LLM capabilities in low-resource languages and regional dialects using cost-efficient methods, ensuring linguistic inclusivity and accessibility to minority communities.

Method: The approach involves using low-rank adaptation (LoRA) and compute-efficient CPT to fine-tune LLMs on Québec French with a small dataset, updating under 1% of the model parameters.

Result: The experiments showed improvement in benchmarks for the minority dialect with minimal regression on benchmarks for the prestige language, highlighting corpus composition as a key factor.

Conclusion: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning with CPT can bridge the linguistic gap for dialects, creating sustainable resources for minority communities and expanding equitable access to quality LLMs.

Abstract: Despite the widespread adoption of large language models (LLMs), their
strongest capabilities remain largely confined to a small number of
high-resource languages for which there is abundant training data. Recently,
continual pre-training (CPT) has emerged as a means to fine-tune these models
to low-resource regional dialects. In this paper, we study the use of CPT for
dialect learning under tight data and compute budgets. Using low-rank
adaptation (LoRA) and compute-efficient continual pre-training, we adapt three
LLMs to the Qu\'ebec French dialect using a very small dataset and benchmark
them on the COLE suite. Our experiments demonstrate an improvement on the
minority dialect benchmarks with minimal regression on the prestige language
benchmarks with under 1% of model parameters updated. Analysis of the results
demonstrate that gains are highly contingent on corpus composition. These
findings indicate that CPT with parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) can
narrow the dialect gap by providing cost-effective and sustainable language
resource creation, expanding high-quality LLM access to minority linguistic
communities. We release the first Qu\'ebec French LLMs on HuggingFace.

### [150] [Beyond Semantics: How Temporal Biases Shape Retrieval in Transformer and State-Space Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22752)
*Anooshka Bajaj,Deven Mahesh Mistry,Sahaj Singh Maini,Yash Aggarwal,Zoran Tiganj*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores how LLMs, including transformer and state-space models, retrieve temporally separated events, showing biases toward tokens at the beginning and end of input.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to investigate the temporal biases and episodic memory-like retrieval patterns of large language models in in-context learning.

Method: Tokens are repeated at fixed positions in sequences, with non-repeated tokens permuted to isolate temporal effects, and ablation was performed to link results to transformer induction heads.

Result: Models predict repeated tokens effectively, favoring those near the start or end of sequences, with biases detected across transformer and state-space architectures.

Conclusion: Temporal biases influence in-context learning and demonstrate episodic-like memory retrieval in LLMs, irrespective of model architecture.

Abstract: In-context learning is governed by both temporal and semantic relationships,
shaping how Large Language Models (LLMs) retrieve contextual information.
Analogous to human episodic memory, where the retrieval of specific events is
enabled by separating events that happened at different times, this work probes
the ability of various pretrained LLMs, including transformer and state-space
models, to differentiate and retrieve temporally separated events.
Specifically, we prompted models with sequences containing multiple
presentations of the same token, which reappears at the sequence end. By fixing
the positions of these repeated tokens and permuting all others, we removed
semantic confounds and isolated temporal effects on next-token prediction.
Across diverse sequences, models consistently placed the highest probabilities
on tokens following a repeated token, but with a notable bias for those nearest
the beginning or end of the input. An ablation experiment linked this
phenomenon in transformers to induction heads. Extending the analysis to unique
semantic contexts with partial overlap further demonstrated that memories
embedded in the middle of a prompt are retrieved less reliably. Despite
architectural differences, state-space and transformer models showed comparable
temporal biases. Our findings deepen the understanding of temporal biases in
in-context learning and offer an illustration of how these biases can enable
temporal separation and episodic retrieval.

*Li Zhou,Lutong Yu,You Lyu,Yihang Lin,Zefeng Zhao,Junyi Ao,Yuhao Zhang,Benyou Wang,Haizhou Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces EchoMind, a novel benchmark to evaluate Speech Language Models (SLMs) on empathetic dialogue skills integrating spoken content and vocal cues. Current SLMs underperform in handling high-expressive vocal cues, revealing gaps in empathetic response capability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks fail to evaluate SLMs on their ability to integrate linguistic, acoustic, and reasoning skills necessary for empathetic dialogues.

Method: The study presents EchoMind, a benchmark designed with sequential tasks mimicking empathetic cognitive processes by focusing on spoken-content understanding, vocal-cue perception, reasoning, and response generation. It incorporates controlled vocal variations and an empathy framework of 3 coarse and 12 fine-grained dimensions.

Result: State-of-the-art SLMs struggle with recognizing and responding to high-expressiveness vocal cues, revealing weaknesses in instruction-following, handling speech variability, and leveraging vocal cues effectively for empathy.

Conclusion: There is a critical gap in SLMs' ability to integrate language content and vocal cues for truly empathetic conversations, underscoring the need for improved models that address these challenges.

Abstract: Speech Language Models (SLMs) have made significant progress in spoken
language understanding. Yet it remains unclear whether they can fully perceive
non lexical vocal cues alongside spoken words, and respond with empathy that
aligns with both emotional and contextual factors. Existing benchmarks
typically evaluate linguistic, acoustic, reasoning, or dialogue abilities in
isolation, overlooking the integration of these skills that is crucial for
human-like, emotionally intelligent conversation. We present EchoMind, the
first interrelated, multi-level benchmark that simulates the cognitive process
of empathetic dialogue through sequential, context-linked tasks: spoken-content
understanding, vocal-cue perception, integrated reasoning, and response
generation. All tasks share identical and semantically neutral scripts that are
free of explicit emotional or contextual cues, and controlled variations in
vocal style are used to test the effect of delivery independent of the
transcript. EchoMind is grounded in an empathy-oriented framework spanning 3
coarse and 12 fine-grained dimensions, encompassing 39 vocal attributes, and
evaluated using both objective and subjective metrics. Testing 12 advanced SLMs
reveals that even state-of-the-art models struggle with high-expressive vocal
cues, limiting empathetic response quality. Analyses of prompt strength, speech
source, and ideal vocal cue recognition reveal persistent weaknesses in
instruction-following, resilience to natural speech variability, and effective
use of vocal cues for empathy. These results underscore the need for SLMs that
integrate linguistic content with diverse vocal cues to achieve truly
empathetic conversational ability.

*Haoyi Qiu,Yilun Zhou,Pranav Narayanan Venkit,Kung-Hsiang Huang,Jiaxin Zhang,Nanyun Peng,Chien-Sheng Wu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces MMPersuade, a framework to analyze how Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) are influenced by persuasive multimodal content in various contexts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the susceptibility of LVLMs to persuasive content and evaluate the methods of persuasion to ensure output remains reliable, ethically sound, and user-preference aligned.

Method: Developed MMPersuade, which includes a multimodal dataset paired with persuasion principles and an evaluation framework measuring persuasion effectiveness and susceptibility in LVLMs.

Result: Researchers found that multimodal inputs heightened persuasion effectiveness compared to text alone, preferences reduced but didn't eliminate susceptibility, and the effectiveness of persuasion strategies varied by context.

Conclusion: MMPersuade establishes a groundwork for creating LVLMs that are more resistant to unethical persuasion and able to produce outputs that align with user preferences and ethical standards.

Abstract: As Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) are increasingly deployed in domains
such as shopping, health, and news, they are exposed to pervasive persuasive
content. A critical question is how these models function as persuadees-how and
why they can be influenced by persuasive multimodal inputs. Understanding both
their susceptibility to persuasion and the effectiveness of different
persuasive strategies is crucial, as overly persuadable models may adopt
misleading beliefs, override user preferences, or generate unethical or unsafe
outputs when exposed to manipulative messages. We introduce MMPersuade, a
unified framework for systematically studying multimodal persuasion dynamics in
LVLMs. MMPersuade contributes (i) a comprehensive multimodal dataset that pairs
images and videos with established persuasion principles across commercial,
subjective and behavioral, and adversarial contexts, and (ii) an evaluation
framework that quantifies both persuasion effectiveness and model
susceptibility via third-party agreement scoring and self-estimated token
probabilities on conversation histories. Our study of six leading LVLMs as
persuadees yields three key insights: (i) multimodal inputs substantially
increase persuasion effectiveness-and model susceptibility-compared to text
alone, especially in misinformation scenarios; (ii) stated prior preferences
decrease susceptibility, yet multimodal information maintains its persuasive
advantage; and (iii) different strategies vary in effectiveness across
contexts, with reciprocity being most potent in commercial and subjective
contexts, and credibility and logic prevailing in adversarial contexts. By
jointly analyzing persuasion effectiveness and susceptibility, MMPersuade
provides a principled foundation for developing models that are robust,
preference-consistent, and ethically aligned when engaging with persuasive
multimodal content.

*Poli Nemkova,Amrit Adhikari,Matthew Pearson,Vamsi Krishna Sadu,Mark V. Albert*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper systematically compares commercial and open-weight large language models (LLMs) for detecting human-rights violations across seven languages, evaluating the cost-reliability trade-offs for resource-constrained organizations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Humanitarian organizations require reliable multilingual monitoring tools but face challenges in balancing costs (commercial APIs) versus potentially less reliable, unvalidated open-weight models, especially for low-resource languages.

Method: The study evaluates six models—four instruction-aligned and two open-weight—across 78,000 multilingual inferences using standard classification metrics and novel cross-lingual reliability measures: Calibration Deviation, Decision Bias, Language Robustness Score, and Language Stability Score.

Result: Aligned models show consistent accuracy and calibration across typologically distant and low-resource languages, while open-weight models experience limitations like prompt-language sensitivity and calibration drift.

Conclusion: Multilingual alignment enables language-agnostic reasoning, providing valuable guidance for organizations balancing budget constraints with the need for reliable multilingual human-rights monitoring systems.

Abstract: Humanitarian organizations face a critical choice: invest in costly
commercial APIs or rely on free open-weight models for multilingual human
rights monitoring. While commercial systems offer reliability, open-weight
alternatives lack empirical validation -- especially for low-resource languages
common in conflict zones. This paper presents the first systematic comparison
of commercial and open-weight large language models (LLMs) for
human-rights-violation detection across seven languages, quantifying the
cost-reliability trade-off facing resource-constrained organizations. Across
78,000 multilingual inferences, we evaluate six models -- four
instruction-aligned (Claude-Sonnet-4, DeepSeek-V3, Gemini-Flash-2.0,
GPT-4.1-mini) and two open-weight (LLaMA-3-8B, Mistral-7B) -- using both
standard classification metrics and new measures of cross-lingual reliability:
Calibration Deviation (CD), Decision Bias (B), Language Robustness Score (LRS),
and Language Stability Score (LSS). Results show that alignment, not scale,
determines stability: aligned models maintain near-invariant accuracy and
balanced calibration across typologically distant and low-resource languages
(e.g., Lingala, Burmese), while open-weight models exhibit significant
prompt-language sensitivity and calibration drift. These findings demonstrate
that multilingual alignment enables language-agnostic reasoning and provide
practical guidance for humanitarian organizations balancing budget constraints
with reliability in multilingual deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Encoder-based models like BERT face limitations with long essays due to a token cap of 512.

Method: Uses summarization and prompting strategies with generative language models.

Conclusion: Generative models are a promising alternative for accurate automated scoring of lengthy essays.

Abstract: BERT and its variants are extensively explored for automated scoring.
However, a limit of 512 tokens for these encoder-based models showed the
deficiency in automated scoring of long essays. Thus, this research explores

*Prerna Ravi,Dong Won Lee,Beatriz Flamia,Jasmine David,Brandon Hanks,Cynthia Breazeal,Emma Anderson,Grace Lin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores how explicit conversational threading can enhance LLM-based analysis of group discussions, providing improvements in collaborative action decoding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding conversational threading in group interactions is critical for improving collaborative learning analysis, particularly in synchronous dialogue where existing methods face challenges.

Method: A systematic approach for detecting threads in multi-party transcripts was introduced and benchmarked, followed by LLM-based relational coding strategies and their integration with thread information.

Result: Integrating threading information demonstrated improved LLM performance in downstream collaborative action coding, emphasizing its importance in structured dialogue analysis.

Conclusion: Thread information enhances LLM discourse analysis, and hybrid human-AI approaches can balance practical considerations for analyzing real-time group interactions effectively.

Abstract: Understanding how ideas develop and flow in small-group conversations is
critical for analyzing collaborative learning. A key structural feature of
these interactions is threading, the way discourse talk naturally organizes
into interwoven topical strands that evolve over time. While threading has been
widely studied in asynchronous text settings, detecting threads in synchronous
spoken dialogue remains challenging due to overlapping turns and implicit cues.
At the same time, large language models (LLMs) show promise for automating
discourse analysis but often struggle with long-context tasks that depend on
tracing these conversational links. In this paper, we investigate whether
explicit thread linkages can improve LLM-based coding of relational moves in
group talk. We contribute a systematic guidebook for identifying threads in
synchronous multi-party transcripts and benchmark different LLM prompting
strategies for automated threading. We then test how threading influences
performance on downstream coding of conversational analysis frameworks, that
capture core collaborative actions such as agreeing, building, and eliciting.
Our results show that providing clear conversational thread information
improves LLM coding performance and underscores the heavy reliance of
downstream analysis on well-structured dialogue. We also discuss practical
trade-offs in time and cost, emphasizing where human-AI hybrid approaches can
yield the best value. Together, this work advances methods for combining LLMs
and robust conversational thread structures to make sense of complex, real-time
group interactions.

TL;DR: Large Language Models struggle with multi-step reasoning, and the PIPS method helps by refining programs with structural feedback and dynamic confidence metrics, improving performance across various tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve the reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), especially their performance in complex, multi-step tasks by minimizing undesirable solutions and enhancing accuracy.

Method: Proposes Per-Instance Program Synthesis (PIPS), which generates and refines instance-level programs using structural feedback and employs a dynamic confidence metric to optimize between direct inference and synthesis.

Result: PIPS achieved significantly better results than existing methods like Chain of Thought (CoT) and Program of Thought (PoT), improving harmonic mean accuracy by up to 8.6%-9.4% and reducing program-generation errors by 65.1% in certain algorithmic tasks.

Conclusion: PIPS provides a robust framework for enhancing LLMs' reasoning capabilities, demonstrating notable performance improvements and reduced errors in multi-step reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at zero-shot inference but continue to
struggle with complex, multi-step reasoning. Recent methods that augment LLMs
with intermediate reasoning steps such as Chain of Thought (CoT) and Program of
Thought (PoT) improve performance but often produce undesirable solutions,
especially in algorithmic domains. We introduce Per-Instance Program Synthesis
(PIPS), a method that generates and refines programs at the instance-level
using structural feedback without relying on task-specific guidance or explicit
test cases. To further improve performance, PIPS incorporates a confidence
metric that dynamically chooses between direct inference and program synthesis
on a per-instance basis. Experiments across three frontier LLMs and 30
benchmarks including all tasks of Big Bench Extra Hard (BBEH), visual question
answering tasks, relational reasoning tasks, and mathematical reasoning tasks
show that PIPS improves the absolute harmonic mean accuracy by up to 8.6% and
9.4% compared to PoT and CoT respectively, and reduces undesirable program
generations by 65.1% on the algorithmic tasks compared to PoT with
Gemini-2.0-Flash.

*Tiasa Singha Roy,Ayush Rajesh Jhaveri,Ilias Triantafyllopoulos*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates unwanted uncertainty in Large Language Models (LLMs), focusing on answer-flipping behaviors, and proposes mitigating solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite the advanced capabilities of LLMs, they often exhibit uncertainty by changing correct answers to incorrect ones upon re-prompting. This undermines their reliability, especially in critical applications.

Method: The study adapts the Needle-in-a-Haystack retrieval framework and integrates a Flip-style re-evaluation prompt to mimic realistic uncertainties. It also identifies specific attention heads responsible for these failures and tests the impact of masking them.

Result: The authors discovered that a small set of non-retrieval attention heads significantly contributes to uncertainty. Masking these attention heads reduces unwanted answer-flipping behavior by up to 15% without negatively impacting coherence or causing overcorrection.

Conclusion: The proposed solution helps mitigate uncertainty-driven failures in LLMs, with some trade-offs in downstream tasks. It advances understanding in mechanistic interpretability and offers a practical approach to improve LLM robustness.

Abstract: Despite their impressive capabilities, Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit
unwanted uncertainty, a phenomenon where a model changes a previously correct
answer into an incorrect one when re-prompted. This behavior undermines trust
and poses serious risks in high-stakes domains. In this work, we investigate
the mechanisms that drive this phenomenon. We adapt the Needle-in-a-Haystack
retrieval framework and integrate a Flip-style re-evaluation prompt to simulate
realistic answer-flipping scenarios. We find that retrieval heads are not
primarily responsible for avoiding uncertainty. Instead, we identify a small
set of non-retrieval attention heads that disproportionately attend to
misleading tokens in uncertain contexts. Masking these heads yields significant
improvements, reducing flip behavior by up to 15% without introducing
incoherence or overcorrection. However, when tested for downstream tasks, we
observe trade-offs with flip behavior. Our findings contribute to the growing
field of mechanistic interpretability and present a simple yet effective
technique for mitigating uncertainty-driven failure modes in LLMs.

Conclusion: The dataset will serve as a resource to improve methods for detecting and attributing AI-generated content, thereby fostering transparency, reliability, and trust in generative AI.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has led to increasingly
human-like AI-generated text, raising concerns about content authenticity,
misinformation, and trustworthiness. Addressing the challenge of reliably
detecting AI-generated text and attributing it to specific models requires
large-scale, diverse, and well-annotated datasets. In this work, we present a

authentic New York Times articles with synthetic versions generated by multiple
state-of-the-art LLMs including Gemma-2-9b, Mistral-7B, Qwen-2-72B, LLaMA-8B,
Yi-Large, and GPT-4-o. The dataset provides original article abstracts as

key tasks: distinguishing human-written from AI-generated text, achieving an
accuracy of 58.35\%, and attributing AI texts to their generating models with
an accuracy of 8.92\%. By bridging real-world journalistic content with modern

### [160] [Batch Speculative Decoding Done Right](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22876)
*Ranran Haoran Zhang,Soumik Dey,Ashirbad Mishra,Hansi Wu,Binbin Li,Rui Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method for enhancing LLM batch speculative decoding, addressing the ragged tensor problem to maintain output equivalence and improve throughput.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the efficiency of batch speculative decoding for LLMs while preserving the correctness of token sequences.

Method: The authors proposed EQSPEC and EXSPEC methods that solve the ragged tensor problem by ensuring proper synchronization and realignment in batching, dynamically forming same-length groups to reduce overhead.

Result: The method achieves up to 3× throughput improvement at batch size 8 compared to batch size 1 on multiple benchmarks, maintaining 95% output equivalence.

Conclusion: EXSPEC offers significant efficiency improvements for batch speculative decoding, integrates seamlessly with inference systems, and ensures result correctness without requiring custom kernels.

Abstract: Speculative decoding speeds up LLM inference by using a small draft model to
propose multiple tokens that a target model verifies in parallel. Extending
this idea to batches is essential for production serving, but it introduces the
ragged tensor problem: sequences in the same batch accept different numbers of
draft tokens, breaking right-alignment and corrupting position IDs, attention
masks, and KV-cache state. We show that several existing batch implementations
violate output equivalence-the fundamental requirement that speculative
decoding must produce identical token sequences to standard autoregressive
generation. These violations occur precisely due to improper handling of the
ragged tensor problem. In response, we (1) characterize the synchronization
requirements that guarantee correctness, (2) present a correctness-first batch
speculative decoding EQSPEC that exposes realignment as consuming 40% of
overhead, and (3) introduce EXSPEC, which maintains a sliding pool of sequences
and dynamically forms same-length groups, to reduce the realignment overhead
while preserving per-sequence speculative speedups. On the SpecBench dataset,
across Vicuna-7B/68M, Qwen3-8B/0.6B, and GLM-4-9B/0.6B target/draft pairs, our
approach achieves up to 3$\times$ throughput improvement at batch size 8
compared to batch size 1, with efficient scaling through batch size 8, while
maintaining 95% output equivalence. Our method requires no custom kernels and
integrates cleanly with existing inference stacks. Our code is available at

*Liwei Jiang,Yuanjun Chai,Margaret Li,Mickel Liu,Raymond Fok,Nouha Dziri,Yulia Tsvetkov,Maarten Sap,Alon Albalak,Yejin Choi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces Infinity-Chat, a large-scale dataset for evaluating the diversity of language model outputs, highlighting mode collapse in generation and issues with LM's alignment to human preferences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Language models struggle to generate diverse, human-like creative outputs, risking homogenization of thought and raising concerns about long-term AI impact.

Method: The authors created Infinity-Chat—comprising 26K diverse open-ended queries—with annotations for studying human preferences and a taxonomy of prompt categories to systematically analyze LM behavior.

Result: The study reveals significant mode collapse in LMs, where outputs tend to be repetitive within models and homogeneous across models. Human ratings and LM alignment to diverse individual preferences also showed limitations.

Conclusion: Infinity-Chat provides critical insights into LM behavior and diversity, serving as a resource for addressing AI safety risks and improving LM output diversity and alignment to human nuances.

Abstract: Language models (LMs) often struggle to generate diverse, human-like creative
content, raising concerns about the long-term homogenization of human thought
through repeated exposure to similar outputs. Yet scalable methods for
evaluating LM output diversity remain limited, especially beyond narrow tasks
such as random number or name generation, or beyond repeated sampling from a
single model. We introduce Infinity-Chat, a large-scale dataset of 26K diverse,
real-world, open-ended user queries that admit a wide range of plausible
answers with no single ground truth. We introduce the first comprehensive
taxonomy for characterizing the full spectrum of open-ended prompts posed to
LMs, comprising 6 top-level categories (e.g., brainstorm & ideation) that
further breaks down to 17 subcategories. Using Infinity-Chat, we present a
large-scale study of mode collapse in LMs, revealing a pronounced Artificial
Hivemind effect in open-ended generation of LMs, characterized by (1)
intra-model repetition, where a single model consistently generates similar
responses, and more so (2) inter-model homogeneity, where different models
produce strikingly similar outputs. Infinity-Chat also includes 31,250 human
annotations, across absolute ratings and pairwise preferences, with 25
independent human annotations per example. This enables studying collective and
individual-specific human preferences in response to open-ended queries. Our
findings show that LMs, reward models, and LM judges are less well calibrated
to human ratings on model generations that elicit differing idiosyncratic
annotator preferences, despite maintaining comparable overall quality. Overall,
INFINITY-CHAT presents the first large-scale resource for systematically
studying real-world open-ended queries to LMs, revealing critical insights to
guide future research for mitigating long-term AI safety risks posed by the
Artificial Hivemind.

*Anwesan Pal,Karen Hovsepian,Tinghao Guo,Mengnan Zhao,Somendra Tripathi,Nikos Kanakaris,George Mihaila,Sumit Nigam*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces Tagging-Augmented Generation (TAG), a method to improve LLMs' performance in handling long-context scenarios and complex reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern LLMs struggle with handling long and complex contexts efficiently in question-answering (QA) and reasoning tasks, despite their advancements.

Method: The authors propose TAG, a lightweight data augmentation approach that enhances performance in long-context scenarios by augmenting QA benchmarks with context tagging or tag definitions.

Result: TAG improved performance on challenging QA benchmarks (NoLima and NovelQA), showing gains of up to 17% in processing 32K token contexts and 2.9% in multi-hop reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: TAG demonstrates that augmenting context with tagging can significantly boost LLM performance in long-context and complex QA applications, without compromising the content integrity of retrieved documents.

Abstract: Recent investigations into effective context lengths of modern flagship large
language models (LLMs) have revealed major limitations in effective question
answering (QA) and reasoning over long and complex contexts for even the
largest and most impressive cadre of models. While approaches like
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and chunk-based re-ranking attempt to
mitigate this issue, they are sensitive to chunking, embedding and retrieval
strategies and models, and furthermore, rely on extensive pre-processing,
knowledge acquisition and indexing steps. In this paper, we propose
Tagging-Augmented Generation (TAG), a lightweight data augmentation strategy
that boosts LLM performance in long-context scenarios, without degrading and
altering the integrity and composition of retrieved documents. We validate our
hypothesis by augmenting two challenging and directly relevant
question-answering benchmarks -- NoLima and NovelQA -- and show that tagging
the context or even just adding tag definitions into QA prompts leads to
consistent performance gains over the baseline -- up to 17% for 32K token
contexts, and 2.9% in complex reasoning question-answering for multi-hop
queries requiring knowledge across a wide span of text. Additional details are

*Yucheng Ning,Xixun Lin,Fang Fang,Yanan Cao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses factual accuracy in Large Language Models (LLMs) outputs, proposing a new evaluation framework that includes a Chinese dataset and a debate-based verification system called MAD-Fact.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of evaluating and improving the factual accuracy of long-form content generated by LLMs, especially in high-stakes domains like biomedicine, law, and education.

Method: The authors propose a systematic approach that integrates long-form datasets, multi-agent debate-based verification methods (MAD-Fact), and weighted evaluation metrics. They also construct a specialized Chinese dataset for factuality called LongHalluQA.

Result: Experiments reveal that larger LLMs are generally more factually consistent in long-form output, whereas domestic Chinese models perform better on Chinese content. The framework effectively evaluates and highlights variations in fictitious claims by introducing a fact importance hierarchy.

Conclusion: The proposed framework enhances the ability to assess and improve the factual reliability of long-form LLM outputs, offering a structured solution to support their safe use in sensitive fields like biomedicine and law.

Abstract: The widespread adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) raises critical
concerns about the factual accuracy of their outputs, especially in high-risk
domains such as biomedicine, law, and education. Existing evaluation methods
for short texts often fail on long-form content due to complex reasoning
chains, intertwined perspectives, and cumulative information. To address this,
we propose a systematic approach integrating large-scale long-form datasets,
multi-agent verification mechanisms, and weighted evaluation metrics. We
construct LongHalluQA, a Chinese long-form factuality dataset; and develop
MAD-Fact, a debate-based multi-agent verification system. We introduce a fact
importance hierarchy to capture the varying significance of claims in long-form
texts. Experiments on two benchmarks show that larger LLMs generally maintain
higher factual consistency, while domestic models excel on Chinese content. Our
work provides a structured framework for evaluating and enhancing factual
reliability in long-form LLM outputs, guiding their safe deployment in
sensitive domains.

### [164] [Measuring Teaching with LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22968)
*Michael Hardy*

TL;DR: The paper develops specialized LLMs using sentence-level embeddings to accurately measure teaching quality in classroom observations, achieving performance surpassing human raters and offering insights into teacher-student interaction metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of scalable and reliable measurement of teaching quality using AI, as general-purpose LLMs struggle with applying complex classroom observation tools effectively.

Method: Custom LLMs built on sentence-level embeddings were employed, systematically evaluating five sentence embeddings under a data-efficient training regime to avoid overfitting.

Result: The specialized models demonstrate human-level and super-human performance in quality measurement, with ratings surpassing human evaluator correlations and capturing lesson-level features over isolated utterances.

Conclusion: This new methodology for AI-driven instructional measurement is viable, providing scalable and valid feedback for educator development, but models still lack full generalization at the individual item level.

Abstract: Objective and scalable measurement of teaching quality is a persistent
challenge in education. While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer potential,
general-purpose models have struggled to reliably apply complex, authentic
classroom observation instruments. This paper uses custom LLMs built on
sentence-level embeddings, an architecture better suited for the long-form,
interpretive nature of classroom transcripts than conventional subword
tokenization. We systematically evaluate five different sentence embeddings
under a data-efficient training regime designed to prevent overfitting. Our
results demonstrate that these specialized models can achieve human-level and
even super-human performance with expert human ratings above 0.65 and
surpassing the average human-human rater correlation. Further, through analysis
of annotation context windows, we find that more advanced models-those better
aligned with human judgments-attribute a larger share of score variation to
lesson-level features rather than isolated utterances, challenging the
sufficiency of single-turn annotation paradigms. Finally, to assess external
validity, we find that aggregate model scores align with teacher value-added
measures, indicating they are capturing features relevant to student learning.
However, this trend does not hold at the individual item level, suggesting that
while the models learn useful signals, they have not yet achieved full
generalization. This work establishes a viable and powerful new methodology for
AI-driven instructional measurement, offering a path toward providing scalable,
reliable, and valid feedback for educator development.

*Shenran Wang,Timothy Tin-Long Tse,Jian Zhu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper evaluates in-depth in-context learning (ICL) across different large language model architectures, discovering differences in internal mechanisms despite similar task performances.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to understand the mechanisms of in-context learning (ICL) within state-of-the-art transformer, state-space, and hybrid large language models, and their behaviors across knowledge-based tasks.

Method: Behavioral probing and intervention-based methods are used to study the internal mechanisms of large language models (LLMs) in performing ICL, and investigate the role of function vectors (FVs) in self-attention and Mamba layers.

Result: Their findings reveal that LLMs of different architectures perform similarly in tasks but use distinct internal mechanisms. FVs are key for parametric knowledge tasks, while Mamba2 may utilize different mechanisms for ICL.

Conclusion: The study advances understanding of ICL mechanisms across architectures and task types, emphasizing the importance of combining behavioral and mechanistic analyses for LLM evaluation.

Abstract: We perform in-depth evaluations of in-context learning (ICL) on
state-of-the-art transformer, state-space, and hybrid large language models
over two categories of knowledge-based ICL tasks. Using a combination of
behavioral probing and intervention-based methods, we have discovered that,
while LLMs of different architectures can behave similarly in task performance,
their internals could remain different. We discover that function vectors (FVs)
responsible for ICL are primarily located in the self-attention and Mamba
layers, and speculate that Mamba2 uses a different mechanism from FVs to
perform ICL. FVs are more important for ICL involving parametric knowledge
retrieval, but not for contextual knowledge understanding. Our work contributes
to a more nuanced understanding across architectures and task types.
Methodologically, our approach also highlights the importance of combining both
behavioural and mechanistic analyses to investigate LLM capabilities.

*Ran Xu,Jingjing Chen,Jiayu Ye,Yu Wu,Jun Yan,Carl Yang,Hongkun Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces TIR-Judge, a framework using tool-integrated reasoning to improve large language model evaluations via RL, achieving significant performance gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome limitations of text-based reasoning in LLM judges, focusing on enhancing evaluation accuracy for complex constraints using integrated tools.

Method: They propose TIR-Judge, a RL-driven framework integrating code execution for evaluative precision, adopting diverse training formats across verifiable/non-verifiable domains.

Result: TIR-Judge outperforms existing judges on benchmarks by up to 7.7%, matching state-of-the-art listwise models despite fewer parameters, even excelling without distilled trajectories.

Conclusion: Tool-augmented LLM judges can effectively self-evolve, succeeding in complex judgments with iterative RL, showcasing significant advancements in evaluation accuracy.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used as judges to evaluate response
quality, providing a scalable alternative to human evaluation. However, most
LLM judges operate solely on intrinsic text-based reasoning, limiting their
ability to verify complex constraints or perform accurate computation.
Motivated by the success of tool-integrated reasoning (TIR) in numerous tasks,
we propose TIR-Judge, an end-to-end RL framework for training LLM judges that
integrates a code executor for precise evaluation. TIR-Judge is built on three
principles: (i) diverse training across verifiable and non-verifiable domains,
(ii) flexible judgment formats (pointwise, pairwise, listwise), and (iii)
iterative RL that bootstraps directly from the initial model without
distillation. On seven public benchmarks, TIR-Judge surpasses strong
reasoning-based judges by up to 6.4% (pointwise) and 7.7% (pairwise), and
achieves listwise performance comparable to Claude-Opus-4 despite having only
8B parameters. Remarkably, TIR-Judge-Zero - trained entirely without distilled
judge trajectories, matches the performance of distilled variants,
demonstrating that tool-augmented judges can self-evolve through iterative
reinforcement learning.

### [168] [Knocking-Heads Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23052)
*Zhanchao Zhou,Xiaodong Chen,Haoxing Chen,Zhenzhong Lan,Jianguo Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The authors introduce knocking-heads attention (KHA), enabling better cross-head interaction in attention models for improved performance in large language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing attention mechanisms like MHA and its variants suffer from limited interactions between individual attention heads, reducing their overall representational capacity.

Method: A new knocking-heads attention (KHA) mechanism facilitates cross-head feature interactions through a shared, diagonally-initialized projection matrix, integrated into attention mechanisms with minimal additional computational overhead.

Result: A 6.1B parameter MoE model, trained with KHA on 1T tokens, achieved superior performance and stable training dynamics compared to standard and variant attention mechanisms.

Conclusion: KHA improves upon current attention methods by enabling better integration of head-specific features, enhancing both efficiency and effectiveness with minimal extra parameters and computational costs.

Abstract: Multi-head attention (MHA) has become the cornerstone of modern large
language models, enhancing representational capacity through parallel attention
heads. However, increasing the number of heads inherently weakens individual
head capacity, and existing attention mechanisms - whether standard MHA or its
variants like grouped-query attention (GQA) and grouped-tied attention (GTA) -
simply concatenate outputs from isolated heads without strong interaction. To
address this limitation, we propose knocking-heads attention (KHA), which
enables attention heads to "knock" on each other - facilitating cross-head
feature-level interactions before the scaled dot-product attention. This is
achieved by applying a shared, diagonally-initialized projection matrix across
all heads. The diagonal initialization preserves head-specific specialization
at the start of training while allowing the model to progressively learn
integrated cross-head representations. KHA adds only minimal parameters and
FLOPs and can be seamlessly integrated into MHA, GQA, GTA, and other attention
variants. We validate KHA by training a 6.1B parameter MoE model (1.01B
activated) on 1T high-quality tokens. Compared to baseline attention
mechanisms, KHA brings superior and more stable training dynamics, achieving
better performance across downstream tasks.

*Hoyeon Moon,Byeolhee Kim,Nikhil Verma*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: QTT-RAG proposes a quality-aware approach for translation tagging to improve multilingual response generation by addressing translation quality issues without altering the original content.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges posed by poor translation quality in multilingual retrieval-augmented generation, which leads to degraded response generation performance and factual distortions in low-resource settings.

Method: QTT-RAG evaluates translation quality based on semantic equivalence, grammatical accuracy, and naturalness & fluency, appending these scores as metadata to the original content for better-informed decision-making by generator models.

Result: QTT-RAG outperforms baseline methods (CrossRAG, DKM-RAG) in preserving factual integrity and enhancing performance across two open-domain QA benchmarks and three languages (Korean, Finnish, and Chinese) using six instruction-tuned large language models ranging from 2.4B to 14B parameters.

Conclusion: QTT-RAG presents an effective and robust method for utilizing cross-lingual documents in low-resource multilingual settings, improving response quality by integrating translation quality awareness into multilingual retrieval-augmented generation systems.

Abstract: Multilingual Retrieval-Augmented Generation (mRAG) often retrieves English
documents and translates them into the query language for low-resource
settings. However, poor translation quality degrades response generation
performance. Existing approaches either assume sufficient translation quality
or utilize the rewriting method, which introduces factual distortion and
hallucinations. To mitigate these problems, we propose Quality-Aware
Translation Tagging in mRAG (QTT-RAG), which explicitly evaluates translation
quality along three dimensions-semantic equivalence, grammatical accuracy, and
naturalness&fluency-and attach these scores as metadata without altering the
original content. We evaluate QTT-RAG against CrossRAG and DKM-RAG as baselines
in two open-domain QA benchmarks (XORQA, MKQA) using six instruction-tuned LLMs
ranging from 2.4B to 14B parameters, covering two low-resource languages
(Korean and Finnish) and one high-resource language (Chinese). QTT-RAG
outperforms the baselines by preserving factual integrity while enabling
generator models to make informed decisions based on translation reliability.
This approach allows for effective usage of cross-lingual documents in
low-resource settings with limited native language documents, offering a
practical and robust solution across multilingual domains.

of mid-training as a vital stage that bridges pre-training and post-training.
Mid-training is distinguished by its use of intermediate data and computational
resources, systematically enhancing specified capabilities such as mathematics,

optimization. We analyze mainstream model implementations in the context of
objective-driven interventions, illustrating how mid-training serves as a
distinct and critical stage in the progressive development of LLM capabilities.

*Suchan Lee,Jihoon Choi,Sohyeon Lee,Minseok Song,Bong-Gyu Jang,Hwanjo Yu,Soyeon Caren Han*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MAP4TS introduces a framework for improving time-series forecasting by using a Multi-Aspect Prompting system, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches struggle to integrate time-series’ unique statistical and temporal characteristics into large language model predictions.

Method: MAP4TS employs specialized prompts, including global, local, statistical, and temporal components, to enhance classical time-series analysis and uses a cross-modality alignment module for effective forecasting.

Result: Extensive testing showed MAP4TS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple datasets and stabilizes performance.

Conclusion: Prompt design incorporating time-series-specific statistical features is crucial for improving forecasting accuracy, with MAP4TS setting a new benchmark in the field.

Abstract: Recent advances have investigated the use of pretrained large language models
(LLMs) for time-series forecasting by aligning numerical inputs with LLM
embedding spaces. However, existing multimodal approaches often overlook the
distinct statistical properties and temporal dependencies that are fundamental
to time-series data. To bridge this gap, we propose MAP4TS, a novel
Multi-Aspect Prompting Framework that explicitly incorporates classical
time-series analysis into the prompt design. Our framework introduces four
specialized prompt components: a Global Domain Prompt that conveys
dataset-level context, a Local Domain Prompt that encodes recent trends and
series-specific behaviors, and a pair of Statistical and Temporal Prompts that
embed handcrafted insights derived from autocorrelation (ACF), partial
autocorrelation (PACF), and Fourier analysis. Multi-Aspect Prompts are combined
with raw time-series embeddings and passed through a cross-modality alignment
module to produce unified representations, which are then processed by an LLM
and projected for final forecasting. Extensive experiments across eight diverse
datasets show that MAP4TS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art LLM-based
methods. Our ablation studies further reveal that prompt-aware designs
significantly enhance performance stability and that GPT-2 backbones, when
paired with structured prompts, outperform larger models like LLaMA in
long-term forecasting tasks.

TL;DR: The paper explores how hierarchical structures in medical multi-document summarization improve contextualization and coherence compared to flat methods, using large language models and evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the ability of medical multi-document summarization models to manage cross-document relationships efficiently, ensuring clarity and relevance for users.

Method: Two hierarchical organization methods were implemented across three large language models, with evaluations conducted using automated metrics, model-based assessments, and domain expert judgments.

Result: Human experts preferred model-generated summaries over human-written ones. Hierarchical approaches improved factuality, coverage, coherence, and clarity while increasing human preferences.

Conclusion: Hierarchical structures improve the clarity and coverage of medical summaries, providing a compelling approach for better human-preferred summaries.

Abstract: Medical multi-document summarization (MDS) is a complex task that requires
effectively managing cross-document relationships. This paper investigates
whether incorporating hierarchical structures in the inputs of MDS can improve
a model's ability to organize and contextualize information across documents
compared to traditional flat summarization methods. We investigate two ways of
incorporating hierarchical organization across three large language models
(LLMs), and conduct comprehensive evaluations of the resulting summaries using
automated metrics, model-based metrics, and domain expert evaluation of
preference, understandability, clarity, complexity, relevance, coverage,
factuality, and coherence. Our results show that human experts prefer
model-generated summaries over human-written summaries. Hierarchical approaches
generally preserve factuality, coverage, and coherence of information, while
also increasing human preference for summaries. Additionally, we examine
whether simulated judgments from GPT-4 align with human judgments, finding
higher agreement along more objective evaluation facets. Our findings
demonstrate that hierarchical structures can improve the clarity of medical
summaries generated by models while maintaining content coverage, providing a
practical way to improve human preference for generated summaries.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a single, multilingual model for grammatical inflection across 73 languages, demonstrating superior performance over monolingual baselines while being lightweight, robust, and simplifying deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to tackle the lack of an open-source, general-purpose multilingual morphological inflection system that is practical, efficient, and capable of handling a wide array of languages, including unseen words.

Method: A compact multilingual model was developed and trained on 73 languages using a novel frequency-weighted, lemma-disjoint train-dev-test resampling procedure. The model’s performance was validated using SIGMORPHON benchmarks and Universal Dependencies treebanks.

Result: The multilingual model outperformed monolingual baselines in most languages, proving the efficacy of the multilingual approach for inflection. The system is robust to unseen words and supports realistic evaluation through novel data splitting.

Conclusion: The approach simplifies deployment by replacing multiple monolingual models with a single compact multilingual model while maintaining superior performance across a variety of languages.

Abstract: We present a compact, single-model approach to multilingual inflection, the
task of generating inflected word forms from base lemmas to express grammatical
categories. Our model, trained jointly on data from 73 languages, is
lightweight, robust to unseen words, and outperforms monolingual baselines in
most languages. This demonstrates the effectiveness of multilingual modeling
for inflection and highlights its practical benefits: simplifying deployment by
eliminating the need to manage and retrain dozens of separate monolingual
models. In addition to the standard SIGMORPHON shared task benchmarks, we
evaluate our monolingual and multilingual models on 73 Universal Dependencies
(UD) treebanks, extracting lemma-tag-form triples and their frequency counts.
To ensure realistic data splits, we introduce a novel frequency-weighted,
lemma-disjoint train-dev-test resampling procedure. Our work addresses the lack
of an open-source, general-purpose, multilingual morphological inflection
system capable of handling unseen words across a wide range of languages,
including Czech. All code is publicly released at:

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces TopLoRA, a novel variant of LoRA, which adapts LoRA weights dynamically for each input token to achieve better performance without increasing computational requirements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve the adaptability of LoRA, a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method, by addressing its limitation in capturing token-specific information due to the use of shared weights for all input tokens.

Method: The authors propose Token-wise Projected Low-Rank Adaptation (TopLoRA) which incorporates a diagonal matrix from input tokens into the LoRA weight structure, creating token-specific input-output projections.

Result: TopLoRA consistently outperforms standard LoRA and its variants in experiments conducted across different models and datasets.

Conclusion: This work demonstrates that token-wise adaptability in LoRA, as achieved by TopLoRA, enhances fine-tuning efficiency and performance without increasing the rank of LoRA weights, establishing a more granular adaptation process.

Abstract: Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) is a parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method
widely used in large language models (LLMs). LoRA essentially describes the
projection of an input space into a low-dimensional output space, with the
dimensionality determined by the LoRA rank. In standard LoRA, all input tokens
share the same weights and undergo an identical input-output projection. This
limits LoRA's ability to capture token-specific information due to the inherent
semantic differences among tokens. To address this limitation, we propose
Token-wise Projected Low-Rank Adaptation (TopLoRA), which dynamically adjusts
LoRA weights according to the input token, thereby learning token-wise
input-output projections in an end-to-end manner. Formally, the weights of
TopLoRA can be expressed as $B\Sigma_X A$, where $A$ and $B$ are low-rank
matrices (as in standard LoRA), and $\Sigma_X$ is a diagonal matrix generated
from each input token $X$. Notably, TopLoRA does not increase the rank of LoRA
weights but achieves more granular adaptation by learning token-wise LoRA
weights (i.e., token-wise input-output projections). Extensive experiments
across multiple models and datasets demonstrate that TopLoRA consistently
outperforms LoRA and its variants. The code is available at

Motivation: The need for systems in morphological inflection to account for frequency distribution from real-world texts for practical deployment.

Method: Investigating frequency-aware approaches for train-dev-test splitting, evaluation metrics (token vs. type accuracy), and training data sampling for 43 languages.

Result: Frequency-aware training is shown to perform better than uniform sampling in 26 out of 43 languages.

Conclusion: Including corpus frequency in morphological inflection improves system realism and generalization capabilities.

Abstract: The traditional approach to morphological inflection (the task of modifying a
base word (lemma) to express grammatical categories) has been, for decades, to
consider lexical entries of lemma-tag-form triples uniformly, lacking any
information about their frequency distribution. However, in production
deployment, one might expect the user inputs to reflect a real-world
distribution of frequencies in natural texts. With future deployment in mind,
we explore the incorporation of corpus frequency information into the task of
morphological inflection along three key dimensions during system development:
(i) for train-dev-test split, we combine a lemma-disjoint approach, which
evaluates the model's generalization capabilities, with a frequency-weighted
strategy to better reflect the realistic distribution of items across different
frequency bands in training and test sets; (ii) for evaluation, we complement
the standard type accuracy (often referred to simply as accuracy), which treats
all items equally regardless of frequency, with token accuracy, which assigns
greater weight to frequent words and better approximates performance on running
text; (iii) for training data sampling, we introduce a method novel in the
context of inflection, frequency-aware training, which explicitly incorporates
word frequency into the sampling process. We show that frequency-aware training
outperforms uniform sampling in 26 out of 43 languages.

### [176] [ENTP: Enhancing Low-Quality SFT Data via Neural-Symbolic Text Purge-Mix](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23160)
*Zile Yang,Ling Li,Na Di,Jinlong Pang,Yao Zhou,Hao Cheng,Bo Han,Jiaheng Wei*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces ENTP, a framework for improving the quality of low-quality SFT data using a neural-symbolic approach, achieving superior fine-tuning results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiencies and lost potential in discarding low-quality data during instruction alignment processes for LLMs.

Method: ENTP combines symbolic purification (to remove noise using statistical priors) and neural reconstruction (to enrich data via latent representations and model knowledge).

Result: ENTP-augmented datasets outperform 13 data-selection baselines and show better results than fine-tuning the original large dataset in instruction-following benchmarks.

Conclusion: The findings demonstrate that low-quality data can drive high performance when intelligently purified and synthesized, offering a new direction in efficient domain-specific model fine-tuning.

Abstract: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) adapts pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs)
to domain-specific instructions by training on a carefully curated subset of
high-quality instruction-response pairs, typically drawn from a larger dataset
that often contains many low-quality or noisy samples. However, existing
quality-first paradigms often overlook valuable signals in discarded
low-quality data and rely on imperfect quality filters. We introduce ENTP
(Enhancing low-quality SFT data via Neural-symbolic Text Purge-Mix), a
framework that revitalizes low-quality corpora through symbolic purification
and neural reconstruction. The symbolic module identifies and prunes noisy
samples based on statistical priors, while the neural component synthesizes
enriched instruction-response pairs by leveraging latent representations and
model knowledge. This neural-symbolic synergy enhances data informativeness and
diversity. Experiments show that ENTP-augmented datasets, constructed
exclusively from low-quality data, outperform 13 established data-selection
baselines across five instruction-following benchmarks, and even surpass
fine-tuning on the full original dataset (approximately 300K examples). Our
results highlight the untapped potential of low-quality data and underscore the
importance of intelligent purification and synthesis for efficient instruction
alignment.

### [177] [Beyond Direct Generation: A Decomposed Approach to Well-Crafted Screenwriting with LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23163)
*Hang Lei,Shengyi Zong,Zhaoyan Li,Ziren Zhou,Hao Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes Dual-Stage Refinement (DSR) to improve screenplay generation using LLMs by separating narrative creation and format adherence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often fail in generating complete and professional screenplays due to the challenge of combining creative writing with strict formatting requirements.

Method: The Dual-Stage Refinement framework decomposes the process into two stages: transforming outlines into novel-style prose, and then formatting this narrative into a screenplay, using hybrid data synthesis for training.

Result: DSR achieves superior performance, with a 75% win rate against strong baselines and 82.7% of human-level quality in professional evaluations.

Conclusion: This approach effectively enhances the capability of LLMs in creative screenplay production, addressing format and creativity individually for better results.

Abstract: The screenplay serves as the foundation for television production, defining
narrative structure, character development, and dialogue. While Large Language
Models (LLMs) show great potential in creative writing, direct end-to-end
generation approaches often fail to produce well-crafted screenplays. We argue
this failure stems from forcing a single model to simultaneously master two
disparate capabilities: creative narrative construction and rigid format
adherence. The resulting outputs may mimic superficial style but lack the deep
structural integrity and storytelling substance required for professional use.
To enable LLMs to generate high-quality screenplays, we introduce Dual-Stage
Refinement (DSR), a decomposed framework that decouples creative narrative
generation from format conversion. The first stage transforms a brief outline
into rich, novel-style prose. The second stage refines this narrative into a
professionally formatted screenplay. This separation enables the model to
specialize in one distinct capability at each stage. A key challenge in
implementing DSR is the scarcity of paired outline-to-novel training data. We
address this through hybrid data synthesis: reverse synthesis deconstructs
existing screenplays into structured inputs, while forward synthesis leverages
these inputs to generate high-quality narrative texts as training targets.
Blind evaluations by professional screenwriters show that DSR achieves a 75%
win rate against strong baselines like Gemini-2.5-Pro and reaches 82.7% of
human-level performance. Our work demonstrates that decomposed generation
architecture with tailored data synthesis effectively specializes LLMs in
complex creative domains.

### [178] [SI-Bench: Benchmarking Social Intelligence of Large Language Models in Human-to-Human Conversations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23182)
*Shuai Huang,Wenxuan Zhao,Jun Gao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces SI-Bench, a benchmark to evaluate social intelligence in language models using authentic dialogue datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of evaluating language models in real complex social interactions and improve upon the simulated agent-to-agent methods.

Method: The authors created SI-Bench with 2,221 authentic dialogues from a social app and manually annotated a subset of 312 dialogues, evaluating across 8 major language models.

Result: State-of-the-art models excel in process reasoning but lag behind humans in reply quality. Additionally, Chain-of-Thought reasoning negatively impacts LLMs' performance in social dialogue.

Conclusion: SI-Bench provides valuable insights into LLMs' social interaction capabilities and highlights where improvements are needed, offering an open dataset for further research.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) develop anthropomorphic abilities, they are
increasingly being deployed as autonomous agents to interact with humans.
However, evaluating their performance in realistic and complex social
interactions remains a significant challenge. Most previous research built
datasets through simulated agent-to-agent interactions, which fails to capture
the authentic linguistic styles and relational dynamics found in real human
conversations. To address this gap, we introduce SI-Bench, a novel benchmark
designed to evaluate aspects of social intelligence in LLMs. Grounded in broad
social science theories, SI-Bench contains 2,221 authentic multi-turn dialogues
collected from a social networking application. We further selected a subset of
312 dialogues for manual annotation across 8 major models. The experiments show
that SOTA models have surpassed the human expert in process reasoning under
complex social situations, yet they still fall behind humans in reply quality.
Moreover, introducing Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning may degrade the
performance of LLMs in social dialogue tasks. All datasets are openly available
at https://github.com/SI-Bench/SI-Bench.git.

*Ali Fata,Hossein Rahmani,Parinaz Soltanzadeh,Amirhossein Derakhshan,Behrouz Minaei Bidgoli*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces DREAM, a method for extracting drug-drug relationships using transfer learning and ontology creation, validated through a large language model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of datasets specifically designed for drug-drug relation extraction and enhance low-cost relation extraction using machine learning.

Method: DREAM employs a trained relation extraction model to detect relationships, applies it to medical texts for ontology construction, and validates results using a large language model.

Result: Quantitatively, the large language model agreed with 71% of the extracted relations. Qualitatively, the method highlighted ambiguities in medical texts.

Conclusion: DREAM showcases the potential of leveraging machine learning and transfer learning for drug relation extraction while also identifying challenges in the medical domain.

Abstract: Relation extraction between drugs plays a crucial role in identifying drug
drug interactions and predicting side effects. The advancement of machine
learning methods in relation extraction, along with the development of large
medical text databases, has enabled the low cost extraction of such relations
compared to other approaches that typically require expert knowledge. However,
to the best of our knowledge, there are limited datasets specifically designed
for drug drug relation extraction currently available. Therefore, employing
transfer learning becomes necessary to apply machine learning methods in this
domain. In this study, we propose DREAM, a method that first employs a trained
relation extraction model to discover relations between entities and then
applies this model to a corpus of medical texts to construct an ontology of
drug relationships. The extracted relations are subsequently validated using a
large language model. Quantitative results indicate that the LLM agreed with 71
of the relations extracted from a subset of PubMed abstracts. Furthermore, our
qualitative analysis indicates that this approach can uncover ambiguities in
the medical domain, highlighting the challenges inherent in relation extraction
in this field.

### [180] [Process Reward Models for Sentence-Level Verification of LVLM Radiology Reports](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23217)
*Alois Thomas,Maya Varma,Jean-Benoit Delbrouck,Curtis P. Langlotz*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes a sentence-level Process Reward Model (PRM) to ensure factual correctness in radiology reports generated by Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Radiology report automation with LVLMs is promising but prone to critical clinical inaccuracies or hallucinations. A robust solution is needed to improve sentence-level factual correctness.

Method: The authors developed a 0.5B-parameter lightweight PRM that predicts each sentence's correctness based on clinical context and preceding text, trained on MIMIC-CXR dataset using weakly-supervised labels.

Result: The PRM outperforms existing techniques, improves Matthews Correlation Coefficient by 7.5% and AUROC by 1.8% against strong baselines. It also filters low-quality reports boosting F1-CheXbert scores by 4.5%, and enhances clinical metrics using best-of-N selection.

Conclusion: The PRM serves as a reliable, model-agnostic safety mechanism for clinical LVLMs, offering improved accuracy and quality in radiology report generation without requiring access to internal model states.

Abstract: Automating radiology report generation with Large Vision-Language Models
(LVLMs) holds great potential, yet these models often produce clinically
critical hallucinations, posing serious risks. Existing hallucination detection
methods frequently lack the necessary sentence-level granularity or robust
generalization across different LVLM generators. We introduce a novel approach:
a sentence-level Process Reward Model (PRM) adapted for this vision-language
task. Our PRM predicts the factual correctness of each generated sentence,
conditioned on clinical context and preceding text. When fine-tuned on
MIMIC-CXR with weakly-supervised labels, a lightweight 0.5B-parameter PRM
outperforms existing verification techniques, demonstrating, for instance,
relative improvements of 7.5% in Matthews Correlation Coefficient and 1.8% in
AUROC over strong white-box baselines on outputs from one LVLM. Unlike methods
reliant on internal model states, our PRM demonstrates strong generalization to
an unseen LVLM. We further show its practical utility: PRM scores effectively
filter low-quality reports, improving F1-CheXbert scores by 4.5% (when
discarding the worst 10% of reports). Moreover, when guiding a novel weighted
best-of-N selection process on the MIMIC-CXR test set, our PRM show relative
improvements in clinical metrics of 7.4% for F1-CheXbert and 0.6% for
BERTScore. These results demonstrate that a lightweight, context-aware PRM
provides a model-agnostic safety layer for clinical LVLMs without access to
internal activations

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper focuses on addressing challenges in automatic speech recognition (ASR) for regional dialects, using a new Bengali dialect corpus, and highlights the limitations of deep learning models under dialectal variations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to explore the impact of regional dialectal variations on ASR accuracy, especially in low-resource languages, where dialects are often disregarded or treated as secondary tasks.

Method: The authors created a 78-hour annotated Bengali Speech-to-Text corpus named Ben-10, and used both linguistic and data-driven analyses to evaluate ASR performance on regional dialects. They tested the models in zero-shot and fine-tuned scenarios, exploring the efficacy of dialect-specific training.

Result: The results reveal that ASR models struggle significantly with regional dialects, regardless of zero-shot or fine-tuning approaches. However, training models explicitly on dialect-specific data showed improvements in handling dialectal variations.

Conclusion: Dialects severely challenge traditional ASR models, but targeted dialect-specific training shows promise. The Ben-10 dataset offers a valuable resource for future research in constrained ASR modeling for regional dialects.

Abstract: Conventional research on speech recognition modeling relies on the canonical
form for most low-resource languages while automatic speech recognition (ASR)
for regional dialects is treated as a fine-tuning task. To investigate the
effects of dialectal variations on ASR we develop a 78-hour annotated Bengali
Speech-to-Text (STT) corpus named Ben-10. Investigation from linguistic and
data-driven perspectives shows that speech foundation models struggle heavily
in regional dialect ASR, both in zero-shot and fine-tuned settings. We observe
that all deep learning methods struggle to model speech data under dialectal
variations but dialect specific model training alleviates the issue. Our
dataset also serves as a out of-distribution (OOD) resource for ASR modeling
under constrained resources in ASR algorithms. The dataset and code developed
for this project are publicly available

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Mubeen is a proprietary Arabic language model optimized for understanding Arabic linguistics, Islamic studies, and cultural heritage. It uses authentic native Arabic sources for clear, accurate responses while addressing user intent effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address limitations in existing Arabic language models that use translated English data and fail in detecting user intent, while aligning with Saudi Vision 2030 to enhance cultural preservation and knowledge dissemination.

Method: The model utilizes authentic Arabic sources, including historical manuscripts and scholarly works digitized through an advanced Arabic OCR engine. It incorporates the Practical Closure Architecture to address the 'Utility Gap Crisis' for more effective guidance.

Result: Mubeen ensures contextually relevant and accurate responses with cultural authenticity while demonstrating proficiency in both classical and contemporary Arabic texts.

Conclusion: Mubeen bridges the gap in Arabic linguistic models by offering decisive, user-focused guidance, cultural authenticity, and advanced understanding of Arabic linguistic and heritage domains.

Abstract: Mubeen is a proprietary Arabic language model developed by MASARAT SA,
optimized for deep understanding of Arabic linguistics, Islamic studies, and
cultural heritage. Trained on an extensive collection of authentic Arabic
sources significantly expanded by digitizing historical manuscripts via a
proprietary Arabic OCR engine, the model incorporates seminal scholarly works
in linguistics, jurisprudence, hadith, and Quranic exegesis, alongside
thousands of academic theses and peer-reviewed research papers. Conditioned
through a deep linguistic engineering framework, Mubeen masters not just the
meaning but the eloquence of Arabic, enabling precise understanding across
classical texts, contemporary writing, and regional dialects with focus on
comprehending user intent and delivering accurate, contextually relevant
responses. Unlike other Arabic models relying on translated English data that
often fail in intent detection or retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), Mubeen
uses native Arabic sources to ensure cultural authenticity and accuracy. Its
core innovation is the Practical Closure Architecture, designed to solve the
"Utility Gap Crisis" where factually correct answers fail to resolve users'
core needs, forcing them into frustrating cycles of re-prompting. By
prioritizing clarity and decisive guidance, Mubeen transforms from an
information repository into a decisive guide, aligning with Saudi Vision 2030.
The model's architecture combines deep heritage specialization with
multi-disciplinary expert modules, enabling robust performance across both
cultural preservation and general knowledge domains.

*Bang Xiao,Lingjie Jiang,Shaohan Huang,Tengchao Lv,Yupan Huang,Xun Wu,Lei Cui,Furu Wei*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new approach to improve the aesthetic quality of code generated by large language models (LLMs) using a novel dataset, multi-agent feedback, and optimization algorithms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs, despite excelling in traditional coding tasks, often produce suboptimal visual designs in code aesthetics. This paper aims to address the gap in enhancing code aesthetics generated by LLMs.

Method: The authors created the AesCode-358K dataset for instruction-tuning on code aesthetics, used a multi-agent reward feedback system for aesthetic evaluation, and developed the GRPO-AR algorithm for optimizing both code functionality and aesthetics.

Result: The proposed approach significantly improves performance on the OpenDesign benchmark for code aesthetics and existing metrics, outperforming models like GPT-4o and GPT-4.1, and achieving results comparable to large open-source models with 480B-685B parameters.

Conclusion: Enhancing code aesthetics through supervised instruction-tuning, multi-agent reward feedback, and optimization algorithms is effective, paving the way for more visually appealing outputs by LLMs.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become valuable assistants for developers
in code-related tasks. While LLMs excel at traditional programming tasks such
as code generation and bug fixing, they struggle with visually-oriented coding
tasks, often producing suboptimal aesthetics. In this paper, we introduce a new
pipeline to enhance the aesthetic quality of LLM-generated code. We first
construct AesCode-358K, a large-scale instruction-tuning dataset focused on
code aesthetics. Next, we propose agentic reward feedback, a multi-agent system
that evaluates executability, static aesthetics, and interactive aesthetics.
Building on this, we develop GRPO-AR, which integrates these signals into the
GRPO algorithm for joint optimization of functionality and code aesthetics.
Finally, we develop OpenDesign, a benchmark for assessing code aesthetics.
Experimental results show that combining supervised fine-tuning on AesCode-358K
with reinforcement learning using agentic reward feedback significantly
improves performance on OpenDesign and also enhances results on existing
benchmarks such as PandasPlotBench. Notably, our AesCoder-4B surpasses GPT-4o
and GPT-4.1, and achieves performance comparable to large open-source models
with 480B-685B parameters, underscoring the effectiveness of our approach.

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Multi-Modal Context-Aware Recognition (MCoRec) task, leveraging audio, visual, and contextual cues for transcription and clustering in overlapping conversational scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the cocktail-party problem by improving recognition of overlapping, natural multi-party conversations using multi-modal data.

Method: MCoRec combines audio and visual inputs to jointly transcribe speech and cluster speakers into respective conversations.

Result: Audio-only baselines show over 100% word error rates, but introducing visual cues achieves a 50% improvement in performance.

Conclusion: Multi-modality (audio-visual integration) is crucial for accurate speaker transcription and clustering in complex conversational environments.

Abstract: We introduce the task of Multi-Modal Context-Aware Recognition (MCoRec) in
the ninth CHiME Challenge, which addresses the cocktail-party problem of
overlapping conversations in a single-room setting using audio, visual, and
contextual cues. MCoRec captures natural multi-party conversations where the
recordings focus on unscripted, casual group chats, leading to extreme speech
overlap of up to 100% and highly fragmented conversational turns. The task
requires systems to answer the question "Who speaks when, what, and with whom?"
by jointly transcribing each speaker's speech and clustering them into their
respective conversations from audio-visual recordings. Audio-only baselines
exceed 100% word error rate, whereas incorporating visual cues yields
substantial 50% improvements, highlighting the importance of multi-modality. In
this manuscript, we present the motivation behind the task, outline the data
collection process, and report the baseline systems developed for the MCoRec.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper designs a fully automated data-centric pipeline for text-to-SQL tasks, proposes multiple model collaboration strategies, and achieves top-tier performance in lightweight models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to explore the impact of data-centric strategies on text-to-SQL tasks, as this area has been largely neglected despite advances in this field.

Method: The authors propose a pipeline with adaptive data repair and error data augmentation, alongside a multi-model collaboration training schema and ensemble strategies to improve accuracy in text-to-SQL tasks.

Result: Experiment results demonstrate the effectiveness of the data-centric pipeline and multi-model collaboration strategies, achieving first place among lightweight text-to-SQL models.

Conclusion: Data-centric strategies and multi-model collaborative approaches contribute significantly to improving text-to-SQL tasks, particularly in lightweight model settings.

Abstract: Text-to-SQL tasks have gained attractive improvements since the release of
ChatGPT. Among them, agent-based frameworks have been widely used in this
field. However, the impact of data-centric strategies on text-to-SQL tasks has
rarely been explored. In this paper, we systemically design a fully automated
data-centric pipeline for text-to-SQL tasks, including \emph{adaptive data
repair}, which can automatically find and fix errors in the training dataset;
and \emph{error data augmentation}, where we specifically diffuse and enhance
erroneous data predicted by the initially trained models. Meanwhile, we propose
a Multi-Model collaboration training schema, aiming to train multiple models
with different augmented data, enabling them to possess distinct capabilities
and work together to complement each other, because it has been found that the
capability of a single fine-tuned model is very limited. Furthermore, we
utilize an ensemble strategy to integrate the capabilities of multiple models
to solve a multiple-choice question, aiming to further improve the accuracy of
text-to-SQL tasks. The experiment results and ablation study have demonstrated
the effectiveness of data-centric pipeline and Multi-Model(MM) interactive
iterative strategies, achieving first place in lightweight text-to-SQL models
(within 70B).

TL;DR: The paper introduces Arabic Little STT, a Levantine Arabic child speech dataset, highlighting challenges faced by ASR models like Whisper when applied to child speech compared to adults.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the data scarcity in low-resource languages, particularly Arabic, and fill the gap concerning child-specific speech corpora.

Method: Developed Arabic Little STT dataset of Levantine Arabic child speech and systematically assessed Whisper ASR model performance compared to adult Arabic benchmarks.

Result: The Whisper ASR model significantly struggled with child speech, as evidenced by a high word error rate (WER) (0.66), compared to sub 0.20 WER on adult speech.

Conclusion: Dedicated benchmarks and inclusive datasets are crucial for improving ASR systems' performance on child speech, governed by ethical frameworks for privacy.

Abstract: The performance of Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems fundamentally depends
on high-quality training data. However, low-resource languages like Arabic
suffer from severe data scarcity. Moreover, the absence of child-specific
speech corpora is an essential gap that poses significant challenges. To
address this gap, we present our created dataset, Arabic Little STT, a dataset
of Levantine Arabic child speech recorded in classrooms, containing 355
utterances from 288 children (ages 6 - 13). We further conduct a systematic
assessment of Whisper, a state-of-the-art automatic speech recognition (ASR)
model, on this dataset and compare its performance with adult Arabic
benchmarks. Our evaluation across eight Whisper variants reveals that even the
best-performing model (Large_v3) struggles significantly, achieving a 0.66 word
error rate (WER) on child speech, starkly contrasting with its sub 0.20 WER on
adult datasets. These results align with other research on English speech.
Results highlight the critical need for dedicated child speech benchmarks and
inclusive training data in ASR development. Emphasizing that such data must be
governed by strict ethical and privacy frameworks to protect sensitive child
information. We hope that this study provides an initial step for future work
on equitable speech technologies for Arabic-speaking children. We hope that our
publicly available dataset enrich the children's demographic representation in
ASR datasets.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AdaSearch and AdaBeam are proposed as novel methods for dynamically allocating computational effort during LLM inference, showing significant improvements in alignment tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) during inference time is challenging, and existing approaches with uniform computational efforts are often suboptimal.

Method: The authors introduce AdaSearch, which employs a blockwise adaptive strategy for resource allocation focusing on critical initial tokens. They extend it to AdaBeam, a tree-search counterpart, applied in sequential decoding.

Result: AdaSearch demonstrated superior performance compared to Best-of-N and fine-tuning approaches, achieving over a 10% improvement in tasks like harmlessness, sentiment control, and mathematical reasoning.

Conclusion: Adaptive resource allocation during crucial phases of LLM inference improves alignment significantly, as evidenced by the successes of AdaSearch and AdaBeam.

Abstract: LLM alignment remains a critical challenge. Inference-time methods provide a
flexible alternative to fine-tuning, but their uniform computational effort
often yields suboptimal alignment. We hypothesize that for many alignment
tasks, the initial tokens of a response are disproportionately more critical.
To leverage this principle, we introduce AdaSearch, a novel blockwise search
strategy. It adaptively allocates a fixed computational budget using a sampling
schedule, focusing search effort on these critical tokens. We apply AdaSearch
to sequential decoding and introduce its tree-search counterpart, AdaBeam. Our
comprehensive evaluation across eight LLMs demonstrates that AdaSearch
outperforms strong Best-of-N and fine-tuning baselines. Specifically, win-rates
improve by over 10% for harmlessness generation, controlled sentiment
generation, and for mathematical reasoning tasks relative to Best-of-N.

*Siyuan Zheng,Pai Liu,Xi Chen,Jizheng Dong,Sihan Jia*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel BaZi-LLM system for generating contextually coherent virtual personas by integrating symbolic reasoning with large language models. It achieves notable improvements in accuracy compared to mainstream LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations of current character generation methods that rely heavily on annotated data or handcrafted prompts, which are difficult to scale and lack contextual coherence. The aim is to create more realistic virtual personas for applications like games and VR.

Method: The authors developed a BaZi-based question-answer dataset on life events and proposed the first BaZi-LLM system. This system integrates symbolic reasoning with large language models to generate temporally dynamic and culturally nuanced virtual personas.

Result: The BaZi-LLM system significantly outperformed mainstream LLMs, achieving a 30.3%-62.6% improvement in accuracy. The results also demonstrated sensitivity to incorrect BaZi information, with accuracy reducing by 20%-45%.

Conclusion: The study shows the potential of integrating culturally informed symbolic reasoning with large language models to generate realistic and contextually relevant virtual characters while highlighting its strengths and dependence on accurate symbolic information.

Abstract: Human-like virtual characters are crucial for games, storytelling, and
virtual reality, yet current methods rely heavily on annotated data or
handcrafted persona prompts, making it difficult to scale up and generate
realistic, contextually coherent personas. We create the first QA dataset for
BaZi-based persona reasoning, where real human experiences categorized into
wealth, health, kinship, career, and relationships are represented as
life-event questions and answers. Furthermore, we propose the first BaZi-LLM
system that integrates symbolic reasoning with large language models to
generate temporally dynamic and fine-grained virtual personas. Compared with
mainstream LLMs such as DeepSeek-v3 and GPT-5-mini, our method achieves a
30.3%-62.6% accuracy improvement. In addition, when incorrect BaZi information
is used, our model's accuracy drops by 20%-45%, showing the potential of
culturally grounded symbolic-LLM integration for realistic character
simulation.

TL;DR: LightKGG is a framework that uses small-scale language models (SLMs) for efficient knowledge graph construction, reducing dependency on complex methods or resource-heavy language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current extraction methods for knowledge graphs are either error-prone or demand high computational resources, restricting their use in low-resource environments.

Method: LightKGG utilizes two innovations: Context-integrated Graph extraction for better information inclusion and Topology-enhanced relationship inference for efficient relationship discovery.

Result: The framework successfully constructs accurate knowledge graphs using minimal hardware resources, making it accessible for low-resource settings.

Conclusion: LightKGG provides a practical, scientifically optimized solution for extracting knowledge graphs using small-scale models, improving accessibility to downstream AI applications.

Abstract: The scarcity of high-quality knowledge graphs (KGs) remains a critical
bottleneck for downstream AI applications, as existing extraction methods rely
heavily on error-prone pattern-matching techniques or resource-intensive large
language models (LLMs). While recent tools leverage LLMs to generate KGs, their
computational demands limit accessibility for low-resource environments. Our
paper introduces LightKGG, a novel framework that enables efficient KG
extraction from textual data using small-scale language models (SLMs) through
two key technical innovations: (1) Context-integrated Graph extraction
integrates contextual information with nodes and edges into a unified graph
structure, reducing the reliance on complex semantic processing while
maintaining more key information; (2) Topology-enhanced relationship inference
leverages the inherent topology of the extracted graph to efficiently infer
relationships, enabling relationship discovery without relying on complex
language understanding capabilities of LLMs. By enabling accurate KG
construction with minimal hardware requirements, this work bridges the gap
between automated knowledge extraction and practical deployment scenarios while
introducing scientifically rigorous methods for optimizing SLM efficiency in
structured NLP tasks.

*Sheri Osborn,Rohit Valecha,H. Raghav Rao,Dan Sass,Anthony Rios*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a benchmark for assessing large language models' effectiveness in forecasting labor market changes due to AI impact, using sector job postings and occupational change data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in systematically forecasting AI's impact on employment and labor markets using large language models.

Method: The study creates a benchmark combining datasets of job postings and projected occupational changes, formatted into forecasting tasks and utilizing various prompting strategies, such as task-scaffolded and persona-driven approaches.

Result: Structured task prompts improve forecast stability while persona prompts enhance short-term trend predictions; performance varies across sectors and timeframes, demonstrating the need for tailored prompting and evaluation.

Conclusion: The benchmark enables exploration of LLM capabilities in economic forecasting, highlighting opportunities and limitations, and supports further research in labor prediction and prompt design.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence is reshaping labor markets, yet we lack tools to
systematically forecast its effects on employment. This paper introduces a
benchmark for evaluating how well large language models (LLMs) can anticipate
changes in job demand, especially in occupations affected by AI. Existing
research has shown that LLMs can extract sentiment, summarize economic reports,
and emulate forecaster behavior, but little work has assessed their use for
forward-looking labor prediction. Our benchmark combines two complementary
datasets: a high-frequency index of sector-level job postings in the United
States, and a global dataset of projected occupational changes due to AI
adoption. We format these data into forecasting tasks with clear temporal
splits, minimizing the risk of information leakage. We then evaluate LLMs using
multiple prompting strategies, comparing task-scaffolded, persona-driven, and
hybrid approaches across model families. We assess both quantitative accuracy
and qualitative consistency over time. Results show that structured task
prompts consistently improve forecast stability, while persona prompts offer
advantages on short-term trends. However, performance varies significantly
across sectors and horizons, highlighting the need for domain-aware prompting
and rigorous evaluation protocols. By releasing our benchmark, we aim to
support future research on labor forecasting, prompt design, and LLM-based
economic reasoning. This work contributes to a growing body of research on how
LLMs interact with real-world economic data, and provides a reproducible
testbed for studying the limits and opportunities of AI as a forecasting tool
in the context of labor markets.

### [191] [Detecting Religious Language in Climate Discourse](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23395)
*Evy Beijen,Pien Pieterse,Yusuf Çelik,Willem Th. van Peursen,Sandjai Bhulai,Meike Morren*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores how religious language manifests in climate-related texts from secular and religious NGOs using two computational approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how explicit and implicit religious language permeates climate discourse in texts produced by secular and religious NGOs.

Method: The authors use a dual methodology: a rule-based hierarchical tree model of religious terms from ecotheology literature and large language models (LLMs) in a zero-shot setting. The methods are applied to analyze over 880,000 sentences.

Result: The rule-based model identified more religious language than LLMs. The study reveals differences in detection methods and suggests that vocabulary or contextual meaning defines religious language.

Conclusion: This study advances digital methods in religious studies by showcasing the potential and limitations of computational approaches for analyzing religious language in climate discourse.

Abstract: Religious language continues to permeate contemporary discourse, even in
ostensibly secular domains such as environmental activism and climate change
debates. This paper investigates how explicit and implicit forms of religious
language appear in climate-related texts produced by secular and religious
nongovernmental organizations (NGOs). We introduce a dual methodological
approach: a rule-based model using a hierarchical tree of religious terms
derived from ecotheology literature, and large language models (LLMs) operating
in a zero-shot setting. Using a dataset of more than 880,000 sentences, we
compare how these methods detect religious language and analyze points of
agreement and divergence. The results show that the rule-based method
consistently labels more sentences as religious than LLMs. These findings
highlight not only the methodological challenges of computationally detecting
religious language but also the broader tension over whether religious language
should be defined by vocabulary alone or by contextual meaning. This study
contributes to digital methods in religious studies by demonstrating both the
potential and the limitations of approaches for analyzing how the sacred
persists in climate discourse.

*Musleh Alharthi,Kaleel Mahmood,Sarosh Patel,Ausif Mahmood*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Mixture of Experts (MoE) framework that combines state-of-the-art models (e.g., xLSTM, enhanced Linear, PatchTST, and minGRU) using a Transformer-based gating network, achieving superior performance on forecasting benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenges in time series forecasting (TSF), such as unpredictability and emphasis on recent data, by building upon insights and limitations of existing models (e.g., Transformers, LLMs).

Method: The proposed method integrates a set of complementary TSF models (xLSTM, enhanced Linear, PatchTST, minGRU, etc.) within a Transformer-based Mixture of Experts (MoE) framework.

Result: The proposed model demonstrated better performance compared to existing TSF models, surpassing even the latest MoE-based approaches on standard benchmarks.

Conclusion: The Mixture of Experts framework combining diverse TSF models offers a robust solution for TSF, outperforming both Transformer-based and other recent models, setting a new state-of-the-art in the field.

Abstract: The immense success of the Transformer architecture
  in Natural Language Processing has led to its adoption in Time Se ries
Forecasting (TSF), where superior performance has been shown.
  However, a recent important paper questioned their effectiveness by
  demonstrating that a simple single layer linear model outperforms
  Transformer-based models. This was soon shown to be not as valid,
  by a better transformer-based model termed PatchTST. More re cently, TimeLLM
demonstrated even better results by repurposing a
  Large Language Model (LLM) for the TSF domain. Again, a follow
  up paper challenged this by demonstrating that removing the LLM
  component or replacing it with a basic attention layer in fact yields
  better performance. One of the challenges in forecasting is the fact
  that TSF data favors the more recent past, and is sometimes subject
  to unpredictable events. Based upon these recent insights in TSF, we
  propose a strong Mixture of Experts (MoE) framework. Our method
  combines the state-of-the-art (SOTA) models including xLSTM, en hanced
Linear, PatchTST, and minGRU, among others. This set of
  complimentary and diverse models for TSF are integrated in a Trans former
based MoE gating network. Our proposed model outperforms
  all existing TSF models on standard benchmarks, surpassing even the
  latest approaches based on MoE frameworks.

*Zhuoran Jin,Hongbang Yuan,Kejian Zhu,Jiachun Li,Pengfei Cao,Yubo Chen,Kang Liu,Jun Zhao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Omni-Reward addresses limitations in current reward models by introducing a generalist omni-modal approach, supporting diverse modalities and personalized preferences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reward models mainly focus on text and image-based preferences, lacking support for video, audio, and other modalities, and often overlook nuanced, personalized preferences when trained on binary data.

Method: The paper proposes Omni-Reward, comprising a benchmark (Omni-RewardBench), a multimodal dataset (Omni-RewardData), and advanced discriminative and generative reward models (Omni-RewardModel).

Result: Omni-RewardModel shows strong performance across the proposed Omni-RewardBench and other existing benchmarks.

Conclusion: Omni-Reward represents an important advancement toward generalized omni-modal reward modeling, addressing modality imbalance and preference rigidity in AI systems.

Abstract: Reward models (RMs) play a critical role in aligning AI behaviors with human
preferences, yet they face two fundamental challenges: (1) Modality Imbalance,
where most RMs are mainly focused on text and image modalities, offering
limited support for video, audio, and other modalities; and (2) Preference
Rigidity, where training on fixed binary preference pairs fails to capture the
complexity and diversity of personalized preferences. To address the above
challenges, we propose Omni-Reward, a step toward generalist omni-modal reward
modeling with support for free-form preferences, consisting of: (1) Evaluation:
We introduce Omni-RewardBench, the first omni-modal RM benchmark with free-form
preferences, covering nine tasks across five modalities including text, image,
video, audio, and 3D; (2) Data: We construct Omni-RewardData, a multimodal
preference dataset comprising 248K general preference pairs and 69K
instruction-tuning pairs for training generalist omni-modal RMs; (3) Model: We
propose Omni-RewardModel, which includes both discriminative and generative
RMs, and achieves strong performance on Omni-RewardBench as well as other
widely used reward modeling benchmarks.

*Litu Ou,Kuan Li,Huifeng Yin,Liwen Zhang,Zhongwang Zhang,Xixi Wu,Rui Ye,Zile Qiao,Yong Jiang,Pengjun Xie,Fei Huang,Jingren Zhou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper explores the role of confidence in Large Language Models (LLMs) during multi-turn interactions and proposes methods to use verbalized confidence scores to improve task accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess and enhance the ability of LLMs to communicate confidence in multi-turn interaction scenarios and utilize it for better decision-making and performance.

Method: By experimenting on open-source agentic models, the authors analyze the relationship between verbalized confidence scores and task accuracy. They introduce Test-Time Scaling (TTS) approaches that utilize these scores to optimize model responses and efficiency.

Result: Models exhibit higher accuracy at high confidence levels and near-zero accuracy at low confidence. Implementing the proposed methods reduced token consumption and showed competitive performance compared to fixed budget TTS methods.

Conclusion: Verbalized confidence is a viable and challenging metric that can improve the utility and efficiency of LLMs, especially in complex multi-turn scenarios, when properly utilized.

Abstract: Confidence in LLMs is a useful indicator of model uncertainty and answer
reliability. Existing work mainly focused on single-turn scenarios, while
research on confidence in complex multi-turn interactions is limited. In this
paper, we investigate whether LLM-based search agents have the ability to
communicate their own confidence through verbalized confidence scores after
long sequences of actions, a significantly more challenging task compared to
outputting confidence in a single interaction. Experimenting on open-source
agentic models, we first find that models exhibit much higher task accuracy at
high confidence while having near-zero accuracy when confidence is low. Based
on this observation, we propose Test-Time Scaling (TTS) methods that use
confidence scores to determine answer quality, encourage the model to try again
until reaching a satisfactory confidence level. Results show that our proposed
methods significantly reduce token consumption while demonstrating competitive
performance compared to baseline fixed budget TTS methods.

### [195] [Evaluating Large Language Models for Stance Detection on Financial Targets from SEC Filing Reports and Earnings Call Transcripts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23464)
*Nikesh Gyawali,Doina Caragea,Alex Vasenkov,Cornelia Caragea*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a sentence-level corpus for stance detection in financial narratives, evaluates modern large language models (LLMs) on this corpus, and demonstrates effective results using few-shot prompting methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Analyzing financial narratives from SEC filings and ECTs is challenging due to their length, jargon, and nuanced language. Existing sentiment analysis approaches require extensive labeled datasets, which are expensive and impractical for sentence-level stance analysis.

Method: The authors created a labeled corpus for stance detection focusing on three financial metrics (debt, EPS, sales) using ChatGPT-o3-pro with human validation. They evaluated LLMs using zero-shot, few-shot, and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting strategies.

Result: Few-shot learning combined with CoT prompting achieved the best performance compared to supervised baselines, and performance varied between SEC filings and ECT datasets.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the viability of using LLMs for target-specific stance analysis in financial texts without relying on extensive labeled datasets.

Abstract: Financial narratives from U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)
filing reports and quarterly earnings call transcripts (ECTs) are very
important for investors, auditors, and regulators. However, their length,
financial jargon, and nuanced language make fine-grained analysis difficult.
Prior sentiment analysis in the financial domain required a large, expensive
labeled dataset, making the sentence-level stance towards specific financial
targets challenging. In this work, we introduce a sentence-level corpus for
stance detection focused on three core financial metrics: debt, earnings per
share (EPS), and sales. The sentences were extracted from Form 10-K annual
reports and ECTs, and labeled for stance (positive, negative, neutral) using
the advanced ChatGPT-o3-pro model under rigorous human validation. Using this
corpus, we conduct a systematic evaluation of modern large language models
(LLMs) using zero-shot, few-shot, and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting
strategies. Our results show that few-shot with CoT prompting performs best
compared to supervised baselines, and LLMs' performance varies across the SEC
and ECT datasets. Our findings highlight the practical viability of leveraging
LLMs for target-specific stance in the financial domain without requiring
extensive labeled data.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MMTutorBench introduces a benchmark for AI math tutoring, enabling evaluation across six dimensions with key problem-solving steps. It evaluates 12 MLLMs, showing performance gaps and challenges compared to human tutors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the lack of focus on diagnostic and guidance skills in AI math tutoring by introducing a benchmark tool.

Method: The research involves designing MMTutorBench, composed of 685 problems with pedagogical rubrics, structured into tasks like Insight Discovery, Operation Formulation, and Execution, providing fine-grained evaluations.

Result: The study identifies clear performance disparities between proprietary and open-source models, limitations in current strategies like OCR and few-shot prompting, and reliability in rubric-based evaluation.

Conclusion: MMTutorBench serves as a valuable tool to diagnose and improve AI math tutoring capabilities, emphasizing the need for advancement in AI-driven tutoring solutions.

Abstract: Effective math tutoring requires not only solving problems but also
diagnosing students' difficulties and guiding them step by step. While
multimodal large language models (MLLMs) show promise, existing benchmarks
largely overlook these tutoring skills. We introduce MMTutorBench, the first
benchmark for AI math tutoring, consisting of 685 problems built around
pedagogically significant key-steps. Each problem is paired with
problem-specific rubrics that enable fine-grained evaluation across six
dimensions, and structured into three tasks-Insight Discovery, Operation
Formulation, and Operation Execution. We evaluate 12 leading MLLMs and find
clear performance gaps between proprietary and open-source systems, substantial
room compared to human tutors, and consistent trends across input variants: OCR
pipelines degrade tutoring quality, few-shot prompting yields limited gains,
and our rubric-based LLM-as-a-Judge proves highly reliable. These results
highlight both the difficulty and diagnostic value of MMTutorBench for
advancing AI tutoring.

*Jiahui Geng,Jonathan Tonglet,Iryna Gurevych*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces M4FC, a diverse, multilingual multimodal dataset for automated fact-checking that spans six tasks and offers baseline results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current datasets for multimodal fact-checking have limitations such as insufficient size and diversity, evidence leakage, dependency on external sources for true claims, and narrow language/task focus.

Method: The authors created M4FC, a dataset of 4,982 images and 6,980 claims verified by professional fact-checkers from 22 organizations. These claims are connected to ten languages and span six distinct multimodal fact-checking tasks.

Result: Baseline results were provided for all six tasks, and the paper analyzed the effect of intermediate task combinations on the overall verdict prediction performance.

Conclusion: M4FC solves several shortcomings in existing datasets by providing a comprehensive, diverse, multilingual resource for multimodal fact-checking across six tasks, aiding further research. The dataset and code are made publicly available.

Abstract: Existing real-world datasets for multimodal automated fact-checking have
multiple limitations: they contain few instances, focus on only one or two
languages and tasks, suffer from evidence leakage, or depend on external sets
of news articles for sourcing true claims. To address these shortcomings, we
introduce M4FC, a new real-world dataset comprising 4,982 images paired with
6,980 claims. The images, verified by professional fact-checkers from 22
organizations, represent diverse cultural and geographic contexts. Each claim
is available in one or two out of ten languages. M4FC spans six multimodal
fact-checking tasks: visual claim extraction, claimant intent prediction, fake
detection, image contextualization, location verification, and verdict
prediction. We provide baseline results for all tasks and analyze how combining
intermediate tasks influence downstream verdict prediction performance. We make
our dataset and code available.

### [198] [IPQA: A Benchmark for Core Intent Identification in Personalized Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23536)
*Jieyong Kim,Maryam Amirizaniani,Soojin Yoon,Dongha Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper aims to bridge the gap in evaluating intent identification capabilities for personalized question answering (PQA) by introducing core intents derived from user behavior patterns and presenting a new benchmark and dataset (IPQA).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks fail to evaluate intent identification, which is crucial for understanding user priorities and generating contextually satisfying responses in personalized question answering.

Method: The authors propose the concept of core intents based on satisficing theory, derive them from observable user behavior, create a diverse dataset using systematic filtering and LLM-based annotations, and assess models' performance on identifying core intents in personalized contexts.

Result: State-of-the-art language models struggle to identify core intents in personalized question answering scenarios, especially as question complexity increases.

Conclusion: Developing models capable of accurate core intent identification is key for advancing personalized question answering systems, and the publicly available dataset and benchmark aim to facilitate progress in this area.

Abstract: Intent identification serves as the foundation for generating appropriate
responses in personalized question answering (PQA). However, existing
benchmarks evaluate only response quality or retrieval performance without
directly measuring intent identification capabilities. This gap is critical
because without understanding which intents users prioritize, systems cannot
generate responses satisfying individual information needs. To address this, we
introduce the concept of core intents: intents users prioritize when selecting
answers to satisfy their information needs. To evaluate these core intents, we
propose IPQA, a benchmark for core Intent identification in Personalized
Question Answering. Since users do not explicitly state their prioritized
intents, we derive core intents from observable behavior patterns in answer
selection, grounded in satisficing theory where users choose answers meeting
their acceptance thresholds. We construct a dataset with various domains
through systematic filtering, LLM-based annotation, and rigorous quality
control combining automated verification with human validation. Experimental
evaluations across state-of-the-art language models reveal that current systems
struggle with core intent identification in personalized contexts. Models fail
to identify core intents from user histories, with performance degrading as
question complexity increases. The code and dataset will be made publicly
available to facilitate future research in this direction.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces LIMRANK, which effectively adapts large language models (LLMs) for information reranking tasks using minimal data and high-quality supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the computational challenges in adapting LLMs for reranking tasks by leveraging minimal fine-tuning with superior synthetic data.

Method: Developed LIMRANK-SYNTHESIZER, a pipeline to create realistic reranking examples using synthetic data, and fine-tuned LIMRANK with less than 5% of the usual dataset size.

Result: LIMRANK achieved competitive results on challenging benchmarks (BRIGHT and FollowIR) and demonstrated strong generalization across related tasks using limited training data.

Conclusion: Minimal fine-tuning with high-quality synthetic data can effectively adapt LLMs for complex reranking tasks, offering computational efficiency and versatility.

Abstract: Existing approaches typically rely on large-scale fine-tuning to adapt LLMs
for information reranking tasks, which is computationally expensive. In this
work, we demonstrate that modern LLMs can be effectively adapted using only
minimal, high-quality supervision. To enable this, we design
LIMRANK-SYNTHESIZER, a reusable and open-source pipeline for generating
diverse, challenging, and realistic reranking examples. Using this synthetic
data, we fine-tune our reranker model, LIMRANK. We evaluate LIMRANK on two
challenging benchmarks, i.e., BRIGHT for reasoning-intensive retrieval and
FollowIR for instruction-following retrieval. Our experiments demonstrate that
LIMRANK achieves competitive performance, while being trained on less than 5%
of the data typically used in prior work. Further ablation studies demonstrate
the effectiveness of LIMRANK-SYNTHESIZER and the strong generalization
capabilities of LIMRANK across downstream tasks, including scientific
literature search and retrieval-augmented generation for knowledge-intensive
problem solving.

*Luis Ramos,Hiram Calvo,Olga Kolesnikova*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper evaluates machine learning and transformer models' performance in detecting hope speech on social media, finding superior results with transformers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study is motivated by the need to identify motivational and goal-driven expressions on social media, as such detection can foster positivity and understanding in communication.

Method: The authors employ traditional machine learning techniques (SVM, logistic regression, Naïve Bayes) and transformer models on hope speech datasets across training, development, and test sets.

Result: Traditional models achieved a macro-F1 up to 0.78, while transformer models delivered better performance with a macro-F1 of 0.79 and an accuracy of 0.80, highlighting their capability to capture subtle semantic nuances.

Conclusion: Transformers outperform traditional models in detecting hope speech, suggesting that larger models or LLMs can excel, even on small datasets.

Abstract: The identification of hope speech has become a promised NLP task, considering
the need to detect motivational expressions of agency and goal-directed
behaviour on social media platforms. This proposal evaluates traditional
machine learning models and fine-tuned transformers for a previously split hope
speech dataset as train, development and test set. On development test, a
linear-kernel SVM and logistic regression both reached a macro-F1 of 0.78; SVM
with RBF kernel reached 0.77, and Na\"ive Bayes hit 0.75. Transformer models
delivered better results, the best model achieved weighted precision of 0.82,
weighted recall of 0.80, weighted F1 of 0.79, macro F1 of 0.79, and 0.80
accuracy. These results suggest that while optimally configured traditional
machine learning models remain agile, transformer architectures detect some
subtle semantics of hope to achieve higher precision and recall in hope speech
detection, suggesting that larges transformers and LLMs could perform better in
small datasets.

*Yizhu Jiao,Jiaqi Zeng,Julien Veron Vialard,Oleksii Kuchaiev,Jiawei Han,Olivier Delalleau*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces the branch-and-rethink (BR-RM) framework, a two-stage reward modeling approach inspired by deliberate second-pass strategies for large language models, achieving state-of-the-art results in multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional reward models compress evaluation criteria into a single scalar in one pass, leading to judgment diffusion and shallow analysis. There is a need to improve focus and sensitivity in reward modeling processes.

Method: The paper proposes a two-turn reward modeling approach, BR-RM. The first turn performs adaptive branching to select instance-critical dimensions and generate evidence-based hypotheses. The second turn executes branch-conditioned reanalysis on the critical aspects. It is compatible with RLHF pipelines and relies on binary outcome rewards for training.

Result: BR-RM demonstrates improved handling of subtle and consequential errors compared to one-shot models and establishes state-of-the-art performance across three challenging reward modeling benchmarks in diverse domains.

Conclusion: Branch-and-rethink enhances reward modeling by introducing a deliberate two-pass evaluation process, reducing judgment diffusion while remaining scalable and practical. It has superior performance with strong applicability across domains.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly rely on thinking models that
externalize intermediate steps and allocate extra test-time compute, with
think-twice strategies showing that a deliberate second pass can elicit
stronger reasoning. In contrast, most reward models (RMs) still compress many
quality dimensions into a single scalar in one shot, a design that induces
judgment diffusion: attention spreads across evaluation criteria, yielding
diluted focus and shallow analysis. We introduce branch-and-rethink (BR-RM), a
two-turn RM that transfers the think-twice principle to reward modeling. Turn 1
performs adaptive branching, selecting a small set of instance-critical
dimensions (such as factuality and safety) and sketching concise,
evidence-seeking hypotheses. Turn 2 executes branch-conditioned rethinking, a
targeted reread that tests those hypotheses and scrutinizes only what matters
most. We train with GRPO-style reinforcement learning over structured two-turn
traces using a simple binary outcome reward with strict format checks, making
the approach compatible with standard RLHF pipelines. By converting
all-at-oncescoringintofocused, second-lookreasoning,
BR-RMreducesjudgmentdiffusionandimproves sensitivity to subtle yet
consequential errors while remaining practical and scalable. Experimental
results demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on
three challenging reward modeling benchmarks across diverse domains. The code
and the model will be released soon.

### [202] [Diagnosing Bottlenecks in Data Visualization Understanding by Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21740)
*Alexa R. Tartaglini,Satchel Grant,Daniel Wurgaft,Christopher Potts,Judith E. Fan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces FUGU, a dataset designed to analyze the challenges faced by vision-language models (VLMs) in understanding data visualizations. It identifies key issues with how VLMs process and transfer visual information, despite some successes in latent representation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To analyze and diagnose why current vision-language models fail on basic data visualization understanding tasks, and whether this is due to visual encoding, vision-language interaction, or language-related processing.

Method: Researchers developed FUGU, a suite of tasks targeting specific challenges in visual data understanding (e.g., data point position, distances, summary stats). Analysis was done using activation patching and linear probes across three models, diagnosing information flow and its issues.

Result: Findings reveal significant challenges in visual encoding and vision-language handoffs. Coordination errors affected models’ performance in detailed and statistical tasks, though the vision encoders sometimes correctly represented coordinates in their latent state. Fine-tuning offered limited improvements.

Conclusion: Current VLM architectures exhibit structural constraints limiting their reliability in understanding data visualizations. Addressing these issues is critical for enhancing models' interpretive capabilities in scientific and statistical contexts.

Abstract: Data visualizations are vital components of many scientific articles and news
stories. Current vision-language models (VLMs) still struggle on basic data
visualization understanding tasks, but the causes of failure remain unclear.
Are VLM failures attributable to limitations in how visual information in the
data visualization is encoded, how information is transferred between the
vision and language modules, or how information is processed within the
language module? We developed FUGU, a suite of data visualization understanding
tasks, to precisely characterize potential sources of difficulty (e.g.,
extracting the position of data points, distances between them, and other
summary statistics). We used FUGU to investigate three widely used VLMs. To
diagnose the sources of errors produced by these models, we used activation
patching and linear probes to trace information flow through models across a
variety of prompting strategies. We found that some models fail to generate the
coordinates of individual data points correctly, and these initial errors often
lead to erroneous final responses. When these models are provided with the
correct coordinates, performance improves substantially. Moreover, even when
the model generates an incorrect response, the correct coordinates can be
successfully read out from the latent representations in the vision encoder,
suggesting that the source of these errors lies in the vision-language handoff.
We further found that while providing correct coordinates helps with tasks
involving one or a small number of data points, it generally worsens
performance for tasks that require extracting statistical relationships across
many data points. Fine-tuning models on FUGU also fails to yield ceiling
performance. These findings point to architectural constraints in current VLMs
that might pose significant challenges for reliable data visualization
understanding.

### [203] [Agro-Consensus: Semantic Self-Consistency in Vision-Language Models for Crop Disease Management in Developing Countries](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21757)
*Mihir Gupta,Pratik Desai,Ross Greer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a cost-effective framework to enhance vision-language model reliability for agricultural image captioning, addressing challenges in disease management in developing countries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the need for improved agricultural disease management in countries with limited resources, unreliable internet, and constraints preventing large-scale AI deployment.

Method: It proposes a self-consistency framework using semantic clustering and a consensus mechanism supported by a lightweight pre-trained embedding model. It includes a human-in-the-loop component for accuracy enhancement.

Result: The framework improves captioning accuracy from 77.5% to 83.1% with a single cluster of consensus and reaches up to 94.0% accuracy using multiple clusters in comparison to baseline results.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates superior performance over standard methods and offers a practical solution for improving agricultural disease diagnoses efficiently.

Abstract: Agricultural disease management in developing countries such as India, Kenya,
and Nigeria faces significant challenges due to limited access to expert plant
pathologists, unreliable internet connectivity, and cost constraints that
hinder the deployment of large-scale AI systems. This work introduces a
cost-effective self-consistency framework to improve vision-language model
(VLM) reliability for agricultural image captioning. The proposed method
employs semantic clustering, using a lightweight (80MB) pre-trained embedding
model to group multiple candidate responses. It then selects the most coherent
caption -- containing a diagnosis, symptoms, analysis, treatment, and
prevention recommendations -- through a cosine similarity-based consensus. A
practical human-in-the-loop (HITL) component is incorporated, wherein user
confirmation of the crop type filters erroneous generations, ensuring
higher-quality input for the consensus mechanism. Applied to the publicly
available PlantVillage dataset using a fine-tuned 3B-parameter PaliGemma model,
our framework demonstrates improvements over standard decoding methods.
Evaluated on 800 crop disease images with up to 21 generations per image, our
single-cluster consensus method achieves a peak accuracy of 83.1% with 10
candidate generations, compared to the 77.5% baseline accuracy of greedy
decoding. The framework's effectiveness is further demonstrated when
considering multiple clusters; accuracy rises to 94.0% when a correct response
is found within any of the top four candidate clusters, outperforming the 88.5%
achieved by a top-4 selection from the baseline.

*Julien Boudier,Hugo Caselles-Dupré*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces specialized ControlNets for artistic control in text-to-image models using bounding boxes and vanishing lines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern text-to-image models lack control over spatial and geometric structure in outputs, prompting the need for improved methodologies to address these limitations.

Method: The study introduces two ControlNet systems — one utilizing bounding boxes for object positioning/scaling and another using vanishing lines for controlling scene geometry. Vision-language annotation and specialized conditioning algorithms are leveraged during training.

Result: Experiments show that the proposed modules provide effective artistic control, though they struggle with handling complex constraints.

Conclusion: The new ControlNets improve artistic control in text-to-image generation but face challenges in managing intricate scenarios.

Abstract: While modern text-to-image diffusion models generate high-fidelity images,
they offer limited control over the spatial and geometric structure of the
output. To address this, we introduce and evaluate two ControlNets specialized
for artistic control: (1) a proportion ControlNet that uses bounding boxes to
dictate the position and scale of objects, and (2) a perspective ControlNet
that employs vanishing lines to control the 3D geometry of the scene. We
support the training of these modules with data pipelines that leverage
vision-language models for annotation and specialized algorithms for
conditioning image synthesis. Our experiments demonstrate that both modules
provide effective control but exhibit limitations with complex constraints.

*Harry Zhang,Luca Carlone*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: H2OFlow is a new framework for learning comprehensive 3D human-object interaction affordances by utilizing synthetic data generated from 3D models instead of manual annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the understanding of human-object interactions and affordances in computer vision and AI, addressing the limitations of labor-intensive datasets and restricted affordance analysis.

Method: H2OFlow employs dense 3D flow representations learned via diffusion processes on point clouds, enabling it to uncover rich 3D affordances using synthetic data.

Result: Extensive evaluations show H2OFlow generalizes well to real-world objects, performing better than methods relying on manual annotation or mesh-based techniques.

Conclusion: H2OFlow eliminates the need for hand-labeled data by using synthetic 3D generative models, offering a robust alternative approach to learning 3D affordances effectively.

Abstract: Understanding how humans interact with the surrounding environment, and
specifically reasoning about object interactions and affordances, is a critical
challenge in computer vision, robotics, and AI. Current approaches often depend
on labor-intensive, hand-labeled datasets capturing real-world or simulated
human-object interaction (HOI) tasks, which are costly and time-consuming to
produce. Furthermore, most existing methods for 3D affordance understanding are
limited to contact-based analysis, neglecting other essential aspects of
human-object interactions, such as orientation (\eg, humans might have a
preferential orientation with respect certain objects, such as a TV) and
spatial occupancy (\eg, humans are more likely to occupy certain regions around
an object, like the front of a microwave rather than its back). To address
these limitations, we introduce \emph{H2OFlow}, a novel framework that
comprehensively learns 3D HOI affordances -- encompassing contact, orientation,
and spatial occupancy -- using only synthetic data generated from 3D generative
models. H2OFlow employs a dense 3D-flow-based representation, learned through a
dense diffusion process operating on point clouds. This learned flow enables
the discovery of rich 3D affordances without the need for human annotations.
Through extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations, we demonstrate that
H2OFlow generalizes effectively to real-world objects and surpasses prior
methods that rely on manual annotations or mesh-based representations in
modeling 3D affordance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Face-MakeUpV2, a facial image generation model addressing attribute leakage and improving consistency with reference images. Extensive experiments show strong performance in preserving face ID and physical characteristics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address facial attribute leakage and insufficient physical consistency in text-to-image facial generation models while responding to local semantic instructions.

Method: Face-MakeUpV2 incorporates two innovative channels: 3D facial rendering and global facial features, using a large-scale dataset FaceCaptionMask-1M and optimizing with semantic alignment and perceptual loss.

Result: Face-MakeUpV2 showed significant improvement in face ID preservation and physical consistency through extensive testing.

Conclusion: The model's practical potential makes it suitable for reliable and controllable facial editing in diverse applications.

Abstract: In facial image generation, current text-to-image models often suffer from
facial attribute leakage and insufficient physical consistency when responding
to local semantic instructions. In this study, we propose Face-MakeUpV2, a
facial image generation model that aims to maintain the consistency of face ID
and physical characteristics with the reference image. First, we constructed a
large-scale dataset FaceCaptionMask-1M comprising approximately one million
image-text-masks pairs that provide precise spatial supervision for the local
semantic instructions. Second, we employed a general text-to-image pretrained
model as the backbone and introduced two complementary facial information
injection channels: a 3D facial rendering channel to incorporate the physical
characteristics of the image and a global facial feature channel. Third, we
formulated two optimization objectives for the supervised learning of our
model: semantic alignment in the model's embedding space to mitigate the
attribute leakage problem and perceptual loss on facial images to preserve ID
consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrated that our Face-MakeUpV2 achieves
best overall performance in terms of preserving face ID and maintaining
physical consistency of the reference images. These results highlight the
practical potential of Face-MakeUpV2 for reliable and controllable facial
editing in diverse applications.

*Abdelilah Ganmati,Karim Afdel,Lahcen Koutti*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper examines the longitudinal stability of compact binary face templates, quantifying ageing drift and its implications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the ageing drift in face templates and improve the stability of face recognition systems.

Method: They used compressed float embeddings from a modern face CNN with PCA-ITQ into 64- and 128-bit codes, measured drift rates, and analyzed operational metrics like EER and TPR.

Result: For 566 identities, ageing drift measured median slopes of 1.357 bits/decade for 64-bit codes and 2.571 bits/decade for 128-bit codes. Shorter codes exhibited better age stability.

Conclusion: Drift impacts face recognition performance; mitigations, like re-enrolment and targeting unstable bits, can address these issues for deployment.

Abstract: We study the longitudinal stability of compact binary face templates and
quantify ageing drift directly in bits per decade. Float embeddings from a
modern face CNN are compressed with PCA-ITQ into 64- and 128-bit codes. For
each identity in AgeDB with at least three distinct ages, we form all genuine
pairs and fit a per-identity linear model of Hamming distance versus absolute
age gap. Across 566 identities, the median slope is 1.357 bits per decade for
64-bit templates and 2.571 bits per decade for 128-bit templates, with tight
non-parametric 95 percent bootstrap confidence intervals. The distributions are
predominantly positive, indicating a small but systematic increase in
intra-class distance over time. Because drift scales with code length, shorter
codes are inherently more age-stable at a fixed decision threshold. We connect
these slopes to operating characteristics by reporting EER and TPR at FAR = 1
percent in three age bins. We discuss implications for smart-card and
match-on-card deployments, including simple mitigations such as periodic
re-enrolment and targeted parity on empirically unstable bit positions. Code
and CSV artifacts are provided to support reproducibility.

*Bishal Chhetri,B. V. Rathish Kumar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a deep learning model that excels in breast cancer prediction and makes its decisions interpretable using SHAP and LIME.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve early detection of breast cancer by combining state-of-the-art predictive accuracy with interpretability for clinical use.

Method: The method involves developing a deep neural network using ReLU, Adam optimizer, and binary cross-entropy loss, and evaluating it against established algorithms, while employing SHAP and LIME for feature attribution.

Result: The proposed model achieved impressive accuracy (0.992), precision (1.000), recall (0.977), and F1 score (0.988), surpassing other algorithms, and demonstrated better interpretability.

Conclusion: The framework enhances both performance and interpretability, focusing on clinically meaningful features like concave points to aid diagnosis and clinician trust.

Abstract: In this study, we present an interpretable deep learning framework for the
early detection of breast cancer using quantitative features extracted from
digitized fine needle aspirate (FNA) images of breast masses. Our deep neural
network, using ReLU activations, the Adam optimizer, and a binary cross-entropy
loss, delivers state-of-the-art classification performance, achieving an
accuracy of 0.992, precision of 1.000, recall of 0.977, and an F1 score of
0.988. These results substantially exceed the benchmarks reported in the
literature. We evaluated the model under identical protocols against a suite of
well-established algorithms (logistic regression, decision trees, random
forests, stochastic gradient descent, K-nearest neighbors, and XGBoost) and
found the deep model consistently superior on the same metrics. Recognizing
that high predictive accuracy alone is insufficient for clinical adoption due
to the black-box nature of deep learning models, we incorporated model-agnostic
Explainable AI techniques such as SHAP and LIME to produce feature-level
attributions and human-readable visualizations. These explanations quantify the
contribution of each feature to individual predictions, support error analysis,
and increase clinician trust, thus bridging the gap between performance and
interpretability for real-world clinical use. The concave points feature of the
cell nuclei is found to be the most influential feature positively impacting
the classification task. This insight can be very helpful in improving the
diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer by highlighting the key
characteristics of breast tumor.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EdgeSync addresses challenges in real-time video analytics by optimizing edge-model updates, improving accuracy by approximately 3.4% over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to solve the accuracy decline of edge models in real-time video analytics due to evolving data distributions like lighting and weather changes.

Method: The proposed method, EdgeSync, uses sample filtering based on timeliness and inference results, alongside dynamic training management to improve model updates.

Result: Evaluated on complex real-world datasets, EdgeSync showed a 3.4% accuracy improvement over modern methods and approximately 10% better performance than traditional approaches.

Conclusion: EdgeSync significantly enhances video analytics performance by addressing timely and relevant model updates on edge devices.

Abstract: Real-time video analytics systems typically deploy lightweight models on edge
devices to reduce latency. However, the distribution of data features may
change over time due to various factors such as changing lighting and weather
conditions, leading to decreased model accuracy. Recent frameworks try to
address this issue by leveraging remote servers to continuously train and adapt
lightweight edge models using more complex models in the cloud. Despite these
advancements, existing methods face two key challenges: first, the retraining
process is compute-intensive, causing significant delays in model updates;
second, the new model may not align well with the evolving data distribution of
the current video stream. To address these challenges, we introduce EdgeSync,
an efficient edge-model updating approach that enhances sample filtering by
incorporating timeliness and inference results, thus ensuring training samples
are more relevant to the current video content while reducing update delays.
Additionally, EdgeSync features a dynamic training management module that
optimizes the timing and sequencing of model updates to improve their
timeliness. Evaluations on diverse and complex real-world datasets demonstrate
that EdgeSync improves accuracy by approximately 3.4% compared to existing
methods and by about 10% compared to traditional approaches.

*Emmanuel U. Ugwu,Zhang Xinming*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper evaluates Segment Anything Models (SAM2) for fire segmentation, emphasizing bounding box prompting strategies for feasibility, especially in mobile deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fire segmentation is challenging due to fire's complex visual properties, and there is limited exploration of SAM2 models in this context.

Method: The authors tested various SAM2.1 variants and mobile-oriented models using different prompting strategies across three fire datasets to identify effective segmentation techniques.

Result: Bounding box prompts proved the most effective, with Box+MP achieving the best performance (IoU: 0.64, Dice: 0.75) on the Khan dataset. MobileSAM and TinySAM optimized for edge devices.

Conclusion: This work highlights bounding box prompts' efficacy for fire segmentation and offers insights for deploying segmentation models in fire monitoring systems, while establishing benchmarks for future research.

Abstract: Fire segmentation remains a critical challenge in computer vision due to
flames' irregular boundaries, translucent edges, and highly variable
intensities. While the Segment Anything Models (SAM and SAM2) have demonstrated
impressive cross-domain generalization capabilities, their effectiveness in
fire segmentation -- particularly under mobile deployment constraints --
remains largely unexplored. This paper presents the first comprehensive
evaluation of SAM2 variants for fire segmentation, focusing on bounding box
prompting strategies to enhance deployment feasibility. We systematically
evaluate four SAM2.1 variants (tiny, small, base_plus, large) alongside
mobile-oriented variants (TinySAM, MobileSAM) across three fire datasets using
multiple prompting strategies: automatic, single positive point (SP), single
positive point + single negative point (SP+SN), multiple positive points (MP),
bounding box (Box), and hybrid variants (Box+SP and Box+MP). Our experimental
results demonstrate that bounding box prompts consistently outperform automatic
and single point-based approaches, with Box+MP achieving the highest mean IoU
(0.64) and Dice coefficient (0.75) on the Khan dataset. Lightweight variants
such as TinySAM and MobileSAM further reduce memory and computational costs,
making them more suitable for latency-tolerant edge scenarios. Overall, this
work provides critical insights for deploying promptable segmentation models in
fire monitoring systems and establishes benchmarks for future research in
domain-specific SAM applications. Code is available at:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents an efficient membership inference attack method targeting diffusion models, utilizing noise prediction patterns to determine training data membership.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address privacy risks associated with diffusion models, specifically through membership inference attacks.

Method: Inject slight noise into images under test and evaluate the aggregation degree of the predicted noise distribution to infer membership.

Result: Achieved superior performance across various datasets and demonstrates scalability in large-scale text-to-image diffusion models.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully identifies training membership with high efficiency and scalability, posing concerns for privacy in diffusion models.

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated powerful performance in generating
high-quality images. A typical example is text-to-image generator like Stable
Diffusion. However, their widespread use also poses potential privacy risks. A
key concern is membership inference attacks, which attempt to determine whether
a particular data sample was used in the model training process. We propose an
efficient membership inference attack method against diffusion models. This
method is based on the injection of slight noise and the evaluation of the
aggregation degree of the noise distribution. The intuition is that the noise
prediction patterns of diffusion models for training set samples and
non-training set samples exhibit distinguishable differences.Specifically, we
suppose that member images exhibit higher aggregation of predicted noise around
a certain time step of the diffusion process. In contrast, the predicted noises
of non-member images exhibit a more discrete characteristic around the certain
time step. Compared with other existing methods, our proposed method requires
fewer visits to the target diffusion model. We inject slight noise into the
image under test and then determine its membership by analyzing the aggregation
degree of the noise distribution predicted by the model. Empirical findings
indicate that our method achieves superior performance across multiple
datasets. At the same time, our method can also show better attack effects in
ASR and AUC when facing large-scale text-to-image diffusion models, proving the
scalability of our method.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper derives a closed-form method to quantify the uncertainty of camera pose estimates using a render-aware approach and extends to multi-camera settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pose estimation is rarely accompanied by rigorous uncertainty quantification, despite its vital role in computer vision and robotics.

Method: Linearizing image formation via pose perturbation on manifold and deriving a render-aware Cramér-Rao bound for covariance estimation.

Result: Provides a statistical foundation compatible with vision theory, allowing uncertainty fusion across multi-agent camera setups.

Conclusion: The approach facilitates uncertainty estimation in pose-related tasks (e.g., cooperative perception) without relying on explicit keypoints.

Abstract: Pose estimation is essential for many applications within computer vision and
robotics. Despite its uses, few works provide rigorous uncertainty
quantification for poses under dense or learned models. We derive a closed-form
lower bound on the covariance of camera pose estimates by treating a
differentiable renderer as a measurement function. Linearizing image formation
with respect to a small pose perturbation on the manifold yields a render-aware
Cram\'er-Rao bound. Our approach reduces to classical bundle-adjustment
uncertainty, ensuring continuity with vision theory. It also naturally extends
to multi-agent settings by fusing Fisher information across cameras. Our
statistical formulation has downstream applications for tasks such as
cooperative perception and novel view synthesis without requiring explicit
keypoint correspondences.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses the need for event prediction in videos, proposing the AVEP task and introducing the EventFormer model, along with a structured dataset for accurate video event prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding and predicting human events, primarily presented as videos rather than scripts, remains underexplored. The paper aims to address this gap by proposing a new task for richer semantic inference in video contexts.

Method: AVEP and EventFormer are introduced. AVEP involves a structured approach to video event prediction with annotated datasets. EventFormer leverages hierarchical attention to process video event relationships and coreferences.

Result: Experiments with AVEP show the complexity of video event prediction and highlight the strengths of EventFormer over other models, including SOTA video prediction models and LVLMs.

Conclusion: EventFormer demonstrates superior performance in video event prediction tasks, establishing the relevance of AVEP and the newly released dataset as a benchmark for future research.

Abstract: Script event induction, which aims to predict the subsequent event based on
the context, is a challenging task in NLP, achieving remarkable success in
practical applications. However, human events are mostly recorded and presented
in the form of videos rather than scripts, yet there is a lack of related
research in the realm of vision. To address this problem, we introduce AVEP
(Action-centric Video Event Prediction), a task that distinguishes itself from
existing video prediction tasks through its incorporation of more complex logic
and richer semantic information. We present a large structured dataset, which
consists of about $35K$ annotated videos and more than $178K$ video clips of
event, built upon existing video event datasets to support this task. The
dataset offers more fine-grained annotations, where the atomic unit is
represented as a multimodal event argument node, providing better structured
representations of video events. Due to the complexity of event structures,
traditional visual models that take patches or frames as input are not
well-suited for AVEP. We propose EventFormer, a node-graph hierarchical
attention based video event prediction model, which can capture both the
relationships between events and their arguments and the coreferencial
relationships between arguments. We conducted experiments using several SOTA
video prediction models as well as LVLMs on AVEP, demonstrating both the
complexity of the task and the value of the dataset. Our approach outperforms
all these video prediction models. We will release the dataset and code for
replicating the experiments and annotations.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a mismatch reconstruction theory to enable image reconstruction for multimode fiber imaging without requiring a measurement matrix, providing both theoretical proof and robust algorithms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional image reconstruction algorithms fail when the measurement matrix is unavailable due to unknown system configurations or fiber bending issues.

Method: Mismatch equations and matched algorithms were developed to construct a new measurement matrix, enabling reconstruction despite unknown matrices.

Result: Experiments demonstrated that the constructed matrix allows for successful image reconstruction under low noise levels, with robustness to noise and computational limitations.

Conclusion: The algorithms show robustness and address image reconstruction limitations, offering potential applications in multimode fiber imaging system challenges.

Abstract: Multimode fiber imaging requires strict matching between measurement value
and measurement matrix to achieve image reconstruction. However, in practical
applications, the measurement matrix often cannot be obtained due to unknown
system configuration or difficulty in real-time alignment after arbitrary fiber
bending, resulting in the failure of traditional reconstruction algorithms.
This paper presents a novel mismatch reconstruction theory for solving the
problem of image reconstruction when measurement matrix is unknown. We first
propose mismatch equation and design matched and calibration solution
algorithms to construct a new measurement matrix. In addition, we also provide
a detailed proof of these equations and algorithms in the appendix. The
experimental results show that under low noise levels, constructed matrix can
be used for matched pair in traditional reconstruction algorithms, and
reconstruct the original image successfully. Then, we analyze the impact of
noise, computational precision and orthogonality on reconstruction performance.
The results show that proposed algorithms have a certain degree of robustness.
Finally, we discuss the limitations and potential applications of this theory.

Result: UNet-based diffusion models excel in preserving spatial details and generating high-fidelity fused images, balancing trade-offs between inference speed and reconstruction quality.

Conclusion: UNet diffusion models are recommended for remote sensing data fusion, with practical guidance on noise scheduling and quantization strategies for efficient model deployment.

Abstract: Data fusion is an essential task in various domains, enabling the integration
of multi-source information to enhance data quality and insights. One key
application is in satellite remote sensing, where fusing multi-sensor
observations can improve spatial and temporal resolution. In this study, we
explore the design space of diffusion and flow models for data fusion, focusing
on the integration of Defense Meteorological Satellite Program's Operational
Linescan System (DMSP-OLS) and Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite
(VIIRS) nighttime lights data. Our approach leverages a diverse set of 2D
image-to-image generative models, including UNET, diffusion, and flow modeling
architectures. We evaluate the effectiveness of these architectures in
satellite remote sensing data fusion, identifying diffusion models based on
UNet as particularly adept at preserving fine-grained spatial details and
generating high-fidelity fused images. We also provide guidance on the
selection of noise schedulers in diffusion-based models, highlighting the
trade-offs between iterative solvers for faster inference and discrete
schedulers for higher-quality reconstructions. Additionally, we explore
quantization techniques to optimize memory efficiency and computational cost
without compromising performance. Our findings offer practical insights into
selecting the most effective diffusion and flow model architectures for data
fusion tasks, particularly in remote sensing applications, and provide
recommendations for leveraging noise scheduling strategies to enhance fusion
quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robust cross-modal fusion of 2D and 3D data for industrial anomaly detection remains a challenge, necessitating an innovative and effective approach.

Method: MAFR integrates RGB images and point clouds into a unified latent space using a fusion encoder and modality-specific decoders with attention-guided restoration mechanisms.

Result: MAFR achieves state-of-the-art performance on MVTec 3D-AD and Eyecandies benchmarks, with mean I-AUROC scores of 0.972 and 0.901, respectively. It performs strongly in few-shot learning and highlights the importance of fusion architecture and composite loss.

Conclusion: MAFR significantly improves robustness and accuracy for industrial anomaly detection by principled fusion of visual and geometric data.

Abstract: Industrial anomaly detection (IAD) increasingly benefits from integrating 2D
and 3D data, but robust cross-modal fusion remains challenging. We propose a
novel unsupervised framework, Multi-Modal Attention-Driven Fusion Restoration
(MAFR), which synthesises a unified latent space from RGB images and point
clouds using a shared fusion encoder, followed by attention-guided,
modality-specific decoders. Anomalies are localised by measuring reconstruction
errors between input features and their restored counterparts. Evaluations on
the MVTec 3D-AD and Eyecandies benchmarks demonstrate that MAFR achieves
state-of-the-art results, with a mean I-AUROC of 0.972 and 0.901, respectively.
The framework also exhibits strong performance in few-shot learning settings,
and ablation studies confirm the critical roles of the fusion architecture and
composite loss. MAFR offers a principled approach for fusing visual and
geometric information, advancing the robustness and accuracy of industrial
anomaly detection. Code is available at https://github.com/adabrh/MAFR

*Kejia Chen,Jiawen Zhang,Jiacong Hu,Kewei Gao,Jian Lou,Zunlei Feng,Mingli Song*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces TITA, a framework to improve Vision-Language Models (VLMs) by providing token-level feedback during inference to reduce hallucination and improve performance, all without retraining the base model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-Language Models are prone to hallucinations and misaligned outputs despite being key to multimodal intelligence. Existing methods for improving these models often demand expensive fine-tuning or provide delayed, coarse feedback.

Method: TITA operates as a lightweight framework that freezes the base Vision-Language Model and employs a reward model to estimate its distribution. During inference, implicit preference signals are captured as log-probability ratios, providing dense token-level feedback for better alignment with minimal computational cost.

Result: TITA demonstrates significant improvements in reducing hallucinations and enhancing performance across 12 benchmarks, with an 8.6% boost on MMVet and 6.7% on POPE. It also achieves comparable gains with other models in terms of hallucination reduction and VQA accuracy while imposing negligible overhead.

Conclusion: The proposed TITA framework effectively addresses the hallucination issue in Vision-Language Models by utilizing token-level inference-time feedback without retraining, proving to be efficient and broadly applicable across multiple benchmarks and models.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have become essential backbones of modern
multimodal intelligence, yet their outputs remain prone to
hallucination-plausible text misaligned with visual inputs. Existing alignment
approaches often rely on expensive fine-tuning with annotated preference data
or sequence-level inference strategies that provide only coarse, delayed
feedback. To overcome these limitations, we present TITA (Token-level
Inference-Time Alignment), a lightweight framework that freezes the base VLM
and instead trains a reward model to approximate its distribution. During
inference, implicit preference signals are extracted as log-probability ratios
between the reward model and the target VLM, yielding dense autoregressive
feedback. This formulation can be viewed as an inference-time variant of Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO), providing token-level corrective signals without
retraining the backbone. Extensive evaluations on LLaVA-1.5-7B and 13B show
consistent gains across 12 benchmarks, with improvements of 8.6% on MMVet and
6.7% on POPE, indicating stronger general understanding and reduced
hallucinations. Additional experiments on Qwen2.5-VL-7B and DeepSeek-VL2-27.5B
show comparable gains, especially in hallucination reduction and VQA accuracy,
while incurring negligible inference overhead.

*Yinbo Sun,Yuchen Fang,Zhibo Zhu,Jia Li,Yu Liu,Qiwen Deng,Jun Zhou,Hang Yu,Xingyu Lu,Lintao Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Hierarchical Interleaved Block Attention (HIBA) and Xihe, a scalable family of time series foundation models (TSFMs), achieving exceptional performance across parameter configurations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing TSFMs, inspired by language models, struggle with capturing multiscale temporal dependencies inherent in time series data, especially during zero-shot transfer across diverse datasets.

Method: The proposed method, HIBA, integrates hierarchical inter- and intra-block sparse attention to capture local and global temporal dependencies. Xihe models utilize this architecture for scalable parameter configurations.

Result: Xihe models achieve impressive zero-shot performance, with Xihe-tiny (9.5M parameters) outperforming most TSFMs and Xihe-max (1.5B parameters) setting new state-of-the-art benchmarks.

Conclusion: The HIBA architecture demonstrates exceptional generalization capabilities and scalability, significantly advancing TSFM performance in capturing multiscale dependencies.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of time series foundation models (TSFMs) has been
propelled by migrating architectures from language models. While existing TSFMs
demonstrate impressive performance, their direct adoption of cross-domain
architectures constrains effective capture of multiscale temporal dependencies
inherent to time series data. This limitation becomes particularly pronounced
during zero-shot transfer across datasets with divergent underlying patterns
and sampling strategies. To address these challenges, we propose Hierarchical
Interleaved Block Attention (HIBA) which employs hierarchical inter- and
intra-block sparse attention to effectively capture multi-scale dependencies.
Intra-block attention facilitates local information exchange, and inter-block
attention operates across blocks to capture global temporal pattern interaction
and dynamic evolution. Leveraging the HIBA architecture, we introduce Xihe, a
scalable TSFM family spanning from an ultra-efficient 9.5M parameter
configuration to high-capacity 1.5B variant. Evaluated on the comprehensive
GIFT-Eval benchmark, our most compact Xihe-tiny model (9.5M) surpasses the
majority of contemporary TSFMs, demonstrating remarkable parameter efficiency.
More impressively, Xihe-max (1.5B) establishes new state-of-the-art zero-shot
performance, surpassing previous best results by a substantial margin. This
consistent performance excellence across the entire parameter spectrum provides
compelling evidence for the exceptional generalization capabilities and
architectural superiority of HIBA.

*Juan Gutiérrez,Ángel Mora,Pablo Regodón,Silvia Rodriguez,José Luis Blanco*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores enhancing Human-in-the-Loop video annotation using AI-driven pre-annotations, resulting in reduced annotation time and consistent outputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the efficiency, accuracy, and overall quality of video annotation tasks by combining human expertise with AI assistance.

Method: Implemented a single-iteration scheme using Label Studio with AI-powered zero-shot pre-annotations and tested it on the UCF-Crime dataset for activity discrimination.

Result: Pre-annotated workflows reduced annotation time by 35% for 70% of annotators, maintained annotation quality, and improved coherence among annotators.

Conclusion: AI-based pre-annotations streamline video annotation processes, empowering annotators, optimizing workflows, and producing consistent and high-quality annotations.

Abstract: We explore the enhancement of Human-in-the-Loop video annotation by
integrating automatic capabilities to ease the task for annotators and assess
their performance. The research delves into the practical implications of the
annotation processes, the integration of AI components, and the evaluation of
its outcomes. We analyze their impact on efficiency, accuracy, and overall
annotation quality. Focusing on the Human-in-the-Loop for video annotation
tasks, we implemented a single-iteration scheme using Label Studio and
AI-powered zero-shot pre-annotations. Using this framework, we designed a test
based on the annotation of the UCF-Crime dataset to discriminate between normal
and abnormal activities in video footage. Our results evidence how automatic
AI-based pre-annotation can streamline the video annotation workflow,
empowering human annotators and optimizing the overall pipeline. Using the
pre-annotated data, we observed a 35% reduction in the annotation time for 70%
of the annotators with similar quality annotations, compared to the traditional
manual annotation task. Results are consistent with asset duration and
complexity. We also observed that while annotators rapidly learned to use the
tool, the produced annotations are more coherent among annotators and better
match the natural clustering of the video frames.

*Marouane Tliba,Mohamed Amine Kerkouri,Yassine Nasser,Nour Aburaed,Aladine Chetouani,Ulas Bagci,Rachid Jennane*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents a multimodal framework integrating anatomical graphs with radiographic features for better KOA diagnosis, achieving significant accuracy improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of standard deep learning models in capturing subtle morphological details in radiographs for KOA diagnosis.

Method: The approach uses a multimodal framework combining anatomical graphs (generated using SAM segmentation) with a vision encoder, maximizing mutual information between graph embeddings and radiographic features.

Result: The framework improves KOA classification accuracy by nearly 10% over baseline models and outperforms state-of-the-art models by 8% in accuracy and 11% in F1 score.

Conclusion: Incorporating anatomical structure into radiographic analysis significantly enhances the accuracy of KOA severity grading, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Abstract: Knee osteoarthritis (KOA) diagnosis from radiographs remains challenging due
to the subtle morphological details that standard deep learning models struggle
to capture effectively. We propose a novel multimodal framework that combines
anatomical structure with radiographic features by integrating a morphological
graph representation - derived from Segment Anything Model (SAM) segmentations
- with a vision encoder. Our approach enforces alignment between
geometry-informed graph embeddings and radiographic features through mutual
information maximization, significantly improving KOA classification accuracy.
By constructing graphs from anatomical features, we introduce explicit
morphological priors that mirror clinical assessment criteria, enriching the
feature space and enhancing the model's inductive bias. Experiments on the
Osteoarthritis Initiative dataset demonstrate that our approach surpasses
single-modality baselines by up to 10\% in accuracy (reaching nearly 80\%),
while outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods by 8\% in accuracy and
11\% in F1 score. These results underscore the critical importance of
incorporating anatomical structure into radiographic analysis for accurate KOA
severity grading.

*Pedro Cisneros-Velarde*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Using two parallel samplers for limited diffusion steps improves image quality by integrating their outputs, tested across models with consistent results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve image quality within limited denoising steps using diffusion models, exploring a novel integration method for better outcomes.

Method: Two parallel samplers denoise at successive steps, and integrate latents effectively without requiring additional fine-tuning or external tools.

Result: The proposed method enhances sample quality, proven by automated and human evaluations, while naive integration and adding more samplers yield lesser improvements.

Conclusion: Integrating outputs from two parallel samplers is simple, effective, and does not benefit further by adding more samplers.

Abstract: We consider the situation where we have a limited number of denoising steps,
i.e., of evaluations of a diffusion model. We show that two parallel processors
or samplers under such limitation can improve the quality of the sampled image.
Particularly, the two samplers make denoising steps at successive times, and
their information is appropriately integrated in the latent image. Remarkably,
our method is simple both conceptually and to implement: it is plug-&-play,
model agnostic, and does not require any additional fine-tuning or external
models. We test our method with both automated and human evaluations for
different diffusion models. We also show that a naive integration of the
information from the two samplers lowers sample quality. Finally, we find that
adding more parallel samplers does not necessarily improve sample quality.

### [223] [Frame-Difference Guided Dynamic Region Perception for CLIP Adaptation in Text-Video Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21806)
*Jiaao Yu,Mingjie Han,Tao Gong,Jian Zhang,Man Lan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces FDA-CLIP, a method improving text-video retrieval by focusing on dynamic regions and suppressing static backgrounds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for efficient and accurate text-video retrieval systems is driven by the growth in video data and challenges like high data acquisition costs and modal gaps.

Method: FDA-CLIP utilizes frame differences to create dynamic region masks with an Alpha channel, optimizing CLIP for text-video alignment by emphasizing dynamic elements.

Result: Experiments showed that FDA-CLIP improves cross-modal alignment by enhancing retrieval efficiency and accuracy.

Conclusion: Focused dynamic region encoding boosts text-video retrieval performance while addressing existing method shortcomings.

Abstract: With the rapid growth of video data, text-video retrieval technology has
become increasingly important in numerous application scenarios such as
recommendation and search. Early text-video retrieval methods suffer from two
critical drawbacks: first, they heavily rely on large-scale annotated
video-text pairs, leading to high data acquisition costs; second, there is a
significant modal gap between video and text features, which limits cross-modal
alignment accuracy. With the development of vision-language model, adapting
CLIP to video tasks has attracted great attention. However, existing adaptation
methods generally lack enhancement for dynamic video features and fail to
effectively suppress static redundant features. To address this issue, this
paper proposes FDA-CLIP (Frame Difference Alpha-CLIP), which is a concise
CLIP-based training framework for text-video alignment. Specifically, the
method uses frame differences to generate dynamic region masks, which are input
into Alpha-CLIP as an additional Alpha channel. This proactively guides the
model to focus on semantically critical dynamic regions while suppressing
static background redundancy. Experiments demonstrate that frame
difference-guided video semantic encoding can effectively balance retrieval
efficiency and accuracy.

### [224] [Activating Visual Context and Commonsense Reasoning through Masked Prediction in VLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21807)
*Jiaao Yu,Shenwei Li,Mingjie Han,Yifei Yin,Wenzheng Song,Chenghao Jia,Man Lan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents a novel approach to improve the reasoning capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs) by addressing their limitations in multimodal scenarios through introducing a fine-tuning task and evaluation benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: A significant challenge addressed is the limited adaptation of large language models to vision-language tasks due to an overemphasis on single-modal language settings and underutilization of visual context and commonsense knowledge.

Method: The paper proposes a fine-tuning task called Masked Prediction via Context and Commonsense (MPCC), requiring models to reconstruct meaningful content from occluded images using visual and commonsense reasoning. They also developed a benchmark called MPCC Eval and introduced Reinforcement Fine Tuning with Prior Sampling to guide reasoning.

Result: The new training method and task enhance model performance in reasoning, particularly in out-of-distribution (OOD) and cross-task generalization scenarios.

Conclusion: Incorporating visual context and commonsense understanding allows VLMs to achieve better generalized reasoning capabilities, paving the way for improved adaptation to diverse multimodal tasks.

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in reasoning models have markedly advanced the reasoning
capabilities of large language models, particularly via training on tasks with
verifiable rewards. Yet, a significant gap persists in their adaptation to real
world multimodal scenarios, most notably, vision language tasks, due to a heavy
focus on single modal language settings. While efforts to transplant
reinforcement learning techniques from NLP to VLMs have emerged, these
approaches often remain confined to perception centric tasks or reduce images
to textual summaries, failing to fully exploit visual context and commonsense
knowledge, ultimately constraining the generalization of reasoning capabilities
across diverse multimodal environments. To address this limitation, we
introduce a novel fine tuning task, Masked Prediction via Context and
Commonsense, which forces models to integrate visual context and commonsense
reasoning by reconstructing semantically meaningful content from occluded
images, thereby laying the foundation for generalized reasoning. To
systematically evaluate the model performance in generalized reasoning, we
developed a specialized evaluation benchmark, MPCC Eval, and employed various
fine tuning strategies to guide reasoning. Among these, we introduced an
innovative training method, Reinforcement Fine tuning with Prior Sampling,
which not only enhances model performance but also improves its generalized
reasoning capabilities in OOD and cross task scenarios.

TL;DR: This paper presents a CLIP-based framework for Domain-Adaptive Zero-Shot Learning (DAZSL) that achieves state-of-the-art performance using semantic enhancement techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficiently address the challenges in cross-domain transfer and cross-category generalization during zero-shot learning, while leveraging the potential of vision-language models like CLIP.

Method: Propose the SRE-CLIP Adapter framework, which integrates Semantic Relation Structure Loss and Cross-Modal Alignment Retention Strategy to improve knowledge transfer and alignment.

Result: The framework achieves state-of-the-art results on I2AwA and I2WebV benchmarks, surpassing current DAZSL methods.

Conclusion: Leveraging semantic relations and alignment strategies can significantly enhance the performance of vision-language models in DAZSL applications.

Abstract: The high cost of data annotation has spurred research on training deep
learning models in data-limited scenarios. Existing paradigms, however, fail to
balance cross-domain transfer and cross-category generalization, giving rise to
the demand for Domain-Adaptive Zero-Shot Learning (DAZSL). Although
vision-language models (e.g., CLIP) have inherent advantages in the DAZSL
field, current studies do not fully exploit their potential. Applying CLIP to
DAZSL faces two core challenges: inefficient cross-category knowledge transfer
due to the lack of semantic relation guidance, and degraded cross-modal
alignment during target domain fine-tuning. To address these issues, we propose
a Semantic Relation-Enhanced CLIP (SRE-CLIP) Adapter framework, integrating a
Semantic Relation Structure Loss and a Cross-Modal Alignment Retention
Strategy. As the first CLIP-based DAZSL method, SRE-CLIP achieves
state-of-the-art performance on the I2AwA and I2WebV benchmarks, significantly
outperforming existing approaches.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper explores integrating language-based action descriptions into multimodal robot navigation systems via reinforcement learning, achieving top-tier navigation performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the trade-off between explainability and performance in multimodal robot navigation, aiming for systems that are both interpretable and efficient.

Method: Incorporates action description generation into reinforcement learning as an auxiliary task using knowledge distillation from pre-trained vision-language models.

Result: The method achieves high navigation performance and state-of-the-art results in semantic audio-visual navigation tasks while also providing action descriptions.

Conclusion: The proposed approach successfully reconciles explainability and performance in robot navigation, indicating its potential for robust multimodal navigation systems.

Abstract: The field of multimodal robot navigation in indoor environments has garnered
significant attention in recent years. However, as tasks and methods become
more advanced, the action decision systems tend to become more complex and
operate as black-boxes. For a reliable system, the ability to explain or
describe its decisions is crucial; however, there tends to be a trade-off in
that explainable systems can not outperform non-explainable systems in terms of
performance. In this paper, we propose incorporating the task of describing
actions in language into the reinforcement learning of navigation as an
auxiliary task. Existing studies have found it difficult to incorporate
describing actions into reinforcement learning due to the absence of
ground-truth data. We address this issue by leveraging knowledge distillation
from pre-trained description generation models, such as vision-language models.
We comprehensively evaluate our approach across various navigation tasks,
demonstrating that it can describe actions while attaining high navigation
performance. Furthermore, it achieves state-of-the-art performance in the
particularly challenging multimodal navigation task of semantic audio-visual
navigation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a hybrid framework combining traditional feature extraction and deep learning for early, accurate Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) screening through fundus imaging.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diabetic Retinopathy is a significant concern in regions with high diabetes prevalence, such as India. Early detection is crucial as DR initially presents no symptoms.

Method: The paper integrates handcrafted clinical features with deep learning for hierarchical pattern recognition in fundus imaging, improving diagnostic precision.

Result: The hybrid model enhances DR classification while reducing false negatives, outperforming standalone deep learning methods.

Conclusion: This multimodal AI-driven approach facilitates scalable and accurate DR screening, addressing the global burden of diabetes-related vision loss.

Abstract: Diabetic Retinopathy (DR), a vision-threatening complication of Dia-betes
Mellitus (DM), is a major global concern, particularly in India, which has one
of the highest diabetic populations. Prolonged hyperglycemia damages reti-nal
microvasculature, leading to DR symptoms like microaneurysms, hemor-rhages, and
fluid leakage, which, if undetected, cause irreversible vision loss. Therefore,
early screening is crucial as DR is asymptomatic in its initial stages. Fundus
imaging aids precise diagnosis by detecting subtle retinal lesions. This paper
introduces a hybrid diagnostic framework combining traditional feature
extraction and deep learning (DL) to enhance DR detection. While handcrafted
features capture key clinical markers, DL automates hierarchical pattern
recog-nition, improving early diagnosis. The model synergizes interpretable
clinical data with learned features, surpassing standalone DL approaches that
demon-strate superior classification and reduce false negatives. This
multimodal AI-driven approach enables scalable, accurate DR screening, crucial
for diabetes-burdened regions.

Result: YOLOv11 achieved 70% higher accuracy on average compared to other models, attributed to its enhanced feature extraction, architecture optimizations, faster processing, and precise localization.

Conclusion: YOLOv11 is established as the most effective model for surface defect detection on the NEU dataset, outperforming other algorithms in accuracy and efficiency.

Abstract: This article compares the performance of six prominent object detection
algorithms, YOLOv11, RetinaNet, Fast R-CNN, YOLOv8, RT-DETR, and DETR, on the
NEU-DET surface defect detection dataset, comprising images representing
various metal surface defects, a crucial application in industrial quality
control. Each model's performance was assessed regarding detection accuracy,
speed, and robustness across different defect types such as scratches,
inclusions, and rolled-in scales. YOLOv11, a state-of-the-art real-time object
detection algorithm, demonstrated superior performance compared to the other
methods, achieving a remarkable 70% higher accuracy on average. This
improvement can be attributed to YOLOv11s enhanced feature extraction
capabilities and ability to process the entire image in a single forward pass,
making it faster and more efficient in detecting minor surface defects.
Additionally, YOLOv11's architecture optimizations, such as improved anchor box
generation and deeper convolutional layers, contributed to more precise
localization of defects. In conclusion, YOLOv11's outstanding performance in
accuracy and speed solidifies its position as the most effective model for
surface defect detection on the NEU dataset, surpassing competing algorithms by
a substantial margin.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SITS-DECO, a generative model for Earth Observation (EO) tasks, utilizing a GPT-like decoder-only architecture to simplify and unify EO data processing without task-specific adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the limitations of existing Earth Observation Foundation Models that require rigid adaptations and are tightly bound to specific data sources or training methods.

Method: The authors developed SITS-DECO, a generative model based on a GPT-style decoder-only architecture, enabling multiple supervised and self-supervised tasks via symbolic prompting and avoiding the need for task-specific adaptations.

Result: SITS-DECO demonstrated superiority in multi-temporal, multi-modal crop-type classification, outperforming larger EO foundation models on the PASTIS-R dataset, despite its simpler architecture and lack of spatial context.

Conclusion: The study highlights the significance of utilizing diverse and well-structured data for model capability over architectural complexity. SITS-DECO lays a foundation for lightweight, multi-task EO modelling with potential for future generative EO foundation models.

Abstract: Earth Observation (EO) Foundation Modelling (FM) holds great promise for
simplifying and improving the use of EO data for diverse real-world tasks.
However, most existing models require additional adaptation before they can be
used and are structured rigidly around particular data sources or training
approaches. To address this, we take inspiration from large language models,
where diverse tasks, both pre-training and downstream, are implicitly captured
through next-token prediction over unified token sequences, leveraging the
structure and diversity of the training data.
  We introduce SITS-DECO (Satellite Image Time Series-DECoder Only), a
proof-of-concept generative model that applies this unified-sequence framing to
EO data. Using a simple GPT-style decoder-only architecture, and demonstrate
its ability to perform useful EO tasks (pixel-wise, multi-temporal, multi-modal
crop-type classification) in a purely generative framework. Through symbolic
prompting, we show that the model can perform multiple supervised and
self-supervised tasks within a single unified architecture, without task- or
modality-specific adaptation. Despite its simplicity and lack of spatial
context, SITS-DECO outperforms much larger EO foundation models on crop-type
classification (PASTIS-R) demonstrating that dense temporal sequence modelling
is a critical missing ingredient in the current paradigm.
  This work exemplifies a data-centric modelling paradigm in which capability
arises from the diversity and structure of the training data rather than from
architectural complexity. SITS-DECO provides a lightweight, practical route to
multi-modal, multi-task EO modelling, and a conceptual bridge toward future
generative EO foundation models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Gestura, a system designed for free-form gesture understanding, featuring improved accuracy and speed over existing solutions by leveraging a pre-trained Vision-Language Model, anatomical priors, and reasoning strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: This research aims to overcome the limitations of predefined gesture categories and current solutions like GestureGPT in free-form gesture understanding, focusing on better recognition accuracy and response times.

Method: Gestura utilizes a Large Vision-Language Model (LVLM) for aligning gestures with semantic concepts. It also includes a Landmark Processing Module to integrate anatomical hand priors and a Chain-of-Thought reasoning strategy for deeper semantic inference.

Result: The combined techniques greatly improve the robustness and adaptability in interpreting ambiguous and free-form gestures.

Conclusion: Gestura provides a significant step forward in free-form gesture comprehension, supported by innovations in modeling and a novel dataset of over 300,000 annotated QA pairs for gesture reasoning.

Abstract: Free-form gesture understanding is highly appealing for human-computer
interaction, as it liberates users from the constraints of predefined gesture
categories. However, the sole existing solution GestureGPT suffers from limited
recognition accuracy and slow response times. In this paper, we propose
Gestura, an end-to-end system for free-form gesture understanding. Gestura
harnesses a pre-trained Large Vision-Language Model (LVLM) to align the highly
dynamic and diverse patterns of free-form gestures with high-level semantic
concepts. To better capture subtle hand movements across different styles, we
introduce a Landmark Processing Module that compensate for LVLMs' lack of
fine-grained domain knowledge by embedding anatomical hand priors. Further, a
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning strategy enables step-by-step semantic
inference, transforming shallow knowledge into deep semantic understanding and
significantly enhancing the model's ability to interpret ambiguous or
unconventional gestures. Together, these components allow Gestura to achieve
robust and adaptable free-form gesture comprehension. Additionally, we have
developed the first open-source dataset for free-form gesture intention
reasoning and understanding with over 300,000 annotated QA pairs.

Method: Analyzing 200 visualizations of women in cultural industries and 230 of museum curators, comparing generated images against specific prompt attributes such as age, attire, glasses, and paraphernalia.

Result: DALL-E3 rendered prompts correctly in most cases but had a deviation rate of 15.6%. Errors were most prevalent in depicting age, moderate for personal appearance, and lowest for paraphernalia.

Conclusion: The study highlights measurable discrepancies in prompt fidelity of DALL-E3, presenting implications for bias detection and the need for improved model evaluation frameworks.

Abstract: This study examines the prompt fidelity of ChatGPT4o / DALL-E3 text-to-image
visualisations by analysing whether attributes explicitly specified in
autogenously generated prompts are correctly rendered in the resulting images.
Using two public-domain datasets comprising 200 visualisations of women working
in the cultural and creative industries and 230 visualisations of museum
curators, the study assessed accuracy across personal attributes (age, hair),
appearance (attire, glasses), and paraphernalia (name tags, clipboards). While
correctly rendered in most cases, DALL-E3 deviated from prompt specifications
in 15.6% of all attributes (n=710). Errors were lowest for paraphernalia,
moderate for personal appearance, and highest for depictions of the person
themselves, particularly age. These findings demonstrate measurable
prompt-to-image fidelity gaps with implications for bias detection and model
evaluation.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a wavelet-based method using discrete wavelet transform (DWT) and ResNet50 to effectively identify GAN-generated images, achieving superior detection accuracy compared to spatial domain analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of identifying images generated by Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) in digital image forensics, which is crucial as GANs become increasingly sophisticated.

Method: The proposed method uses discrete wavelet transform (DWT) preprocessing (with Haar and Daubechies wavelet filters) to generate multi-resolution representations of images, which are then classified using a ResNet50 network. The performance of this method is compared with ResNet50 trained on spatial data.

Result: Models using Haar and Daubechies preprocessing achieved accuracy rates of 93.8% and 95.1%, respectively, significantly higher than the 81.5% accuracy of the spatial data model. Daubechies filters outperformed Haar filters, showcasing their higher efficacy in detection.

Conclusion: The study highlights that GAN-generated images have unique wavelet-domain artifacts, making wavelet-based analysis a highly effective tool for detecting them, and suggests further exploration in this domain for deepfake detection.

Abstract: Identifying images generated by Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) has
become a significant challenge in digital image forensics. This research
presents a wavelet-based detection method that uses discrete wavelet transform
(DWT) preprocessing and a ResNet50 classification layer to differentiate the
StyleGAN-generated images from real ones. Haar and Daubechies wavelet filters
are applied to convert the input images into multi-resolution representations,
which will then be fed to a ResNet50 network for classification, capitalizing
on subtle artifacts left by the generative process. Moreover, the wavelet-based
models are compared to an identical ResNet50 model trained on spatial data. The
Haar and Daubechies preprocessed models achieved a greater accuracy of 93.8
percent and 95.1 percent, much higher than the model developed in the spatial
domain (accuracy rate of 81.5 percent). The Daubechies-based model outperforms
Haar, showing that adding layers of descriptive frequency patterns can lead to
even greater distinguishing power. These results indicate that the
GAN-generated images have unique wavelet-domain artifacts or "fingerprints."
The method proposed illustrates the effectiveness of wavelet-domain analysis to
detect GAN images and emphasizes the potential of further developing the
capabilities of future deepfake detection systems.

diagnostics, yet the lack of interpretability in most models hampers clinical
trust and adoption. This paper presents an explainable deep learning framework
for detecting brain tumors in MRI scans and pneumonia in chest X-ray images
using two leading Convolutional Neural Networks, ResNet50 and DenseNet121.
These models were trained on publicly available Kaggle datasets comprising
7,023 brain MRI images and 5,863 chest X-ray images, achieving high
classification performance. DenseNet121 consistently outperformed ResNet50 with
94.3 percent vs. 92.5 percent accuracy for brain tumors and 89.1 percent vs.
84.4 percent accuracy for pneumonia. For better explainability,
Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) was integrated to create
heatmap visualizations superimposed on the test images, indicating the most
influential image regions in the decision-making process. Interestingly, while
both models produced accurate results, Grad-CAM showed that DenseNet121
consistently focused on core pathological regions, whereas ResNet50 sometimes
scattered attention to peripheral or non-pathological areas. Combining deep
learning and explainable AI offers a promising path toward reliable,
interpretable, and clinically useful diagnostic tools.

### [234] [Precise classification of low quality G-banded Chromosome Images by reliability metrics and data pruning classifier](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21827)
*Mojtaba Moattari*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a method to enhance chromosome classification accuracy in low-quality image settings using reliability thresholding metrics and engineered features, achieving over 90% precision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Out-reached pathological labs struggle with false positives in chromosome classification due to low-cost systems and low-quality images. This paper aims to enhance accuracy under such constraints.

Method: Reliability thresholding metrics and deliberately engineered features are integrated with deep learning techniques (e.g., Alex-Net, SVM, K Nearest Neighbors) to improve the classification of semi-straight chromosomes.

Result: The method results in a classification precision exceeding 90%, especially for chromosomes with common defects and translocations, even in low-quality datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed metrics and method are highly suitable for karyotyping tasks in budget-constrained pathological labs, providing a reliable solution to improve accuracy despite sub-optimal conditions.

Abstract: In the last decade, due to high resolution cameras and accurate meta-phase
analyzes, the accuracy of chromosome classification has improved substantially.
However, current Karyotyping systems demand large number of high quality train
data to have an adequately plausible Precision per each chromosome. Such
provision of high quality train data with accurate devices are not yet
accomplished in some out-reached pathological laboratories. To prevent false
positive detections in low-cost systems and low-quality images settings, this
paper improves the classification Precision of chromosomes using proposed
reliability thresholding metrics and deliberately engineered features. The
proposed method has been evaluated using a variation of deep Alex-Net neural
network, SVM, K Nearest-Neighbors, and their cascade pipelines to an automated
filtering of semi-straight chromosome. The classification results have highly
improved over 90% for the chromosomes with more common defections and
translocations. Furthermore, a comparative analysis over the proposed
thresholding metrics has been conducted and the best metric is bolded with its
salient characteristics. The high Precision results provided for a very
low-quality G-banding database verifies suitability of the proposed metrics and
pruning method for Karyotyping facilities in poor countries and lowbudget
pathological laboratories.

*Yichi Zhang,Zhuo Chen,Lingbing Guo,Lei Liang,Wen Zhang,Huajun Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper addresses challenges in reasoning with abstract visual information, presenting a novel data engine, training framework, and introducing the STAR-64K dataset for multi-modal relational knowledge tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge gaps in handling Multi-Modal Relational Knowledge (MMRK) and enabling structured abstractive reasoning (STAR) for visual data in multi-modal large language models.

Method: Developed an automatic STAR data engine, created the STAR-64K dataset, and introduced a two-stage training framework with tailored evaluation protocols.

Result: Experimental results showed that smaller MLLMs (3B/7B models) significantly outperformed GPT-4o in STAR tasks, demonstrating the framework's effectiveness.

Conclusion: The proposed methods and dataset enhance MLLMs' ability to reason with abstractive relational knowledge, offering insights into design effectiveness, scalability, and data transferability.

Abstract: Understanding and reasoning with abstractive information from the visual
modality presents significant challenges for current multi-modal large language
models (MLLMs). Among the various forms of abstractive information, Multi-Modal
Relational Knowledge (MMRK), which represents abstract relational structures
between multi-modal entities using node-edge formats, remains largely
under-explored. In particular, STructured and Abstractive Reasoning (STAR) on
such data has received little attention from the research community. To bridge
the dual gaps in large-scale high-quality data and capability enhancement
methodologies, this paper makes the following key contributions: (i). An
automatic STAR data engine capable of synthesizing images with MMRK to build
multi-modal instruction data with reliable chain-of-thought thinking for
various STAR tasks and (ii). A comprehsive two-stage capability enhancement
training framework, accompanied by a suite of evaluation protocols tailored to
different STAR tasks. Based upon these contributions, we introduce STAR-64K, a
dataset comprising 64K high-quality multi-modal instruction samples, and
conduct experiments across 5 open-source MLLMs. Experimental results show that
our two-stage enhancement framework enables smaller 3B/7B models to
significantly outperform GPT-4o in STAR. Additionally, we provide in-depth
analysis regarding the effectiveness of various designs, data transferability,
and scalability.

### [236] [A Flow Model with Low-Rank Transformers for Incomplete Multimodal Survival Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21829)
*Yi Yin,Yuntao Shou,Zao Dai,Yun Peng,Tao Meng,Wei Ai,Keqin Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses challenges in multimodal survival analysis caused by incomplete modality data and proposes a framework combining a low-rank Transformer and flow-based generative model to enhance prediction robustness and alignment across modalities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study is motivated by the increasing attention on multimodal medical data-based survival analysis and the limitations of real-world datasets with incomplete modality data due to acquisition issues or system failures.

Method: The proposed method involves class-specific flow for cross-modal distribution alignment to reconstruct missing modalities more consistently, alongside a low-rank Transformer architecture for intra-modal dependency modeling and reduced overfitting during modality fusion.

Result: The extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance in both complete modality settings and scenarios with incomplete modalities.

Conclusion: The framework provides robust and flexible multimodal survival prediction, resolving distributional discrepancies across modalities and ensuring reliable reconstruction of missing modality data.

Abstract: In recent years, multimodal medical data-based survival analysis has
attracted much attention. However, real-world datasets often suffer from the
problem of incomplete modality, where some patient modality information is
missing due to acquisition limitations or system failures. Existing methods
typically infer missing modalities directly from observed ones using deep
neural networks, but they often ignore the distributional discrepancy across
modalities, resulting in inconsistent and unreliable modality reconstruction.
To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework that combines a
low-rank Transformer with a flow-based generative model for robust and flexible
multimodal survival prediction. Specifically, we first formulate the concerned
problem as incomplete multimodal survival analysis using the multi-instance
representation of whole slide images (WSIs) and genomic profiles. To realize
incomplete multimodal survival analysis, we propose a class-specific flow for
cross-modal distribution alignment. Under the condition of class labels, we
model and transform the cross-modal distribution. By virtue of the reversible
structure and accurate density modeling capabilities of the normalizing flow
model, the model can effectively construct a distribution-consistent latent
space of the missing modality, thereby improving the consistency between the
reconstructed data and the true distribution. Finally, we design a lightweight
Transformer architecture to model intra-modal dependencies while alleviating
the overfitting problem in high-dimensional modality fusion by virtue of the
low-rank Transformer. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that our method
not only achieves state-of-the-art performance under complete modality
settings, but also maintains robust and superior accuracy under the incomplete
modalities scenario.

*Ngoc-Bao-Quang Nguyen,Tuan-Minh Do,Cong-Tam Phan,Thi-Thu-Hong Phan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper compares machine learning, deep learning, and hybrid methods for garbage classification and finds the hybrid approach achieves the highest accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for systematic benchmarks in automated garbage classification using different AI approaches, aiming for better waste management.

Method: Comprehensive experimentation using machine learning models, deep learning architectures (ResNet, EfficientNetV2S), and a hybrid model combining deep feature extraction with classical classifiers like SVM and Logistic Regression.

Result: The hybrid method outperforms others, achieving up to 100% accuracy on some datasets, with significantly reduced feature dimensions for faster training and inference.

Conclusion: The introduced hybrid framework achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and efficiency, making it practical for scalable waste management in constrained environments.

Abstract: Automated image-based garbage classification is a critical component of
global waste management; however, systematic benchmarks that integrate Machine
Learning (ML), Deep Learning (DL), and efficient hybrid solutions remain
underdeveloped. This study provides a comprehensive comparison of three
paradigms: (1) machine learning algorithms using handcrafted features, (2) deep
learning architectures, including ResNet variants and EfficientNetV2S, and (3)
a hybrid approach that utilizes deep models for feature extraction combined
with classical classifiers such as Support Vector Machine and Logistic
Regression to identify the most effective strategy. Experiments on three public
datasets - TrashNet, Garbage Classification, and a refined Household Garbage
Dataset (with 43 corrected mislabels)- demonstrate that the hybrid method
consistently outperforms the others, achieving up to 100% accuracy on TrashNet
and the refined Household set, and 99.87% on Garbage Classification, thereby
surpassing state-of-the-art benchmarks. Furthermore, feature selection reduces
feature dimensionality by over 95% without compromising accuracy, resulting in
faster training and inference. This work establishes more reliable benchmarks
for waste classification and introduces an efficient hybrid framework that
achieves high accuracy while reducing inference cost, making it suitable for
scalable deployment in resource-constrained environments.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study evaluates gpt-4o's ability to classify chest X-ray images as NORMAL or PNEUMONIA in zero-shot settings, finding optimal accuracy at 74% with concise prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate the potential of GPT-4o for medical image interpretation, specifically its ability to classify chest X-rays without prior fine-tuning.

Method: Used a test set of 400 balanced chest X-ray images and applied four different prompt designs to assess gpt-4o's classification performance in a zero-shot setting.

Result: Concise, feature-focused prompts delivered the highest accuracy of 74%; reasoning-oriented prompts performed worse, revealing limited diagnostic reliability in its zero-shot classification ability.

Conclusion: GPT-4o shows promise for medical image tasks but remains clinically unreliable without further improvements in visual reasoning and adaptation.

Abstract: In this study, we evaluate the ability of OpenAI's gpt-4o model to classify
chest X-ray images as either NORMAL or PNEUMONIA in a zero-shot setting,
without any prior fine-tuning. A balanced test set of 400 images (200 from each
class) was used to assess performance across four distinct prompt designs,
ranging from minimal instructions to detailed, reasoning-based prompts. The
results indicate that concise, feature-focused prompts achieved the highest
classification accuracy of 74\%, whereas reasoning-oriented prompts resulted in
lower performance. These findings highlight that while ChatGPT exhibits
emerging potential for medical image interpretation, its diagnostic reliability
remains limited. Continued advances in visual reasoning and domain-specific
adaptation are required before such models can be safely applied in clinical
practice.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper details how leveraging SSL-based video world models can enhance the physical plausibility of state-of-the-art video generative models, improving physics realism by ~6%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: State-of-the-art video generative models struggle with physical plausibility despite exhibiting visual realism. The authors aim to bridge this gap using advancements in intuitive physics understanding derived from SSL-pretrained models.

Method: The authors integrated MAGI-1, a state-of-the-art video generative model, with VJEPA-2, a recently developed SSL-based architecture, utilizing VJEPA-2 as a reward signal to guide the generation process.

Result: The physics plausibility of video generative models showed a measurable improvement of approximately 6% when VJEPA-2 was applied as a reward signal.

Conclusion: Coupling video generative models with SSL-based architectures like VJEPA-2 offers promising potential to address the challenge of limited physical understanding in video generation, enhancing both physical plausibility and realism.

Abstract: This is a short technical report describing the winning entry of the
PhysicsIQ Challenge, presented at the Perception Test Workshop at ICCV 2025.
State-of-the-art video generative models exhibit severely limited physical
understanding, and often produce implausible videos. The Physics IQ benchmark
has shown that visual realism does not imply physics understanding. Yet,
intuitive physics understanding has shown to emerge from SSL pretraining on
natural videos. In this report, we investigate whether we can leverage
SSL-based video world models to improve the physics plausibility of video
generative models. In particular, we build ontop of the state-of-the-art video
generative model MAGI-1 and couple it with the recently introduced Video Joint
Embedding Predictive Architecture 2 (VJEPA-2) to guide the generation process.
We show that by leveraging VJEPA-2 as reward signal, we can improve the physics
plausibility of state-of-the-art video generative models by ~6%.

*Marco Siino,Giuseppe Bonomo,Rosario Sorbello,Ilenia Tinnirello*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces RatioWaveNet, enhancing EEG-based BCIs decoding using a wavelet-based method for worst-case reliability improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in decoding EEG signals for BCIs due to nonstationarity, low signal-to-noise ratio, and subject variability.

Method: A novel wavelet-based front end (RDWT) is embedded in a temporal CNN-Transformer backbone to improve sensorimotor rhythm clarity and robustness.

Result: RatioWaveNet consistently improves accuracy for difficult subjects and shows average-case gains across multiple seed tests on BCI datasets (BCI-IV-2a and 2b).

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively enhances Transformer-based BCIs by improving reliability, especially for challenging cases, without significant computational overhead.

Abstract: Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) based on motor imagery (MI) translate covert
movement intentions into actionable commands, yet reliable decoding from
non-invasive EEG remains challenging due to nonstationarity, low SNR, and
subject variability. We present RatioWaveNet, which augments a strong temporal
CNN-Transformer backbone (TCFormer) with a trainable, Rationally-Dilated
Wavelet Transform (RDWT) front end. The RDWT performs an undecimated,
multi-resolution subband decomposition that preserves temporal length and
shift-invariance, enhancing sensorimotor rhythms while mitigating jitter and
mild artifacts; subbands are fused via lightweight grouped 1-D convolutions and
passed to a multi-kernel CNN for local temporal-spatial feature extraction, a
grouped-query attention encoder for long-range context, and a compact TCN head
for causal temporal integration.
  Our goal is to test whether this principled wavelet front end improves
robustness precisely where BCIs typically fail - on the hardest subjects - and
whether such gains persist on average across seeds under both intra- and
inter-subject protocols. On BCI-IV-2a and BCI-IV-2b, across five seeds,
RatioWaveNet improves worst-subject accuracy over the Transformer backbone by
+0.17 / +0.42 percentage points (Sub-Dependent / LOSO) on 2a and by +1.07 /
+2.54 percentage points on 2b, with consistent average-case gains and modest
computational overhead. These results indicate that a simple, trainable wavelet
front end is an effective plug-in to strengthen Transformer-based BCIs,
improving worst-case reliability without sacrificing efficiency.

*Michael Aerni,Joshua Swanson,Kristina Nikolić,Florian Tramèr*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper identifies a systematic dissociation in multimodal AI models, which fail in textual articulation despite accurate visual memorization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal AI models exhibit reliable visual ability but often fail to generate accurate textual descriptions, which could pose risks in AI safety frameworks.

Method: The paper used frontier models to reproduce visual tasks and examined their textual descriptions, supplemented by controlled tests on synthetic datasets across architectures.

Result: Modal aphasia emerges as a systematic characteristic of multimodal models and highlights vulnerabilities in AI safety when safeguards target only one modality.

Conclusion: Current unified multimodal models require an improved alignment across modalities as partial safeguards may lead to safety vulnerabilities.

Abstract: We present modal aphasia, a systematic dissociation in which current unified
multimodal models accurately memorize concepts visually but fail to articulate
them in writing, despite being trained on images and text simultaneously. For
one, we show that leading frontier models can generate near-perfect
reproductions of iconic movie artwork, but confuse crucial details when asked
for textual descriptions. We corroborate those findings through controlled
experiments on synthetic datasets in multiple architectures. Our experiments
confirm that modal aphasia reliably emerges as a fundamental property of
current unified multimodal models, not just as a training artifact. In
practice, modal aphasia can introduce vulnerabilities in AI safety frameworks,
as safeguards applied to one modality may leave harmful concepts accessible in
other modalities. We demonstrate this risk by showing how a model aligned
solely on text remains capable of generating unsafe images.

*Gyubeum Lim,Yemo Koo,Vijay Krishna Madisetti*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SCoPE VLM, a model for agentic tasks like GUI control and web navigation, able to navigate long context documents selectively and efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in long-context visual information understanding in vision-language models, particularly focusing on decision-oriented tasks.

Method: Proposes a Chain of Scroll mechanism for navigating documents selectively and introduces tailored reinforcement learning (Episodic Group Relative Policy Optimization).

Result: The method effectively models human-like reading behaviors, reduces memory usage, and improves multi-page document question answering.

Conclusion: SCoPE VLM enhances multimodal agents' capability by modeling agentic reading patterns and reducing computational challenges.

Abstract: Understanding long-context visual information remains a fundamental challenge
for vision-language models, particularly in agentic tasks such as GUI control
and web navigation. While web pages and GUI environments are inherently
structured documents, current VLMs typically neglect decision-oriented document
understanding in their training objectives. Existing approaches primarily
extend visual embeddings to process long, high-resolution inputs, but these
methods are memory-intensive and impractical for locally deployable solutions.
To address these issues, we propose SCoPE VLM, a document navigation expert
that leverages a novel Chain of Scroll mechanism to selectively and recursively
navigate documents, focusing exclusively on relevant segments. We introduce a
dedicated data generation pipeline to construct informative Chain of Scroll
trajectories and Episodic Group Relative Policy Optimization, a tailored
reinforcement learning method to reduce the gap between training and inference.
Our method substantially reduces memory usage and effectively models human-like
reading behaviors. To the best of our knowledge, SCoPE VLM is the first
framework to explicitly model agentic reading patterns in multi-page document
question answering, advancing the capabilities of multimodal agents.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces Poisson Flow Consistency Training (PFCT), enabling isolated training of Poisson Flow Consistency Models (PFCM) without pre-trained models, focusing on CT image denoising.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitation of PFCM requiring distillation training, thereby unlocking its potential for broader data modalities.

Method: Developed PFCT by removing the pretrained PFGM++ with a perturbation kernel, introducing the sinusoidal discretization schedule and Beta noise distribution to improve sample quality and adaptability.

Result: PFCT demonstrated effectiveness in low-dose CT image denoising, improving LPIPS and SSIM scores, and showed competitive performance to other generative models like the Consistency Model.

Conclusion: PFCT is validated as a viable training method for PFCM, expanding its flexibility and potential applications in generative modeling, though further optimization and exploration in other tasks are needed.

Abstract: The Poisson Flow Consistency Model (PFCM) is a consistency-style model based
on the robust Poisson Flow Generative Model++ (PFGM++) which has achieved
success in unconditional image generation and CT image denoising. Yet the PFCM
can only be trained in distillation which limits the potential of the PFCM in
many data modalities. The objective of this research was to create a method to
train the PFCM in isolation called Poisson Flow Consistency Training (PFCT).
The perturbation kernel was leveraged to remove the pretrained PFGM++, and the
sinusoidal discretization schedule and Beta noise distribution were introduced
in order to facilitate adaptability and improve sample quality. The model was
applied to the task of low dose computed tomography image denoising and
improved the low dose image in terms of LPIPS and SSIM. It also displayed
similar denoising effectiveness as models like the Consistency Model. PFCT is
established as a valid method of training the PFCM from its effectiveness in
denoising CT images, showing potential with competitive results to other
generative models. Further study is needed in the precise optimization of PFCT
and in its applicability to other generative modeling tasks. The framework of
PFCT creates more flexibility for the ways in which a PFCM can be created and
can be applied to the field of generative modeling.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents a three-stage hybrid framework utilizing modern detection and vision language models (VLMs) to automate the interpretation of complex 2D engineering drawings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Engineering drawings play a critical role in manufacturing communication, but interpreting their complex, multi-view layouts with dense annotations remains challenging for manual, OCR, or traditional methods.

Method: The framework employs: 1) YOLOv11-det for layout segmentation, 2) YOLOv11-obb for orientation-aware fine-grained detection, and 3) Donut-based VLMs for OCR-free semantic parsing of textual and quantitative content.

Result: Despite varied layouts, the Alphabetical VLM achieved an F1 score of 0.672, while the Numerical VLM reached 0.963, showcasing significant accuracy in annotation-level interpretation.

Conclusion: The proposed system enables scalable and accurate analysis of engineering drawings, integrating seamlessly with CAD and manufacturing databases to improve processing efficiency.

Abstract: Engineering drawings are fundamental to manufacturing communication, serving
as the primary medium for conveying design intent, tolerances, and production
details. However, interpreting complex multi-view drawings with dense
annotations remains challenging using manual methods, generic optical character
recognition (OCR) systems, or traditional deep learning approaches, due to
varied layouts, orientations, and mixed symbolic-textual content. To address
these challenges, this paper proposes a three-stage hybrid framework for the
automated interpretation of 2D multi-view engineering drawings using modern
detection and vision language models (VLMs). In the first stage, YOLOv11-det
performs layout segmentation to localize key regions such as views, title
blocks, and notes. The second stage uses YOLOv11-obb for orientation-aware,
fine-grained detection of annotations, including measures, GD&T symbols, and
surface roughness indicators. The third stage employs two Donut-based, OCR-free
VLMs for semantic content parsing: the Alphabetical VLM extracts textual and
categorical information from title blocks and notes, while the Numerical VLM
interprets quantitative data such as measures, GD&T frames, and surface
roughness. Two specialized datasets were developed to ensure robustness and
generalization: 1,000 drawings for layout detection and 1,406 for
annotation-level training. The Alphabetical VLM achieved an overall F1 score of
0.672, while the Numerical VLM reached 0.963, demonstrating strong performance
in textual and quantitative interpretation, respectively. The unified JSON
output enables seamless integration with CAD and manufacturing databases,
providing a scalable solution for intelligent engineering drawing analysis.

*Xin Lu,Chuanqing Zhuang,Chenxi Jin,Zhengda Lu,Yiqun Wang,Wu Liu,Jun Xiao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces LSF-Animation, a framework for speech-driven 3D facial animation that eliminates dependence on explicit identity and emotion labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous methods rely on manual labels for emotion and identity, limiting the adaptability and naturalness of facial animations.

Method: LSF-Animation implicitly extracts emotion from speech and identity from neutral facial meshes while introducing the Hierarchical Interaction Fusion Block (HIFB) for improved feature integration.

Result: LSF-Animation shows superior performance in emotional expressiveness, identity generalization, and animation realism on the 3DMEAD dataset.

Conclusion: The proposed method enhances generalization to unseen speakers and emotional states, improving animation realism while removing reliance on explicit labels. Source code will be provided for further use.

Abstract: Speech-driven 3D facial animation has attracted increasing interest since its
potential to generate expressive and temporally synchronized digital humans.
While recent works have begun to explore emotion-aware animation, they still
depend on explicit one-hot encodings to represent identity and emotion with
given emotion and identity labels, which limits their ability to generalize to
unseen speakers. Moreover, the emotional cues inherently present in speech are
often neglected, limiting the naturalness and adaptability of generated
animations. In this work, we propose LSF-Animation, a novel framework that
eliminates the reliance on explicit emotion and identity feature
representations. Specifically, LSF-Animation implicitly extracts emotion
information from speech and captures the identity features from a neutral
facial mesh, enabling improved generalization to unseen speakers and emotional
states without requiring manual labels. Furthermore, we introduce a
Hierarchical Interaction Fusion Block (HIFB), which employs a fusion token to
integrate dual transformer features and more effectively integrate emotional,
motion-related and identity-related cues. Extensive experiments conducted on
the 3DMEAD dataset demonstrate that our method surpasses recent
state-of-the-art approaches in terms of emotional expressiveness, identity
generalization, and animation realism. The source code will be released at:

TL;DR: The paper proposes WM-MoE, a new framework aimed at improving motion forecasting for autonomous vehicles in challenging corner-case scenarios using a world model-based approach, large language models, and specialized experts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance autonomous vehicle safety by addressing the underperformance of existing motion forecasting models in rare and critical corner-case scenarios, which arise from biased training data and limited generalization.

Method: WM-MoE integrates perception, temporal memory, and decision-making within a unified world model-based framework. It employs large language models for enriched temporal context, a temporal tokenizer for mapping trajectories, and a mixture-of-experts approach for addressing scenario complexity. A new benchmark dataset, nuScenes-corner, is also introduced.

Result: WM-MoE outperformed state-of-the-art motion forecasting baselines across various datasets, showing robustness in corner-case scenarios and handling missing data effectively.

Conclusion: WM-MoE demonstrates the promise and capability of world model-based architectures for achieving accurate, reliable, and generalizable motion forecasting in autonomous vehicles in critical safety scenarios.

Abstract: Accurate and reliable motion forecasting is essential for the safe deployment
of autonomous vehicles (AVs), particularly in rare but safety-critical
scenarios known as corner cases. Existing models often underperform in these
situations due to an over-representation of common scenes in training data and
limited generalization capabilities. To address this limitation, we present
WM-MoE, the first world model-based motion forecasting framework that unifies
perception, temporal memory, and decision making to address the challenges of
high-risk corner-case scenarios. The model constructs a compact scene
representation that explains current observations, anticipates future dynamics,
and evaluates the outcomes of potential actions. To enhance long-horizon
reasoning, we leverage large language models (LLMs) and introduce a lightweight
temporal tokenizer that maps agent trajectories and contextual cues into the
LLM's feature space without additional training, enriching temporal context and
commonsense priors. Furthermore, a mixture-of-experts (MoE) is introduced to
decompose complex corner cases into subproblems and allocate capacity across
scenario types, and a router assigns scenes to specialized experts that infer
agent intent and perform counterfactual rollouts. In addition, we introduce
nuScenes-corner, a new benchmark that comprises four real-world corner-case
scenarios for rigorous evaluation. Extensive experiments on four benchmark
datasets (nuScenes, NGSIM, HighD, and MoCAD) showcase that WM-MoE consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines and remains robust under
corner-case and data-missing conditions, indicating the promise of world
model-based architectures for robust and generalizable motion forecasting in
fully AVs.

Motivation: The study seeks to address challenges in accurately assessing urban canopy coverage, crucial for urban planning and combating climate change.

Method: The methodology incorporates deep learning-based object image analysis applied to high-resolution drone images, processed on a cloud platform with high-performance processors.

Result: Results validate the approach's accuracy in estimating city-scale canopy coverage, aiding urban forestry management and environmental analysis.

Conclusion: The proposed method enhances urban planning by enabling efficient analysis, tree plantation optimization, and potential carbon sequestration assessments for promoting greener cities.

Abstract: Accurate assessment of urban canopy coverage is crucial for informed urban

methodology utilizes object-based image analysis, based on deep learning
algorithms to accurately identify and segment green canopies from
high-resolution drone images. This approach allows the user for detailed
analysis of urban vegetation, capturing variations in canopy density and
understanding spatial distribution. To overcome the computational challenges
associated with processing large datasets, it was implemented over a cloud
platform utilizing high-performance processors. This infrastructure efficiently
manages space complexity and ensures affordable latency, enabling the rapid
analysis of vast amounts of drone imageries. Our results demonstrate the
effectiveness of this approach in accurately estimating canopy coverage at the
city scale, providing valuable insights for urban forestry management of an
industrial township. The resultant data generated by this method can be used to
optimize tree plantation and assess the carbon sequestration potential of urban
forests. By integrating these insights into sustainable urban planning, we can
foster more resilient urban environments, contributing to a greener and
healthier future.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the computational efficiency and resource accessibility of large multimodal models like CLIP, particularly in resource-constrained environments.

Method: TernaryCLIP employs quantization-aware training and distillation modules to convert connection weights of both vision and text encoders into ternary representation, maintaining high performance while achieving significant compression, acceleration, and optimization.

Result: TernaryCLIP achieves 99% ternarized weights with a 1.58-bit representation, 16.98x compression ratio, 2.3x inference acceleration, 16x storage reduction, 10x memory optimization, and 60% sparsity, while maintaining excellent performance on multiple datasets for image and text tasks.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the practicality of extreme quantization for large multimodal models like CLIP, enabling their effective use in resource-limited scenarios while retaining high performance.

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed an increasing interest in image-text contrastive
modeling, exemplified by models such as Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining
(CLIP). In this paper, we propose the TernaryCLIP, a lightweight computational
framework that converts connection weights of both vision and text encoders of
CLIP into the ternary format, instead of full-precision or floating ones.
TernaryCLIP incorporates quantization-aware training and distillation modules,
preventing precision degradation and enabling low-cost and high-efficiency
computations. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that TernaryCLIP can
achieve up to 99\% ternarized weights with 1.58-bit representation, 16.98
$\times$ compression ratio, 2.3 $\times$ inference acceleration, 16 $\times$
storage reduction, 10 $\times$ memory optimization, and 60\% sparsity while
maintaining promising performance on zero-shot image classification and
image-text retrieval tasks across 41 commonly used datasets. Our work
highlights the feasibility of extreme quantization for large multimodal models,
supporting effective and efficient deployment on resource-constrained devices.

*Dogyun Park,Moayed Haji-Ali,Yanyu Li,Willi Menapace,Sergey Tulyakov,Hyunwoo J. Kim,Aliaksandr Siarohin,Anil Kag*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SPRINT introduces sparse-dense residual fusion for Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) to enable efficient training with substantial token dropping, achieving significant computational savings while maintaining quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the high computational cost of training DiTs due to their quadratic cost with sequence length, making large-scale pretraining expensive.

Method: SPRINT proposes a strategy combining sparse-dense residual fusion. Early layers process dense tokens, deeper ones focus on sparse subsets, and outputs are fused through residual connections. Training involves masked pretraining followed by full-token fine-tuning.

Result: SPRINT offers 9.8x training savings with similar FID/FDD quality on ImageNet-1K (256x256). Additionally, during inference, Path-Drop Guidance (PDG) reduces FLOPs by half while improving generative quality.

Conclusion: SPRINT is proven as an efficient and effective method for improving DiT training and inference, supporting aggressive token reduction without compromising output quality.

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) deliver state-of-the-art generative performance
but their quadratic training cost with sequence length makes large-scale
pretraining prohibitively expensive. Token dropping can reduce training cost,
yet na\"ive strategies degrade representations, and existing methods are either
parameter-heavy or fail at high drop ratios. We present SPRINT, Sparse--Dense
Residual Fusion for Efficient Diffusion Transformers, a simple method that
enables aggressive token dropping (up to 75%) while preserving quality. SPRINT
leverages the complementary roles of shallow and deep layers: early layers
process all tokens to capture local detail, deeper layers operate on a sparse
subset to cut computation, and their outputs are fused through residual
connections. Training follows a two-stage schedule: long masked pre-training
for efficiency followed by short full-token fine-tuning to close the
train--inference gap. On ImageNet-1K 256x256, SPRINT achieves 9.8x training
savings with comparable FID/FDD, and at inference, its Path-Drop Guidance (PDG)
nearly halves FLOPs while improving quality. These results establish SPRINT as
a simple, effective, and general solution for efficient DiT training.

TL;DR: Lite-Diff introduces lightweight layers to adapt pre-trained diffusion models for domain-specific tasks, like medical imaging, with reduced computational cost and improved performance in low-data settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in domain-specific adaptation of diffusion models, such as limited data and high computational cost for full model fine-tuning.

Method: Lite-Diff employs lightweight adaptation layers integrated into a frozen diffusion U-Net, coupled with a latent morphological autoencoder and pixel-level discriminator.

Result: Lite-Diff demonstrates superior adaptation efficiency and performance on three chest X-ray datasets, outperforming full fine-tuning approaches in low-data scenarios.

Conclusion: The framework offers an efficient transfer learning method for adapting diffusion models to specialized domains, making them viable for deployment in low-data environments.

Abstract: In recent years, diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable success in
high-fidelity image synthesis. However, fine-tuning these models for
specialized domains, such as medical imaging, remains challenging due to
limited domain-specific data and the high computational cost of full model
adaptation. In this paper, we introduce Lite-Diff (Lightweight Diffusion Model
Adaptation), a novel finetuning approach that integrates lightweight adaptation
layers into a frozen diffusion U-Net while enhancing training with a latent
morphological autoencoder (for domain-specific latent consistency) and a pixel
level discriminator(for adversarial alignment). By freezing weights of the base
model and optimizing only small residual adapter modules, LiteDiff
significantly reduces the computational overhead and mitigates overfitting,
even in minimal-data settings. Additionally, we conduct ablation studies to
analyze the effects of selectively integrating adaptation layers in different
U-Net blocks, revealing an optimal balance between efficiency and performance.
Experiments on three chest X-ray datasets - (1) Kaggle Chest X-Ray Pneumonia,
(2) NIH Chest X-ray14 and (3) VinBigData Chest X_ray demonstrate that LiteDiff
achieves superior adaptation efficiency compared to naive full fine-tuning. Our
framework provides a promising direction for transfer learning in diffusion
models, facilitating their deployment in diverse low data domains.

### [252] [FlowOpt: Fast Optimization Through Whole Flow Processes for Training-Free Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22010)
*Or Ronai,Vladimir Kulikov,Tomer Michaeli*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FlowOpt is a zero-order optimization framework for controlled generation tasks using diffusion and flow-matching models. It provides efficient optimization without backpropagation, yielding state-of-the-art results in image editing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Controlled generation tasks often require computationally impractical gradient-based methods due to the iterative sampling processes in diffusion and flow-matching models. FlowOpt aims to simplify and optimize this process.

Method: FlowOpt employs a zero-order optimization framework to treat the sampling process as a black box, enabling optimization through the entire sampling path. It ensures global convergence under calculated step-size constraints.

Result: FlowOpt achieves state-of-the-art results in image editing tasks, including inversion and similarity-based editing, with competitive efficiency in neural function evaluations compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: FlowOpt offers a novel and efficient approach for optimizing generation tasks, proving effective and practical for image editing without requiring traditional backpropagation methods.

Abstract: The remarkable success of diffusion and flow-matching models has ignited a
surge of works on adapting them at test time for controlled generation tasks.
Examples range from image editing to restoration, compression and
personalization. However, due to the iterative nature of the sampling process
in those models, it is computationally impractical to use gradient-based
optimization to directly control the image generated at the end of the process.
As a result, existing methods typically resort to manipulating each timestep
separately. Here we introduce FlowOpt - a zero-order (gradient-free)
optimization framework that treats the entire flow process as a black box,
enabling optimization through the whole sampling path without backpropagation
through the model. Our method is both highly efficient and allows users to
monitor the intermediate optimization results and perform early stopping if
desired. We prove a sufficient condition on FlowOpt's step-size, under which
convergence to the global optimum is guaranteed. We further show how to
empirically estimate this upper bound so as to choose an appropriate step-size.
We demonstrate how FlowOpt can be used for image editing, showcasing two
options: (i) inversion (determining the initial noise that generates a given
image), and (ii) directly steering the edited image to be similar to the source
image while conforming to a target text prompt. In both cases, FlowOpt achieves
state-of-the-art results while using roughly the same number of neural function
evaluations (NFEs) as existing methods. Code and examples are available on the
project's webpage.

Conclusion: The study provides a promising solution for real-time sign language translation, offering potential applications in healthcare, education, and public services.

Abstract: Sign languages play a crucial role in the communication of deaf communities,
but they are often marginalized, limiting access to essential services such as
healthcare and education. This study proposes an automatic sign language
recognition system based on a hybrid CNN-LSTM architecture, using Mediapipe for
gesture keypoint extraction. Developed with Python, TensorFlow and Streamlit,
the system provides real-time gesture translation. The results show an average
accuracy of 92\%, with very good performance for distinct gestures such as
``Hello'' and ``Thank you''. However, some confusions remain for visually
similar gestures, such as ``Call'' and ``Yes''. This work opens up interesting
perspectives for applications in various fields such as healthcare, education
and public services.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents a caption-based explainable AI (XAI) method for improving robustness in machine learning models by using a novel integration of a standalone model with the CLIP model to identify dominant predictive concepts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the critical issue of robustness in machine learning models, which is often hindered by spurious and misleading features, and to enhance interpretability through explainable AI methods that minimize risks like covariate shifts.

Method: The paper proposes a novel caption-based XAI method that uses network surgery to integrate a standalone ML model into the CLIP model, enabling the generation of dominant concept-based explanations.

Result: The new method produces explanations that reduce the risk of the standalone model being misled by spurious features, encouraging better robustness in ML models.

Conclusion: The novel caption-based XAI approach improves the interpretability and robustness of machine learning models by addressing issues such as spurious correlations, thus advancing the development of more reliable AI systems.

Abstract: Robustness has become one of the most critical problems in machine learning
(ML). The science of interpreting ML models to understand their behavior and
improve their robustness is referred to as explainable artificial intelligence
(XAI). One of the state-of-the-art XAI methods for computer vision problems is
to generate saliency maps. A saliency map highlights the pixel space of an
image that excites the ML model the most. However, this property could be
misleading if spurious and salient features are present in overlapping pixel
spaces. In this paper, we propose a caption-based XAI method, which integrates
a standalone model to be explained into the contrastive language-image
pre-training (CLIP) model using a novel network surgery approach. The resulting
caption-based XAI model identifies the dominant concept that contributes the
most to the models prediction. This explanation minimizes the risk of the
standalone model falling for a covariate shift and contributes significantly
towards developing robust ML models.

*Hyeonsu Kang,Emily Bao,Anjan Goswami*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper examines Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in the context of slide evaluation and introduces the VLM-SlideEval framework to test their capabilities concerning element extraction, robustness to design changes, and narrative structure comprehension.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the gap in slide-specific understanding of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) despite their increasing adoption as evaluators in automation pipelines.

Method: The study introduces the VLM-SlideEval framework, evaluating VLMs on element-level alignment, robustness to slide variations, and higher-order narrative comprehension using publicly available slide datasets processed into a standardized schema.

Result: VLMs showed limitations in pixel-accurate element extraction, decent performance on singular slide understanding, and difficulties in capturing multi-slide narrative structures, especially under controlled perturbations.

Conclusion: Current VLMs have significant limitations in slide evaluation, highlighting a need for improved, calibrated evaluation processes to advance their usefulness in agentic systems.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) are increasingly used to evaluate multimodal
content, including presentation slides, yet their slide-specific understanding
remains underexplored {despite their growing role as critics in agentic,
model-forward pipelines}. We introduce VLM-SlideEval, an evaluation framework
that probes VLMs along three axes: (1) element-level extraction from slide
images aligned to ground truth; (2) robustness to controlled perturbations in
geometry, style, and text; and (3) higher-level comprehension, such as
recovering a deck's narrative order from shuffled slides. Using publicly
available decks from Zenodo
(https://huggingface.co/datasets/Forceless/Zenodo10K/viewer/default/pptx), we
standardize ground-truth element metadata from PowerPoint XML and live
renderings into a unified, verifiable schema. Empirically, VLMs underperform on
pixel-accurate extraction and show non-trivial agreement, fidelity, and
consistency under controlled perturbations, while performing better on
single-slide content understanding; however, they do not reliably capture
narrative structure across slides. These results highlight the limits of
current VLMs for slide evaluation and motivate calibrated, critic-in-the-loop
evaluators that drive iterative refinement and selection in agentic pipelines.

TL;DR: The study introduces a robust deep learning framework enhancing anomaly detection in surveillance videos through human-centric preprocessing and spatio-temporal modeling, achieving 92.41% accuracy in multi-class classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Anomaly detection in surveillance videos is challenging due to diverse abnormal events, class imbalance, and scene-dependent clutter. This paper aims to address these issues.

Method: The method integrates YOLO-World for detecting human instances, ByteTrack for identity-aware tracking, Gaussian blur for suppressing background distractions, InceptionV3 for spatial features extraction, and BiLSTM for temporal modeling.

Result: On the five-class subset of UCF-Crime dataset, the framework demonstrates 92.41% accuracy and per-class F1-scores above 0.85 across trials, showcasing robust anomaly discrimination.

Conclusion: Foreground-focused preprocessing significantly improves anomaly detection and generalization in real-world surveillance scenarios.

Abstract: Anomaly detection in surveillance videos remains a challenging task due to
the diversity of abnormal events, class imbalance, and scene-dependent visual
clutter. To address these issues, we propose a robust deep learning framework
that integrates human-centric preprocessing with spatio-temporal modeling for
multi-class anomaly classification. Our pipeline begins by applying YOLO-World
- an open-vocabulary vision-language detector - to identify human instances in
raw video clips, followed by ByteTrack for consistent identity-aware tracking.
Background regions outside detected bounding boxes are suppressed via Gaussian
blurring, effectively reducing scene-specific distractions and focusing the
model on behaviorally relevant foreground content. The refined frames are then
processed by an ImageNet-pretrained InceptionV3 network for spatial feature
extraction, and temporal dynamics are captured using a bidirectional LSTM
(BiLSTM) for sequence-level classification. Evaluated on a five-class subset of
the UCF-Crime dataset (Normal, Burglary, Fighting, Arson, Explosion), our
method achieves a mean test accuracy of 92.41% across three independent trials,
with per-class F1-scores consistently exceeding 0.85. Comprehensive evaluation
metrics - including confusion matrices, ROC curves, and macro/weighted averages
- demonstrate strong generalization and resilience to class imbalance. The
results confirm that foreground-focused preprocessing significantly enhances
anomaly discrimination in real-world surveillance scenarios.

*Zheng Qi,Chao Shang,Evangelia Spiliopoulou,Nikolaos Pappas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces GIFT, a method to reduce hallucination in vision language models by leveraging gaze shifts for balancing attention on visual and textual inputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the hallucination issue in vision language models, which stems from over-reliance on linguistic priors and inadequate attention allocation to relevant visual and user query inputs.

Method: Proposes GIFT, using a visual saliency map based on gaze shifts to adjust attention to relevant visual information and user queries during decoding.

Result: GIFT reduces hallucination in vision language models across tasks, achieving up to 20.7% improvement on decoding, while keeping computational overhead low.

Conclusion: GIFT effectively balances cross-modal fusion in vision language models, mitigating hallucination and maintaining robust vision-language performance.

Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) often generate hallucination, i.e., content
that cannot be substantiated by either textual or visual inputs. Prior work
primarily attributes this to over-reliance on linguistic prior knowledge rather
than visual inputs. Some methods attempt to mitigate hallucination by
amplifying visual token attention proportionally to their attention scores.
However, these methods overlook the visual attention sink problem, where
attention is frequently misallocated to task-irrelevant visual regions, and
neglect cross-modal fusion balance by enhancing only visual attention without
adjusting attention to the user query. This can result in amplifying incorrect
areas while failing to properly interpret the user query. To address these
challenges, we propose a simple yet effective method called Gaze Shift-Guided
Cross-modal Fusion Enhancement (GIFT). GIFT pre-computes a holistic visual
saliency map by tracking positive changes in visual attention, or "gaze
shifts", during user query comprehension, and leverages this map to amplify
attention to both salient visual information and the user query at each
decoding step. This reduces the impact of visual attention sink, as irrelevant
tokens exhibit minimal shifts, while ensuring balanced cross-modal fusion for
well-integrated representation. Extensive experiments show that GIFT
effectively mitigates hallucination in VLMs across both generative and
classification tasks, achieving up to 20.7% improvement over greedy decoding,
while maintaining general vision-language performance with low computational
overhead.

*Luca Caldera,Lara Cavinato,Francesca Ieva*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel framework for harmonizing 3D T1-weighted brain MRI across different scanners and sites, improving cross-site consistency and downstream analysis performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MRI variability hinders consistent analysis across multicenter neuroimaging studies; addressing this helps improve generalizability and analysis consistency.

Method: The framework uses image-based harmonization by disentangling anatomical content from scanner/site variations. A differentiable loss based on SSIM is used, allowing separate evaluation of image components.

Result: Harmonized images showed high alignment across acquisition settings, maintained anatomical fidelity, and improved downstream tasks like brain age prediction and Alzheimer's classification.

Conclusion: The framework enhances cross-site consistency, maintains anatomical fidelity, and improves downstream model performance, making it robust for multicenter neuroimaging studies.

Abstract: The variability introduced by differences in MRI scanner models, acquisition
protocols, and imaging sites hinders consistent analysis and generalizability
across multicenter studies. We present a novel image-based harmonization
framework for 3D T1-weighted brain MRI, which disentangles anatomical content
from scanner- and site-specific variations. The model incorporates a
differentiable loss based on the Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) to preserve
biologically meaningful features while reducing inter-site variability. This
loss enables separate evaluation of image luminance, contrast, and structural
components. Training and validation were performed on multiple publicly
available datasets spanning diverse scanners and sites, with testing on both
healthy and clinical populations. Harmonization using multiple style targets,
including style-agnostic references, produced consistent and high-quality
outputs. Visual comparisons, voxel intensity distributions, and SSIM-based
metrics demonstrated that harmonized images achieved strong alignment across
acquisition settings while maintaining anatomical fidelity. Following
harmonization, structural SSIM reached 0.97, luminance SSIM ranged from 0.98 to
0.99, and Wasserstein distances between mean voxel intensity distributions
decreased substantially. Downstream tasks showed substantial improvements: mean
absolute error for brain age prediction decreased from 5.36 to 3.30 years, and
Alzheimer's disease classification AUC increased from 0.78 to 0.85. Overall,
our framework enhances cross-site image consistency, preserves anatomical
fidelity, and improves downstream model performance, providing a robust and
generalizable solution for large-scale multicenter neuroimaging studies.

### [259] [Mitigating Coordinate Prediction Bias from Positional Encoding Failures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22102)
*Xingjian Tao,Yiwei Wang,Yujun Cai,Yihong Luo,Jing Tang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper highlights the challenges faced by multimodal large language models (MLLMs) in precise coordinate prediction due to issues with high-resolution inputs and visual positional encodings. It proposes a training-free method called Vision-PE Shuffle Guidance (VPSG) to mitigate these issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs excel in vision-language tasks but struggle with spatial reasoning and precise coordinate prediction due to weak positional encodings, which are worsened by high-resolution inputs.

Method: The proposed method, Vision-PE Shuffle Guidance (VPSG), is a test-time approach that uses auxiliary decoding with shuffled visual positional encodings (VPEs) to identify and correct positional biases while preserving coordinate format.

Result: Experiments on the ScreenSpot-Pro dataset show that VPSG reliably improves positional encoding robustness and spatial reasoning accuracy in MLLMs.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that positional encoding limitations are a key bottleneck in accurate coordinate prediction for MLLMs, and strategies addressing these weaknesses, like VPSG, are critical for enhancing their spatial reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) excel at vision-language tasks such
as VQA and document understanding, yet precise coordinate prediction remains
challenging. High-resolution inputs exacerbate this difficulty by producing
long token sequences that weaken positional encodings and introduce directional
biases in coordinate outputs. We investigate this phenomenon by analyzing how
MLLMs behave when visual positional encodings (VPEs) are deliberately perturbed
through shuffling. Our analysis reveals that such perturbations induce
predictable, non-random coordinate biases rather than random errors, suggesting
that models rely on internal positional priors when spatial grounding signals
are degraded. Crucially, we observe similar directional error patterns in
natural high-resolution datasets, indicating that positional encoding failures
are a key bottleneck for accurate coordinate prediction at scale. To address
this issue, we propose Vision-PE Shuffle Guidance (VPSG), a training-free
test-time method that leverages the directional nature of these biases for
correction. VPSG runs auxiliary decoding with shuffled VPEs to isolate
position-unconditioned tendencies, then uses this as negative evidence to guide
digit prediction while preserving coordinate format through a lightweight
finite-state machine. Experiments on ScreenSpot-Pro demonstrate reliable
improvements, highlighting positional encoding robustness as a critical factor
for spatial reasoning in MLLMs.

*Bailey Trang,Parham Saremi,Alan Q. Wang,Fangrui Huang,Zahra TehraniNasab,Amar Kumar,Tal Arbel,Li Fei-Fei,Ehsan Adeli*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Rainbow is proposed as a new method to enhance diversity in conditional and prompt-based image generation by addressing condition uncertainty and utilizing latent graph representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods struggle to produce diverse outputs due to their reliance on random seeds or limited diversity through prompt modifications. Addressing this challenge is important for better capturing condition uncertainty.

Method: Rainbow introduces a framework that employs latent graph representations, parameterized by GFlowNets, to decompose conditions into diverse latent aspects. It uses advanced graph sampling to generate multiple diverse trajectories that lead to varied and plausible images.

Result: Rainbow improves diversity and fidelity in image synthesis, generation, and counterfactual tasks on both natural and medical image datasets.

Conclusion: Rainbow successfully offers a generalizable approach for creating diverse and high-quality images by resolving condition uncertainty and leveraging innovative latent representations.

Abstract: Capturing diversity is crucial in conditional and prompt-based image
generation, particularly when conditions contain uncertainty that can lead to
multiple plausible outputs. To generate diverse images reflecting this
diversity, traditional methods often modify random seeds, making it difficult
to discern meaningful differences between samples, or diversify the input
prompt, which is limited in verbally interpretable diversity. We propose
Rainbow, a novel conditional image generation framework, applicable to any
pretrained conditional generative model, that addresses inherent
condition/prompt uncertainty and generates diverse plausible images. Rainbow is
based on a simple yet effective idea: decomposing the input condition into
diverse latent representations, each capturing an aspect of the uncertainty and
generating a distinct image. First, we integrate a latent graph, parameterized
by Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets), into the prompt representation
computation. Second, leveraging GFlowNets' advanced graph sampling capabilities
to capture uncertainty and output diverse trajectories over the graph, we
produce multiple trajectories that collectively represent the input condition,
leading to diverse condition representations and corresponding output images.
Evaluations on natural image and medical image datasets demonstrate Rainbow's
improvement in both diversity and fidelity across image synthesis, image
generation, and counterfactual generation tasks.

*Karim Elmaaroufi,Liheng Lai,Justin Svegliato,Yutong Bai,Sanjit A. Seshia,Matei Zaharia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces GRAID, a new framework to improve spatial reasoning in Vision Language Models (VLMs) using 2D geometric primitives instead of 3D reconstruction or caption-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Vision Language Models struggle with spatial reasoning tasks due to issues like errors in 3D reconstruction and generative hallucinations.

Method: The authors use 2D bounding boxes from standard object detectors to derive spatial relationships, avoiding the pitfalls associated with 3D reconstruction and overly detailed caption-based methods.

Result: The dataset generated using GRAID achieves a 91.16% human validation rate, outperforming previous datasets with 57.6%. Models trained on GRAID data exhibited significant improvements in spatial reasoning concepts and multiple benchmarks.

Conclusion: GRAID demonstrates that focusing on 2D spatial relationships results in higher-quality datasets and better model performance on spatial reasoning tasks, with generalization to new question types and benchmarks.

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) achieve strong performance on many
vision-language tasks but often struggle with spatial reasoning\textemdash{}a
prerequisite for many applications. Empirically, we find that a dataset
produced by a current training data generation pipeline has a 57.6\% human
validation rate. These rates stem from current limitations: single-image 3D
reconstruction introduces cascading modeling errors and requires wide answer
tolerances, while caption-based methods require hyper-detailed annotations and
suffer from generative hallucinations. We present GRAID, built on the key
insight that qualitative spatial relationships can be reliably determined from
2D geometric primitives alone. By operating exclusively on 2D bounding boxes
from standard object detectors, GRAID avoids both 3D reconstruction errors and
generative hallucinations, resulting in datasets that are of higher quality

### [262] [CogStereo: Neural Stereo Matching with Implicit Spatial Cognition Embedding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22119)
*Lihuang Fang,Xiao Hu,Yuchen Zou,Hong Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CogStereo introduces a cognition-driven approach for stereo matching that achieves zero-shot generalization without relying on dataset-specific priors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of deep stereo matching in zero-shot generalization, which lags behind other vision tasks' foundation models.

Method: CogStereo embeds spatial cognition using monocular depth features, introducing a dual-conditional refinement mechanism to ensure consistent global correction and structurally coherent disparity estimation.

Result: CogStereo achieves state-of-the-art results and excels in cross-domain generalization on datasets like Scene Flow, KITTI, Middlebury, ETH3D, EuRoc, and real-world scenarios.

Conclusion: CogStereo advances stereo vision by embedding cognition-driven approaches, enabling improved generalization and refinement in challenging regions.

Abstract: Deep stereo matching has advanced significantly on benchmark datasets through
fine-tuning but falls short of the zero-shot generalization seen in foundation
models in other vision tasks. We introduce CogStereo, a novel framework that
addresses challenging regions, such as occlusions or weak textures, without
relying on dataset-specific priors. CogStereo embeds implicit spatial cognition
into the refinement process by using monocular depth features as priors,
capturing holistic scene understanding beyond local correspondences. This
approach ensures structurally coherent disparity estimation, even in areas
where geometry alone is inadequate. CogStereo employs a dual-conditional
refinement mechanism that combines pixel-wise uncertainty with cognition-guided
features for consistent global correction of mismatches. Extensive experiments
on Scene Flow, KITTI, Middlebury, ETH3D, EuRoc, and real-world demonstrate that
CogStereo not only achieves state-of-the-art results but also excels in
cross-domain generalization, shifting stereo vision towards a cognition-driven
approach.

### [263] [Mint: A Simple Test-Time Adaptation of Vision-Language Models against Common Corruptions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22127)
*Wenxuan Bao,Ruxi Deng,Jingrui He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper explores how corruptions affect CLIP's image embeddings and introduces Mint, a method to improve performance under these conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pretrained vision-language models like CLIP struggle with distribution shifts from input corruptions, leading to performance degradation.

Method: The paper investigates embedding variance collapse caused by corruptions, develops a theoretical explanation, and introduces Mint, a test-time adaptation method to maximize pseudo-label-based inter-class variance for better performance.

Result: Mint shows consistent improvement in performance for various corruption benchmarks and CLIP architectures, even with small batch sizes.

Conclusion: Maximizing inter-class variance can mitigate embedding variance collapse and improve generalization in corrupted distribution scenarios.

Abstract: Pretrained vision-language models such as CLIP achieve strong zero-shot
generalization but remain vulnerable to distribution shifts caused by input
corruptions. In this work, we investigate how corruptions affect CLIP's image
embeddings and uncover a consistent phenomenon we term as embedding variance
collapse, where both intra-class and inter-class variances shrink as corruption
severity increases. We find that this collapse is closely tied to performance
degradation, with inter-class variance strongly correlated with classification
accuracy. To explain this phenomenon, we analyze how corruptions alter the
structure of the embedding space. Our theoretical results suggest that the
visual encoder tends to encode corruption-related signals, which dilute
class-discriminative features and compress the representation geometry. We
further show that maximizing inter-class variance, even when estimated from
pseudo-labels, can provably enhance embedding quality. Based on this insight,
we propose Mint, a simple test-time adaptation method that maximizes
pseudo-label-based inter-class variance on the fly using a mean accumulator and
a gradient accumulator. Mint operates effectively with small batch sizes and
consistently improves performance across multiple corruption benchmarks and
CLIP architectures. Our code is available at https://github.com/baowenxuan/Mint .

### [264] [egoEMOTION: Egocentric Vision and Physiological Signals for Emotion and Personality Recognition in Real-World Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22129)
*Matthias Jammot,Bjöern Braun,Paul Streli,Rafael Wampfler,Christian Holz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces egoEMOTION, a dataset analyzing emotion and personality using egocentric visual and physiological data, enabling benchmarks for understanding affect in human behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current egocentric vision systems largely ignore emotional states and personality, which are crucial to understanding human behavior and decision-making processes.

Method: The authors created the egoEMOTION dataset using data from Meta's Project Aria glasses, collecting egocentric visual signals, physiological data, and self-reported emotional and personality metrics from 43 participants under controlled and naturalistic scenarios.

Result: The study demonstrated that vision systems outperform physiological signals in affect prediction when using learning-based methods on the dataset.

Conclusion: The dataset establishes emotional and personality data as essential aspects of egocentric perception, paving the way for affect-driven modeling of human behavior and interaction.

Abstract: Understanding affect is central to anticipating human behavior, yet current
egocentric vision benchmarks largely ignore the person's emotional states that
shape their decisions and actions. Existing tasks in egocentric perception
focus on physical activities, hand-object interactions, and attention modeling
- assuming neutral affect and uniform personality. This limits the ability of
vision systems to capture key internal drivers of behavior. In this paper, we
present egoEMOTION, the first dataset that couples egocentric visual and
physiological signals with dense self-reports of emotion and personality across
controlled and real-world scenarios. Our dataset includes over 50 hours of
recordings from 43 participants, captured using Meta's Project Aria glasses.
Each session provides synchronized eye-tracking video, headmounted
photoplethysmography, inertial motion data, and physiological baselines for
reference. Participants completed emotion-elicitation tasks and naturalistic
activities while self-reporting their affective state using the Circumplex
Model and Mikels' Wheel as well as their personality via the Big Five model. We
define three benchmark tasks: (1) continuous affect classification (valence,
arousal, dominance); (2) discrete emotion classification; and (3) trait-level
personality inference. We show that a classical learning-based method, as a
simple baseline in real-world affect prediction, produces better estimates from
signals captured on egocentric vision systems than processing physiological
signals. Our dataset establishes emotion and personality as core dimensions in
egocentric perception and opens new directions in affect-driven modeling of
behavior, intent, and interaction.

*Guangan Jiang,Tianzi Zhang,Dong Li,Zhenjun Zhao,Haoang Li,Mingrui Li,Hongyu Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces STG-Avatar, a framework to create highly detailed animatable human avatars from monocular videos, addressing limitations in non-rigid and dynamic features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for realistic human avatars for human-robot interaction and immersive virtual experiences, with challenges in representing clothing deformations and dynamic regions.

Method: The STG-Avatar framework integrates Spacetime Gaussians (STG) with linear blend skinning (LBS) for deformation, combining real-time skeletal control and optimized 3D Gaussian adaptation. Optical flow is used to refine dynamic regions.

Result: Experimental results show that STG-Avatar surpasses state-of-the-art methods in reconstruction quality, operational efficiency, and quantitative metrics while maintaining real-time rendering.

Conclusion: STG-Avatar offers a significant advancement in high-fidelity human avatar reconstruction, balancing quality and efficiency, with its code publicly available for further research.

Abstract: Realistic animatable human avatars from monocular videos are crucial for
advancing human-robot interaction and enhancing immersive virtual experiences.
While recent research on 3DGS-based human avatars has made progress, it still
struggles with accurately representing detailed features of non-rigid objects
(e.g., clothing deformations) and dynamic regions (e.g., rapidly moving limbs).
To address these challenges, we present STG-Avatar, a 3DGS-based framework for
high-fidelity animatable human avatar reconstruction. Specifically, our
framework introduces a rigid-nonrigid coupled deformation framework that
synergistically integrates Spacetime Gaussians (STG) with linear blend skinning
(LBS). In this hybrid design, LBS enables real-time skeletal control by driving
global pose transformations, while STG complements it through spacetime
adaptive optimization of 3D Gaussians. Furthermore, we employ optical flow to
identify high-dynamic regions and guide the adaptive densification of 3D
Gaussians in these regions. Experimental results demonstrate that our method
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both reconstruction
quality and operational efficiency, achieving superior quantitative metrics
while retaining real-time rendering capabilities. Our code is available at

*Yuhang Gao,Xiang Xiang,Sheng Zhong,Guoyou Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces the LOC framework to enhance language-guided 3D scene understanding using supervised and self-supervised learning paradigms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of limited 3D dataset availability, which restricts Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in 3D scene understanding.

Method: LOC combines fused multi-frame LiDAR points, Poisson reconstruction, and KNN-based semantic voxel assignment. The novel Densely Contrastive Learning (DCL) technique mitigates feature over-homogenization using dense semantic information and textual prompts.

Result: The framework demonstrates superior performance on the nuScenes dataset, achieving precise predictions for known classes and identifying unknown classes without extra training data.

Conclusion: LOC enhances open-set recognition in 3D scenes by leveraging fused data and contrastive learning, offering adaptability for various occupancy networks and learning paradigms.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown significant progress in open-set
challenges. However, the limited availability of 3D datasets hinders their
effective application in 3D scene understanding. We propose LOC, a general
language-guided framework adaptable to various occupancy networks, supporting
both supervised and self-supervised learning paradigms. For self-supervised
tasks, we employ a strategy that fuses multi-frame LiDAR points for
dynamic/static scenes, using Poisson reconstruction to fill voids, and
assigning semantics to voxels via K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) to obtain
comprehensive voxel representations. To mitigate feature over-homogenization
caused by direct high-dimensional feature distillation, we introduce Densely
Contrastive Learning (DCL). DCL leverages dense voxel semantic information and
predefined textual prompts. This efficiently enhances open-set recognition
without dense pixel-level supervision, and our framework can also leverage
existing ground truth to further improve performance. Our model predicts dense
voxel features embedded in the CLIP feature space, integrating textual and
image pixel information, and classifies based on text and semantic similarity.
Experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate the method's superior
performance, achieving high-precision predictions for known classes and
distinguishing unknown classes without additional training data.

*Renrong Shao,Wei Zhang,Jun Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces ARFNet, a novel approach for Source-Free Domain Adaptation (SFDA), which reduces negative transfer and domain shift using attention mechanisms, contrast learning, and centroid evaluations, delivering superior results on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge in SFDA lies in adapting a model to a target domain without source data, while addressing complexities like domain shift and negative transfer, which hinder performance enhancement.

Method: The proposed ARFNet uses techniques like attention residual fusion for discriminative feature extraction, global-local attention contrast for better inter-class discrimination, and dynamic centroid evaluation for self-distillation to reduce domain shift.

Result: ARFNet outperforms existing SFDA techniques, achieving state-of-the-art results on five benchmarks of various scales, as shown in comprehensive experiments.

Conclusion: ARFNet effectively alleviates negative transfer and domain shift in SFDA, leveraging novel methods in attention contrast and centroid evaluation to significantly improve model adaptation and performance.

Abstract: Source-free domain adaptation (SFDA) involves training a model on source
domain and then applying it to a related target domain without access to the
source data and labels during adaptation. The complexity of scene information
and lack of the source domain make SFDA a difficult task. Recent studies have
shown promising results, but many approaches to domain adaptation concentrate
on domain shift and neglect the effects of negative transfer, which may impede
enhancements of model performance during adaptation. n this paper, addressing
this issue, we propose a novel framework of Attention Residual Fusion Network
(ARFNet) based on contrast learning for SFDA to alleviate negative transfer and
domain shift during the progress of adaptation, in which attention residual
fusion, global-local attention contrast, and dynamic centroid evaluation are
exploited. Concretely, the attention mechanism is first exploited to capture
the discriminative region of the target object. Then, in each block, attention
features are decomposed into spatial-wise and channel-wise attentions to
achieve the cross-layer attention residual fusion progressively and
self-distillation. During adaptation progress, we contrast global and local
representations to improve the perceptual capabilities of different categories,
which enables the model to discriminate variations between inner-class and
intra-class. Finally, a dynamic centroid evaluation strategy is exploited to
evaluate the trustworthy centroids and labels for self-supervised
self-distillation, which aims to accurately approximate the center of the
source domain and pseudo-labels to mitigate domain shift. To validate the
efficacy, we execute comprehensive experiments on five benchmarks of varying
scales. Experimental outcomes indicate that our method surpasses other
techniques, attaining superior performance across SFDA benchmarks.

*Shuhong Liu,Lin Gu,Ziteng Cui,Xuangeng Chu,Tatsuya Harada*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: I2-NeRF introduces a neural radiance field framework to enhance 3D perception in degraded media environments like underwater and haze through novel sampling and radiative formulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve 3D physical world perception in AI under challenging conditions like media degradation (e.g., underwater, haze).

Method: Developed I2-NeRF, combining reverse-stratified upsampling for uniform 3D space sampling and a unified radiative formulation using Beer-Lambert law to account for media degradation.

Result: Experiments show enhanced reconstruction fidelity and physical accuracy in challenging media environments compared to existing technologies.

Conclusion: The proposed I2-NeRF framework offers improved 3D perception and physical understanding in degraded visual environments, including capability to estimate medium properties.

Abstract: Participating in efforts to endow generative AI with the 3D physical world
perception, we propose I2-NeRF, a novel neural radiance field framework that
enhances isometric and isotropic metric perception under media degradation.
While existing NeRF models predominantly rely on object-centric sampling,
I2-NeRF introduces a reverse-stratified upsampling strategy to achieve
near-uniform sampling across 3D space, thereby preserving isometry. We further
present a general radiative formulation for media degradation that unifies
emission, absorption, and scattering into a particle model governed by the
Beer-Lambert attenuation law. By composing the direct and media-induced
in-scatter radiance, this formulation extends naturally to complex media
environments such as underwater, haze, and even low-light scenes. By treating
light propagation uniformly in both vertical and horizontal directions, I2-NeRF
enables isotropic metric perception and can even estimate medium properties
such as water depth. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our
method significantly improves both reconstruction fidelity and physical
plausibility compared to existing approaches.

### [269] [HARMONY: Hidden Activation Representations and Model Output-Aware Uncertainty Estimation for Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22171)
*Erum Mushtaq,Zalan Fabian,Yavuz Faruk Bakman,Anil Ramakrishna,Mahdi Soltanolkotabi,Salman Avestimehr*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The authors propose 'HARMONY,' a novel framework for uncertainty estimation in Vision-Language Models (VLMs), which jointly leverages visual and textual information to improve the trustworthiness of model outputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for reliable and trustworthy decision-making in high-stakes applications like autonomous driving and assistive technologies where Vision-Language Models are being deployed.

Method: HARMONY combines fused multimodal information from model activations with output probability distributions in VLMs to assess the reliability of predictions, improving upon earlier methods that rely solely on one metric.

Result: Experimental evaluations on three open-ended Visual Question Answering benchmarks (A-OKVQA, VizWiz, and PathVQA) and three SOTA VLMs (LLaVa-7b, LLaVA-13b, InstructBLIP) show up to 4% improvement in AUROC and 6% improvement in PRR.

Conclusion: HARMONY effectively enhances uncertainty estimation in VLMs by incorporating both multimodal hidden representations and output token probabilities, setting a new state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: The growing deployment of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in high-stakes
applications such as autonomous driving and assistive technologies for visually
impaired individuals necessitates reliable mechanisms to assess the
trustworthiness of their generation. Uncertainty Estimation (UE) plays a
central role in quantifying the reliability of model outputs and reducing
unsafe generations via selective prediction. In this regard, most existing
probability-based UE approaches rely on output probability distributions,
aggregating token probabilities into a single uncertainty score using
predefined functions such as length-normalization. Another line of research
leverages model hidden representations and trains MLP-based models to predict
uncertainty. However, these methods often fail to capture the complex
multimodal relationships between semantic and textual tokens and struggle to
identify biased probabilities often influenced by language priors. Motivated by
these observations, we propose a novel UE framework, HARMONY, that jointly
leverages fused multimodal information in model activations and the output
distribution of the VLM to determine the reliability of responses. The key
hypothesis of our work is that both the model's internal belief in its visual
understanding, captured by its hidden representations, and the produced token
probabilities carry valuable reliability signals that can be jointly leveraged
to improve UE performance, surpassing approaches that rely on only one of these
components. Experimental results on three open-ended VQA benchmarks, A-OKVQA,
VizWiz, and PathVQA, and three state-of-the-art VLMs, LLaVa-7b, LLaVA-13b and
InstructBLIP demonstrate that our method consistently performs on par with or
better than existing approaches, achieving up to 4\% improvement in AUROC, and
6\% in PRR, establishing new state of the art in uncertainty estimation for
VLMs.

*Vincent Lu,Aaron Truong,Zeyu Yun,Yubei Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a simple, non-parametric generative model for images focusing on three natural image principles, achieving strong results without complex engineering tricks or training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To simplify image generative models and improve understanding of their mechanisms while maintaining strong empirical performance.

Method: The model defines the pixel distribution using a local context window based on principles like spatial non-stationarity, low-level regularities, and high-level semantics.

Result: The model produces high-quality samples for MNIST and visually compelling CIFAR-10 images, suggesting a compositional mechanism for image generation.

Conclusion: The study provides a minimal theory of natural-image structure and mechanistic insights into generalization in image generation models.

Abstract: Scaling and architectural advances have produced strikingly photorealistic
image generative models, yet their mechanisms still remain opaque. Rather than
advancing scaling, our goal is to strip away complicated engineering tricks and
propose a simple, non-parametric generative model. Our design is grounded in
three principles of natural images-(i) spatial non-stationarity, (ii) low-level
regularities, and (iii) high-level semantics-and defines each pixel's
distribution from its local context window. Despite its minimal architecture
and no training, the model produces high-fidelity samples on MNIST and visually
compelling CIFAR-10 images. This combination of simplicity and strong empirical
performance points toward a minimal theory of natural-image structure. The
model's white-box nature also allows us to have a mechanistic understanding of
how the model generalizes and generates diverse images. We study it by tracing
each generated pixel back to its source images. These analyses reveal a simple,
compositional procedure for "part-whole generalization", suggesting a
hypothesis for how large neural network generative models learn to generalize.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle to combine full-body motion generation in 3D scenes with precise object grasping, indicating the need for a solution that integrates both aspects.

Method: The authors developed MOGRAS, a large-scale dataset with pre-grasping full-body walking motions and grasping poses in annotated 3D indoor scenes. They benchmarked existing methods and adapted approaches for scene-aware grasping.

Result: The dataset highlighted limitations in current methods, and the proposed methodology achieved significant improvements in generating realistic, scene-aware, human grasping motions.

Conclusion: MOGRAS enables advancements in realistic human-scene interactions, addressing a key challenge in robotics, virtual reality, and related fields.

Abstract: Generating realistic full-body motion interacting with objects is critical
for applications in robotics, virtual reality, and human-computer interaction.
While existing methods can generate full-body motion within 3D scenes, they
often lack the fidelity for fine-grained tasks like object grasping.
Conversely, methods that generate precise grasping motions typically ignore the
surrounding 3D scene. This gap, generating full-body grasping motions that are
physically plausible within a 3D scene, remains a significant challenge. To
address this, we introduce MOGRAS (Human MOtion with GRAsping in 3D Scenes), a
large-scale dataset that bridges this gap. MOGRAS provides pre-grasping
full-body walking motions and final grasping poses within richly annotated 3D
indoor scenes. We leverage MOGRAS to benchmark existing full-body grasping
methods and demonstrate their limitations in scene-aware generation.
Furthermore, we propose a simple yet effective method to adapt existing
approaches to work seamlessly within 3D scenes. Through extensive quantitative
and qualitative experiments, we validate the effectiveness of our dataset and
highlight the significant improvements our proposed method achieves, paving the
way for more realistic human-scene interactions.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper addresses safety risks in offsite construction by proposing a framework integrating YOLOv10n and DeepSORT for object detection and tracking, along with trajectory prediction models TrajGATFormer and TrajGATFormer-Obstacle.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve collision-avoidance systems by better predicting worker and obstacle trajectories under dynamic construction environments.

Method: A framework combining YOLOv10n for object detection, DeepSORT for tracking, and transformer-based models (TrajGATFormer and TrajGATFormer-Obstacle) with Graph Attention Networks for trajectory prediction.

Result: The models achieve high prediction accuracy with reductions in Average Displacement Error (ADE) and Final Displacement Error (FDE) by up to 35% and 38%, respectively.

Conclusion: The proposed framework improves trajectory prediction accuracy, addressing safety risks in offsite construction environments, and performs better than traditional approaches.

Abstract: As the demand grows within the construction industry for processes that are
not only faster but also safer and more efficient, offsite construction has
emerged as a solution, though it brings new safety risks due to the close
interaction between workers, machinery, and moving obstacles. Predicting the
future trajectories of workers and taking into account social and environmental
factors is a crucial step for developing collision-avoidance systems to
mitigate such risks. Traditional methods often struggle to adapt to the dynamic
and unpredictable nature of construction environments. Many rely on simplified
assumptions or require hand-crafted features, limiting their ability to respond
to complex, real-time interactions between workers and moving obstacles. While
recent data-driven methods have improved the modeling of temporal patterns,
they still face challenges in capturing long-term behavior and accounting for
the spatial and social context crucial to collision risk assessment. To address
these limitations, this paper proposes a framework integrating YOLOv10n and
DeepSORT for precise detection and tracking, along with two novel trajectory
prediction models: TrajGATFormer and TrajGATFormer-Obstacle. YOLOv10n serves as
the backbone for object detection, accurately identifying workers and obstacles
in diverse scenes, while DeepSORT efficiently tracks them over time with unique
IDs for continuity. Both models employ a transformer encoder-decoder with Graph
Attention Networks (GAT) to capture temporal and spatial interactions.
TrajGATFormer predicts worker trajectories with an ADE of 1.25 m and FDE of 2.3
m over a 4.8 s horizon, while TrajGATFormer-Obstacle extends prediction to both
workers and obstacles, achieving higher accuracy (ADE 1.15 m, FDE 2.2 m).
Comparative analysis shows both models outperform traditional methods, reducing
ADE and FDE by up to 35% and 38%, respectively.

TL;DR: DynamicTree introduces a framework to efficiently and realistically generate and animate 3D trees using Gaussian Splatting, supported by the new 4DTree dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The goal is to address limitations in existing methods for generating realistic and interactive 4D motion of complex trees, which is crucial for applications in virtual reality and simulations.

Method: The paper proposes DynamicTree, which generates sparse voxel spectrum-based animations for 3D Gaussian Splatting trees in a feed-forward manner. It includes mesh motion generation and Gaussian deformation for realistic animations.

Result: The method achieves significant performance improvements in terms of visual quality and computational efficiency, making animations realistic and responsive. These results outperform prior methods.

Conclusion: DynamicTree provides a novel and efficient solution for generating long-term and interactive tree animations, paving the way for advancements in virtual reality simulations and games.

Abstract: Generating dynamic and interactive 3D objects, such as trees, has wide
applications in virtual reality, games, and world simulation. Nevertheless,
existing methods still face various challenges in generating realistic 4D
motion for complex real trees. In this paper, we propose DynamicTree, the first
framework that can generate long-term, interactive animation of 3D Gaussian
Splatting trees. Unlike prior optimization-based methods, our approach
generates dynamics in a fast feed-forward manner. The key success of our
approach is the use of a compact sparse voxel spectrum to represent the tree
movement. Given a 3D tree from Gaussian Splatting reconstruction, our pipeline
first generates mesh motion using the sparse voxel spectrum and then binds
Gaussians to deform the mesh. Additionally, the proposed sparse voxel spectrum
can also serve as a basis for fast modal analysis under external forces,
allowing real-time interactive responses. To train our model, we also introduce
4DTree, the first large-scale synthetic 4D tree dataset containing 8,786
animated tree meshes with semantic labels and 100-frame motion sequences.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves realistic and
responsive tree animations, significantly outperforming existing approaches in

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the performance gap between adaptation-based methods and fully supervised learning by selectively acquiring target domain annotations in a multi-source domain setting.

Method: The proposed GALA strategy uses global k-means clustering for target samples and a cluster-wise local selection criterion to handle inter-class diversity and multi-source domain variation. It is a plug-and-play method without additional trainable parameters.

Result: GALA consistently outperforms prior active learning and DA methods across three standard benchmarks, approaching fully-supervised performance with only 1% target annotations.

Conclusion: The GALA strategy effectively addresses challenges in MS-ADA, enhancing performance while staying efficient in annotation use, and can integrate seamlessly into existing frameworks.

Abstract: Domain Adaptation (DA) provides an effective way to tackle target-domain
tasks by leveraging knowledge learned from source domains. Recent studies have
extended this paradigm to Multi-Source Domain Adaptation (MSDA), which exploits
multiple source domains carrying richer and more diverse transferable
information. However, a substantial performance gap still remains between
adaptation-based methods and fully supervised learning. In this paper, we
explore a more practical and challenging setting, named Multi-Source Active
Domain Adaptation (MS-ADA), to further enhance target-domain performance by
selectively acquiring annotations from the target domain. The key difficulty of
MS-ADA lies in designing selection criteria that can jointly handle inter-class
diversity and multi-source domain variation. To address these challenges, we
propose a simple yet effective GALA strategy (GALA), which combines a global
k-means clustering step for target-domain samples with a cluster-wise local
selection criterion, effectively tackling the above two issues in a
complementary manner. Our proposed GALA is plug-and-play and can be seamlessly
integrated into existing DA frameworks without introducing any additional
trainable parameters. Extensive experiments on three standard DA benchmarks
demonstrate that GALA consistently outperforms prior active learning and active
DA methods, achieving performance comparable to the fully-supervised upperbound
while using only 1% of the target annotations.

### [276] [Enpowering Your Pansharpening Models with Generalizability: Unified Distribution is All You Need](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22217)
*Yongchuan Cui,Peng Liu,Hui Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Deep learning models for remote sensing pansharpening face performance issues on unseen satellite data due to distributional discrepancies. UniPAN proposes a unified distribution strategy to bridge training and testing gaps and improve model generalizability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current pansharpening models deteriorate significantly on data from unseen satellite sensors due to differences in image distributions, limiting their universality and practicality.

Method: The paper adopts a unified distribution strategy (UniPAN), creating a distribution transformation function to normalize pixel values across sources to conform to a single training distribution. Both training and testing data are transformed consistently.

Result: Experimental results show UniPAN enhances performance and generalizability of deep pansharpening models across various satellite sensors.

Conclusion: UniPAN effectively addresses distributional discrepancies to enable generalized deployment of pansharpening models, emphasizing its potential for widespread remote sensing applications.

Abstract: Existing deep learning-based models for remote sensing pansharpening exhibit
exceptional performance on training datasets. However, due to sensor-specific
characteristics and varying imaging conditions, these models suffer from
substantial performance degradation when applied to unseen satellite data,
lacking generalizability and thus limiting their applicability. We argue that
the performance drops stem primarily from distributional discrepancies from
different sources and the key to addressing this challenge lies in bridging the
gap between training and testing distributions. To validate the idea and
further achieve a "train once, deploy forever" capability, this paper
introduces a novel and intuitive approach to enpower any pansharpening models
with generalizability by employing a unified distribution strategy (UniPAN).
Specifically, we construct a distribution transformation function that
normalizes the pixels sampled from different sources to conform to an identical
distribution. The deep models are trained on the transformed domain, and during
testing on new datasets, the new data are also transformed to match the
training distribution. UniPAN aims to train and test the model on a unified and
consistent distribution, thereby enhancing its generalizability. Extensive
experiments validate the efficacy of UniPAN, demonstrating its potential to
significantly enhance the performance of deep pansharpening models across
diverse satellite sensors. Codes: https://github.com/yc-cui/UniPAN.

*Jeongin Kim,Wonho Bae,YouLee Han,Giyeong Oh,Youngjae Yu,Danica J. Sutherland,Junhyug Noh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel active learning framework for semantic segmentation to minimize labeling efforts under limited budgets using a diffusion model and a two-stage selection pipeline.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of semantic segmentation requiring expensive dense pixel-level annotations, especially under constrained labeling budgets.

Method: The method utilizes a pre-trained diffusion model for multi-scale feature extraction. It introduces a two-stage selection process: hierarchical representation-based candidate selection (using MaxHerding), followed by an entropy-augmented disagreement score (eDALD) computation to choose pixels for annotation.

Result: The approach shows significant improvement in segmentation accuracy under extreme pixel-budget constraints across four benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively reduces the required annotated pixels while maintaining high segmentation accuracy and outperforms existing baselines.

Abstract: Semantic segmentation demands dense pixel-level annotations, which can be
prohibitively expensive - especially under extremely constrained labeling
budgets. In this paper, we address the problem of low-budget active learning
for semantic segmentation by proposing a novel two-stage selection pipeline.
Our approach leverages a pre-trained diffusion model to extract rich
multi-scale features that capture both global structure and fine details. In
the first stage, we perform a hierarchical, representation-based candidate
selection by first choosing a small subset of representative pixels per image
using MaxHerding, and then refining these into a diverse global pool. In the
second stage, we compute an entropy-augmented disagreement score (eDALD) over
noisy multi-scale diffusion features to capture both epistemic uncertainty and
prediction confidence, selecting the most informative pixels for annotation.
This decoupling of diversity and uncertainty lets us achieve high segmentation
accuracy with only a tiny fraction of labeled pixels. Extensive experiments on
four benchmarks (CamVid, ADE-Bed, Cityscapes, and Pascal-Context) demonstrate
that our method significantly outperforms existing baselines under extreme
pixel-budget regimes. Our code is available at

*Kunyang Zhou,Yeqin Shao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces DiffusionLane, a novel lane detection model using diffusion processes to refine noisy lane anchors, achieving state-of-the-art results in multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of this paper is to address the challenges in lane detection tasks, such as poor feature representation and accurate lane anchor refinement, by introducing a novel diffusion-based method.

Method: The method involves treating lane detection as a denoising diffusion process in the parameter space of lanes, adding Gaussian noise to lane parameters, and using a hybrid decoding strategy with a global-level and local-level decoder and auxiliary head for better feature representation.

Result: DiffusionLane achieves state-of-the-art performance with strong generalization ability across multiple benchmarks, surpassing existing methods in accuracy and F1 score on datasets like Carlane, Tusimple, CULane, and LLAMAS.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that DiffusionLane is a highly effective and generalizable method for lane detection, addressing key challenges in the domain. The release of the code will enable further adoption and validation.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel diffusion-based model for lane detection,
called DiffusionLane, which treats the lane detection task as a denoising
diffusion process in the parameter space of the lane. Firstly, we add the
Gaussian noise to the parameters (the starting point and the angle) of ground
truth lanes to obtain noisy lane anchors, and the model learns to refine the
noisy lane anchors in a progressive way to obtain the target lanes. Secondly,
we propose a hybrid decoding strategy to address the poor feature
representation of the encoder, resulting from the noisy lane anchors.
Specifically, we design a hybrid diffusion decoder to combine global-level and
local-level decoders for high-quality lane anchors. Then, to improve the
feature representation of the encoder, we employ an auxiliary head in the
training stage to adopt the learnable lane anchors for enriching the
supervision on the encoder. Experimental results on four benchmarks, Carlane,
Tusimple, CULane, and LLAMAS, show that DiffusionLane possesses a strong
generalization ability and promising detection performance compared to the
previous state-of-the-art methods. For example, DiffusionLane with ResNet18
surpasses the existing methods by at least 1\% accuracy on the domain
adaptation dataset Carlane. Besides, DiffusionLane with MobileNetV4 gets
81.32\% F1 score on CULane, 96.89\% accuracy on Tusimple with ResNet34, and
97.59\% F1 score on LLAMAS with ResNet101. Code will be available at

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Achieving high accuracy in semantic segmentation within real-time applications such as autonomous driving, under computational and hardware constraints.

Conclusion: CGRA4ML offers a promising solution for deploying advanced segmentation networks on FPGA, delivering power-efficient performance competitive to GPUs while maintaining high accuracy.

Abstract: Semantic segmentation has emerged as a fundamental problem in computer
vision, gaining particular importance in real-time applications such as
autonomous driving. The main challenge is achieving high accuracy while
operating under computational and hardware constraints. In this research, we
present an FPGA-based implementation of real-time semantic segmentation
leveraging the lightweight LMIINet architecture and the Coarse-Grained
Reconfigurable Array for Machine Learning (CGRA4ML) hardware framework. The
model was trained using Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) with 8-bit precision
on the Cityscapes dataset, reducing memory footprint by a factor of four while
enabling efficient fixed-point computations. Necessary modifications were
applied to adapt the model to CGRA4ML constraints, including simplifying skip
connections, employing hardware-friendly operations such as depthwise-separable
and 1A-1 convolutions, and redesigning parts of the Flatten Transformer. Our
implementation achieves approximately 90% pixel accuracy and 45% mean
Intersection-over-Union (mIoU), operating in real-time at 20 frames per second
(FPS) with 50.1 ms latency on the ZCU104 FPGA board. The results demonstrate
the potential of CGRA4ML, with its flexibility in mapping modern layers and
off-chip memory utilization for skip connections, provides a path for
implementing advanced semantic segmentation networks on FPGA for real-time
applications to outperform traditional GPU solutions in terms of power
efficiency while maintaining competitive accuracy. The code for this project is

### [281] [Accident Anticipation via Temporal Occurrence Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22260)
*Tianhao Zhao,Yiyang Zou,Zihao Mao,Peilun Xiao,Yulin Huang,Hongda Yang,Yuxuan Li,Qun Li,Guobin Wu,Yutian Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a new method to predict multi-horizon accident scores, enhancing road safety by addressing shortcomings in traditional binary risk scoring.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing accident anticipation methods rely on ambiguous binary supervision for predicting hazard, resulting in false alarms and unreliable learning.

Method: The proposed approach estimates accident scores for various future time steps using a snippet-level encoder and Transformer-based temporal decoder with annotated accident timestamps.

Result: Experiments demonstrate the method improves recall and Time-to-Accident (TTA) under realistic False Alarm Rate (FAR) constraints.

Conclusion: By shifting to multi-horizon accident prediction, the study overcomes challenges of traditional methods and delivers a more effective system for road safety.

Abstract: Accident anticipation aims to predict potential collisions in an online
manner, enabling timely alerts to enhance road safety. Existing methods
typically predict frame-level risk scores as indicators of hazard. However,
these approaches rely on ambiguous binary supervision (labeling all frames in
accident videos as positive) despite the fact that risk varies continuously
over time, leading to unreliable learning and false alarms. To address this, we
propose a novel paradigm that shifts the prediction target from current-frame
risk scoring to directly estimating accident scores at multiple future time
steps (e.g., 0.1s-2.0s ahead), leveraging precisely annotated accident
timestamps as supervision. Our method employs a snippet-level encoder to
jointly model spatial and temporal dynamics, and a Transformer-based temporal
decoder that predicts accident scores for all future horizons simultaneously
using dedicated temporal queries. Furthermore, we introduce a refined
evaluation protocol that reports Time-to-Accident (TTA) and recall (evaluated
at multiple pre-accident intervals (0.5s, 1.0s, and 1.5s)) only when the false
alarm rate (FAR) remains within an acceptable range, ensuring practical
relevance. Experiments show that our method achieves superior performance in
both recall and TTA under realistic FAR constraints.

TL;DR: The paper introduces GSAlign, a novel network to address the challenges in aerial-ground person re-identification, improving accuracy and matching performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address major issues in AG-ReID such as extreme viewpoint differences, occlusions, and domain gaps between aerial and ground-based imagery.

Method: The authors propose GSAlign, featuring Learnable Thin Plate Spline (LTPS) and Dynamic Alignment Module (DAM) to adjust geometric distortion and semantic misalignment.

Result: GSAlign achieves significant improvements (+18.8% mAP and +16.8% Rank-1 accuracy) on the CARGO dataset compared to previous methods.

Conclusion: GSAlign effectively enhances aerial-ground person re-identification by resolving geometric and semantic alignment issues. The code is made publicly available for further research.

Abstract: Aerial-Ground person re-identification (AG-ReID) is an emerging yet
challenging task that aims to match pedestrian images captured from drastically
different viewpoints, typically from unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and
ground-based surveillance cameras. The task poses significant challenges due to
extreme viewpoint discrepancies, occlusions, and domain gaps between aerial and
ground imagery. While prior works have made progress by learning cross-view
representations, they remain limited in handling severe pose variations and
spatial misalignment. To address these issues, we propose a Geometric and
Semantic Alignment Network (GSAlign) tailored for AG-ReID. GSAlign introduces
two key components to jointly tackle geometric distortion and semantic
misalignment in aerial-ground matching: a Learnable Thin Plate Spline (LTPS)
Module and a Dynamic Alignment Module (DAM). The LTPS module adaptively warps
pedestrian features based on a set of learned keypoints, effectively
compensating for geometric variations caused by extreme viewpoint changes. In
parallel, the DAM estimates visibility-aware representation masks that
highlight visible body regions at the semantic level, thereby alleviating the
negative impact of occlusions and partial observations in cross-view
correspondence. A comprehensive evaluation on CARGO with four matching
protocols demonstrates the effectiveness of GSAlign, achieving significant
improvements of +18.8\% in mAP and +16.8\% in Rank-1 accuracy over previous
state-of-the-art methods on the aerial-ground setting. The code is available

Conclusion: The dataset WAON and its corresponding benchmark significantly advance the performance of Vision-Language Models in Japanese, setting a new standard for this domain.

Abstract: Large-scale and high-quality image-text pair datasets play an important role
in developing high-performing Vision-Language Models (VLMs). In this work, we
introduce WAON, a large-scale and high-quality Japanese image-text pair dataset
containing approximately 155 million examples, collected from Common Crawl. Our
dataset construction pipeline employs various techniques, including filtering
and deduplication, which have been shown to be effective in previous studies.
To evaluate its effectiveness, we also construct WAON-Bench, a manually curated

using both WAON and the Japanese subset of ReLAION, one of the most widely used
vision-language datasets. We fine-tune SigLIP2, a strong multilingual model, on
both datasets. The results demonstrate that WAON enhances model performance on
WAON-Bench more efficiently than ReLAION and achieves higher accuracy across
all evaluated benchmarks. Furthermore, the model fine-tuned on WAON achieves
state-of-the-art performance on several Japanese cultural benchmarks. We

*Xiang Fei,Tina Tian,Howie Choset,Lu Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces the novel Bag-of-Word-Groups (BoWG) method for loop closure detection, addressing challenges in perceptually aliased environments with superior precision-recall and computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current SLAM systems struggle with loop closure detection in environments with visual repetitiveness, sparsity, and computational inefficiencies.

Method: The authors propose BoWG, leveraging spatial co-occurrence of visual words and temporal consistency using adaptive schemes, alongside feature distribution analysis and post-verification mechanisms.

Result: Experiments on datasets, including a confined-pipe dataset, confirm BoWG's superior performance relative to existing methods in precision-recall and efficiency.

Conclusion: BoWG significantly enhances loop closure detection in SLAM, showing strong scalability and computation speed, making it promising for challenging environments.

Abstract: Loop closure is critical in Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM)
systems to reduce accumulative drift and ensure global mapping consistency.
However, conventional methods struggle in perceptually aliased environments,
such as narrow pipes, due to vector quantization, feature sparsity, and
repetitive textures, while existing solutions often incur high computational
costs. This paper presents Bag-of-Word-Groups (BoWG), a novel loop closure
detection method that achieves superior precision-recall, robustness, and
computational efficiency. The core innovation lies in the introduction of word
groups, which captures the spatial co-occurrence and proximity of visual words
to construct an online dictionary. Additionally, drawing inspiration from
probabilistic transition models, we incorporate temporal consistency directly
into similarity computation with an adaptive scheme, substantially improving
precision-recall performance. The method is further strengthened by a feature
distribution analysis module and dedicated post-verification mechanisms. To
evaluate the effectiveness of our method, we conduct experiments on both public
datasets and a confined-pipe dataset we constructed. Results demonstrate that
BoWG surpasses state-of-the-art methods, including both traditional and
learning-based approaches, in terms of precision-recall and computational
efficiency. Our approach also exhibits excellent scalability, achieving an
average processing time of 16 ms per image across 17,565 images in the

Motivation: The paper addresses the limitations of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) in accurately and interpretably predicting urban socio-economic status, which is crucial for sustainable development.

Method: CityRiSE utilizes reinforcement learning with multi-modal data and a curated reward design to enable LVLMs to reason socio-economic status through structured processes.

Result: CityRiSE significantly outperforms existing baselines in prediction accuracy and generalization across unseen cities and indicators.

Conclusion: CityRiSE demonstrates the potential of RL-integrated LVLMs for interpretable and generalist urban socio-economic sensing, paving the way for improved leveraging of large-scale visual data in global development goals.

Abstract: Harnessing publicly available, large-scale web data, such as street view and
satellite imagery, urban socio-economic sensing is of paramount importance for
achieving global sustainable development goals. With the emergence of Large
Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), new opportunities have arisen to solve this
task by treating it as a multi-modal perception and understanding problem.
However, recent studies reveal that LVLMs still struggle with accurate and
interpretable socio-economic predictions from visual data. To address these
limitations and maximize the potential of LVLMs, we introduce
\textbf{CityRiSE}, a novel framework for \textbf{R}eason\textbf{i}ng urban
\textbf{S}ocio-\textbf{E}conomic status in LVLMs through pure reinforcement
learning (RL). With carefully curated multi-modal data and verifiable reward
design, our approach guides the LVLM to focus on semantically meaningful visual
cues, enabling structured and goal-oriented reasoning for generalist
socio-economic status prediction. Experiments demonstrate that CityRiSE with
emergent reasoning process significantly outperforms existing baselines,
improving both prediction accuracy and generalization across diverse urban
contexts, particularly for prediction on unseen cities and unseen indicators.
This work highlights the promise of combining RL and LVLMs for interpretable

TL;DR: GRPO-Guard enhances GRPO-based reinforcement learning by addressing systematic shifts in importance-ratio distribution and preventing over-optimization in policy models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle the problem of implicit over-optimization in GRPO frameworks that leads to a degradation in essential metrics like image quality and text-prompt alignment.

Method: The method introduces ratio normalization to balance importance ratios and gradient reweighting to equalize policy gradients over noise conditions.

Result: GRPO-Guard reduces over-optimization, stabilizes optimization, and improves or maintains generation quality across several diffusion backbones and proxy tasks.

Conclusion: GRPO-Guard provides a simple yet effective enhancement, ensuring effective flow-matching optimization while avoiding over-optimization issues.

Abstract: Recently, GRPO-based reinforcement learning has shown remarkable progress in
optimizing flow-matching models, effectively improving their alignment with
task-specific rewards. Within these frameworks, the policy update relies on
importance-ratio clipping to constrain overconfident positive and negative
gradients. However, in practice, we observe a systematic shift in the
importance-ratio distribution-its mean falls below 1 and its variance differs
substantially across timesteps. This left-shifted and inconsistent distribution
prevents positive-advantage samples from entering the clipped region, causing
the mechanism to fail in constraining overconfident positive updates. As a
result, the policy model inevitably enters an implicit over-optimization
stage-while the proxy reward continues to increase, essential metrics such as
image quality and text-prompt alignment deteriorate sharply, ultimately making
the learned policy impractical for real-world use. To address this issue, we
introduce GRPO-Guard, a simple yet effective enhancement to existing GRPO
frameworks. Our method incorporates ratio normalization, which restores a
balanced and step-consistent importance ratio, ensuring that PPO clipping
properly constrains harmful updates across denoising timesteps. In addition, a
gradient reweighting strategy equalizes policy gradients over noise conditions,
preventing excessive updates from particular timestep regions. Together, these
designs act as a regulated clipping mechanism, stabilizing optimization and
substantially mitigating implicit over-optimization without relying on heavy KL
regularization. Extensive experiments on multiple diffusion backbones (e.g.,
SD3.5M, Flux.1-dev) and diverse proxy tasks demonstrate that GRPO-Guard
significantly reduces over-optimization while maintaining or even improving
generation quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the lack of focus on inter-instance relationships in traditional self-supervised methods, which mainly prioritize intra-instance variations.

Method: The method involves constructing k-nearest neighbor graphs for teacher and student streams during pretraining, using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for broader contextual integration after pretraining.

Result: Accuracy improvements observed: 7.3% on CIFAR-10, 3.2% on ImageNet-100, and 1.0% on ImageNet-1K datasets, surpassing state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The integration of graph-based mechanisms effectively enhances representation learning, highlighting the importance of inter-instance relationships. Code is made publicly available for reproducibility.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach that integrates graph theory into
self-supervised representation learning. Traditional methods focus on
intra-instance variations generated by applying augmentations. However, they
often overlook important inter-instance relationships. While our method retains
the intra-instance property, it further captures inter-instance relationships
by constructing k-nearest neighbor (KNN) graphs for both teacher and student
streams during pretraining. In these graphs, nodes represent samples along with
their latent representations. Edges encode the similarity between instances.
Following pretraining, a representation refinement phase is performed. In this
phase, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) propagate messages not only among immediate
neighbors but also across multiple hops, thereby enabling broader contextual
integration. Experimental results on CIFAR-10, ImageNet-100, and ImageNet-1K
demonstrate accuracy improvements of 7.3%, 3.2%, and 1.0%, respectively, over
state-of-the-art methods. These results highlight the effectiveness of the
proposed graph based mechanism. The code is publicly available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MindHier, a framework for reconstructing visual stimuli from fMRI signals through a hierarchical approach, offering better results and faster inference compared to diffusion-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the limitations of existing diffusion-based methods, which use fixed neural guidance, leading to collapsed hierarchical information and suboptimal image reconstruction aligned with neural perception stages.

Method: MindHier is designed with three main components: (1) Hierarchical fMRI Encoder to extract multi-level neural information, (2) a Hierarchy-to-Hierarchy Alignment to ensure layer-wise correspondence with CLIP features, and (3) Scale-Aware Coarse-to-Fine Neural Guidance for autoregressive modeling from global to local features.

Result: MindHier demonstrates superior semantic fidelity, achieves 4.67x faster inference, and produces more deterministic results compared to diffusion-based baselines when tested on the NSD dataset.

Conclusion: MindHier provides an effective and cognitively-aligned method for fMRI-based visual reconstruction, showing improved performance and efficiency over prior methods.

Abstract: Reconstructing visual stimuli from fMRI signals is a central challenge
bridging machine learning and neuroscience. Recent diffusion-based methods
typically map fMRI activity to a single high-level embedding, using it as fixed
guidance throughout the entire generation process. However, this fixed guidance
collapses hierarchical neural information and is misaligned with the
stage-dependent demands of image reconstruction. In response, we propose
MindHier, a coarse-to-fine fMRI-to-image reconstruction framework built on
scale-wise autoregressive modeling. MindHier introduces three components: a
Hierarchical fMRI Encoder to extract multi-level neural embeddings, a
Hierarchy-to-Hierarchy Alignment scheme to enforce layer-wise correspondence
with CLIP features, and a Scale-Aware Coarse-to-Fine Neural Guidance strategy
to inject these embeddings into autoregression at matching scales. These
designs make MindHier an efficient and cognitively-aligned alternative to
diffusion-based methods by enabling a hierarchical reconstruction process that
synthesizes global semantics before refining local details, akin to human
visual perception. Extensive experiments on the NSD dataset show that MindHier
achieves superior semantic fidelity, 4.67x faster inference, and more
deterministic results than the diffusion-based baselines.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GeoDiffusion offers a training-free approach for accurate geometric conditioning in 3D image generation and editing, ensuring precision and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for improved 3D object feature control in image generation, as traditional methods are slow and skill-intensive, while current generative tools lack geometric accuracy.

Method: The framework uses a class-specific 3D object as a geometric prior with keypoints, parametric correlations, rendered reference images, and style transfer for user-defined specifications.

Result: GeoDiffusion demonstrates precise geometric modifications and enhanced iterative design workflows via its GeoDrag tool for accurate and fast drag-based editing.

Conclusion: GeoDiffusion provides an efficient solution for precise geometric control, addressing limitations in current 3D editing and generative methods.

Abstract: Precise geometric control in image generation is essential for engineering \&
product design and creative industries to control 3D object features accurately
in image space. Traditional 3D editing approaches are time-consuming and demand
specialized skills, while current image-based generative methods lack accuracy
in geometric conditioning. To address these challenges, we propose
GeoDiffusion, a training-free framework for accurate and efficient geometric
conditioning of 3D features in image generation. GeoDiffusion employs a
class-specific 3D object as a geometric prior to define keypoints and
parametric correlations in 3D space. We ensure viewpoint consistency through a
rendered image of a reference 3D object, followed by style transfer to meet
user-defined appearance specifications. At the core of our framework is
GeoDrag, improving accuracy and speed of drag-based image editing on geometry
guidance tasks and general instructions on DragBench. Our results demonstrate
that GeoDiffusion enables precise geometric modifications across various
iterative design workflows.

*Changhao Zhang,Matthew J. Clarkson,Mobarak I. Hoque*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents an integrated approach using self-supervised monocular depth estimation for accurate intrinsic parameter estimation in endoscopic 3D reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for 3D reconstruction in endoscopy fail to estimate intrinsic parameters accurately due to challenges like continuous zoom and sterility constraints.

Method: The authors adapt the Depth Anything V2 (DA2) model to jointly predict depth, pose, and intrinsic parameters with innovations like an attention-based pose network and Weight-Decomposed Low-Rank Adaptation (DoRA) strategy.

Result: The approach outperformed state-of-the-art methods on SCARED and C3VD public datasets in 3D reconstruction and depth estimation.

Conclusion: Integrating intrinsic parameter estimation into depth frameworks can improve the accuracy and reliability of endoscopic 3D reconstructions.

Abstract: 3D reconstruction of endoscopic surgery scenes plays a vital role in
enhancing scene perception, enabling AR visualization, and supporting
context-aware decision-making in image-guided surgery. A critical yet
challenging step in this process is the accurate estimation of the endoscope's
intrinsic parameters. In real surgical settings, intrinsic calibration is
hindered by sterility constraints and the use of specialized endoscopes with
continuous zoom and telescope rotation. Most existing methods for endoscopic 3D
reconstruction do not estimate intrinsic parameters, limiting their
effectiveness for accurate and reliable reconstruction. In this paper, we
integrate intrinsic parameter estimation into a self-supervised monocular depth
estimation framework by adapting the Depth Anything V2 (DA2) model for joint
depth, pose, and intrinsics prediction. We introduce an attention-based pose
network and a Weight-Decomposed Low-Rank Adaptation (DoRA) strategy for
efficient fine-tuning of DA2. Our method is validated on the SCARED and C3VD
public datasets, demonstrating superior performance compared to recent
state-of-the-art approaches in self-supervised monocular depth estimation and
3D reconstruction. Code and model weights can be found in project repository:

*Jindong Yang,Han Fang,Weiming Zhang,Nenghai Yu,Kejiang Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel watermarking method, T2SMark, which achieves a balance between robustness and diversity for diffusion models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of balancing robustness and diversity in image watermarking methods, especially in diffusion models, to protect intellectual property and mitigate misuse of generative AI.

Method: This paper introduces T2SMark, a two-stage watermarking scheme. It uses Tail-Truncated Sampling (TTS) to enhance watermark robustness and employs a session key during encryption to maintain sampling diversity.

Result: T2SMark was tested on diffusion models with U-Net and DiT backbones, demonstrating its ability to optimally balance watermark robustness and generation diversity.

Conclusion: T2SMark outperforms previous Noise-as-Watermark methods by successfully balancing robustness and diversity, making it viable for real-world deployment.

Abstract: Diffusion models have advanced rapidly in recent years, producing
high-fidelity images while raising concerns about intellectual property
protection and the misuse of generative AI. Image watermarking for diffusion
models, particularly Noise-as-Watermark (NaW) methods, encode watermark as
specific standard Gaussian noise vector for image generation, embedding the
infomation seamlessly while maintaining image quality. For detection, the
generation process is inverted to recover the initial noise vector containing
the watermark before extraction. However, existing NaW methods struggle to
balance watermark robustness with generation diversity. Some methods achieve
strong robustness by heavily constraining initial noise sampling, which
degrades user experience, while others preserve diversity but prove too fragile
for real-world deployment. To address this issue, we propose T2SMark, a
two-stage watermarking scheme based on Tail-Truncated Sampling (TTS). Unlike
prior methods that simply map bits to positive or negative values, TTS enhances
robustness by embedding bits exclusively in the reliable tail regions while
randomly sampling the central zone to preserve the latent distribution. Our
two-stage framework then ensures sampling diversity by integrating a randomly
generated session key into both encryption pipelines. We evaluate T2SMark on
diffusion models with both U-Net and DiT backbones. Extensive experiments show
that it achieves an optimal balance between robustness and diversity. Our code

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces EndoWave, a framework to improve 3D reconstruction in robot-assisted surgeries by addressing photometric and structural challenges using spatio-temporal Gaussian Splatting, optical flow constraints, and wavelet techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate 3D reconstruction in minimally invasive surgery is essential but challenging due to photometric inconsistencies, non-rigid tissue motion, and visual artifacts that impact traditional methods relying on appearance constraints.

Method: EndoWave employs a spatio-temporal Gaussian Splatting representation, optical flow-based geometric constraints for temporal coherence, and a multi-resolution rational wavelet for enhanced scene detail and rendering quality.

Result: EndoWave demonstrated state-of-the-art 3D reconstruction and visual accuracy in evaluations using real surgical datasets, outperforming baseline methods.

Conclusion: The proposed EndoWave framework effectively addresses the limitations in endoscopic 3D reconstruction, improving temporal coherence and structural accuracy in minimally invasive surgery contexts.

Abstract: In robot-assisted minimally invasive surgery, accurate 3D reconstruction from
endoscopic video is vital for downstream tasks and improved outcomes. However,
endoscopic scenarios present unique challenges, including photometric
inconsistencies, non-rigid tissue motion, and view-dependent highlights. Most
3DGS-based methods that rely solely on appearance constraints for optimizing
3DGS are often insufficient in this context, as these dynamic visual artifacts
can mislead the optimization process and lead to inaccurate reconstructions. To
address these limitations, we present EndoWave, a unified spatio-temporal
Gaussian Splatting framework by incorporating an optical flow-based geometric
constraint and a multi-resolution rational wavelet supervision. First, we adopt
a unified spatio-temporal Gaussian representation that directly optimizes
primitives in a 4D domain. Second, we propose a geometric constraint derived
from optical flow to enhance temporal coherence and effectively constrain the
3D structure of the scene. Third, we propose a multi-resolution rational
orthogonal wavelet as a constraint, which can effectively separate the details
of the endoscope and enhance the rendering performance. Extensive evaluations
on two real surgical datasets, EndoNeRF and StereoMIS, demonstrate that our
method EndoWave achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction quality and visual
accuracy compared to the baseline method.

*Tianran Li,Marius Staring,Yuchuan Qiao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a Recurrent Correlation-based framework for deformable image registration to address challenges in handling large deformations in medical imaging, achieving significant efficiency and accuracy improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficiently handling large deformations in medical imaging, which remains a challenging task for current deformable image registration methods, despite advances in deep learning that have reduced runtime.

Method: The proposed approach involves a Recurrent Correlation-based framework that dynamically relocates matching regions through iterative local matching using offset estimation. It also uses a lightweight recurrent module for efficient updates and decouples motion-related and texture features to reduce semantic redundancy.

Result: The framework demonstrates strong accuracy and computational efficiency on brain MRI and abdominal CT datasets, surpassing or matching state-of-the-art methods. For example, it matches performance on the non-affine OASIS dataset while being significantly faster and computationally lighter than the RDP method.

Conclusion: The method delivers an effective and resource-efficient solution for large deformation image registration and can improve computational speed and accuracy in medical imaging applications.

Abstract: Deformable image registration estimates voxel-wise correspondences between
images through spatial transformations, and plays a key role in medical
imaging. While deep learning methods have significantly reduced runtime,
efficiently handling large deformations remains a challenging task.
Convolutional networks aggregate local features but lack direct modeling of
voxel correspondences, promoting recent works to explore explicit feature
matching. Among them, voxel-to-region matching is more efficient for direct
correspondence modeling by computing local correlation features whithin
neighbourhoods, while region-to-region matching incurs higher redundancy due to
excessive correlation pairs across large regions. However, the inherent
locality of voxel-to-region matching hinders the capture of long-range
correspondences required for large deformations. To address this, we propose a
Recurrent Correlation-based framework that dynamically relocates the matching
region toward more promising positions. At each step, local matching is
performed with low cost, and the estimated offset guides the next search
region, supporting efficient convergence toward large deformations. In
addition, we uses a lightweight recurrent update module with memory capacity
and decouples motion-related and texture features to suppress semantic
redundancy. We conduct extensive experiments on brain MRI and abdominal CT
datasets under two settings: with and without affine pre-registration. Results
show that our method exibits a strong accuracy-computation trade-off,
surpassing or matching the state-of-the-art performance. For example, it
achieves comparable performance on the non-affine OASIS dataset, while using
only 9.5% of the FLOPs and running 96% faster than RDP, a representative
high-performing method.

Motivation: To enhance infrastructure-based perception for automated driving through better background subtraction in roadside LiDAR applications.

Method: A Gaussian distribution grid (GDG) is developed to model spatial statistics of background, coupled with a filtering algorithm to classify LiDAR points.

Conclusion: The proposed approach is adaptable to diverse LiDAR sensors and is efficient for low-resource hardware, making it suitable for real-world applications.

Abstract: We present a fully interpretable and flexible statistical method for
background subtraction in roadside LiDAR data, aimed at enhancing
infrastructure-based perception in automated driving. Our approach introduces
both a Gaussian distribution grid (GDG), which models the spatial statistics of
the background using background-only scans, and a filtering algorithm that uses
this representation to classify LiDAR points as foreground or background. The
method supports diverse LiDAR types, including multiline 360 degree and
micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) sensors, and adapts to various
configurations. Evaluated on the publicly available RCooper dataset, it
outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in accuracy and flexibility, even with
minimal background data. Its efficient implementation ensures reliable
performance on low-resource hardware, enabling scalable real-world deployment.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper improves semantic segmentation for point clouds using a novel dynamic filtering and data augmentation approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Annotating real-world LiDAR point clouds is costly, motivating the use of synthetic data and unsupervised domain adaptation.

Method: Proposed Dynamic Pseudo-Label Filtering (DPLF) and a Prior-Guided Data Augmentation Pipeline (PG-DAP) to better handle data adaptation, combined with data mixing consistency loss.

Result: Achieved superior performance in synthetic-to-real point cloud segmentation tasks compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The proposed methods effectively utilize unlabeled data, alleviate domain shifts, and demonstrate improved performance in challenging tasks, with publicly released code.

Abstract: Annotating real-world LiDAR point clouds for use in intelligent autonomous
systems is costly. To overcome this limitation, self-training-based
Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) has been widely used to improve point
cloud semantic segmentation by leveraging synthetic point cloud data. However,
we argue that existing methods do not effectively utilize unlabeled data, as
they either rely on predefined or fixed confidence thresholds, resulting in
suboptimal performance. In this paper, we propose a Dynamic Pseudo-Label
Filtering (DPLF) scheme to enhance real data utilization in point cloud UDA
semantic segmentation. Additionally, we design a simple and efficient
Prior-Guided Data Augmentation Pipeline (PG-DAP) to mitigate domain shift
between synthetic and real-world point clouds. Finally, we utilize data mixing
consistency loss to push the model to learn context-free representations. We
implement and thoroughly evaluate our approach through extensive comparisons
with state-of-the-art methods. Experiments on two challenging synthetic-to-real
point cloud semantic segmentation tasks demonstrate that our approach achieves
superior performance. Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of the DPLF
and PG-DAP modules. We release the code of our method in this paper.

*Jusheng Zhang,Kaitong Cai,Jing Yang,Jian Wang,Chengpei Tang,Keze Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a new framework, Top-Down Semantic Refinement (TDSR), to enhance the hierarchical refinement of image captioning tasks using large Vision-Language Models (VLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations of large VLMs in maintaining global narrative coherence and capturing fine details, particularly in tasks requiring multi-step complex scene descriptions.

Method: The authors redefine image captioning as a hierarchical refinement planning problem modeled as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). They introduce a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm optimized for VLMs by utilizing visual-guided parallel expansion, a lightweight value network, and adaptive early stopping to reduce computational costs while preserving quality.

Result: Their framework, TDSR, demonstrated enhanced performance on various benchmarks (e.g., DetailCaps, COMPOSITIONCAP, POPE) and improved state-of-the-art results in fine-grained description, compositional generalization, and hallucination suppression when integrated with existing VLMs.

Conclusion: TDSR serves as an effective plug-and-play solution to enhance the capabilities of existing Vision-Language Models, offering better narrative coherence, computational efficiency, and superior performance in image captioning tasks.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) face an inherent contradiction in image
captioning: their powerful single-step generation capabilities often lead to a
myopic decision-making process. This makes it difficult to maintain global
narrative coherence while capturing rich details, a limitation that is
particularly pronounced in tasks that require multi-step and complex scene
description. To overcome this fundamental challenge, we redefine image
captioning as a goal-oriented hierarchical refinement planning problem, and
further propose a novel framework, named Top-Down Semantic Refinement (TDSR),
which models the generation process as a Markov Decision Process (MDP).
However, planning within the vast state space of a VLM presents a significant
computational hurdle. Our core contribution, therefore, is the design of a
highly efficient Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm tailored for VLMs. By
incorporating a visual-guided parallel expansion and a lightweight value
network, our TDSR reduces the call frequency to the expensive VLM by an order
of magnitude without sacrificing planning quality. Furthermore, an adaptive
early stopping mechanism dynamically matches computational overhead to the
image's complexity. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks, including
DetailCaps, COMPOSITIONCAP, and POPE, demonstrate that our TDSR, as a
plug-and-play module, can significantly enhance the performance of existing
VLMs (e.g., LLaVA-1.5, Qwen2.5-VL) by achieving state-of-the-art or highly
competitive results in fine-grained description, compositional generalization,
and hallucination suppression.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces TIRE, a novel method to improve subject identity preservation in 3D/4D generation using video tracking, 2D inpainting, and resplatting techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D/4D generation methods focus on photorealism, efficiency, and aesthetics but fail to maintain subject identity across viewpoints. Personalized 3D/4D generation needs more exploration.

Method: The method, TIRE (Track, Inpaint, REsplat), uses 3D assets as input, applies video tracking to locate areas for modification, performs subject-driven 2D inpainting, and resplats modified 2D views to 3D.

Result: TIRE significantly enhances semantic identity preservation in 3D/4D generation compared to existing techniques.

Conclusion: The study highlights the potential of personalized 3D/4D generation, demonstrating the effectiveness of TIRE in maintaining subject identity across perspectives.

Abstract: Current 3D/4D generation methods are usually optimized for photorealism,
efficiency, and aesthetics. However, they often fail to preserve the semantic
identity of the subject across different viewpoints. Adapting generation
methods with one or few images of a specific subject (also known as
Personalization or Subject-driven generation) allows generating visual content
that align with the identity of the subject. However, personalized 3D/4D
generation is still largely underexplored. In this work, we introduce TIRE
(Track, Inpaint, REsplat), a novel method for subject-driven 3D/4D generation.
It takes an initial 3D asset produced by an existing 3D generative model as
input and uses video tracking to identify the regions that need to be modified.
Then, we adopt a subject-driven 2D inpainting model for progressively infilling
the identified regions. Finally, we resplat the modified 2D multi-view
observations back to 3D while still maintaining consistency. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly improves identity
preservation in 3D/4D generation compared to state-of-the-art methods. Our

TL;DR: The paper studies the performance of automotive LiDAR in snowy conditions, developing a physics-based model and assessing its impact on object detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the degradation of LiDAR performance in adverse weather like snowfall and its impact on autonomous driving systems.

Method: Investigated LiDAR signal attenuation under snowfall, simulated snowy conditions from clear data, and tested effects on a pre-trained object detection model.

Result: Quantified LiDAR signal degradation due to snowfall and validated the physics-based model by comparing synthetic and real snowy data.

Conclusion: Snowfall significantly affects LiDAR performance, with physics-based simulations aiding in examining object detection model robustness.

Abstract: Because 3D structure of a roadway environment can be characterized directly
by a Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) sensors, they can be used to obtain
exceptional situational awareness for assitive and autonomous driving systems.
Although LiDARs demonstrate good performance in clean and clear weather
conditions, their performance significantly deteriorates in adverse weather
conditions such as those involving atmospheric precipitation. This may render
perception capabilities of autonomous systems that use LiDAR data in learning
based models to perform object detection and ranging ineffective. While efforts
have been made to enhance the accuracy of these models, the extent of signal
degradation under various weather conditions remains largely not quantified. In
this study, we focus on the performance of an automotive grade LiDAR in snowy
conditions in order to develop a physics-based model that examines failure
modes of a LiDAR sensor. Specifically, we investigated how the LiDAR signal
attenuates with different snowfall rates and how snow particles near the source
serve as small but efficient reflectors. Utilizing our model, we transform data
from clear conditions to simulate snowy scenarios, enabling a comparison of our
synthetic data with actual snowy conditions. Furthermore, we employ this
synthetic data, representative of different snowfall rates, to explore the
impact on a pre-trained object detection model, assessing its performance under
varying levels of snowfall

TL;DR: The paper introduces a benchmark named WAGIBench to evaluate vision-language models (VLMs) for goal inference in assistive wearable agents and presents a novel dataset for this purpose.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of prior work on goal inference for assistive wearable agents, aiming to reduce user effort by understanding goals from multimodal observations without explicit queries.

Method: Created a benchmark (WAGIBench) and collected a multimodal dataset including visual, audio, and contextual inputs from 348 participants to evaluate VLM performance in goal inference.

Result: Human performance achieves 93% accuracy, while the best VLM achieves 84%, and generative models produce relevant goals only 55% of the time. Models show improvement with additional relevant modalities.

Conclusion: While larger models improve performance, they are still far from practical application, demonstrating the need for further advancements in the field.

Abstract: There has been a surge of interest in assistive wearable agents: agents
embodied in wearable form factors (e.g., smart glasses) who take assistive
actions toward a user's goal/query (e.g. "Where did I leave my keys?"). In this
work, we consider the important complementary problem of inferring that goal
from multi-modal contextual observations. Solving this "goal inference" problem
holds the promise of eliminating the effort needed to interact with such an
agent. This work focuses on creating WAGIBench, a strong benchmark to measure
progress in solving this problem using vision-language models (VLMs). Given the
limited prior work in this area, we collected a novel dataset comprising 29
hours of multimodal data from 348 participants across 3,477 recordings,
featuring ground-truth goals alongside accompanying visual, audio, digital, and
longitudinal contextual observations. We validate that human performance
exceeds model performance, achieving 93% multiple-choice accuracy compared with
84% for the best-performing VLM. Generative benchmark results that evaluate
several families of modern vision-language models show that larger models
perform significantly better on the task, yet remain far from practical
usefulness, as they produce relevant goals only 55% of the time. Through a
modality ablation, we show that models benefit from extra information in
relevant modalities with minimal performance degradation from irrelevant
modalities.

Motivation: The main bottleneck in CryoET imaging is particle picking due to the reliance on manual labels, leaving most tomograms unutilized.

Method: An end-to-end heatmap-supervised detection model inspired by keypoint detection and a teacher-student co-training mechanism with innovations like multi-view pseudo-labeling and CryoET-specific DropBlock augmentation.

Result: Using the CZII dataset, the framework demonstrated a 10% improvement in F1 score compared to supervised baselines.

Conclusion: The proposed semi-supervised approach effectively utilizes unlabeled CryoET data, showcasing its potential to advance imaging accuracy and efficiency.

Abstract: Cryogenic Electron Tomography (CryoET) combined with sub-volume averaging
(SVA) is the only imaging modality capable of resolving protein structures
inside cells at molecular resolution. Particle picking, the task of localizing
and classifying target proteins in 3D CryoET volumes, remains the main
bottleneck. Due to the reliance on time-consuming manual labels, the vast
reserve of unlabeled tomograms remains underutilized. In this work, we present
a fast, label-efficient semi-supervised framework that exploits this untapped
data. Our framework consists of two components: (i) an end-to-end
heatmap-supervised detection model inspired by keypoint detection, and (ii) a
teacher-student co-training mechanism that enhances performance under sparse
labeling conditions. Furthermore, we introduce multi-view pseudo-labeling and a
CryoET-specific DropBlock augmentation strategy to further boost performance.
Extensive evaluations on the large-scale CZII dataset show that our approach
improves F1 by 10% over supervised baselines, underscoring the promise of
semi-supervised learning for leveraging unlabeled CryoET data.

Abstract: Recent advancements in 2D and 3D generative models have expanded the
capabilities of computer vision. However, generating high-quality 4D dynamic
content from a single static image remains a significant challenge. Traditional
methods have limitations in modeling temporal dependencies and accurately
capturing dynamic geometry changes, especially when considering variations in

solution that integrates 4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS) techniques with
Category-Agnostic Pose Estimation (CAPE) technology. This framework uses 3D
Gaussian Splatting to construct a 3D model from single images, then predicts
multi-view pose keypoints based on one-shot support from a chosen view,
leveraging supervisory signals to enhance motion consistency. Experimental
results show that DynaPose4D achieves excellent coherence, consistency, and

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a cost-efficient method to improve Knowledge Distillation by generating diverse teacher perspectives using a single network with branch augmentations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Knowledge Distillation methods rely on diverse teacher perspectives which often require multiple networks, increasing computational costs.

Method: Multiple branches are attached to a single teacher network, introducing angular diversity objectives to ensure meaningful variations among views. This generates diverse multi-views efficiently.

Result: The method improves distillation performance compared to existing methods and seamlessly integrates with other KD frameworks for consistent generalization improvements.

Conclusion: The proposed approach enhances KD by reducing computational costs while increasing teacher perspective diversity, leading to better student model training and adaptable integration into existing frameworks.

Abstract: Knowledge Distillation (KD) aims to train a lightweight student model by
transferring knowledge from a large, high-capacity teacher. Recent studies have
shown that leveraging diverse teacher perspectives can significantly improve
distillation performance; however, achieving such diversity typically requires
multiple teacher networks, leading to high computational costs. In this work,
we propose a novel cost-efficient knowledge augmentation method for KD that
generates diverse multi-views by attaching multiple branches to a single
teacher. To ensure meaningful semantic variation across multi-views, we
introduce two angular diversity objectives: 1) constrained inter-angle
diversify loss, which maximizes angles between augmented views while preserving
proximity to the original teacher output, and 2) intra-angle diversify loss,
which encourages an even distribution of views around the original output. The
ensembled knowledge from these angularly diverse views, along with the original
teacher, is distilled into the student. We further theoretically demonstrate
that our objectives increase the diversity among ensemble members and thereby
reduce the upper bound of the ensemble's expected loss, leading to more
effective distillation. Experimental results show that our method surpasses an
existing knowledge augmentation method across diverse configurations. Moreover,
the proposed method is compatible with other KD frameworks in a plug-and-play

### [304] [GateFuseNet: An Adaptive 3D Multimodal Neuroimaging Fusion Network for Parkinson's Disease Diagnosis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22507)
*Rui Jin,Chen Chen,Yin Liu,Hongfu Sun,Min Zeng,Min Li,Yang Gao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces GateFuseNet, a novel adaptive 3D multimodal fusion network combining QSM and T1w images for effective Parkinson's disease diagnosis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for improved diagnostic accuracy in Parkinson's disease using MRI, as conventional methods are less sensitive to its pathology.

Method: GateFuseNet uses a gated fusion module to integrate QSM and T1w features, applying modality-specific attention weights and selective feature modulation.

Result: The approach achieved superior accuracy (85%) and AUC (92.06%) compared to existing methods, supported by Grad-CAM insights and ablation studies.

Conclusion: GateFuseNet demonstrates significant advancement in accurately diagnosing Parkinson's disease, focusing on clinically relevant pathological regions.

Abstract: Accurate diagnosis of Parkinson's disease (PD) from MRI remains challenging
due to symptom variability and pathological heterogeneity. Most existing
methods rely on conventional magnitude-based MRI modalities, such as
T1-weighted images (T1w), which are less sensitive to PD pathology than
Quantitative Susceptibility Mapping (QSM), a phase-based MRI technique that
quantifies iron deposition in deep gray matter nuclei. In this study, we
propose GateFuseNet, an adaptive 3D multimodal fusion network that integrates
QSM and T1w images for PD diagnosis. The core innovation lies in a gated fusion
module that learns modality-specific attention weights and channel-wise gating
vectors for selective feature modulation. This hierarchical gating mechanism
enhances ROI-aware features while suppressing irrelevant signals. Experimental
results show that our method outperforms three existing state-of-the-art
approaches, achieving 85.00% accuracy and 92.06% AUC. Ablation studies further
validate the contributions of ROI guidance, multimodal integration, and fusion
positioning. Grad-CAM visualizations confirm the model's focus on clinically
relevant pathological regions. The source codes and pretrained models can be

*Yang Tian,Fan Liu,Jingyuan Zhang,Wei Bi,Yupeng Hu,Liqiang Nie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ORIG introduces an advanced framework for generating visually realistic and factually grounded images by iteratively refining prompts using multimodal evidence from the web.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the factual accuracy and reliability of image generation by addressing limitations in current retrieval-augmented approaches.

Method: ORIG employs an iterative process that combines multimodal retrieval, filtering, and knowledge integration to enrich prompts for image generation. It also uses a benchmark (FIG-Eval) for systematic evaluation.

Result: Experiments show ORIG significantly improves both the factual consistency and perceptual quality of generated images compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates the efficacy of ORIG and highlights promising advancements in open multimodal retrieval for generating factually accurate images.

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have achieved remarkable progress in
generating photorealistic and prompt-aligned images, but they often produce
outputs that contradict verifiable knowledge, especially when prompts involve
fine-grained attributes or time-sensitive events. Conventional
retrieval-augmented approaches attempt to address this issue by introducing
external information, yet they are fundamentally incapable of grounding
generation in accurate and evolving knowledge due to their reliance on static
sources and shallow evidence integration. To bridge this gap, we introduce
ORIG, an agentic open multimodal retrieval-augmented framework for Factual
Image Generation (FIG), a new task that requires both visual realism and
factual grounding. ORIG iteratively retrieves and filters multimodal evidence
from the web and incrementally integrates the refined knowledge into enriched
prompts to guide generation. To support systematic evaluation, we build
FIG-Eval, a benchmark spanning ten categories across perceptual, compositional,
and temporal dimensions. Experiments demonstrate that ORIG substantially
improves factual consistency and overall image quality over strong baselines,
highlighting the potential of open multimodal retrieval for factual image
generation.

### [306] [AesCrop: Aesthetic-driven Cropping Guided by Composition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22528)
*Yen-Hong Wong,Lai-Kuan Wong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents AesCrop, a composition-aware hybrid image cropping model, that outperforms existing methods in generating visually appealing crops with compositional attention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to improve aesthetic-driven image cropping for scenarios like view recommendation and thumbnail generation by addressing limitations of current methods related to diversity and globality while incorporating compositional aesthetics.

Method: AesCrop combines a VMamba image encoder, a novel Mamba Composition Attention Bias (MCAB), and a transformer decoder to generate rank-based image crops with quality scores by explicitly encoding compositional cues.

Result: Extensive experiments show AesCrop outperforms state-of-the-art methods both quantitatively and qualitatively in generating visually appealing image crops.

Conclusion: AesCrop successfully integrates compositional aesthetics into hybrid image cropping models, bridging gaps in globality and diversity, and demonstrates superior performance in aesthetic image cropping applications.

Abstract: Aesthetic-driven image cropping is crucial for applications like view
recommendation and thumbnail generation, where visual appeal significantly
impacts user engagement. A key factor in visual appeal is composition--the
deliberate arrangement of elements within an image. Some methods have
successfully incorporated compositional knowledge through evaluation-based and
regression-based paradigms. However, evaluation-based methods lack globality
while regression-based methods lack diversity. Recently, hybrid approaches that
integrate both paradigms have emerged, bridging the gap between these two to
achieve better diversity and globality. Notably, existing hybrid methods do not
incorporate photographic composition guidance, a key attribute that defines
photographic aesthetics. In this work, we introduce AesCrop, a
composition-aware hybrid image-cropping model that integrates a VMamba image
encoder, augmented with a novel Mamba Composition Attention Bias (MCAB) and a
transformer decoder to perform end-to-end rank-based image cropping, generating
multiple crops along with the corresponding quality scores. By explicitly
encoding compositional cues into the attention mechanism, MCAB directs AesCrop
to focus on the most compositionally salient regions. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that AesCrop outperforms current state-of-the-art methods,
delivering superior quantitative metrics and qualitatively more pleasing crops.

### [307] [SRSR: Enhancing Semantic Accuracy in Real-World Image Super-Resolution with Spatially Re-Focused Text-Conditioning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22534)
*Chen Chen,Majid Abdolshah,Violetta Shevchenko,Hongdong Li,Chang Xu,Pulak Purkait*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Spatially Re-focused Super-Resolution (SRSR) framework to address semantic ambiguities in diffusion-based super-resolution methods using refined text conditioning and classifier-free guidance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle semantic misalignment and hallucinated details caused by inaccuracies in text conditioning and cross-attention in diffusion-based super-resolution methods.

Method: Developed spatial refinement techniques: Spatially Re-focused Cross-Attention (SRCA) and Spatially Targeted Classifier-Free Guidance (STCFG) to improve text conditioning and prevent irrelevant distortions.

Result: SRSR demonstrated superior performance compared to seven state-of-the-art baselines across various standard and perceptual quality metrics.

Conclusion: The framework enhances both semantic fidelity and perceptual quality, proving effective in super-resolution applications.

Abstract: Existing diffusion-based super-resolution approaches often exhibit semantic
ambiguities due to inaccuracies and incompleteness in their text conditioning,
coupled with the inherent tendency for cross-attention to divert towards
irrelevant pixels. These limitations can lead to semantic misalignment and
hallucinated details in the generated high-resolution outputs. To address
these, we propose a novel, plug-and-play spatially re-focused super-resolution
(SRSR) framework that consists of two core components: first, we introduce
Spatially Re-focused Cross-Attention (SRCA), which refines text conditioning at
inference time by applying visually-grounded segmentation masks to guide
cross-attention. Second, we introduce a Spatially Targeted Classifier-Free
Guidance (STCFG) mechanism that selectively bypasses text influences on
ungrounded pixels to prevent hallucinations. Extensive experiments on both
synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that SRSR consistently
outperforms seven state-of-the-art baselines in standard fidelity metrics (PSNR
and SSIM) across all datasets, and in perceptual quality measures (LPIPS and
DISTS) on two real-world benchmarks, underscoring its effectiveness in
achieving both high semantic fidelity and perceptual quality in
super-resolution.

*Mahiro Ukai,Shuhei Kurita,Nakamasa Inoue*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces STATUS Bench, the first benchmark to evaluate VLMs' understanding of object states, showcasing current limitations and providing resources to advance research in object state recognition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the lack of evaluation mechanisms for Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to accurately identify subtle variations in object states, a crucial aspect for diverse applications.

Method: The authors presented STATUS Bench, which combines three simultaneous tasks: object state identification, image retrieval, and state change identification. It relies on a hand-crafted evaluation dataset and introduces STATUS Train, a large-scale training dataset with 13 million descriptions.

Result: Experiments reveal that current state-of-the-art VLMs struggle significantly with zero-shot performance in object state identification, even under rigorous evaluation schemes. Fine-tuned models, such as Qwen2.5-VL, show improved performance and match Gemini 2.0 Flash.

Conclusion: STATUS Bench and STATUS Train are essential tools for progressing object state recognition in VLMs, as current models exhibit substantial limitations in capturing nuanced distinctions of object states.

Abstract: Object state recognition aims to identify the specific condition of objects,
such as their positional states (e.g., open or closed) and functional states
(e.g., on or off). While recent Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are capable of
performing a variety of multimodal tasks, it remains unclear how precisely they
can identify object states. To alleviate this issue, we introduce the STAte and
Transition UnderStanding Benchmark (STATUS Bench), the first benchmark for
rigorously evaluating the ability of VLMs to understand subtle variations in
object states in diverse situations. Specifically, STATUS Bench introduces a
novel evaluation scheme that requires VLMs to perform three tasks
simultaneously: object state identification (OSI), image retrieval (IR), and
state change identification (SCI). These tasks are defined over our fully
hand-crafted dataset involving image pairs, their corresponding object state
descriptions and state change descriptions. Furthermore, we introduce a
large-scale training dataset, namely STATUS Train, which consists of 13 million
semi-automatically created descriptions. This dataset serves as the largest
resource to facilitate further research in this area. In our experiments, we
demonstrate that STATUS Bench enables rigorous consistency evaluation and
reveal that current state-of-the-art VLMs still significantly struggle to
capture subtle object state distinctions. Surprisingly, under the proposed
rigorous evaluation scheme, most open-weight VLMs exhibited chance-level
zero-shot performance. After fine-tuning on STATUS Train, Qwen2.5-VL achieved
performance comparable to Gemini 2.0 Flash. These findings underscore the
necessity of STATUS Bench and Train for advancing object state recognition in
VLM research.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new micro-expression dataset for conversational wild scenarios, along with a model, MELDAE, and boundary-aware loss function to improve detection and localization effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of micro-expression analysis which traditionally relies on controlled datasets, leading to poor performance in realistic, wild conversational settings.

Method: Developed a novel micro-expression dataset, MELDAE framework for end-to-end localization and detection, and a boundary-aware loss function targeting temporal accuracy.

Result: Their framework outperformed existing methods, improving the F1_{DR} localization metric by 17.72% compared to the strongest baseline, showcasing its superiority on new and existing datasets.

Conclusion: MELDAE and the new dataset significantly enhance micro-expression analysis for real-world applications, presenting advancements in temporal detection accuracy and generalizability.

Abstract: Accurately analyzing spontaneous, unconscious micro-expressions is crucial
for revealing true human emotions, but this task remains challenging in wild
scenarios, such as natural conversation. Existing research largely relies on
datasets from controlled laboratory environments, and their performance
degrades dramatically in the real world. To address this issue, we propose
three contributions: the first micro-expression dataset focused on
conversational-in-the-wild scenarios; an end-to-end localization and detection
framework, MELDAE; and a novel boundary-aware loss function that improves
temporal accuracy by penalizing onset and offset errors. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our framework achieves state-of-the-art results on the WDMD
dataset, improving the key F1_{DR} localization metric by 17.72% over the
strongest baseline, while also demonstrating excellent generalization
capabilities on existing benchmarks.

TL;DR: The paper introduces solutions for efficient 3D reconstruction in XLFM, including a benchmark dataset, a self-supervised learning method, and a novel consistency loss for improved volumetric neural imaging.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: XLFM has significant potential in neuroscience due to its capability for large-scale, high-resolution neural imaging. The challenges of lacking standardized datasets and efficient learning methods limit its 3D reconstruction capabilities.

Method: The paper introduces (1) XLFM-Zebrafish benchmark dataset for evaluation, (2) Masked View Modeling for Light Fields (MVN-LF), a self-supervised task for data-efficient angular learning, and (3) Optical Rendering Consistency Loss, enforcing physical alignment of reconstructions.

Result: On the XLFM-Zebrafish benchmark, the proposed approach improves PSNR by 7.7% compared to previous state-of-the-art methods, showcasing better 3D reconstruction accuracy.

Conclusion: These contributions address key limitations in XLFM, advancing the field of volumetric imaging and setting a reliable foundation for further neuroscience applications.

Abstract: Light field microscopy (LFM) has become an emerging tool in neuroscience for
large-scale neural imaging in vivo, notable for its single-exposure volumetric
imaging, broad field of view, and high temporal resolution. However,
learning-based 3D reconstruction in XLFM remains underdeveloped due to two core
challenges: the absence of standardized datasets and the lack of methods that
can efficiently model its angular-spatial structure while remaining physically
grounded. We address these challenges by introducing three key contributions.
First, we construct the XLFM-Zebrafish benchmark, a large-scale dataset and
evaluation suite for XLFM reconstruction. Second, we propose Masked View
Modeling for Light Fields (MVN-LF), a self-supervised task that learns angular
priors by predicting occluded views, improving data efficiency. Third, we
formulate the Optical Rendering Consistency Loss (ORC Loss), a differentiable
rendering constraint that enforces alignment between predicted volumes and
their PSF-based forward projections. On the XLFM-Zebrafish benchmark, our
method improves PSNR by 7.7% over state-of-the-art baselines.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces PFED, a framework for efficient UAV localization using aerial and satellite imagery, achieving high accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for effective UAV localization in GNSS-denied environments while addressing the limitations of resource-intensive existing methods.

Method: PFED employs hierarchical knowledge transfer and multi-view representation refinement, featuring HD-CVGL and UAPA during training, and MRM during inference.

Result: PFED achieves state-of-the-art accuracy (97.15% Recall@1) and substantial efficiency improvements compared to prior methods.

Conclusion: PFED proves feasible for real-time UAV applications with high performance on edge devices, suggesting practical applicability in the field.

Abstract: Cross-view geo-localization (CVGL) enables UAV localization by matching
aerial images to geo-tagged satellite databases, which is critical for
autonomous navigation in GNSS-denied environments. However, existing methods
rely on resource-intensive fine-grained feature extraction and alignment, where
multiple branches and modules significantly increase inference costs, limiting
their deployment on edge devices. We propose Precision-Focused Efficient Design
(PFED), a resource-efficient framework combining hierarchical knowledge
transfer and multi-view representation refinement. This innovative method
comprises two key components: 1) During training, Hierarchical Distillation
paradigm for fast and accurate CVGL (HD-CVGL), coupled with Uncertainty-Aware
Prediction Alignment (UAPA) to distill essential information and mitigate the
data imbalance without incurring additional inference overhead. 2) During
inference, an efficient Multi-view Refinement Module (MRM) leverages mutual
information to filter redundant samples and effectively utilize the multi-view
data. Extensive experiments show that PFED achieves state-of-the-art
performance in both accuracy and efficiency, reaching 97.15\% Recall@1 on
University-1652 while being over $5 \times$ more efficient in FLOPs and $3
\times$ faster than previous top methods. Furthermore, PFED runs at 251.5 FPS
on the AGX Orin edge device, demonstrating its practical viability for
real-time UAV applications. The project is available at

*Boyi Zheng,Yalin Zheng,Hrvoje Bogunović,Qing Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PSScreen V2 is a self-training framework designed for multi-retinal disease screening, capable of handling datasets with partial labels and domain shifts through its three-branch architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods rely heavily on fully labeled, single-domain datasets, which limit applicability across varied and partially labeled data. This work aims to overcome these constraints to enable robust screening across multiple datasets.

Method: PSScreen V2 incorporates a three-branch architecture with a teacher network generating pseudo labels for missing ones, and two student networks enhancing domain robustness and addressing uncertainties using LF-Dropout and LF-Uncert strategies.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate PSScreen V2's superior performance in domain generalization and compatibility with diverse models and datasets, including new domains like chest X-rays and vision foundation models.

Conclusion: PSScreen V2 is effective, adaptable, and generalizable, providing significant advancements for screening multiple retinal diseases while addressing major challenges of label absence and domain variability.

Abstract: In this work, we propose PSScreen V2, a partially supervised self-training
framework for multiple retinal disease screening. Unlike previous methods that
rely on fully labelled or single-domain datasets, PSScreen V2 is designed to
learn from multiple partially labelled datasets with different distributions,
addressing both label absence and domain shift challenges. To this end,
PSScreen V2 adopts a three-branch architecture with one teacher and two student
networks. The teacher branch generates pseudo labels from weakly augmented
images to address missing labels, while the two student branches introduce
novel feature augmentation strategies: Low-Frequency Dropout (LF-Dropout),
which enhances domain robustness by randomly discarding domain-related
low-frequency components, and Low-Frequency Uncertainty (LF-Uncert), which
estimates uncertain domain variability via adversarially learned Gaussian
perturbations of low-frequency statistics. Extensive experiments on multiple
in-domain and out-of-domain fundus datasets demonstrate that PSScreen V2
achieves state-of-the-art performance and superior domain generalization
ability. Furthermore, compatibility tests with diverse backbones, including the
vision foundation model DINOv2, as well as evaluations on chest X-ray datasets,
highlight the universality and adaptability of the proposed framework. The

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new method, Projection Embedded Diffusion Bridge (PEDB), for reconstructing CT images from incomplete projection data using a reverse stochastic differential equation with embedded data consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges in CT image reconstruction from incomplete data, particularly improving fidelity and structural detail recovery using data consistency that aligns with observed projections.

Method: PEDB utilizes a novel reverse stochastic differential equation that samples clean images conditioned on both FBP reconstructions and incomplete projection data, embedding projection data directly into the score function to ensure consistency.

Result: PEDB consistently achieves superior performance across varying types of incomplete projection data (sparse-view, limited-angle, truncated), outperforming state-of-the-art diffusion bridge models.

Conclusion: The method significantly improves CT image reconstruction fidelity and detail recovery by leveraging embedded data consistency in the reverse diffusion process, showcasing robust and enhanced performance.

Abstract: Reconstructing CT images from incomplete projection data remains challenging
due to the ill-posed nature of the problem. Diffusion bridge models have
recently shown promise in restoring clean images from their corresponding
Filtered Back Projection (FBP) reconstructions, but incorporating data
consistency into these models remains largely underexplored. Incorporating data
consistency can improve reconstruction fidelity by aligning the reconstructed
image with the observed projection data, and can enhance detail recovery by
integrating structural information contained in the projections. In this work,
we propose the Projection Embedded Diffusion Bridge (PEDB). PEDB introduces a
novel reverse stochastic differential equation (SDE) to sample from the
distribution of clean images conditioned on both the FBP reconstruction and the
incomplete projection data. By explicitly conditioning on the projection data
in sampling the clean images, PEDB naturally incorporates data consistency. We
embed the projection data into the score function of the reverse SDE. Under
certain assumptions, we derive a tractable expression for the posterior score.
In addition, we introduce a free parameter to control the level of
stochasticity in the reverse process. We also design a discretization scheme
for the reverse SDE to mitigate discretization error. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that PEDB achieves strong performance in CT reconstruction from
three types of incomplete data, including sparse-view, limited-angle, and
truncated projections. For each of these types, PEDB outperforms evaluated
state-of-the-art diffusion bridge models across standard, noisy, and
domain-shift evaluations.

*Yassh Ramchandani,Vijayashekhar S S,Jignesh S. Bhatt*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces SWAN, a self-supervised wavelet neural network, for effectively estimating endmembers and abundances from hyperspectral imagery using a three-stage process.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the efficiency and accuracy of joint estimation of endmembers and abundances in hyperspectral images while promoting self-supervised learning techniques.

Method: SWAN uses a three-stage process: SWANencoder (lower-dimensional latent mapping), SWANdecoder (reconstruction from latent space), and SWANforward (physics-based learning). A specialized loss function in the image acquisition domain eliminates the need for labeled data, while regularizers address overfitting and preserve spatial information.

Result: Experimental validation on synthetic and real benchmark hyperspectral datasets show performance improvements over state-of-the-art neural network-based unmixing techniques.

Conclusion: SWAN achieves enhanced performance in hyperspectral image unmixing through self-supervised learning and compact network design, making it suitable for practical applications.

Abstract: In this article, we present SWAN: a three-stage, self-supervised wavelet
neural network for joint estimation of endmembers and abundances from
hyperspectral imagery. The contiguous and overlapping hyperspectral band images
are first expanded to Biorthogonal wavelet basis space that provides sparse,
distributed, and multi-scale representations. The idea is to exploit latent
symmetries from thus obtained invariant and covariant features using a
self-supervised learning paradigm. The first stage, SWANencoder maps the input
wavelet coefficients to a compact lower-dimensional latent space. The second
stage, SWANdecoder uses the derived latent representation to reconstruct the
input wavelet coefficients. Interestingly, the third stage SWANforward learns
the underlying physics of the hyperspectral image. A three-stage combined loss
function is formulated in the image acquisition domain that eliminates the need
for ground truth and enables self-supervised training. Adam is employed for
optimizing the proposed loss function, while Sigmoid with a dropout of 0.3 is
incorporated to avoid possible overfitting. Kernel regularizers bound the
magnitudes and preserve spatial variations in the estimated endmember
coefficients. The output of SWANencoder represents estimated abundance maps
during inference, while weights of SWANdecoder are retrieved to extract
endmembers. Experiments are conducted on two benchmark synthetic data sets with
different signal-to-noise ratios as well as on three real benchmark
hyperspectral data sets while comparing the results with several
state-of-the-art neural network-based unmixing methods. The qualitative,
quantitative, and ablation results show performance enhancement by learning a
resilient unmixing function as well as promoting self-supervision and compact
network parameters for practical applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper explores the use of cross-species transfer learning for dairy cattle pose estimation using a transformer model trained on synthetic zebra data. While achieving high accuracy on in-distribution data, the model faced challenges in generalizing to unseen environments, highlighting the limitations of synthetic-to-real domain transfer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve pose estimation for livestock, specifically dairy cows, under agricultural conditions, addressing the lack of large annotated datasets for this purpose.

Method: The study adapted the ZebraPose model, which was trained on synthetic zebra images, for 27-keypoint detection in dairy cows. The evaluation used three data configurations: a custom on-farm dataset, the APT-36K benchmark subset, and their combination, systematically testing model performance and generalization.

Result: The combined model showed promising in-distribution performance (AP = 0.86, AR = 0.87, PCK 0.5 = 0.869). However, substantial generalization failures arose when applied to unseen barns and cow populations, indicating a significant synthetic-to-real domain gap.

Conclusion: The study concludes that morphological similarity alone does not guarantee effective cross-domain transfer. It emphasizes the need for agricultural AI systems designed with farm-level realism, environmental robustness, and diverse benchmark datasets to ensure scalability and reliability in real-world applications.

Abstract: Pose estimation serves as a cornerstone of computer vision for understanding
animal posture, behavior, and welfare. Yet, agricultural applications remain
constrained by the scarcity of large, annotated datasets for livestock,
especially dairy cattle. This study evaluates the potential and limitations of
cross-species transfer learning by adapting ZebraPose - a vision
transformer-based model trained on synthetic zebra imagery - for 27-keypoint
detection in dairy cows under real barn conditions. Using three configurations
- a custom on-farm dataset (375 images, Sussex, New Brunswick, Canada), a
subset of the APT-36K benchmark dataset, and their combination, we
systematically assessed model accuracy and generalization across environments.
While the combined model achieved promising performance (AP = 0.86, AR = 0.87,
PCK 0.5 = 0.869) on in-distribution data, substantial generalization failures
occurred when applied to unseen barns and cow populations. These findings
expose the synthetic-to-real domain gap as a major obstacle to agricultural AI
deployment and emphasize that morphological similarity between species is
insufficient for cross-domain transfer. The study provides practical insights
into dataset diversity, environmental variability, and computational
constraints that influence real-world deployment of livestock monitoring
systems. We conclude with a call for agriculture-first AI design, prioritizing
farm-level realism, cross-environment robustness, and open benchmark datasets
to advance trustworthy and scalable animal-centric technologies.

Motivation: Atypical mitotic figures are critical biomarkers but are difficult to recognize reliably due to class imbalance and variability in imaging domains.

Method: The study uses DenseNet-121 combined with stain-aware augmentation, geometric/intensity transformations, and learning techniques addressing class imbalance such as weighted sampling and hybrid loss functions.

Result: The proposed model achieved a balanced accuracy of 85.0%, AUROC 0.927, sensitivity 89.2%, and specificity 80.9% across multiple independent domains.

Conclusion: This DenseNet-121-based framework offers robust classification performance for atypical mitotic figures, generalizes well across domains, and is suitable for computational pathology workflows.

Abstract: Atypical mitotic figures are important biomarkers of tumor aggressiveness in
histopathology, yet reliable recognition remains challenging due to severe
class imbalance and variability across imaging domains. We present a
DenseNet-121-based framework tailored for atypical mitosis classification in
the MIDOG 2025 (Track 2) setting. Our method integrates stain-aware
augmentation (Macenko), geometric and intensity transformations, and
imbalance-aware learning via weighted sampling with a hybrid objective
combining class-weighted binary cross-entropy and focal loss. Trained
end-to-end with AdamW and evaluated across multiple independent domains, the
model demonstrates strong generalization under scanner and staining shifts,
achieving balanced accuracy 85.0%, AUROC 0.927, sensitivity 89.2%, and
specificity 80.9% on the official test set. These results indicate that
combining DenseNet-121 with stain-aware augmentation and imbalance-adaptive
objectives yields a robust, domain-generalizable framework for atypical mitosis
classification suitable for real-world computational pathology workflows.

Motivation: To address the need for an efficient detection and classification system for common tea leaf diseases caused by pests and pathogens, improving agricultural productivity.

Method: The authors evaluated SSD MobileNet V2 and Faster R-CNN ResNet50 V1 for object detection. Additionally, Mask R-CNN was used for object instance segmentation, with a custom method to calculate the damaged areas on the leaves.

Result: Faster R-CNN ResNet50 V1 was found to perform better with a precision of 0.252 and mAP of 25% compared to SSD MobileNet V2, which had a mAP of 20.9%. The paper also implemented a method to measure the diseased areas of leaves using Mask R-CNN.

Conclusion: Faster R-CNN ResNet50 V1 outperforms SSD MobileNet V2 in tea leaf disease detection. This approach can potentially improve tea farming practices by accurately identifying and analyzing diseased leaf areas.

Abstract: The proposed solution is Deep Learning Technique that will be able classify

### [318] [Self-Attention Decomposition For Training Free Diffusion Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22650)
*Tharun Anand,Mohammad Hassan Vali,Arno Solin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents a method to improve controllability in image editing using diffusion models by identifying interpretable editing directions through eigenvectors of self-attention matrices, reducing editing time by 60%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion models excel in image synthesis but lack effective and efficient precise editing capabilities due to reliance on sampling or auxiliary networks.

Method: The method analytically derives semantic editing directions from pretrained self-attention weight matrices of diffusion models, avoiding the need for additional training or datasets.

Result: Experiments reveal that the approach generates high-quality image edits with improved efficiency (60% reduction in editing time) across various datasets.

Conclusion: The study provides an efficient tool for semantic editing in diffusion models by leveraging intrinsic model properties, improving control and reducing computational demands.

Abstract: Diffusion models achieve remarkable fidelity in image synthesis, yet precise
control over their outputs for targeted editing remains challenging. A key step
toward controllability is to identify interpretable directions in the model's
latent representations that correspond to semantic attributes. Existing
approaches for finding interpretable directions typically rely on sampling
large sets of images or training auxiliary networks, which limits efficiency.
We propose an analytical method that derives semantic editing directions
directly from the pretrained parameters of diffusion models, requiring neither
additional data nor fine-tuning. Our insight is that self-attention weight
matrices encode rich structural information about the data distribution learned
during training. By computing the eigenvectors of these weight matrices, we
obtain robust and interpretable editing directions. Experiments demonstrate
that our method produces high-quality edits across multiple datasets while
reducing editing time significantly by 60% over current benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces SARCLIP, a vision-language foundation model for Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery, trained on a new dataset SARCLIP-1M to improve multimodal alignment and zero-shot recognition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations of current SAR foundation models, which overlook multimodal alignment and zero-shot target recognition, by creating an effective vision-language framework.

Method: The authors developed SARCLIP, a vision-language model trained on SARCLIP-1M (over one million text-image pairs) using a contrastive learning and domain transferring strategy to link SAR imagery with text.

Result: SARCLIP outperforms state-of-the-art foundation models in feature extraction, interpretation, and zero-shot classification, demonstrating superior capability in semantic understanding of SAR imagery.

Conclusion: SARCLIP advances multimodal understanding in SAR imaging and paves the way for further development in zero-shot classification and vision-language tasks for the SAR domain. Datasets and codes will be publicly available.

Abstract: Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) has emerged as a crucial imaging modality due
to its all-weather capabilities. While recent advancements in self-supervised
learning and Masked Image Modeling (MIM) have paved the way for SAR foundation
models, these approaches primarily focus on low-level visual features, often
overlooking multimodal alignment and zero-shot target recognition within SAR
imagery. To address this limitation, we construct SARCLIP-1M, a large-scale
vision language dataset comprising over one million text-image pairs aggregated
from existing datasets. We further introduce SARCLIP, the first vision language
foundation model tailored for the SAR domain. Our SARCLIP model is trained
using a contrastive vision language learning approach by domain transferring
strategy, enabling it to bridge the gap between SAR imagery and textual
descriptions. Extensive experiments on image-text retrieval and zero-shot
classification tasks demonstrate the superior performance of SARCLIP in feature
extraction and interpretation, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art
foundation models and advancing the semantic understanding of SAR imagery. The
code and datasets will be released soon.

*Wenkai Zhu,Xu Li,Qimin Xu,Benwu Wang,Kun Wei,Yiming Peng,Zihang Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces LVD-GS, a novel LiDAR-Visual 3D Gaussian Splatting SLAM to overcome pose errors and scale ambiguity in mapping for dynamic outdoor scenes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D Gaussian Splatting SLAM techniques face limitations in dynamic outdoor environments due to dependence on single representation schemes, causing errors and ambiguities.

Method: The authors developed a hierarchical collaborative representation module for mapping optimization and a joint dynamic modeling module to address dynamic objects’ influence, using segmentation and uncertainty estimates.

Result: LVD-GS significantly improves upon state-of-the-art performance in SLAM tasks tested on KITTI, nuScenes, and self-collected datasets.

Conclusion: This paper demonstrates the effectiveness of LVD-GS in enhancing reconstruction robustness and mitigating scale drift in large-scale, dynamic mapping environments.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting SLAM has emerged as a widely used technique for
high-fidelity mapping in spatial intelligence. However, existing methods often
rely on a single representation scheme, which limits their performance in
large-scale dynamic outdoor scenes and leads to cumulative pose errors and
scale ambiguity. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{LVD-GS}, a
novel LiDAR-Visual 3D Gaussian Splatting SLAM system. Motivated by the human
chain-of-thought process for information seeking, we introduce a hierarchical
collaborative representation module that facilitates mutual reinforcement for
mapping optimization, effectively mitigating scale drift and enhancing
reconstruction robustness. Furthermore, to effectively eliminate the influence
of dynamic objects, we propose a joint dynamic modeling module that generates
fine-grained dynamic masks by fusing open-world segmentation with implicit
residual constraints, guided by uncertainty estimates from DINO-Depth features.
Extensive evaluations on KITTI, nuScenes, and self-collected datasets
demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to
existing methods.

### [321] [Alias-Free ViT: Fractional Shift Invariance via Linear Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22673)
*Hagay Michaeli,Daniel Soudry*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The authors introduce Alias-Free Vision Transformers (ViTs) to enhance robustness to image translations by incorporating alias-free downsampling and shift-equivariant attention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision Transformers lack architectural inductive biases like convnets, resulting in sensitivity to image translations. Alias-free methods have improved convnets in this aspect, motivating their application to ViTs.

Method: Two strategies are used: alias-free downsampling and nonlinearities, along with linear cross-covariance attention achieving shift-equivariance.

Result: The model exhibits competitive image classification performance and surpasses similar-sized models in robustness to adversarial translations.

Conclusion: Alias-Free ViTs address the translation sensitivity of standard ViTs, offering improved robustness and maintaining performance.

Abstract: Transformers have emerged as a competitive alternative to convnets in vision
tasks, yet they lack the architectural inductive bias of convnets, which may
hinder their potential performance. Specifically, Vision Transformers (ViTs)
are not translation-invariant and are more sensitive to minor image
translations than standard convnets. Previous studies have shown, however, that
convnets are also not perfectly shift-invariant, due to aliasing in
downsampling and nonlinear layers. Consequently, anti-aliasing approaches have
been proposed to certify convnets' translation robustness. Building on this
line of work, we propose an Alias-Free ViT, which combines two main components.
First, it uses alias-free downsampling and nonlinearities. Second, it uses
linear cross-covariance attention that is shift-equivariant to both integer and
fractional translations, enabling a shift-invariant global representation. Our
model maintains competitive performance in image classification and outperforms
similar-sized models in terms of robustness to adversarial translations.

*Jinpeng Dong,Chen Li,Yutong Lin,Jingwen Fu,Sanping Zhou,Nanning Zheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents DAMap, a framework for improving high-definition (HD) map construction for autonomous vehicles, addressing issues in classification and localization prediction quality in existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study seeks to resolve inherent task misalignment problems in HD map element prediction, which affects the safety of autonomous driving vehicles.

Method: DAMap comprises three components: Distance-aware Focal Loss (DAFL) for better label assignment, Task Modulated Deformable Attention (TMDA) for task-specific features, and Hybrid Loss Scheme (HLS) for enhanced utilization of DAFL.

Result: Experimental evaluation demonstrates consistent improvement in performance across multiple metrics, datasets (NuScenes and Argoverse2), and configurations.

Conclusion: The proposed DAMap overcomes task misalignment issues in HD map predictions, contributing to safer autonomous driving systems.

Abstract: Predicting High-definition (HD) map elements with high quality (high
classification and localization scores) is crucial to the safety of autonomous
driving vehicles. However, current methods perform poorly in high quality
predictions due to inherent task misalignment. Two main factors are responsible
for misalignment: 1) inappropriate task labels due to one-to-many matching
queries sharing the same labels, and 2) sub-optimal task features due to
task-shared sampling mechanism. In this paper, we reveal two inherent defects
in current methods and develop a novel HD map construction method named DAMap
to address these problems. Specifically, DAMap consists of three components:
Distance-aware Focal Loss (DAFL), Hybrid Loss Scheme (HLS), and Task Modulated
Deformable Attention (TMDA). The DAFL is introduced to assign appropriate
classification labels for one-to-many matching samples. The TMDA is proposed to
obtain discriminative task-specific features. Furthermore, the HLS is proposed
to better utilize the advantages of the DAFL. We perform extensive experiments
and consistently achieve performance improvement on the NuScenes and Argoverse2
benchmarks under different metrics, baselines, splits, backbones, and
schedules. Code will be available at https://github.com/jpdong-xjtu/DAMap.

*Hibiki Ayabe,Kazushi Okamoto,Koki Karube,Atsushi Shibata,Kei Harada*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study introduces a machine learning model to predict building attributes from facade images, addressing missing or outdated metadata issues in Japan's housing market.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enhance disaster risk assessment and improve insurance pricing by accurately classifying building fireproof structures in the absence of reliable metadata.

Method: A multi-task learning model is used to jointly predict construction year, structure type, and property type. A rule-based mapping aligns predictions with official insurance classifications for fireproof classes.

Result: The model achieved high accuracy in predicting construction year and robust classification of building structure types. It performed well despite data imbalances and effectively captured visual cues related to age and materials.

Conclusion: The study shows that scalable and interpretable image-based systems are feasible for managing risk assessment, insurance processes, and urban planning.

Abstract: Structural fireproof classification is vital for disaster risk assessment and
insurance pricing in Japan. However, key building metadata such as construction
year and structure type are often missing or outdated, particularly in the
second-hand housing market. This study proposes a multi-task learning model
that predicts these attributes from facade images. The model jointly estimates
the construction year, building structure, and property type, from which the
structural fireproof class - defined as H (non-fireproof), T (semi-fireproof),
or M (fireproof) - is derived via a rule-based mapping based on official
insurance criteria. We trained and evaluated the model using a large-scale
dataset of Japanese residential images, applying rigorous filtering and
deduplication. The model achieved high accuracy in construction-year regression
and robust classification across imbalanced categories. Qualitative analyses
show that it captures visual cues related to building age and materials. Our
approach demonstrates the feasibility of scalable, interpretable, image-based
risk-profiling systems, offering potential applications in insurance, urban
planning, and disaster preparedness.

TL;DR: RoboSVG introduces an advanced multimodal framework for generating interactive SVGs guided by textual, visual, and numerical signals, supported by the large-scale RoboDraw dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robots and digital design systems increasingly rely on SVGs for visual and motion encoding, necessitating advanced generation tools that can integrate multi-modal inputs like text, images, and numerical data.

Method: This paper proposes the RoboSVG framework, which synthesizes and refines SVGs through multimodal guidance incorporating text, image, and numerical input, supported by a large-scale dataset RoboDraw.

Result: RoboSVG demonstrates superior performance in query compliance and visual fidelity through comprehensive experiments, outperforming existing methods in SVG generation across various tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed RoboSVG framework sets a new benchmark in SVG generation tasks by leveraging a novel dataset and refinement methods. Both the dataset and source code will be publicly available to advance this field.

Abstract: Scalable Vector Graphics (SVGs) are fundamental to digital design and robot
control, encoding not only visual structure but also motion paths in
interactive drawings. In this work, we introduce RoboSVG, a unified multimodal
framework for generating interactive SVGs guided by textual, visual, and
numerical signals. Given an input query, the RoboSVG model first produces
multimodal guidance, then synthesizes candidate SVGs through dedicated
generation modules, and finally refines them under numerical guidance to yield
high-quality outputs. To support this framework, we construct RoboDraw, a
large-scale dataset of one million examples, each pairing an SVG generation
condition (e.g., text, image, and partial SVG) with its corresponding
ground-truth SVG code. RoboDraw dataset enables systematic study of four tasks,
including basic generation (Text-to-SVG, Image-to-SVG) and interactive
generation (PartialSVG-to-SVG, PartialImage-to-SVG). Extensive experiments
demonstrate that RoboSVG achieves superior query compliance and visual fidelity
across tasks, establishing a new state of the art in versatile SVG generation.

### [325] [VADTree: Explainable Training-Free Video Anomaly Detection via Hierarchical Granularity-Aware Tree](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22693)
*Wenlong Li,Yifei Xu,Yuan Rao,Zhenhua Wang,Shuiguang Deng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes VADTree, an advanced video anomaly detection method that utilizes hierarchical sampling for better anomaly detection without requiring training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for video anomaly detection either rely on extensive in-domain training data or fail to explain anomalies effectively. Existing training-free methods struggle to detect anomalies with varying temporal spans.

Method: The paper introduces VADTree, a Hierarchical Granularity-aware Tree (HGTree) structure for flexible temporal sampling in videos. It uses a Generic Event Boundary Detection model to identify potential anomaly events, and integrates multi-dimensional priors into visual language models for enhanced anomaly detection and reasoning. Multi-granularity anomaly scores are then combined using an inter-cluster node correlation method.

Result: VADTree achieves state-of-the-art results in training-free video anomaly detection across three challenging datasets, while significantly reducing the number of sampled video segments.

Conclusion: Hierarchical and flexible video sampling combined with powerful pre-trained models enables a more accurate and efficient detection of anomalies in videos, as demonstrated by the proposed VADTree approach.

Abstract: Video anomaly detection (VAD) focuses on identifying anomalies in videos.
Supervised methods demand substantial in-domain training data and fail to
deliver clear explanations for anomalies. In contrast, training-free methods
leverage the knowledge reserves and language interactivity of large pre-trained
models to detect anomalies. However, the current fixed-length temporal window
sampling approaches struggle to accurately capture anomalies with varying
temporal spans. Therefore, we propose VADTree that utilizes a Hierarchical
Granularityaware Tree (HGTree) structure for flexible sampling in VAD. VADTree
leverages the knowledge embedded in a pre-trained Generic Event Boundary
Detection (GEBD) model to characterize potential anomaly event boundaries.
Specifically, VADTree decomposes the video into generic event nodes based on
boundary confidence, and performs adaptive coarse-fine hierarchical structuring
and redundancy removal to construct the HGTree. Then, the multi-dimensional
priors are injected into the visual language models (VLMs) to enhance the
node-wise anomaly perception, and anomaly reasoning for generic event nodes is
achieved via large language models (LLMs). Finally, an inter-cluster node
correlation method is used to integrate the multi-granularity anomaly scores.
Extensive experiments on three challenging datasets demonstrate that VADTree
achieves state-of-the-art performance in training-free settings while
drastically reducing the number of sampled video segments. The code will be
available at https://github.com/wenlongli10/VADTree.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Windsock and DANCE Instruction Tuning to improve multimodal retrieval-augmented generation methods in large language models, addressing challenges such as retrieval timing, modality selection, and retrieved information utilization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MRAG methods suffer from inefficiencies in retrieval strategies, modality selection, and utilization of external knowledge, which hinders response quality and increases computational costs.

Method: The authors propose a query-dependent Windsock module for dynamic retrieval decisions and introduce Dynamic Noise-Resistance Instruction Tuning to enhance information usage while addressing noise robustness. They additionally convert question-answering datasets for training using self-assessment techniques.

Result: The proposed method improves generation quality by 17.07% and reduces retrieval times by 8.95%, showing better efficiency and adaptability.

Conclusion: Windsock and DANCE offer a significant advance in MRAG approaches by optimizing retrieval processes and improving the quality and efficiency of multimodal large language model outputs.

Abstract: Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (MRAG) has emerged as a promising
method to generate factual and up-to-date responses of Multimodal Large
Language Models (MLLMs) by incorporating non-parametric knowledge from external
knowledge bases. However, existing MRAG approaches suffer from static retrieval
strategies, inflexible modality selection, and suboptimal utilization of
retrieved information, leading to three critical challenges: determining when
to retrieve, what modality to incorporate, and how to utilize retrieved
information effectively. To address these challenges, we introduce Windsock, a
query-dependent module making decisions on retrieval necessity and modality
selection, effectively reducing computational overhead and improving response
quality. Additionally, we propose Dynamic Noise-Resistance (DANCE) Instruction
Tuning, an adaptive training strategy that enhances MLLMs' ability to utilize
retrieved information while maintaining robustness against noise. Moreover, we
adopt a self-assessment approach leveraging knowledge within MLLMs to convert
question-answering datasets to MRAG training datasets. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our proposed method significantly improves the generation
quality by 17.07% while reducing 8.95% retrieval times.

*Vittorio Bernuzzi,Leonardo Rossi,Tomaso Fontanini,Massimo Bertozzi,Andrea Prati*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WaveMAE is a self-supervised pretraining framework leveraging wavelet transforms and geographical priors to improve downstream tasks in multispectral satellite imagery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Annotated data scarcity in remote sensing prompts the need for self-supervised learning approaches that generalize well across diverse tasks.

Method: WaveMAE utilizes a masked autoencoding framework with discrete wavelet transform for frequency component separation and Geo-conditioned Positional Encoding for geographic priors.

Result: WaveMAE demonstrates consistent performance improvements over state-of-the-art methods in semantic segmentation, regression, and other benchmarks despite using fewer parameters.

Conclusion: WaveMAE is established as a robust, geographically-informed foundation model for multispectral remote sensing imagery.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has recently emerged as a key strategy for
building foundation models in remote sensing, where the scarcity of annotated
data limits the applicability of fully supervised approaches. In this work, we
introduce WaveMAE, a masked autoencoding framework tailored for multispectral
satellite imagery. Unlike conventional pixel-based reconstruction, WaveMAE
leverages a multi-level Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) to disentangle
frequency components and guide the encoder toward learning scale-aware
high-frequency representations. We further propose a Geo-conditioned Positional
Encoding (GPE), which incorporates geographical priors via Spherical Harmonics,
encouraging embeddings that respect both semantic and geospatial structure. To
ensure fairness in evaluation, all methods are pretrained on the same dataset
(fMoW-S2) and systematically evaluated on the diverse downstream tasks of the
PANGAEA benchmark, spanning semantic segmentation, regression, change
detection, and multilabel classification. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that WaveMAE achieves consistent improvements over prior state-of-the-art
approaches, with substantial gains on segmentation and regression benchmarks.
The effectiveness of WaveMAE pretraining is further demonstrated by showing
that even a lightweight variant, containing only 26.4% of the parameters,
achieves state-of-the-art performance. Our results establish WaveMAE as a
strong and geographically informed foundation model for multispectral remote
sensing imagery.

*Hao Li,Zhengyu Zou,Fangfu Liu,Xuanyang Zhang,Fangzhou Hong,Yukang Cao,Yushi Lan,Manyuan Zhang,Gang Yu,Dingwen Zhang,Ziwei Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces InstanceGrounded Geometry Transformer (IGGT), a model integrating spatial reconstruction and contextual understanding using 2D data inputs for 3D scene analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D models often focus on geometry without effectively integrating spatial reconstruction with semantic understanding, leading to limited generalization and poor performance in advanced 3D interpretation tasks.

Method: The proposed IGGT employs 3D-Consistent Contrastive Learning to encode a unified representation for 3D geometric structures and instance-level clustering using only 2D visual inputs. Additionally, a new dataset, InsScene-15K, facilitates the training process with RGB images, poses, depth maps, and masks.

Result: The approach demonstrates the ability to lift 2D inputs consistently into coherent 3D scenes while maintaining distinct object instances and integrating spatial and semantic understanding.

Conclusion: Unifying spatial reconstruction and semantic analysis improves generalization and performance in 3D scene understanding, paving the way for more adaptable and coherent models for downstream tasks.

Abstract: Humans naturally perceive the geometric structure and semantic content of a
3D world as intertwined dimensions, enabling coherent and accurate
understanding of complex scenes. However, most prior approaches prioritize
training large geometry models for low-level 3D reconstruction and treat
high-level spatial understanding in isolation, overlooking the crucial
interplay between these two fundamental aspects of 3D-scene analysis, thereby
limiting generalization and leading to poor performance in downstream 3D
understanding tasks. Recent attempts have mitigated this issue by simply
aligning 3D models with specific language models, thus restricting perception
to the aligned model's capacity and limiting adaptability to downstream tasks.
In this paper, we propose InstanceGrounded Geometry Transformer (IGGT), an
end-to-end large unified transformer to unify the knowledge for both spatial
reconstruction and instance-level contextual understanding. Specifically, we
design a 3D-Consistent Contrastive Learning strategy that guides IGGT to encode
a unified representation with geometric structures and instance-grounded
clustering through only 2D visual inputs. This representation supports
consistent lifting of 2D visual inputs into a coherent 3D scene with explicitly
distinct object instances. To facilitate this task, we further construct
InsScene-15K, a large-scale dataset with high-quality RGB images, poses, depth
maps, and 3D-consistent instance-level mask annotations with a novel data
curation pipeline.

remain limited. We introduce LRW-Persian, the largest in-the-wild Persian
word-level lipreading dataset, comprising $743$ target words and over
$414{,}000$ video samples extracted from more than $1{,}900$ hours of footage
across $67$ television programs. Designed as a benchmark-ready resource,
LRW-Persian provides speaker-disjoint training and test splits, wide regional
and dialectal coverage, and rich per-clip metadata including head pose, age,
and gender. To ensure large-scale data quality, we establish a fully automated
end-to-end curation pipeline encompassing transcription based on Automatic
Speech Recognition(ASR), active-speaker localization, quality filtering, and
pose/mask screening. We further fine-tune two widely used lipreading
architectures on LRW-Persian, establishing reference performance and
demonstrating the difficulty of Persian visual speech recognition. By filling a

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation lies in the increasing importance of cross-view visual understanding for applications such as autonomous navigation, urban planning, and augmented reality.

Method: The paper reviews state-of-the-art techniques like CNNs, ViTs for cross-view localization, and GANs, diffusion models for cross-view synthesis.

Result: This survey organizes and summarizes the advancements, challenges, limitations, and future directions in cross-view localization and synthesis.

Conclusion: By analyzing recent advancements, the paper paves the way for further research and improvements in tackling cross-view tasks.

Abstract: Cross-view localization and synthesis are two fundamental tasks in cross-view
visual understanding, which deals with cross-view datasets: overhead (satellite
or aerial) and ground-level imagery. These tasks have gained increasing
attention due to their broad applications in autonomous navigation, urban
planning, and augmented reality. Cross-view localization aims to estimate the
geographic position of ground-level images based on information provided by
overhead imagery while cross-view synthesis seeks to generate ground-level
images based on information from the overhead imagery. Both tasks remain
challenging due to significant differences in viewing perspective, resolution,
and occlusion, which are widely embedded in cross-view datasets. Recent years
have witnessed rapid progress driven by the availability of large-scale
datasets and novel approaches. Typically, cross-view localization is formulated
as an image retrieval problem where ground-level features are matched with
tiled overhead images feature, extracted by convolutional neural networks
(CNNs) or vision transformers (ViTs) for cross-view feature embedding.
Cross-view synthesis, on the other hand, seeks to generate ground-level views
based on information from overhead imagery, generally using generative
adversarial networks (GANs) or diffusion models. This paper presents a
comprehensive survey of advances in cross-view localization and synthesis,
reviewing widely used datasets, highlighting key challenges, and providing an
organized overview of state-of-the-art techniques. Furthermore, it discusses
current limitations, offers comparative analyses, and outlines promising
directions for future research. We also include the project page via

TL;DR: This paper introduces ConMatFormer, a hybrid deep learning model combining ConvNeXt blocks, attention mechanisms, and transformers for improved diabetic foot ulcer detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of detecting diabetic foot ulcers (DFU) efficiently amidst scarcity and variability of datasets, improving model accuracy and transparency.

Method: ConMatFormer integrates ConvNeXt blocks for local feature extraction, attention mechanisms for focused analysis, and transformer modules for understanding global context. Data augmentation is used to counter class imbalance, supplemented by explainable AI methods for transparency.

Result: ConMatFormer outperformed SOTA CNN and Vision Transformer models, achieving 0.8961 accuracy and 0.9160 precision in experiments, with an enhanced 4-fold cross-validation accuracy of 0.9755. Explainable AI methods validated its reliability.

Conclusion: The proposed ConMatFormer sets a new benchmark for DFU classification with high accuracy and transparency, demonstrating its potential in medical image analysis.

Abstract: Diabetic foot ulcer (DFU) detection is a clinically significant yet
challenging task due to the scarcity and variability of publicly available
datasets. To solve these problems, we propose ConMatFormer, a new hybrid deep
learning architecture that combines ConvNeXt blocks, multiple attention
mechanisms convolutional block attention module (CBAM) and dual attention
network (DANet), and transformer modules in a way that works together. This
design facilitates the extraction of better local features and understanding of
the global context, which allows us to model small skin patterns across
different types of DFU very accurately. To address the class imbalance, we used
data augmentation methods. A ConvNeXt block was used to obtain detailed local
features in the initial stages. Subsequently, we compiled the model by adding a
transformer module to enhance long-range dependency. This enabled us to
pinpoint the DFU classes that were underrepresented or constituted minorities.
Tests on the DS1 (DFUC2021) and DS2 (diabetic foot ulcer (DFU)) datasets showed
that ConMatFormer outperformed state-of-the-art (SOTA) convolutional neural
network (CNN) and Vision Transformer (ViT) models in terms of accuracy,
reliability, and flexibility. The proposed method achieved an accuracy of
0.8961 and a precision of 0.9160 in a single experiment, which is a significant
improvement over the current standards for classifying DFUs. In addition, by
4-fold cross-validation, the proposed model achieved an accuracy of 0.9755 with
a standard deviation of only 0.0031. We further applied explainable artificial
intelligence (XAI) methods, such as Grad-CAM, Grad-CAM++, and LIME, to
consistently monitor the transparency and trustworthiness of the
decision-making process.. Our findings set a new benchmark for DFU
classification and provide a hybrid attention transformer framework for medical
image analysis.

### [332] [Self-Calibrated Consistency can Fight Back for Adversarial Robustness in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22785)
*Jiaxiang Liu,Jiawei Du,Xiao Liu,Prayag Tiwari,Mingkun Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a test-time defense method, Self-Calibrated Consistency (SCC), to improve robustness against adversarial attacks on vision-language models like CLIP in zero-shot settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current pre-trained vision-language models like CLIP are highly effective in zero-shot tasks but are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Existing defenses rely heavily on labeled data for adversarial fine-tuning, which is incompatible with zero-shot applications.

Method: The authors propose SCC, which includes two modules: Semantic Consistency, leveraging pseudo-labels and multi-view predictions to regularize cross-modal alignments, and Spatial Consistency, using augmented views to stabilize predictions against adversarial perturbations. Together, this forms a plug-and-play defense strategy during inference.

Result: Experiments on 22 benchmarks confirm that SCC enhances the zero-shot robustness of CLIP against adversarial attacks while preserving accuracy. It can integrate seamlessly with other vision-language models for additional benefits.

Conclusion: SCC demonstrates the feasibility and potential of achieving adversarial robustness in vision-language models without requiring labeled data, offering a promising paradigm for domains such as biomedical applications using models like BioMedCLIP.

Abstract: Pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP have demonstrated
strong zero-shot capabilities across diverse domains, yet remain highly
vulnerable to adversarial perturbations that disrupt image-text alignment and
compromise reliability. Existing defenses typically rely on adversarial
fine-tuning with labeled data, limiting their applicability in zero-shot
settings. In this work, we identify two key weaknesses of current CLIP
adversarial attacks -- lack of semantic guidance and vulnerability to view
variations -- collectively termed semantic and viewpoint fragility. To address
these challenges, we propose Self-Calibrated Consistency (SCC), an effective
test-time defense. SCC consists of two complementary modules: Semantic
consistency, which leverages soft pseudo-labels from counterattack warm-up and
multi-view predictions to regularize cross-modal alignment and separate the
target embedding from confusable negatives; and Spatial consistency, aligning
perturbed visual predictions via augmented views to stabilize inference under
adversarial perturbations. Together, these modules form a plug-and-play
inference strategy. Extensive experiments on 22 benchmarks under diverse attack
settings show that SCC consistently improves the zero-shot robustness of CLIP
while maintaining accuracy, and can be seamlessly integrated with other VLMs
for further gains. These findings highlight the great potential of establishing
an adversarially robust paradigm from CLIP, with implications extending to
broader vision-language domains such as BioMedCLIP.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MedXplain-VQA introduces a framework with five explainability components for medical visual question answering, achieving notable improvements in clinical reasoning metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the need for explainable artificial intelligence in medical visual question answering systems to ensure trust and adoption by clinicians.

Method: The framework integrates components like BLIP-2 backbone, enhanced Grad-CAM, medical query reformulation, region extraction, and chain-of-thought reasoning, assessed with clinically relevant metrics.

Result: MedXplain-VQA improved composite scores (0.683 vs. 0.378 baseline) with high reasoning confidence and generated diagnostically relevant regions and structured explanations.

Conclusion: MedXplain-VQA demonstrated the potential to be a robust medical VQA system. Future validations with experts and extensive datasets are planned for clinical adoption.

Abstract: Explainability is critical for the clinical adoption of medical visual
question answering (VQA) systems, as physicians require transparent reasoning
to trust AI-generated diagnoses. We present MedXplain-VQA, a comprehensive
framework integrating five explainable AI components to deliver interpretable
medical image analysis. The framework leverages a fine-tuned BLIP-2 backbone,
medical query reformulation, enhanced Grad-CAM attention, precise region
extraction, and structured chain-of-thought reasoning via multi-modal language
models. To evaluate the system, we introduce a medical-domain-specific
framework replacing traditional NLP metrics with clinically relevant
assessments, including terminology coverage, clinical structure quality, and
attention region relevance. Experiments on 500 PathVQA histopathology samples
demonstrate substantial improvements, with the enhanced system achieving a
composite score of 0.683 compared to 0.378 for baseline methods, while
maintaining high reasoning confidence (0.890). Our system identifies 3-5
diagnostically relevant regions per sample and generates structured
explanations averaging 57 words with appropriate clinical terminology. Ablation
studies reveal that query reformulation provides the most significant initial
improvement, while chain-of-thought reasoning enables systematic diagnostic
processes. These findings underscore the potential of MedXplain-VQA as a
robust, explainable medical VQA system. Future work will focus on validation
with medical experts and large-scale clinical datasets to ensure clinical
readiness.

*Fatemeh Nazarieh,Zhenhua Feng,Diptesh Kanojia,Muhammad Awais,Josef Kittler*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MAGIC-Talk introduces a one-shot diffusion-based method for customizable and temporally stable talking face generation while addressing issues like identity preservation, temporal consistency, and motion coherence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current audio-driven talking face generation methods face challenges like poor temporal consistency, identity preservation, and lack of customization, especially for long video generation.

Method: The framework MAGIC-Talk combines ReferenceNet for identity preservation and facial editing using text prompts, along with AnimateNet for improved motion coherence using structured motion priors. It introduces a progressive latent fusion strategy to enhance long-form video quality.

Result: MAGIC-Talk achieves better visual quality, identity preservation, and synchronization accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods, producing smoother transitions and reducing motion inconsistencies.

Conclusion: MAGIC-Talk is a robust and innovative solution for talking face generation, overcoming limitations in previous approaches while offering enhanced customization and temporal stability.

Abstract: Audio-driven talking face generation has gained significant attention for
applications in digital media and virtual avatars. While recent methods improve
audio-lip synchronization, they often struggle with temporal consistency,
identity preservation, and customization, especially in long video generation.
To address these issues, we propose MAGIC-Talk, a one-shot diffusion-based
framework for customizable and temporally stable talking face generation.
MAGIC-Talk consists of ReferenceNet, which preserves identity and enables
fine-grained facial editing via text prompts, and AnimateNet, which enhances
motion coherence using structured motion priors. Unlike previous methods
requiring multiple reference images or fine-tuning, MAGIC-Talk maintains
identity from a single image while ensuring smooth transitions across frames.
Additionally, a progressive latent fusion strategy is introduced to improve
long-form video quality by reducing motion inconsistencies and flickering.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that MAGIC-Talk outperforms state-of-the-art
methods in visual quality, identity preservation, and synchronization accuracy,
offering a robust solution for talking face generation.

*Zahraa Al Sahili,Maryam Fetanat,Maimuna Nowaz,Ioannis Patras,Matthew Purver*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FairJudge provides a protocol for evaluating text-to-image systems' fairness and prompt alignment using instruction-following multimodal LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of reliable, reproducible methods for evaluating prompt-alignment and fairness in text-to-image systems, especially for weakly visible social attributes.

Method: FairJudge uses multimodal LLMs with a rubric mapped to [-1,1] to score alignment. The system demands constrained label sets, evidence-based assessment, and abstention for insufficient cues.

Result: FairJudge performs better than existing baselines in demographic predictions and achieving higher prompt alignment without compromising profession accuracy.

Conclusion: FairJudge enhances fairness audits for text-to-image systems with a reproducible and accountable approach, particularly for evaluating diverse social attributes.

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) systems lack simple, reproducible ways to evaluate how
well images match prompts and how models treat social attributes. Common
proxies -- face classifiers and contrastive similarity -- reward surface cues,
lack calibrated abstention, and miss attributes only weakly visible (for
example, religion, culture, disability). We present FairJudge, a lightweight
protocol that treats instruction-following multimodal LLMs as fair judges. It
scores alignment with an explanation-oriented rubric mapped to [-1, 1];
constrains judgments to a closed label set; requires evidence grounded in the
visible content; and mandates abstention when cues are insufficient. Unlike
CLIP-only pipelines, FairJudge yields accountable, evidence-aware decisions;
unlike mitigation that alters generators, it targets evaluation fairness. We
evaluate gender, race, and age on FairFace, PaTA, and FairCoT; extend to
religion, culture, and disability; and assess profession correctness and
alignment on IdenProf, FairCoT-Professions, and our new DIVERSIFY-Professions.
We also release DIVERSIFY, a 469-image corpus of diverse, non-iconic scenes.
Across datasets, judge models outperform contrastive and face-centric baselines
on demographic prediction and improve mean alignment while maintaining high
profession accuracy, enabling more reliable, reproducible fairness audits.

*Aleksandar Pramov*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a multimodal system combining visual and textual features, adapted with LoRA, for predicting commercial memorability in a MediaEval 2025 task, achieving better robustness and generalization than traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to improve the prediction of commercial memorability by addressing the limitations of existing systems, specifically targeting the MediaEval 2025 competition task.

Method: Their method uses a Gemma-3 LLM backbone for multimodal fusion of visual and textual features, adapted with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), further supported by LLM-generated rationale prompts for guidance.

Result: The proposed system performed better in robustness and generalization on the test set compared to a tuned ensemble of gradient boosted trees.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the efficacy of a multimodal LLM-based approach in predicting commercial memorability, presenting an improvement over baseline models.

Abstract: This paper addresses the prediction of commercial (brand) memorability as
part of "Subtask 2: Commercial/Ad Memorability" within the "Memorability:
Predicting movie and commercial memorability" task at the MediaEval 2025
workshop competition. We propose a multimodal fusion system with a Gemma-3 LLM
backbone that integrates pre-computed visual (ViT) and textual (E5) features by
multi-modal projections. The model is adapted using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA).
A heavily-tuned ensemble of gradient boosted trees serves as a baseline. A key
contribution is the use of LLM-generated rationale prompts, grounded in
expert-derived aspects of memorability, to guide the fusion model. The results
demonstrate that the LLM-based system exhibits greater robustness and
generalization performance on the final test set, compared to the baseline.

*Aya Nakayama,Brian Wong,Yuji Nishimura,Kaito Tanaka*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces the SP-CSVR framework to address the "style trap" in LVLMs by improving semantic understanding across styles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Vision-Language Models face challenges with semantic understanding due to varying visual styles, particularly in in-context learning.

Method: The SP-CSVR framework uses three components: CSFE for style-content disentanglement, SAICD for style adaptation, and ASCM for cross-style semantic invariance using multitask contrastive learning.

Result: SP-CSVR achieves state-of-the-art performance in visual captioning, visual question answering, and style adaptation on a challenging multi-style dataset, with confirmed improvements in robustness, generalization, and efficiency.

Conclusion: The proposed SP-CSVR framework effectively decouples style from content, enhancing the performance and adaptability of LVLMs across diverse visual styles.

Abstract: The "style trap" poses a significant challenge for Large Vision-Language
Models (LVLMs), hindering robust semantic understanding across diverse visual
styles, especially in in-context learning (ICL). Existing methods often fail to
effectively decouple style from content, hindering generalization. To address
this, we propose the Semantic-Preserving Cross-Style Visual Reasoner (SP-CSVR),
a novel framework for stable semantic understanding and adaptive cross-style
visual reasoning. SP-CSVR integrates a Cross-Style Feature Encoder (CSFE) for
style-content disentanglement, a Semantic-Aligned In-Context Decoder (SAICD)
for efficient few-shot style adaptation, and an Adaptive Semantic Consistency
Module (ASCM) employing multi-task contrastive learning to enforce cross-style
semantic invariance. Extensive experiments on a challenging multi-style dataset
demonstrate SP-CSVR's state-of-the-art performance across visual captioning,
visual question answering, and in-context style adaptation. Comprehensive
evaluations, including ablation studies and generalization analysis, confirm
SP-CSVR's efficacy in enhancing robustness, generalization, and efficiency
across diverse visual styles.

*Omri Hirsch,Ron Shapira Weber,Shira Ifergane,Oren Freifeld*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FastJAM proposes a rapid graph-based approach for image joint alignment, drastically reducing computation time while improving alignment quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing joint alignment methods, such as long training times, large models, and extensive hyperparameter tuning.

Method: FastJAM constructs a graph using pairwise matches from an image matcher and applies a graph neural network for efficient computation of homography parameters, utilizing a novel loss function that eliminates regularization.

Result: FastJAM outperforms modern JA methods in alignment quality while cutting computation time down to seconds.

Conclusion: FastJAM offers a computationally efficient and effective solution to image joint alignment tasks, making it practical for real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Joint Alignment (JA) of images aims to align a collection of images into a
unified coordinate frame, such that semantically-similar features appear at
corresponding spatial locations. Most existing approaches often require long
training times, large-capacity models, and extensive hyperparameter tuning. We
introduce FastJAM, a rapid, graph-based method that drastically reduces the
computational complexity of joint alignment tasks. FastJAM leverages pairwise
matches computed by an off-the-shelf image matcher, together with a rapid
nonparametric clustering, to construct a graph representing intra- and
inter-image keypoint relations. A graph neural network propagates and
aggregates these correspondences, efficiently predicting per-image homography
parameters via image-level pooling. Utilizing an inverse-compositional loss,
that eliminates the need for a regularization term over the predicted
transformations (and thus also obviates the hyperparameter tuning associated
with such terms), FastJAM performs image JA quickly and effectively.
Experimental results on several benchmarks demonstrate that FastJAM achieves
results better than existing modern JA methods in terms of alignment quality,
while reducing computation time from hours or minutes to mere seconds. Our code
is available at our project webpage, https://bgu-cs-vil.github.io/FastJAM/

### [339] [When Agents are Powerful: Black Hole Search in Time-Varying Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22309)
*Tanvir Kaur,Ashish Saxena*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper addresses optimizing the Black Hole Search (BHS) problem in dynamic graphs by enhancing agent capabilities, reducing resource demands.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Identifying black holes in graphs is critical as they destroy resources, and previous BHS solutions required many agents due to limited communication capabilities.

Method: Enhancing agent abilities with global communication and 1-hop visibility to improve efficiency in locating harmful black holes in dynamic graph environments.

Result: The proposed agent capabilities lead to more resource-efficient solutions for the BHS problem in dynamic graphs.

Conclusion: Strengthened agent capabilities in global communication and visibility significantly optimize black hole identification, offering feasible solutions for dynamic environments.

Abstract: A black hole is a harmful node in a graph that destroys any resource entering
it, making its identification a critical task. In the \emph{Black Hole Search
(BHS)} problem, a team of agents operates on a graph $G$ with the objective
that at least one agent must survive and correctly identify an edge incident to
the black hole. Prior work has addressed BHS in arbitrary dynamic graphs under
the restrictive \emph{face-to-face} communication, where agents can exchange
information only when co-located. This constraint significantly increases the
number of agents required to solve the problem. In this work, we strengthen the
capabilities of agents in two ways: (i) granting them \emph{global
communication}, enabling interaction regardless of location, and (ii) equipping
them with \emph{1-hop visibility}, allowing each agent to observe its immediate
neighborhood. These enhancements lead to more efficient solutions for the BHS
problem in dynamic graphs.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The study investigates opaque, unconscious mobile robots solving a separation problem with obstructed visibility, proposing an algorithm generating concentric semicircles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how opaque, unconscious robots could achieve specific geometric separation under limited visibility constraints.

Method: Developed a collision-free algorithm under a semi-synchronous scheduler for separating robots into concentric semicircles.

Result: The algorithm successfully solves the separation problem within O(n) epochs without robots having prior knowledge of their count.

Conclusion: Opaque robotic behavior can be algorithmically controlled for specific tasks, enhancing multi-robot system designs.

Abstract: We study a recently introduced \textit{unconscious} mobile robot model, where
each robot is associated with a \textit{color}, which is visible to other
robots but not to itself. The robots are autonomous, anonymous, oblivious and
silent, operating in the Euclidean plane under the conventional
\textit{Look-Compute-Move} cycle. A primary task in this model is the
\textit{separation problem}, where unconscious robots sharing the same color
must separate from others, forming recognizable geometric shapes such as
circles, points, or lines. All prior works model the robots as
\textit{transparent}, enabling each to know the positions and colors of all
other robots. In contrast, we model the robots as \textit{opaque}, where a
robot can obstruct the visibility of two other robots, if it lies on the line
segment between them. Under this obstructed visibility, we consider a variant
of the separation problem in which robots, starting from any arbitrary initial
configuration, are required to separate into concentric semicircles. We present
a collision-free algorithm that solves the separation problem under a
semi-synchronous scheduler in $O(n)$ epochs, where $n$ is the number of robots.
The robots agree on one coordinate axis but have no knowledge of $n$.

TL;DR: The paper addresses challenges in deploying deep learning models on constrained edge devices and explores methods like model partitioning, compression, and adaptation to optimize inference latency, privacy, and monetary costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With the rise of edge intelligent applications like VR/AR and chatbots, constrained edge devices struggle with handling large and complex deep learning models. This highlights the need for effective optimization and partitioning methods.

Method: The paper surveys state-of-the-art techniques, including model compression, distillation, transmission compression, and architecture adaptations, examining their impacts on optimizing latency, data privacy, and resource costs.

Result: The research highlights methods that balance multiple objectives, such as accuracy, computational and transmission delays, and privacy protection, showcasing the benefits of these optimizations.

Conclusion: Optimizing DL model partitions and adaptations in edge settings can enhance performance, privacy, and cost-effectiveness. Further work is needed to address multi-objective trade-offs in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Edge intelligent applications like VR/AR and language model based chatbots
have become widespread with the rapid expansion of IoT and mobile devices.
However, constrained edge devices often cannot serve the increasingly large and
complex deep learning (DL) models. To mitigate these challenges, researchers
have proposed optimizing and offloading partitions of DL models among user
devices, edge servers, and the cloud. In this setting, users can take advantage
of different services to support their intelligent applications. For example,
edge resources offer low response latency. In contrast, cloud platforms provide
low monetary cost computation resources for computation-intensive workloads.
However, communication between DL model partitions can introduce transmission
bottlenecks and pose risks of data leakage. Recent research aims to balance
accuracy, computation delay, transmission delay, and privacy concerns. They
address these issues with model compression, model distillation, transmission
compression, and model architecture adaptations, including internal
classifiers. This survey contextualizes the state-of-the-art model offloading
methods and model adaptation techniques by studying their implication to a
multi-objective optimization comprising inference latency, data privacy, and
resource monetary cost.

TL;DR: This paper introduces Bayes-Split-Edge, a Bayesian optimization framework for collaborative inference in wireless edge networks. It efficiently manages energy and delay constraints during neural network split inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to enable timely and efficient collaborative inference tasks for energy-limited edge devices through optimized neural network split inference in wireless networks.

Method: Bayesian optimization, combined with a hybrid acquisition function, is used to optimize the transmission power and neural network split point within wireless edge networks.

Result: Bayes-Split-Edge achieves significant reductions in evaluation cost (up to 2.4x) and matches or outperforms baselines like CMA-ES and PPO in constraint-aware optimization and convergence.

Conclusion: The proposed Bayes-Split-Edge framework offers a sample-efficient and constraint-sensitive solution for collaborative split inference in wireless edge computing systems.

Abstract: Mobile edge devices (e.g., AR/VR headsets) typically need to complete timely
inference tasks while operating with limited on-board computing and energy
resources. In this paper, we investigate the problem of collaborative inference
in wireless edge networks, where energy-constrained edge devices aim to
complete inference tasks within given deadlines. These tasks are carried out
using neural networks, and the edge device seeks to optimize inference
performance under energy and delay constraints. The inference process can be
split between the edge device and an edge server, thereby achieving
collaborative inference over wireless networks. We formulate an inference
utility optimization problem subject to energy and delay constraints, and
propose a novel solution called Bayes-Split-Edge, which leverages Bayesian
optimization for collaborative split inference over wireless edge networks. Our
solution jointly optimizes the transmission power and the neural network split
point. The Bayes-Split-Edge framework incorporates a novel hybrid acquisition
function that balances inference task utility, sample efficiency, and
constraint violation penalties. We evaluate our approach using the VGG19 model
on the ImageNet-Mini dataset, and Resnet101 on Tiny-ImageNet, and real-world
mMobile wireless channel datasets. Numerical results demonstrate that
Bayes-Split-Edge achieves up to 2.4x reduction in evaluation cost compared to
standard Bayesian optimization and achieves near-linear convergence. It also
outperforms several baselines, including CMA-ES, DIRECT, exhaustive search, and
Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), while matching exhaustive search
performance under tight constraints. These results confirm that the proposed
framework provides a sample-efficient solution requiring maximum 20 function
evaluations and constraint-aware optimization for wireless split inference in
edge computing systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a feature engineering approach to detect and analyze anomalies in instant payment systems, bridging the gap between technical metrics and business visibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Instant payment systems require high performance standards with minimal downtime, but traditional monitoring lacks effective visibility into business processes.

Method: The authors propose using processing times between ISO 20022 messages, applying anomaly detection to these compact features for failure detection and localization.

Result: Experimental results with the TIPS system demonstrate the approach's ability to detect various anomaly patterns, assist operators with interpretable explanations, and reduce investigation time.

Conclusion: The framework improves observability in distributed systems by mapping features to processing phases, differentiating issues, and assisting operators in handling payment system anomalies effectively.

Abstract: Instant payment infrastructures have stringent performance requirements,
processing millions of transactions daily with zero-downtime expectations.
Traditional monitoring approaches fail to bridge the gap between technical
infrastructure metrics and business process visibility. We introduce a novel
feature engineering approach based on processing times computed between
consecutive ISO 20022 message exchanges, creating a compact representation of
system state. By applying anomaly detection to these features, we enable early
failure detection and localization, allowing incident classification.
Experimental evaluation on the TARGET Instant Payment Settlement (TIPS) system,
using both real-world incidents and controlled simulations, demonstrates the
approach's effectiveness in detecting diverse anomaly patterns and provides
inherently interpretable explanations that enable operators to understand the
business impact. By mapping features to distinct processing phases, the
resulting framework differentiates between internal and external payment system
issues, significantly reduces investigation time, and bridges observability
gaps in distributed systems where transaction state is fragmented across
multiple entities.

*Jinwoo Baek*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents a theoretical framework for diagnosing and addressing forward-error amplification in low-precision trained Transformers, emphasizing stability diagnostics and minimally invasive fixes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to understand and address the problem of forward-error amplification in Transformers trained in low precision, as it can affect performance and stability during training.

Method: A first-order, module-wise theoretical framework was developed to predict error growth in Transformers, focusing on self-attention mechanisms. The authors introduce diagnostics like score-scale ratio, softmax sensitivity, value conditioning, and LayerNorm indicators to evaluate and mitigate errors. The framework provides a unified stability bound that is directly estimable during training.

Result: The proposed theory and diagnostics track mismatches effectively, serve as early warning signals for instability, and guide mitigation strategies. They were validated on Tiny-ViT/CIFAR-10, where the indicators demonstrated predictive and corrective utility in improving stability during training.

Conclusion: This study offers a practical, theoretical foundation for identifying and mitigating forward-error issues in low-precision Transformer models, enhancing stability with minimal computational overhead.

Abstract: Transformers trained in low precision can suffer forward-error amplification.
We give a first-order, module-wise theory that predicts when and where errors
grow. For self-attention we derive a per-layer bound that factorizes into three
interpretable diagnostics: a score-scale ratio $\kappa_{\rm score}$, a rowwise
softmax sensitivity $\kappa_{\rm softmax}$, and value conditioning $\kappa(V)$.
We prove a residual relaxation inequality showing that residual blocks
attenuate depth-wise accumulation, and we introduce a precision- and
width-aware LayerNorm indicator $\rho_{\rm LN}$ with a matching first-order
bound in the $\epsilon$-dominated regime. These pieces yield a unified
forward-stability bound whose right-hand side is directly estimable during
training.
  On Tiny-ViT/CIFAR-10 we evaluate the bound and components. (1) The combined
predictor $\kappa_{\rm softmax},(1+\kappa_{\rm
score}),\kappa(V),|W_O|2+\kappa{\rm eff}+C_{\rm LN}$ tracks
FP32$\leftrightarrow$LP mismatches across seeds, widths, and precisions;
scaling by $\epsilon_{\rm mach}$ collapses mixed-precision points. (2) The
time-series maximum of $\kappa_{\rm softmax}$ acts as an early-warning signal,
leading error spikes by 16-24 steps (corr. 0.65-0.82; permutation
$p!\approx!10^{-3}$; Precision@K 0.89-1.00). (3) Guided by $\rho_{\rm LN}$, a
small LayerNorm-$\epsilon$ tweak targeting $\rho_\star$ gives consistent
stabilization (mean tail-loss $\downarrow\ \approx0.010$ at $\rho_\star!=!0.6$,
cap$=10^{-2}$) with negligible overhead.
  Overall, our theory supplies actionable, unitless diagnostics that (i)
explain when self-attention is fragile, (ii) forecast instability, and (iii)
motivate a minimally invasive mitigation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CMR is a novel regularization method improving layer spectral properties and model performance under adversarial stress.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address stability and accuracy challenges in layer spectra, especially under adversarial conditions.

Method: CMR utilizes a combined log-condition proxy and Chebyshev moments to optimize layer spectra, ensuring stabilized gradients while maintaining task-specific learning.

Result: CMR significantly reduces layer condition numbers, increases gradient magnitudes, and improves test accuracy in adversarial scenarios.

Conclusion: Optimization-driven spectral preconditioning using CMR leads to better-conditioned models for improved stability and learning accuracy.

Abstract: We introduce \textbf{Chebyshev Moment Regularization (CMR)}, a simple,
architecture-agnostic loss that directly optimizes layer spectra. CMR jointly
controls spectral edges via a log-condition proxy and shapes the interior via
Chebyshev moments, with a decoupled, capped mixing rule that preserves task
gradients. We prove strictly monotone descent for the condition proxy, bounded
moment gradients, and orthogonal invariance. In an adversarial
``$\kappa$-stress'' setting (MNIST, 15-layer MLP), \emph{compared to vanilla
training}, CMR reduces mean layer condition numbers by $\sim\!10^3$ (from
$\approx3.9\!\times\!10^3$ to $\approx3.4$ in 5 epochs), increases average
gradient magnitude, and restores test accuracy (
$\approx10\%\!\to\!\approx86\%$ ). These results support
\textbf{optimization-driven spectral preconditioning}: directly steering models
toward well-conditioned regimes for stable, accurate learning.

TL;DR: Proposed BBOPlace-Bench as a benchmark for evaluating and developing BBO algorithms for chip placement. Experimental results show EAs outperform SA and BO.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of a unified benchmark for evaluating black-box optimization algorithms specific to chip placement.

Method: Developing BBOPlace-Bench, which integrates multiple problem formulations and a modular framework for testing various algorithms including simulated annealing, evolutionary algorithms, and Bayesian optimization.

Result: Experimental results highlight superior performance of problem formulations like mask-guided optimization and hyperparameter optimization, as well as evolutionary algorithms outperforming others, especially in high-dimensional tasks.

Conclusion: BBOPlace-Bench enhances algorithm development for chip placement and expands practical applications for black-box optimization algorithms.

Abstract: Chip placement is a vital stage in modern chip design as it has a substantial
impact on the subsequent processes and the overall quality of the final chip.
The use of black-box optimization (BBO) for chip placement has a history of
several decades. However, early efforts were limited by immature problem
formulations and inefficient algorithm designs. Recent progress has shown the
effectiveness and efficiency of BBO for chip placement, proving its potential
to achieve state-of-the-art results. Despite these advancements, the field
lacks a unified, BBO-specific benchmark for thoroughly assessing various
problem formulations and BBO algorithms. To fill this gap, we propose
BBOPlace-Bench, the first benchmark designed specifically for evaluating and
developing BBO algorithms for chip placement tasks. It integrates three problem
formulations of BBO for chip placement, and offers a modular, decoupled, and
flexible framework that enables users to seamlessly implement, test, and
compare their own algorithms. BBOPlace-Bench integrates a wide variety of
existing BBO algorithms, including simulated annealing (SA), evolutionary
algorithms (EAs), and Bayesian optimization (BO). Experimental results show
that the problem formulations of mask-guided optimization and hyperparameter
optimization exhibit superior performance than the sequence pair problem
formulation, while EAs demonstrate better overall performance than SA and BO,
especially in high-dimensional search spaces, and also achieve state-of-the-art
performance compared to the mainstream chip placement methods. BBOPlace-Bench
not only facilitates the development of efficient BBO-driven solutions for chip
placement but also broadens the practical application scenarios (which are
urgently needed) for the BBO community. The code of BBOPlace-Bench is available
at https://github.com/lamda-bbo/BBOPlace-Bench.

*Supriya Nagesh,Karina Covarrubias,Robert El-Kareh,Shiva Prasad Kasiviswanathan,Nina Mishra*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study develops machine learning models to predict postoperative aspiration, achieving high accuracy and identifying key risk factors like opioids and operative site.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce surgical patient morbidity and mortality associated with postoperative aspiration through predictive modeling and intervention.

Method: Machine learning models such as XGBoost, Multilayer Perceptron, and Random Forest were trained using MIMIC-IV data to predict aspiration risk. Causal factors were analyzed with Average Treatment Effects (ATE).

Result: The best ML model achieved an AUROC of 0.86 with key predictors including opioids, patient age, and length of stay. Gender disparities and causative factors like opioid dosage and operative site were highlighted.

Conclusion: ML models are effective in predicting postoperative aspiration risk, enabling targeted prevention measures. Findings suggest a need for addressing gender-based differences in care and optimizing opioid administration protocols.

Abstract: Background: Aspiration, the inhalation of foreign material into the lungs,
significantly impacts surgical patient morbidity and mortality. This study
develops a machine learning (ML) model to predict postoperative aspiration,
enabling timely preventative interventions.
  Methods: From the MIMIC-IV database of over 400,000 hospital admissions, we
identified 826 surgical patients (mean age: 62, 55.7\% male) who experienced
aspiration within seven days post-surgery, along with a matched non-aspiration
cohort. Three ML models: XGBoost, Multilayer Perceptron, and Random Forest were
trained using pre-surgical hospitalization data to predict postoperative
aspiration. To investigate causation, we estimated Average Treatment Effects
(ATE) using Augmented Inverse Probability Weighting.
  Results: Our ML model achieved an AUROC of 0.86 and 77.3\% sensitivity on a
held-out test set. Maximum daily opioid dose, length of stay, and patient age
emerged as the most important predictors. ATE analysis identified significant
causative factors: opioids (0.25 +/- 0.06) and operative site (neck: 0.20 +/-
0.13, head: 0.19 +/- 0.13). Despite equal surgery rates across genders, men
were 1.5 times more likely to aspirate and received 27\% higher maximum daily
opioid dosages compared to women.
  Conclusion: ML models can effectively predict postoperative aspiration risk,
enabling targeted preventative measures. Maximum daily opioid dosage and
operative site significantly influence aspiration risk. The gender disparity in
both opioid administration and aspiration rates warrants further investigation.
These findings have important implications for improving postoperative care
protocols and aspiration prevention strategies.

*Larkin Liu,Jalal Etesami*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces online mixture-of-experts (OMoE), proposing two algorithms to optimize expert aggregation for improved accuracy: an optimized voting approach and weighted-majority voting. Applications to large language models are demonstrated with theoretical and empirical findings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve aggregate accuracy in decision-making by optimally combining expert outputs using efficient algorithms and methodologies.

Method: Two algorithms were developed: one incorporates UCB-driven successive elimination to refine exploration actions through aggregate voting, and the second leverages weighted-majority voting based on experts' predictive powers.

Result: The proposed algorithms show theoretical no-regret guarantees and empirically enhance the aggregation of large language models by dynamically optimizing the selection of experts.

Conclusion: The study provides novel methods and guarantees for optimally aggregating expert decisions, demonstrating improved performance in online fine-tuning of large language models.

Abstract: We explore the use of expert-guided bandit learning, which we refer to as
online mixture-of-experts (OMoE). In this setting, given a context, a candidate
committee of experts must determine how to aggregate their outputs to achieve
optimal results in terms of aggregate accuracy. We propose two algorithms to
address this problem. The first algorithm combines aggregate voting with
UCB-driven successive elimination, efficiently pruning suboptimal exploration
actions. The second algorithm employs an online weighted-majority-voting
mechanism, leveraging the respective voting power of each expert proportional
to their predictive power. We derive theoretical guarantees for the regret
properties in the bandit setting under ideal circumstances, and empirical
results are provided accordingly. As a modern study on applications, these
methods are applied to the online fine-tuning of a set of expert large language
models (LLMs), where after each response, the generative LLM dynamically
reweighs its set of experts and/or selects the optimal committee of experts to
generate the most accurate response. Our results introduce new methodologies
and no-regret guarantees for combining multiple experts to improve on the
performance of the an aggregate model overall.

*Shifeng Xu,Yanzhu Liu,Adams Wai-Kin Kong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper identifies and addresses the issue of prediction error accumulation in sampling processes of diffusion models, presenting the Variance-Reduction Guidance (VRG) method to enhance generation quality without model modification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle the accumulation of prediction errors during the sampling process in diffusion models, which deteriorates the quality of generated outputs.

Method: Developed Variance-Reduction Guidance (VRG), a novel statistical technique that adjusts sampling trajectories to minimize prediction errors, improving generation quality without requiring fine-tuning or modifications of the model.

Result: Experimental evaluations across multiple datasets and baselines show that VRG significantly improves diffusion model generation quality in both conditional and unconditional settings.

Conclusion: VRG is a practical and effective approach for enhancing diffusion model outputs, leveraging redesigned sampling trajectories without altering the model itself.

Abstract: Diffusion models have become emerging generative models. Their sampling
process involves multiple steps, and in each step the models predict the noise
from a noisy sample. When the models make prediction, the output deviates from
the ground truth, and we call such a deviation as \textit{prediction error}.
The prediction error accumulates over the sampling process and deteriorates
generation quality. This paper introduces a novel technique for statistically
measuring the prediction error and proposes the Variance-Reduction Guidance
(VRG) method to mitigate this error. VRG does not require model fine-tuning or
modification. Given a predefined sampling trajectory, it searches for a new
trajectory which has the same number of sampling steps but produces higher
quality results. VRG is applicable to both conditional and unconditional
generation. Experiments on various datasets and baselines demonstrate that VRG
can significantly improve the generation quality of diffusion models. Source

*Xiao Zhou,Yuze Sun,Jie Wu,Xiaomeng Huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel deep learning framework (PCC-MJO) enhances Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) forecast accuracy and range in dynamical models, overcoming prediction barriers and improving subseasonal forecasts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving the prediction of the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO), which is crucial for understanding global weather and climate extremes but challenging in dynamical models.

Method: Developed PCC-MJO, a two-stage deep learning model combining a physics-informed 3D U-Net to correct field errors and an LSTM to refine MJO indexes, applied to forecasts from CMA, ECMWF, and NCEP.

Result: The model extends forecast skill range by 2-8 days, better resolves the Maritime Continent barrier, and aligns its outputs with observed MJO dynamics (correlation > 0.93).

Conclusion: The framework is physically consistent, computationally efficient, and generalizable, addressing longstanding issues in subseasonal MJO forecasting.

Abstract: The Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) is an important driver of global weather
and climate extremes, but its prediction in operational dynamical models
remains challenging, with skillful forecasts typically limited to 3-4 weeks.
Here, we introduce a novel deep learning framework, the Physics-guided Cascaded
Corrector for MJO (PCC-MJO), which acts as a universal post-processor to
correct MJO forecasts from dynamical models. This two-stage model first employs
a physics-informed 3D U-Net to correct spatial-temporal field errors, then
refines the MJO's RMM index using an LSTM optimized for forecast skill. When
applied to three different operational forecasts from CMA, ECMWF and NCEP, our
unified framework consistently extends the skillful forecast range (bivariate
correlation > 0.5) by 2-8 days. Crucially, the model effectively mitigates the
"Maritime Continent barrier", enabling more realistic eastward propagation and
amplitude. Explainable AI analysis quantitatively confirms that the model's
decision-making is spatially congruent with observed MJO dynamics (correlation
> 0.93), demonstrating that it learns physically meaningful features rather
than statistical fittings. Our work provides a promising physically consistent,
computationally efficient, and highly generalizable pathway to break through
longstanding barriers in subseasonal forecasting.

### [351] [Quantifying Multimodal Imbalance: A GMM-Guided Adaptive Loss for Audio-Visual Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21797)
*Zhaocheng Liu,Zhiwen Yu,Xiaoqing Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel method for quantitatively analyzing multimodal imbalance (via Modality Gap), informing a sample-level adaptive loss function, and achieving SOTA performance on CREMA-D and AVE datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for addressing multimodal imbalance often focus on architecture and optimization, lacking quantitative analysis of imbalance between modalities.

Method: The paper defines 'Modality Gap' for multimodal data and models it using a bimodal Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), applies Bayes' theorem for distribution analysis, and designs an adaptive loss function with a two-phase training strategy.

Result: The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art accuracies of 80.65% and 70.90% on CREMA-D and AVE datasets, respectively, proving its effectiveness.

Conclusion: The study successfully addresses multimodal imbalance through quantitative analysis and adaptive loss function design, achieving superior performance compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Current mainstream approaches to addressing multimodal imbalance primarily
focus on architectural modifications and optimization-based, often overlooking
a quantitative analysis of the imbalance degree between modalities. To address
this gap, our work introduces a novel method for the quantitative analysis of
multi-modal imbalance, which in turn informs the design of a sample-level
adaptive loss function.We begin by defining the "Modality Gap" as the
difference between the Softmax scores of different modalities (e.g., audio and
visual) for the ground-truth class prediction. Analysis of the Modality Gap
distribution reveals that it can be effectively modeled by a bimodal Gaussian
Mixture Model (GMM). These two components are found to correspond respectively
to "modality-balanced" and "modality-imbalanced" data samples. Subsequently, we
apply Bayes' theorem to compute the posterior probability of each sample
belonging to these two distinct distributions.Informed by this quantitative
analysis, we design a novel adaptive loss function with three objectives: (1)
to minimize the overall Modality Gap; (2) to encourage the imbalanced sample
distribution to shift towards the balanced one; and (3) to apply greater
penalty weights to imbalanced samples. We employ a two-stage training strategy
consisting of a warm-up phase followed by an adaptive training
phase.Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on the public CREMA-D and AVE datasets,
attaining accuracies of $80.65\%$ and $70.90\%$, respectively. This validates
the effectiveness of our proposed methodology.

### [352] [Power to the Clients: Federated Learning in a Dictatorship Setting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22149)
*Mohammadsajad Alipour,Mohammad Mohammadi Amiri*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper examines the vulnerabilities in federated learning by introducing the concept of 'dictator clients,' who can dominate server model contributions while erasing others, providing theoretical and empirical evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the security concerns in federated learning, where malicious participants can exploit the decentralized structure to manipulate or compromise training outcomes.

Method: The authors introduce 'dictator clients' as a threat model, propose specific attack strategies, analyze their theoretical impact on learning processes, and validate their impact through experiments on computer vision and natural language benchmarks.

Result: The analysis highlights how dictator clients can fully dominate the server model, and explores various scenarios with single and multiple dictators collaborating or betraying each other, with validated results from benchmarks.

Conclusion: The study reveals significant security vulnerabilities in federated learning systems due to dictator client attacks, emphasizing the need for protections against such exploitations.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for decentralized
model training, enabling multiple clients to collaboratively learn a shared
model without exchanging their local data. However, the decentralized nature of
FL also introduces vulnerabilities, as malicious clients can compromise or
manipulate the training process. In this work, we introduce dictator clients, a
novel, well-defined, and analytically tractable class of malicious participants
capable of entirely erasing the contributions of all other clients from the
server model, while preserving their own. We propose concrete attack strategies
that empower such clients and systematically analyze their effects on the
learning process. Furthermore, we explore complex scenarios involving multiple
dictator clients, including cases where they collaborate, act independently, or
form an alliance in order to ultimately betray one another. For each of these
settings, we provide a theoretical analysis of their impact on the global
model's convergence. Our theoretical algorithms and findings about the complex
scenarios including multiple dictator clients are further supported by
empirical evaluations on both computer vision and natural language processing
benchmarks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces LLEMA, a framework combining large language models, chemistry rules, and memory-based refinement for materials discovery across multiple objectives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Materials discovery involves navigating large chemical and structural spaces while balancing contradictory objectives. The paper seeks an efficient and principled pathway to accelerate this process.

Method: The LLEMA framework integrates large language models to propose candidates, an oracle model to estimate properties, and a memory-based scorer for optimization in iterative cycles.

Result: LLEMA successfully discovers materials that meet chemistry plausibility, stability, and property alignment. It outperforms generative and LLM-only benchmarks with improved hit rates and Pareto performance.

Conclusion: LLEMA provides a systematic method enforcing synthesizability and multi-objective trade-offs, advancing practical materials discovery efficiently.

Abstract: Materials discovery requires navigating vast chemical and structural spaces
while satisfying multiple, often conflicting, objectives. We present LLM-guided
Evolution for MAterials design (LLEMA), a unified framework that couples the
scientific knowledge embedded in large language models with chemistry-informed
evolutionary rules and memory-based refinement. At each iteration, an LLM
proposes crystallographically specified candidates under explicit property
constraints; a surrogate-augmented oracle estimates physicochemical properties;
and a multi-objective scorer updates success/failure memories to guide
subsequent generations. Evaluated on 14 realistic tasks spanning electronics,
energy, coatings, optics, and aerospace, LLEMA discovers candidates that are
chemically plausible, thermodynamically stable, and property-aligned, achieving
higher hit-rates and stronger Pareto fronts than generative and LLM-only
baselines. Ablation studies confirm the importance of rule-guided generation,
memory-based refinement, and surrogate prediction. By enforcing
synthesizability and multi-objective trade-offs, LLEMA delivers a principled
pathway to accelerate practical materials discovery.

*Yifeng Liu,Angela Yuan,Quanquan Gu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MARS-M is a new matrix-based optimizer combining variance reduction techniques and preconditioning, achieving improved convergence rates and empirical performance over prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To merge the advantages of matrix-based optimizers and variance-reduction techniques for efficient large-scale neural network training.

Method: Introduce MARS-M optimizer, combining variance reduction from MARS with preconditioning from Muon. Theoretical analysis shows improved convergence rate compared to Muon.

Result: MARS-M achieves better empirical results in language modeling and computer vision tasks, with lower losses and enhanced downstream performance.

Conclusion: MARS-M is an advanced optimizer enhancing both theoretical convergence rates and practical performance, providing a powerful tool for neural network training.

Abstract: Matrix-based preconditioned optimizers, such as Muon, have recently been
shown to be more efficient than scalar-based optimizers for training
large-scale neural networks, including large language models (LLMs). On the
other hand, recent benchmarks on optimizers for LLM pre-training have
demonstrated that variance-reduction techniques such as MARS can achieve
substantial speedups over standard optimizers that do not employ variance
reduction. In this paper, to achieve the best of both worlds, we introduce
MARS-M, a new optimizer that integrates the variance reduction technique in
MARS with Muon. Under standard regularity conditions, we prove that Muon-M
converges to a first-order stationary point at a rate of
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(T^{-1/3})$, which improves upon
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(T^{-1/4})$ rate attained by Muon. Our empirical results on
language modeling and computer vision tasks demonstrate that MARS-M
consistently yields lower losses and improved performance across various
downstream benchmarks. The implementation of MARS-M is available at

TL;DR: This paper presents XRePIT, a hybrid simulation framework that combines machine learning and solver-based correction to reliably and efficiently address fluid dynamics simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations of purely data-driven surrogates in fluid dynamics, which struggle with error accumulation, and the lack of robustness and automation in hybrid methods for practical applications.

Method: The authors developed XRePIT, a fully automated, physics-aware hybrid method that integrates machine learning for acceleration with solver-based corrections to ensure stability and robustness.

Result: XRePIT achieves stable, accelerated simulations for over 10,000 timesteps, generalizes to unseen boundary conditions, and scales to 3D flows with speedups up to 4.98×. It maintains high physical fidelity with low error margins in thermal and velocity field predictions.

Conclusion: XRePIT represents a significant step forward, offering a reliable and scalable hybrid method that is ready for real-world engineering applications.

Abstract: Purely data-driven surrogates for fluid dynamics often fail catastrophically
from error accumulation, while existing hybrid methods have lacked the
automation and robustness for practical use. To solve this, we developed
XRePIT, a novel hybrid simulation strategy that synergizes machine learning
(ML) acceleration with solver-based correction. We specifically designed our
method to be fully automated and physics-aware, ensuring the stability and
practical applicability that previous approaches lacked. We demonstrate that
this new design overcomes long-standing barriers, achieving the first stable,
accelerated rollouts for over 10,000 timesteps. The method also generalizes
robustly to unseen boundary conditions and, crucially, scales to 3D flows. Our
approach delivers speedups up to 4.98$\times$ while maintaining high physical
fidelity, resolving thermal fields with relative errors of ~1E-3 and capturing
low magnitude velocity dynamics with errors below 1E-2 ms-1. This work thus
establishes a mature and scalable hybrid method, paving the way for its use in
real-world engineering.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Sentinel, a personalized federated learning framework, which addresses challenges in IoT network intrusion detection systems, including class imbalance, non-IID data, and communication costs. Sentinel incorporates a dual-model structure with innovative mechanisms for better performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to tackle the limitations of conventional federated learning methods in IoT intrusion detection systems, including class imbalance, non-IID data distribution, and high communication overhead, which hinder their effectiveness in real-world scenarios.

Method: The paper proposes Sentinel, a personalized federated IDS framework with a dual-model architecture per client, encompassing a personalized teacher and a shared student model. It employs key techniques like bidirectional knowledge distillation, feature alignment, class-balanced loss functions, and normalized gradient aggregation for better efficiency and fairness.

Result: Sentinel outperforms existing state-of-the-art federated methods on IoTID20 and 5GNIDD datasets, especially under extreme data heterogeneity, while maintaining communication efficiency.

Conclusion: Sentinel establishes a new benchmark in IoT intrusion detection systems by effectively addressing data heterogeneity and class imbalance challenges, ensuring privacy and communication efficiency.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) offers a privacy-preserving paradigm for machine
learning, but its application in intrusion detection systems (IDS) within IoT
networks is challenged by severe class imbalance, non-IID data, and high
communication overhead.These challenges severely degrade the performance of
conventional FL methods in real-world network traffic classification. To
overcome these limitations, we propose Sentinel, a personalized federated IDS
(pFed-IDS) framework that incorporates a dual-model architecture on each
client, consisting of a personalized teacher and a lightweight shared student
model. This design effectively balances deep local adaptation with efficient
global model consensus while preserving client privacy by transmitting only the
compact student model, thus reducing communication costs. Sentinel integrates
three key mechanisms to ensure robust performance: bidirectional knowledge
distillation with adaptive temperature scaling, multi-faceted feature
alignment, and class-balanced loss functions. Furthermore, the server employs
normalized gradient aggregation with equal client weighting to enhance fairness
and mitigate client drift. Extensive experiments on the IoTID20 and 5GNIDD
benchmark datasets demonstrate that Sentinel significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art federated methods, establishing a new performance benchmark,
especially under extreme data heterogeneity, while maintaining communication
efficiency.

TL;DR: This paper introduces Reductive Lie Neurons (ReLNs), a novel neural network architecture exactly equivariant to general linear symmetries, overcoming limitations of existing models and demonstrating scalability on various tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of this paper is to address the limitation of existing equivariant models which only handle simple symmetries, preventing them from addressing broader scientific real-world scenarios influenced by general linear transformations like GL(n).

Method: The paper proposes Reductive Lie Neurons (ReLNs) that include a novel adjoint-invariant bilinear layer to guarantee equivariance for Lie-algebraic features and matrix-valued inputs without redesigning per subgroup.

Result: ReLNs outperform other methods in algebraic benchmarks with sl(3) and sp(4) symmetries, achieve competitive results in Lorentz-equivariant physics tasks, and improve 3D drone trajectory estimation under geometric uncertainty.

Conclusion: ReLNs represent a versatile and generalizable framework for neural networks adaptable to broad linear group symmetries, paving the way for their application in diverse structured input data scenarios.

Abstract: Encoding symmetries is a powerful inductive bias for improving the
generalization of deep neural networks. However, most existing equivariant
models are limited to simple symmetries like rotations, failing to address the
broader class of general linear transformations, GL(n), that appear in many
scientific domains. We introduce Reductive Lie Neurons (ReLNs), a novel neural
network architecture exactly equivariant to these general linear symmetries.
ReLNs are designed to operate directly on a wide range of structured inputs,
including general n-by-n matrices. ReLNs introduce a novel adjoint-invariant
bilinear layer to achieve stable equivariance for both Lie-algebraic features
and matrix-valued inputs, without requiring redesign for each subgroup. This
architecture overcomes the limitations of prior equivariant networks that only
apply to compact groups or simple vector data. We validate ReLNs' versatility
across a spectrum of tasks: they outperform existing methods on algebraic
benchmarks with sl(3) and sp(4) symmetries and achieve competitive results on a
Lorentz-equivariant particle physics task. In 3D drone state estimation with
geometric uncertainty, ReLNs jointly process velocities and covariances,
yielding significant improvements in trajectory accuracy. ReLNs provide a
practical and general framework for learning with broad linear group symmetries
on Lie algebras and matrix-valued data. Project page:

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents a method for short-term airport fog forecasting using physics-informed, location-independent features, achieving successful geographic transferability across different sites.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome challenges in geographic generalization of airport fog forecasting models that often rely on location-specific features, thereby failing to transfer across different sites.

Method: A gradient boosting classifier (XGBoost) was trained on Santiago, Chile (SCEL) data using coordinate-free features based on thermodynamic and radiative processes, and tested on different global sites for geographic transferability.

Result: The model demonstrated high predictive performance with AUC values of 0.923-0.947 across diverse geographic distances and fog regimes, indicating successful transferability and reliance on universally applicable physical relationships.

Conclusion: Physics-informed and location-independent feature engineering enhances geographic transferability of atmospheric forecasting tools, providing a robust framework for broader applications beyond site-specific models.

Abstract: Short-term forecasting of airport fog (visibility < 1.0 km) presents
challenges in geographic generalization because many machine learning models
rely on location-specific features and fail to transfer across sites. This
study investigates whether fundamental thermodynamic and radiative processes
can be encoded in a coordinate-free (location-independent) feature set to
enable geographic transferability. A gradient boosting classifier (XGBoost)
trained on Santiago, Chile (SCEL, 33S) data from 2002-2009 was evaluated on a
2010-2012 holdout set and under strict zero-shot tests at Puerto Montt (SCTE),
San Francisco (KSFO), and London (EGLL). The model achieved AUC values of
0.923-0.947 across distances up to 11,650 km and different fog regimes
(radiative, advective, marine). Consistent SHAP feature rankings show that
visibility persistence, solar angle, and thermal gradients dominate
predictions, suggesting the model learned transferable physical relationships
rather than site-specific patterns. Results suggest that physics-informed,
coordinate-free feature engineering can yield geographically transferable
atmospheric forecasting tools.

TL;DR: The paper presents AirFed, a federated graph-enhanced multi-agent reinforcement learning framework addressing key challenges in UAV-MEC systems through trajectory planning and task optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing UAV-MEC systems struggle with scalability, slow convergence, and inefficient knowledge sharing in dynamic environments, especially for large-scale IoT datasets.

Method: The authors propose AirFed, employing dual-layer Graph Attention Networks to model spatial-temporal dependencies, a dual-Actor single-Critic architecture for joint optimization tasks, and a reputation-based decentralized federated learning mechanism.

Result: AirFed demonstrated significant improvements, including 42.9% weighted cost reduction, 99% deadline satisfaction, 94.2% IoT device coverage rate, and 54.5% decrease in communication overhead.

Conclusion: AirFed proves to be highly effective and scalable for large-scale UAV-MEC system implementations across varied system densities and scales.

Abstract: Multiple Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) cooperative Mobile Edge Computing
(MEC) systems face critical challenges in coordinating trajectory planning,
task offloading, and resource allocation while ensuring Quality of Service
(QoS) under dynamic and uncertain environments. Existing approaches suffer from
limited scalability, slow convergence, and inefficient knowledge sharing among
UAVs, particularly when handling large-scale IoT device deployments with
stringent deadline constraints. This paper proposes AirFed, a novel federated
graph-enhanced multi-agent reinforcement learning framework that addresses
these challenges through three key innovations. First, we design dual-layer
dynamic Graph Attention Networks (GATs) that explicitly model spatial-temporal
dependencies among UAVs and IoT devices, capturing both service relationships
and collaborative interactions within the network topology. Second, we develop
a dual-Actor single-Critic architecture that jointly optimizes continuous
trajectory control and discrete task offloading decisions. Third, we propose a
reputation-based decentralized federated learning mechanism with
gradient-sensitive adaptive quantization, enabling efficient and robust
knowledge sharing across heterogeneous UAVs. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that AirFed achieves 42.9% reduction in weighted cost compared to
state-of-the-art baselines, attains over 99% deadline satisfaction and 94.2%
IoT device coverage rate, and reduces communication overhead by 54.5%.
Scalability analysis confirms robust performance across varying UAV numbers,
IoT device densities, and system scales, validating AirFed's practical
applicability for large-scale UAV-MEC deployments.

TL;DR: The paper explores Predictive Coding (PC), an alternative algorithm to Backpropagation for training deep neural networks, offering theoretical advancements and proposing a new parameterization for stable training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the inefficiency of Backpropagation and to investigate Predictive Coding as a potentially more efficient, brain-inspired algorithm.

Method: The study uses theoretical optimization approaches to analyze PC's learning dynamics and proposes a novel parameterization termed "$\mu$PC" for improving training of deep PC networks.

Result: PC dynamics are understood as a trust-region method, potentially leveraging higher-order information. The "$\mu$PC" parameterization enables stable training for deep networks (100+ layers) with competitive performance.

Conclusion: This research significantly enhances understanding of Predictive Coding's mechanics while advocating for hardware co-design to enable practical scalability.

Abstract: Backpropagation (BP) is the standard algorithm for training the deep neural
networks that power modern artificial intelligence including large language
models. However, BP is energy inefficient and unlikely to be implemented by the
brain. This thesis studies an alternative, potentially more efficient
brain-inspired algorithm called predictive coding (PC). Unlike BP, PC networks
(PCNs) perform inference by iterative equilibration of neuron activities before
learning or weight updates. Recent work has suggested that this iterative
inference procedure provides a range of benefits over BP, such as faster
training. However, these advantages have not been consistently observed, the
inference and learning dynamics of PCNs are still poorly understood, and deep
PCNs remain practically untrainable. Here, we make significant progress towards
scaling PCNs by taking a theoretical approach grounded in optimisation theory.
First, we show that the learning dynamics of PC can be understood as an
approximate trust-region method using second-order information, despite
explicitly using only first-order local updates. Second, going beyond this
approximation, we show that PC can in principle make use of arbitrarily
higher-order information, such that for feedforward networks the effective
landscape on which PC learns is far more benign and robust to vanishing
gradients than the (mean squared error) loss landscape. Third, motivated by a
study of the inference dynamics of PCNs, we propose a new parameterisation
called ``$\mu$PC'', which for the first time allows stable training of 100+
layer networks with little tuning and competitive performance on simple tasks.
Overall, this thesis significantly advances our fundamental understanding of
the inference and learning dynamics of PCNs, while highlighting the need for
future research to focus on hardware co-design if PC is to compete with BP at
scale.

TL;DR: HAIN introduces a novel machine learning architecture combining accuracy and interpretability, outperforming traditional interpretability approaches while identifying biologically relevant cancer biomarkers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for models that combine high accuracy with interpretability, crucial for decision-sensitive applications in fields like genomics, healthcare, and finance.

Method: HAIN utilizes multi-level attention mechanisms, dimensionality reduction, and explanation-driven loss functions. It incorporates gradient-weighted attention for feature-level interpretability and prototype-based representations for global model explanations.

Result: HAIN achieves a classification accuracy of 94.3% on the TCGA dataset, outperforming SHAP and LIME in transparency and explanatory power. It also identifies biologically relevant cancer biomarkers.

Conclusion: HAIN is a promising AI solution harmonizing predictive accuracy with interpretability, offering advancements for precision medicine and regulatory compliance.

Abstract: The proliferation of high-dimensional datasets in fields such as genomics,
healthcare, and finance has created an urgent need for machine learning models
that are both highly accurate and inherently interpretable. While traditional
deep learning approaches deliver strong predictive performance, their lack of
transparency often impedes their deployment in critical, decision-sensitive
applications. In this work, we introduce the Hierarchical Attention-based
Interpretable Network (HAIN), a novel architecture that unifies multi-level
attention mechanisms, dimensionality reduction, and explanation-driven loss
functions to deliver interpretable and robust analysis of complex biomedical
data. HAIN provides feature-level interpretability via gradientweighted
attention and offers global model explanations through prototype-based
representations. Comprehensive evaluation on The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)
dataset demonstrates that HAIN achieves a classification accuracy of 94.3%,
surpassing conventional post-hoc interpretability approaches such as SHAP and
LIME in both transparency and explanatory power. Furthermore, HAIN effectively
identifies biologically relevant cancer biomarkers, supporting its utility for
clinical and research applications. By harmonizing predictive accuracy with
interpretability, HAIN advances the development of transparent AI solutions for
precision medicine and regulatory compliance.

### [362] [Symbolic Neural Generation with Applications to Lead Discovery in Drug Design](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23379)
*Ashwin Srinivasan,A Baskar,Tirtharaj Dash,Michael Bain,Sanjay Kumar Dey,Mainak Banerjee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces Symbolic Neural Generators (SNGs) that integrate symbolic learning with neural methods to generate data meeting formal correctness criteria. Tested in drug design, they produce viable solutions comparable to state-of-the-art approaches and assist in molecule selection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to develop hybrid neurosymbolic models that integrate symbolic learning and neural reasoning to generate data while adhering to logical specifications and formal correctness criteria. This approach addresses challenges in scenarios with limited data and poorly understood targets.

Method: SNGs combine symbolic learners with neural generators. Logical specifications constrain the data-generation process, rejecting invalid instances. The implemented SNG uses Inductive Logic Programming and a large language model, with semantics based on weighted partial orders.

Result: SNGs demonstrated strong performance in drug design benchmarks. For exploratory problems in drug design, the generated molecules showed binding affinities comparable to clinical candidates. Experts found symbolic specifications useful for filtering and selected viable molecules for synthesis.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that SNGs effectively combine symbolic and neural approaches to address complex data generation tasks. They show promise in drug design, especially where targets are poorly understood, and aid in expert assessments for practical applications in synthesis and testing.

Abstract: We investigate a relatively underexplored class of hybrid neurosymbolic
models integrating symbolic learning with neural reasoning to construct data
generators meeting formal correctness criteria. In \textit{Symbolic Neural
Generators} (SNGs), symbolic learners examine logical specifications of
feasible data from a small set of instances -- sometimes just one. Each
specification in turn constrains the conditional information supplied to a
neural-based generator, which rejects any instance violating the symbolic
specification. Like other neurosymbolic approaches, SNG exploits the
complementary strengths of symbolic and neural methods. The outcome of an SNG
is a triple $(H, X, W)$, where $H$ is a symbolic description of feasible
instances constructed from data, $X$ a set of generated new instances that
satisfy the description, and $W$ an associated weight. We introduce a semantics
for such systems, based on the construction of appropriate \textit{base} and
\textit{fibre} partially-ordered sets combined into an overall partial order,
and outline a probabilistic extension relevant to practical applications. In
this extension, SNGs result from searching over a weighted partial ordering. We
implement an SNG combining a restricted form of Inductive Logic Programming
(ILP) with a large language model (LLM) and evaluate it on early-stage drug
design. Our main interest is the description and the set of potential inhibitor
molecules generated by the SNG. On benchmark problems -- where drug targets are
well understood -- SNG performance is statistically comparable to
state-of-the-art methods. On exploratory problems with poorly understood
targets, generated molecules exhibit binding affinities on par with leading
clinical candidates. Experts further find the symbolic specifications useful as
preliminary filters, with several generated molecules identified as viable for
synthesis and wet-lab testing.

*Azim Ahmadzadeh,Mahsa Khazaei,Elaina Rohlfing*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Multiscale Dubuc Distance (MDD) as a novel similarity measure for time series, which outperforms the conventional Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) in certain scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the search and indexing of high-dimensional, complex time series data by addressing limitations of the existing Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) technique.

Method: The study develops and evaluates the Multiscale Dubuc Distance (MDD), a similarity measure that checks time series similarity across multiple temporal scales without point-to-point alignment, using simulations, 95 datasets from the UCR archive, and a real-world classification task.

Result: MDD outperforms DTW in several cases, with substantial performance improvements in specific scenarios, and demonstrates its effectiveness in a complex real-world classification problem.

Conclusion: MDD is shown to be a robust and superior alternative to DTW for time series comparison in several challenging applications, making it a valuable tool for practical use.

Abstract: Time series are high-dimensional and complex data objects, making their
efficient search and indexing a longstanding challenge in data mining. Building
on a recently introduced similarity measure, namely Multiscale Dubuc Distance
(MDD), this paper investigates its comparative strengths and limitations
relative to the widely used Dynamic Time Warping (DTW). MDD is novel in two key
ways: it evaluates time series similarity across multiple temporal scales and
avoids point-to-point alignment. We demonstrate that in many scenarios where
MDD outperforms DTW, the gains are substantial, and we provide a detailed
analysis of the specific performance gaps it addresses. We provide simulations,
in addition to the 95 datasets from the UCR archive, to test our hypotheses.
Finally, we apply both methods to a challenging real-world classification task
and show that MDD yields a significant improvement over DTW, underscoring its
practical utility.

*Qingzhu Zhang,Jiani Zhong,Zongsheng Li,Xinke Shen,Quanying Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a task-specific pre-training framework using multiple EEG datasets to enhance emotion recognition, outperforming existing models with significant improvements in accuracy and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the challenge that existing task-general pre-training EEG models face in complex tasks like emotion recognition due to mismatches in task-specific features, large inter-dataset distribution shifts, inconsistent emotion category definitions, and inter-subject variability.

Method: The authors propose a task-specific multi-dataset joint pre-training framework with a cross-dataset covariance alignment loss to align statistical properties across datasets, along with a hybrid encoder model combining a Mamba-like linear attention channel and a spatiotemporal dynamics model.

Result: The proposed framework achieves a 4.57% improvement in AUROC for few-shot emotion recognition and an 11.92% improvement in accuracy for zero-shot generalization to a new dataset compared to state-of-the-art models. Multi-dataset training yields an 8.55% performance gain over single-dataset training.

Conclusion: The scalable multi-dataset pre-training framework enhances generalizability and performance in affective computing, demonstrating the value of task-specific pre-training for EEG-based emotion recognition.

Abstract: Task-specific pre-training is essential when task representations diverge
from generic pre-training features. Existing task-general pre-training EEG
models struggle with complex tasks like emotion recognition due to mismatches
between task-specific features and broad pre-training approaches. This work
aims to develop a task-specific multi-dataset joint pre-training framework for
cross-dataset emotion recognition, tackling problems of large inter-dataset
distribution shifts, inconsistent emotion category definitions, and substantial
inter-subject variability. We introduce a cross-dataset covariance alignment
loss to align second-order statistical properties across datasets, enabling
robust generalization without the need for extensive labels or per-subject
calibration. To capture the long-term dependency and complex dynamics of EEG,
we propose a hybrid encoder combining a Mamba-like linear attention channel
encoder and a spatiotemporal dynamics model. Our method outperforms
state-of-the-art large-scale EEG models by an average of 4.57% in AUROC for
few-shot emotion recognition and 11.92% in accuracy for zero-shot
generalization to a new dataset. Performance scales with the increase of
datasets used in pre-training. Multi-dataset joint pre-training achieves a
performance gain of 8.55% over single-dataset training. This work provides a
scalable framework for task-specific pre-training and highlights its benefit in
generalizable affective computing. Our code is available at

*Jianqing Zhang,Zhezheng Hao,Wei Xia,Hande Dong,Hong Wang,Chenxing Wei,Yuyan Zhou,Yubin Qi,Qiang Lin,Jian Cao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces GAPO, a reinforcement learning method designed to overcome challenges posed by skewed reward distributions in real-world code-editing tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RL methods for training large language models in code-editing tasks struggle with skewed reward distributions and unpredictable outliers that distort advantage computation and increase noise.

Method: GAPO finds an outlier-free highest-density interval (HDI) per prompt and replaces the group mean with the median of that interval in advantage calculation, ensuring robust handling of skewed distributions.

Result: GAPO demonstrated consistent improvements in exact match accuracy when tested on nine instruction-tuned LLMs (3B-14B) across 51,844 real-world code-editing tasks in 10 languages.

Conclusion: GAPO offers a robust and efficient solution for RL-based code-editing in large language models, outperforming competing methods like GRPO and DAPO, with publicly available code for further application.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is widely used for post-training large language
models (LLMs) in code editing, where group-relative methods like GRPO are
popular for their critic-free, normalized advantage estimation. However, in
real-world code-editing scenarios, reward distributions are often skewed with
unpredictable outliers, leading to distorted advantage computation and
increased noise. To address this issue, we propose Group Adaptive Policy
Optimization (GAPO), which adaptively finds an outlier-free highest-density
interval (HDI) per prompt and then uses the median of that interval as an
adaptive Q to replace the group mean in advantage calculation. This adaptive Q
robustly handles skewed distributions while remaining plug-and-play and
efficient. We validate GAPO on nine instruction-tuned LLMs (3B-14B) using a
large internal dataset of 51,844 real-world, history-aware code-editing tasks
across 10 languages, demonstrating consistent improvements in exact match
accuracy over GRPO and its variant DAPO. Code is publicly available.

*Chen Lu,Ke Xue,Lei Yuan,Yao Wang,Yaoyuan Wang,Sheng Fu,Chao Qian*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Seq-MADAC, a framework addressing inter-dependent hyperparameter configurations using sequential multi-agent reinforcement learning, which outperforms state-of-the-art methods and generalizes widely.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve automated machine learning techniques by dynamically configuring algorithm parameters, especially addressing inter-dependent parameter setups that prior techniques overlooked.

Method: The method involves designing Seq-MADAC—a sequential multi-agent DAC framework that uses sequential advantage decomposition networks to manage inherent inter-dependencies among algorithm parameters.

Result: Experiments on synthetic functions and optimization algorithms show Seq-MADAC performs better than existing MARL methods and generalizes well across different problems.

Conclusion: Seq-MADAC sets a new standard for automated algorithm configuration, particularly in scenarios with dependency-aware adjustments.

Abstract: Dynamic algorithm configuration (DAC) is a recent trend in automated machine
learning, which can dynamically adjust the algorithm's configuration during the
execution process and relieve users from tedious trial-and-error tuning tasks.
Recently, multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) approaches have improved
the configuration of multiple heterogeneous hyperparameters, making various
parameter configurations for complex algorithms possible. However, many complex
algorithms have inherent inter-dependencies among multiple parameters (e.g.,
determining the operator type first and then the operator's parameter), which
are, however, not considered in previous approaches, thus leading to
sub-optimal results. In this paper, we propose the sequential multi-agent DAC
(Seq-MADAC) framework to address this issue by considering the inherent
inter-dependencies of multiple parameters. Specifically, we propose a
sequential advantage decomposition network, which can leverage action-order
information through sequential advantage decomposition. Experiments from
synthetic functions to the configuration of multi-objective optimization
algorithms demonstrate Seq-MADAC's superior performance over state-of-the-art
MARL methods and show strong generalization across problem classes. Seq-MADAC
establishes a new paradigm for the widespread dependency-aware automated
algorithm configuration. Our code is available at

### [367] [Restoring Pruned Large Language Models via Lost Component Compensation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21834)
*Zijian Feng,Hanzhang Zhou,Zixiao Zhu,Tianjiao Li,Jia Jim Deryl Chua,Lee Onn Mak,Gee Wah Ng,Kezhi Mao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RestoreLCC proposes a method to address performance degradation in pruned LLMs by selectively restoring lost information in attention activations, significantly improving recovery without compromising efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pruned large language models often experience performance degradation, and existing restoration methods fail to effectively recover their capabilities due to overlooking unique properties of pruned models.

Method: RestoreLCC identifies pruning-induced information loss in attention activations and restores critical components by probing attention heads, extracting lost components via activation differences, and injecting them back for recovery.

Result: Experiments show RestoreLCC consistently outperforms existing restoration methods in general and task-specific performance recovery while maintaining sparsity and efficiency.

Conclusion: RestoreLCC provides an effective restoration framework for pruned LLMs, balancing performance recovery with inference efficiency and compatibility across various pruning schemes.

Abstract: Pruning is a widely used technique to reduce the size and inference cost of
large language models (LLMs), but it often causes performance degradation. To
mitigate this, existing restoration methods typically employ
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), such as LoRA, to recover the pruned
model's performance. However, most PEFT methods are designed for dense models
and overlook the distinct properties of pruned models, often resulting in
suboptimal recovery. In this work, we propose a targeted restoration strategy
for pruned models that restores performance while preserving their low cost and
high efficiency. We observe that pruning-induced information loss is reflected
in attention activations, and selectively reintroducing components of this
information can significantly recover model performance. Based on this insight,
we introduce RestoreLCC (Restoring Pruned LLMs via Lost Component
Compensation), a plug-and-play method that contrastively probes critical
attention heads via activation editing, extracts lost components from
activation differences, and finally injects them back into the corresponding
pruned heads for compensation and recovery. RestoreLCC is compatible with
structured, semi-structured, and unstructured pruning schemes. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that RestoreLCC consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines in both general and task-specific performance
recovery, without compromising the sparsity or inference efficiency of pruned
models.

### [368] [A Multimodal, Multitask System for Generating E Commerce Text Listings from Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21835)
*Nayan Kumar Singh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents a multi-task system for generating factual text listings from images, improving accuracy and efficiency compared to current methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Retailers face challenges in generating accurate, engaging descriptions manually. Existing Vision to Language Models (VLMs) suffer from factual inaccuracies and inefficiencies.

Method: The authors designed a multi-task system with a fine-tuned vision encoder for attribute prediction and price regression, along with a hierarchical text generation process embedding predicted attributes.

Result: The proposed system improved performance: attribute classification saw a 6.6% better F1 score, price regression had a 3.6% improved R2 value, factual inaccuracies dropped by 44.5%, and text generation latency reduced by 3.5 times. ROUGE-L score was slightly lower (-3.5%).

Conclusion: The system demonstrates better factual consistency and efficiency than traditional VLMs, making it highly suitable for retail applications despite a minor decline in ROUGE-L score.

Abstract: Manually generating catchy descriptions and names is labor intensive and a
slow process for retailers. Although generative AI provides an automation
solution in form of Vision to Language Models (VLM), the current VLMs are prone
to factual "hallucinations". Siloed, single task models are not only
inefficient but also fail to capture interdependent relationships between
features. To address these challenges, we propose an end to end, multi task
system that generates factually grounded textual listings from a single image.
The contributions of this study are two proposals for the model architecture.
First, application of multi task learning approach for fine tuning a vision
encoder where a single vision backbone is jointly trained on attribute
prediction such as color, hemline and neck style and price regression. Second,
introduction of a hierarchical generation process where the model's own
predicted attributes are embedded in a prompt and fed to the text decoder to
improve factual consistency. The experiments demonstrate the superiority of
this architecture. The multi tasking approach outperforms both the independent
price regression, with a 3.6% better R2 Value and attribute classification,
with a 6.6% improvement F1 score. Critically, the hierarchical generation
process proves highly effective, slashing the factual hallucination rate from
12.7% to 7.1%, a 44.5% relative reduction, compared to a non hierarchical
ablation. The hierarchical approach also reduces the latency of the
autoregressive text generation process by a factor of 3.5 when compared to
direct vision to language model of similar size. One minor caveat is that the
model does perform 3.5% worse than direct vision-to-language model on ROUGE-L
score.

*Jaya Krishna Mandivarapu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces COLA, a framework to enable continual learning for LLMs while avoiding catastrophic forgetting by using low-dimensional weight embeddings through an autoencoder.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address continual learning challenges in large language models (LLMs), notably catastrophic forgetting and inefficiencies in frequent re-training.

Method: The framework employs autoencoders to learn low-dimensional embeddings of weights for different tasks, facilitating knowledge transfer without data replay or excessive task-specific parameters.

Result: COLA minimizes catastrophic forgetting, reduces parameter usage and memory size, and outperforms state-of-the-art continual learning methods across diverse datasets.

Conclusion: COLA effectively addresses the limitations of LLMs in continual learning by ensuring efficient learning of new tasks without degrading performance or requiring previous task data.

Abstract: Learning a set of tasks over time, also known as continual learning (CL), is
one of the most challenging problems in artificial intelligence due to
catastrophic forgetting. Large language models (LLMs) are often impractical to
frequent re-training and continual learning , due to high cost of computational
resources for training. Moreover, LLM are not suitable for continual learning
as updating these models over time for acquiring new knowledge leads to
overwrites existing knowledge leading to common phenomenon know as
\textit{catastrophic forgetting}. In this paper, we aim to address these
concerns using a novel framework , COLA that employs an autoencoder to learn
capture low-dimensional embeddings of the weights associated with various
tasks. Our approach facilitates the transfer of knowledge to new tasks while
preventing catastrophic forgetting, all without using data replay or a
substantial set of task-specific parameters. Our approach, COLA, makes the LLM
efficiently learn new tasks with minimal training, insignificant performance
degradation on previous tasks, and eliminates the need for retaining earlier
training data. Empirical evaluation on different datasets ranging from task
oriented dialouge system to intent classsfication datasets showcases that our
method not only overcomes catastrophic forgetting but also achieves significant
reduction in parameter usage and memory size, across multiple tasks and
outperforming the existing state of the art methods across multiple datasets.

TL;DR: KARIPAP, a tensor network compression based on quantum concepts, reduces computational strain and memory usage of LLMs with minimal impact on performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs have significant computational and environmental drawbacks due to their large-scale parameter and training demands, requiring a more efficient compression method.

Method: Uses quantum-inspired tensor network compression through iPEPS and TRG contraction, leveraging multi-directional entanglement to conserve computational resources.

Result: The approach reduced LLaMA-2 7B’s memory usage by 93%, parameters by 70%, and sped up training by 50% and inference by 25%, with only 2-3% accuracy loss.

Conclusion: KARIPAP enables scalable and energy-efficient LLM architectures by confirming that such models occupy low-dimensional entanglement manifolds, promising quantum-aware designs.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT and LLaMA drive rapid progress in
generative AI, yet their huge parameter scales create severe computational and
environmental burdens. High training costs, energy use, and limited device
deployment hinder accessibility. Existing compression - pruning, distillation,
low-rank, and quantization - reduces size but ignores complex inter-layer
correlations. We propose KARIPAP, a quantum-inspired tensor network compression
using Infinite Projected Entangled Pair States (iPEPS) and Tensor
Renormalization Group (TRG) contraction. Unlike 1D Matrix Product States, iPEPS
captures multi-directional entanglement in attention and deep transformer
layers. TRG ensures polynomial-time contraction, making tensorization feasible
while preserving key correlation geometry. Experiments on LLaMA-2 7B show up to
93% memory and 70% parameter reduction, with 50% faster training, 25% faster
inference, and only 2-3% accuracy loss. Layer-wise entanglement profiling
reveals redundancy in deeper layers, confirming their suitability for tensor
factorization. KARIPAP demonstrates that modern LLMs occupy low-dimensional
entanglement manifolds, enabling scalable, energy-efficient, and quantum-aware
AI architectures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address privacy risks posed by membership inference attacks while overcoming limitations of shadow models and heavy query dependencies.

Method: Uses Gaussian process meta-modeling with post-hoc metrics to train a classifier for distinguishing training data members, leveraging features like accuracy, entropy, and sensitivity measures.

Result: GP-MIA demonstrated high effectiveness and generalizability across synthetic, fraud detection, CIFAR-10, and WikiText-2 datasets.

Conclusion: GP-MIA offers a practical, efficient, and interpretable solution to detect membership inference attacks, enhancing privacy safeguards.

Abstract: Membership inference attacks (MIAs) test whether a data point was part of a
model's training set, posing serious privacy risks. Existing methods often
depend on shadow models or heavy query access, which limits their practicality.
We propose GP-MIA, an efficient and interpretable approach based on Gaussian
process (GP) meta-modeling. Using post-hoc metrics such as accuracy, entropy,
dataset statistics, and optional sensitivity features (e.g. gradients, NTK
measures) from a single trained model, GP-MIA trains a GP classifier to
distinguish members from non-members while providing calibrated uncertainty
estimates. Experiments on synthetic data, real-world fraud detection data,
CIFAR-10, and WikiText-2 show that GP-MIA achieves high accuracy and
generalizability, offering a practical alternative to existing MIAs.

*Kaiyi Xu,Junchao Gong,Wenlong Zhang,Ben Fei,Lei Bai,Wanli Ouyang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces SynCast, a novel precipitation nowcasting method using reinforcement learning-inspired optimization to address challenges in radar echo-based deep learning models, such as over-smoothing and conflicting metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing precipitation nowcasting methods face limitations such as over-smoothed predictions for extreme weather events and difficulty in optimizing conflicting metrics like CSI and FAR simultaneously.

Method: The authors propose SynCast, which utilizes Diffusion Sequential Preference Optimization in a two-stage training framework. The first stage reduces false alarms (FAR), while the second stage optimizes critical success index (CSI) without degrading FAR results.

Result: SynCast delivers synergistic improvements in both CSI and FAR metrics, outperforming traditional probabilistic and deterministic models in precipitation nowcasting.

Conclusion: Preference optimization via SynCast can consistently overcome key performance challenges in precipitation nowcasting, showcasing potential for reliable extreme weather monitoring.

Abstract: Precipitation nowcasting based on radar echoes plays a crucial role in
monitoring extreme weather and supporting disaster prevention. Although deep
learning approaches have achieved significant progress, they still face notable
limitations. For example, deterministic models tend to produce over-smoothed
predictions, which struggle to capture extreme events and fine-scale
precipitation patterns. Probabilistic generative models, due to their inherent
randomness, often show fluctuating performance across different metrics and
rarely achieve consistently optimal results. Furthermore, precipitation
nowcasting is typically evaluated using multiple metrics, some of which are
inherently conflicting. For instance, there is often a trade-off between the
Critical Success Index (CSI) and the False Alarm Ratio (FAR), making it
challenging for existing models to deliver forecasts that perform well on both
metrics simultaneously. To address these challenges, we introduce preference
optimization into precipitation nowcasting for the first time, motivated by the
success of reinforcement learning from human feedback in large language models.
Specifically, we propose SynCast, a method that employs the two-stage
post-training framework of Diffusion Sequential Preference Optimization
(Diffusion-SPO), to progressively align conflicting metrics and consistently
achieve superior performance. In the first stage, the framework focuses on
reducing FAR, training the model to effectively suppress false alarms. Building
on this foundation, the second stage further optimizes CSI with constraints
that preserve FAR alignment, thereby achieving synergistic improvements across
these conflicting metrics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing vision-language models are largely English-centric, limiting effectiveness in multilingual scenarios.

Method: Comprehensive empirical analysis of multilingual design factors such as training data, encoder, and text backbones; developed TowerVision models and VisionBlocks dataset for multilingual tasks.

Result: TowerVision exhibited superior performance in multimodal benchmarks, particularly in culturally grounded tasks and multimodal translation, surpassing models trained on larger datasets.

Conclusion: Multilingual vision-language training enhances cross-lingual generalization and challenges the assumption that instruction-tuned LLMs are always optimal. Resources are released for further research.

Abstract: Despite significant advances in vision-language models (VLMs), most existing
work follows an English-centric design process, limiting their effectiveness in
multilingual settings. In this work, we provide a comprehensive empirical study
analyzing the impact of several multilingual design choices, such as training
data composition, encoder selection, and text backbones. The result is
TowerVision, a family of open multilingual VLMs for both image-text and
video-text tasks, built upon the multilingual text-only model Tower+.
TowerVision achieves competitive performance on multiple multimodal
multilingual benchmarks and shows particular strength in culturally grounded
tasks and multimodal translation. By incorporating visual and cultural context
during fine-tuning, our models surpass existing approaches trained on
substantially larger datasets, as demonstrated on ALM-Bench and Multi30K (image
tasks) and ViMUL-Bench (video tasks). Alongside the models, we release
VisionBlocks, a high-quality, curated vision-language dataset. Our findings
highlight that multilingual vision-language training data substantially
improves cross-lingual generalization -- both from high-resource to
underrepresented languages and vice versa -- and that instruction-tuned LLMs
are not always the optimal initialization point. To support further research,
we publicly release all models, data, and training recipes.

*Hojin Kim,Romit Maulik*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a differentiable adaptive framework using DEIM to enhance interpretability in deep learning and dynamical systems, demonstrating its applications and limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome limitations in DEIM's fixed interpolation points for dynamic and complex systems. Additionally, the authors aim to use DEIM for interpretability of neural differential equation models.

Method: The method involves developing an adaptive DEIM formulation for the viscous Burgers equation and leveraging it as an analysis tool for Neural Ordinary Differential Equations in vortex-merging problems.

Result: The framework efficiently selects adaptive interpolation points and exposes physical features and limitations in NODE dynamics, improving understanding of generalization behavior.

Conclusion: DEIM is positioned as both a model reduction tool and a diagnostic method to better understand neural differential equation models and enhance their adaptability.

Abstract: We present a differentiable framework that leverages the Discrete Empirical
Interpolation Method (DEIM) for interpretable deep learning and dynamical
system analysis. Although DEIM efficiently approximates nonlinear terms in
projection-based reduced-order models (POD-ROM), its fixed interpolation points
limit the adaptability to complex and time-varying dynamics. To address this
limitation, we first develop a differentiable adaptive DEIM formulation for the
one-dimensional viscous Burgers equation, which allows neural networks to
dynamically select interpolation points in a computationally efficient and
physically consistent manner. We then apply DEIM as an interpretable analysis
tool for examining the learned dynamics of a pre-trained Neural Ordinary
Differential Equation (NODE) on a two-dimensional vortex-merging problem. The
DEIM trajectories reveal physically meaningful features in the learned dynamics
of NODE and expose its limitations when extrapolating to unseen flow
configurations. These findings demonstrate that DEIM can serve not only as a
model reduction tool but also as a diagnostic framework for understanding and
improving the generalization behavior of neural differential equation models.

*Fardin Gankhanloo,Emmett Springer,Erik H. Hoyer,Daniel L. Young,Kimia Ghobadi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a mixed-integer programming (MIP) framework to optimize healthcare risk assessment tools amid challenges such as intervention-censored outcomes and asymmetric misclassification costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving risk assessment tools in healthcare using electronic health record (EHR) data to overcome partial supervision and asymmetric misclassification challenges.

Method: A mixed-integer programming (MIP) framework with feasible label sets, distance-aware objectives, minimum threshold gaps, and CSO relaxation for efficient optimization.

Result: The framework supports governance constraints, enabling practical deployment in clinical workflows and optimizing point-based scoring systems.

Conclusion: The approach is innovative in handling challenges of ordinal risk categories and provides practical solutions for improving deployability in healthcare risk assessments.

Abstract: Risk assessment tools in healthcare commonly employ point-based scoring
systems that map patients to ordinal risk categories via thresholds. While
electronic health record (EHR) data presents opportunities for data-driven
optimization of these tools, two fundamental challenges impede standard
supervised learning: (1) partial supervision arising from intervention-censored
outcomes, where only extreme categories can be reliably labeled, and (2)
asymmetric misclassification costs that increase with ordinal distance. We
propose a mixed-integer programming (MIP) framework that jointly optimizes
scoring weights and category thresholds under these constraints. Our approach
handles partial supervision through per-instance feasible label sets,
incorporates asymmetric distance-aware objectives, and prevents middle-category
collapse via minimum threshold gaps. We further develop a CSO relaxation using
softplus losses that preserves the ordinal structure while enabling efficient
optimization. The framework supports governance constraints including sign
restrictions, sparsity, and minimal modifications to incumbent tools, ensuring
practical deployability in clinical workflows.

### [376] [Privacy-preserving Decision-focused Learning for Multi-energy Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21858)
*Yangze Zhou,Ruiyang Yao,Dalin Qin,Yixiong Jia,Yi Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a privacy-preserving framework for decision-focused learning (DFL) in multi-energy system (MES) dispatch, addressing privacy and security issues while achieving lower dispatch costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional load forecasting models optimize forecasting accuracy but neglect impacts on MES decision-making. Privacy concerns arise when adopting DFL methods in MES due to the sharing of sensitive data across sectors.

Method: The authors introduced a privacy-preserving DFL framework using information masking, a safety protocol with matrix decomposition and homomorphic encryption, and a load pattern recognition algorithm for training DFL models tailored to heterogeneous load patterns.

Result: The framework is theoretically validated and tested on real-world MES data, showing effective privacy protection and lower average daily dispatch costs compared to other methods.

Conclusion: This approach bridges the gap between load forecasting and decision-making for MES dispatch while addressing privacy concerns and achieving cost reductions.

Abstract: Decision-making for multi-energy system (MES) dispatch depends on accurate
load forecasting. Traditionally, load forecasting and decision-making for MES
are implemented separately. Forecasting models are typically trained to
minimize forecasting errors, overlooking their impact on downstream
decision-making. To address this, decision-focused learning (DFL) has been
studied to minimize decision-making costs instead. However, practical adoption
of DFL in MES faces significant challenges: the process requires sharing
sensitive load data and model parameters across multiple sectors, raising
serious privacy issues. To this end, we propose a privacy-preserving DFL
framework tailored for MES. Our approach introduces information masking to
safeguard private data while enabling recovery of decision variables and
gradients required for model training. To further enhance security for DFL, we
design a safety protocol combining matrix decomposition and homomorphic
encryption, effectively preventing collusion and unauthorized data access.
Additionally, we developed a privacy-preserving load pattern recognition
algorithm, enabling the training of specialized DFL models for heterogeneous
load patterns. Theoretical analysis and comprehensive case studies, including
real-world MES data, demonstrate that our framework not only protects privacy
but also consistently achieves lower average daily dispatch costs compared to
existing methods.

*Samuel Bright-Thonney,Christina Reissel,Gaia Grosso,Nathaniel Woodward,Katya Govorkova,Andrzej Novak,Sang Eon Park,Eric Moreno,Philip Harris*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces AutoSciDACT, a pipeline for novelty detection in scientific datasets, addressing noisy data and ensuring statistical precision in anomaly identification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods struggle with high-dimensional data noise and the inability to support rigorous statistical claims for anomalies in scientific discovery.

Method: AutoSciDACT employs contrastive pre-training to generate low-dimensional representations and uses the New Physics Learning Machine for sensitive anomaly detection and statistical validation.

Result: Experiments across diverse domains showcase sensitivity to subtle anomalous signals, highlighting the method's broad applicability.

Conclusion: AutoSciDACT represents a promising step toward a unified framework for scientific anomaly detection, capable of producing statistically robust findings.

Abstract: Novelty detection in large scientific datasets faces two key challenges: the
noisy and high-dimensional nature of experimental data, and the necessity of
making statistically robust statements about any observed outliers. While there
is a wealth of literature on anomaly detection via dimensionality reduction,
most methods do not produce outputs compatible with quantifiable claims of
scientific discovery. In this work we directly address these challenges,
presenting the first step towards a unified pipeline for novelty detection
adapted for the rigorous statistical demands of science. We introduce
AutoSciDACT (Automated Scientific Discovery with Anomalous Contrastive
Testing), a general-purpose pipeline for detecting novelty in scientific data.
AutoSciDACT begins by creating expressive low-dimensional data representations
using a contrastive pre-training, leveraging the abundance of high-quality
simulated data in many scientific domains alongside expertise that can guide
principled data augmentation strategies. These compact embeddings then enable
an extremely sensitive machine learning-based two-sample test using the New
Physics Learning Machine (NPLM) framework, which identifies and statistically
quantifies deviations in observed data relative to a reference distribution
(null hypothesis). We perform experiments across a range of astronomical,
physical, biological, image, and synthetic datasets, demonstrating strong
sensitivity to small injections of anomalous data across all domains.

*Shuang Wang,Xuben Wang,Fei Deng,Peifan Jiang,Jian Chen,Gianluca Fiandaca*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces OpenEM, a standardized, large-scale 3D geoelectric dataset to support deep learning applications in electromagnetic (EM) exploration. It addresses the limitations of existing datasets and includes a deep learning-based fast forward modeling approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional EM methods struggle with the lack of realistic and standardized 3D geoelectric datasets, hindering the application of deep learning techniques in complex geological scenarios.

Method: The authors developed OpenEM, a dataset comprising nine categories of geoelectric models with diverse geological structures. A deep learning-based fast forward modeling approach was also introduced for efficient simulations.

Result: OpenEM enables reliable and efficient forward modeling, offering comprehensive coverage for geological scenarios. It provides a platform for advancing deep learning applications in EM exploration.

Conclusion: OpenEM addresses the challenges in constructing realistic geoelectric datasets and accelerates deep learning advancements in electromagnetic exploration methods. The dataset and associated tools are publicly available for research use.

Abstract: With the remarkable success of deep learning, applying such techniques to EM
methods has emerged as a promising research direction to overcome the
limitations of conventional approaches. The effectiveness of deep learning
methods depends heavily on the quality of datasets, which directly influences
model performance and generalization ability. Existing application studies
often construct datasets from random one-dimensional or structurally simple
three-dimensional models, which fail to represent the complexity of real
geological environments. Furthermore, the absence of standardized, publicly
available three-dimensional geoelectric datasets continues to hinder progress
in deep learning based EM exploration. To address these limitations, we present
OpenEM, a large scale, multi structural three dimensional geoelectric dataset
that encompasses a broad range of geologically plausible subsurface structures.
OpenEM consists of nine categories of geoelectric models, spanning from simple
configurations with anomalous bodies in half space to more complex structures
such as flat layers, folded layers, flat faults, curved faults, and their
corresponding variants with anomalous bodies. Since three-dimensional forward
modeling in electromagnetics is extremely time-consuming, we further developed
a deep learning based fast forward modeling approach for OpenEM, enabling
efficient and reliable forward modeling across the entire dataset. This
capability allows OpenEM to be rapidly deployed for a wide range of tasks.
OpenEM provides a unified, comprehensive, and large-scale dataset for common EM
exploration systems to accelerate the application of deep learning in
electromagnetic methods. The complete dataset, along with the forward modeling
codes and trained models, is publicly available at

### [379] [The Mirror Loop: Recursive Non-Convergence in Generative Reasoning Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21861)
*Bentley DeVilling*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study investigates how large language models (LLMs) handle recursive reasoning, showing that without external feedback, self-correction plateaus. Grounding information improves reasoning effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate whether large language models can effectively use recursive self-correction for progress in reasoning tasks, particularly under conditions of limited external feedback.

Method: The authors tested three LLMs (OpenAI GPT-4o-mini, Anthropic Claude 3 Haiku, and Google Gemini 2.0 Flash) across four task categories (arithmetic, code, explanation, reflection) for ten iterations each. They compared ungrounded self-critique with a grounded intervention (one verification step at iteration three).

Result: Ungrounded runs showed decline in informational change (~55%), converging to informational closure. Grounded runs countered this trend, with a +28% rebound in informational change and sustained updates. Cross-measures like edit distance and embedding drift confirmed consistency.

Conclusion: Recursive reasoning in LLMs is limited without interaction with external sources, leading to epistemic stasis. A minimal grounding intervention shows potential for maintaining reasoning flux. The findings guide the design of grounded, cooperative reasoning systems.

Abstract: Large language models are often described as capable of reflective reasoning,
yet recursive self-evaluation without external feedback frequently yields
reformulation rather than progress. We test this prediction in a cross-provider
study of 144 reasoning sequences across three models (OpenAI GPT-4o-mini,
Anthropic Claude 3 Haiku, and Google Gemini 2.0 Flash) and four task families
(arithmetic, code, explanation, reflection), each iterated ten times under two
conditions: ungrounded self-critique and a minimal grounding intervention (a
single verification step at iteration three). Mean informational change (delta
I, measured via normalized edit distance) declined by 55% from early (0.193) to
late (0.087) iterations in ungrounded runs, with consistent patterns across all
three providers. Grounded runs showed a +28% rebound in informational change
immediately after the intervention and sustained non-zero variance thereafter.
Complementary measures-n-gram novelty, embedding drift, and character-level
entropy-converged on the same pattern: reflection without contact tends toward
informational closure. We interpret this as evidence for a structural limit on
self-correction in generative reasoning: without an exchange of information
with an independent verifier or environment, recursive inference approaches an
attractor state of epistemic stasis. Minimal grounding functions as dissipative
coupling, reintroducing informational flux. The cross-architecture consistency
suggests the mirror loop arises from shared autoregressive training objectives
rather than provider-specific alignment schemes. The results delineate when
reflection is performative rather than epistemic and motivate design principles
for grounded, cooperative reasoning. Materials and code are publicly available.

TL;DR: This paper revisits the orbital minimization method (OMM), a classical optimization framework, to train neural networks to approximate eigenfunctions of operators, demonstrating its advantages in benchmark tasks and relevance in modern machine learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to bridge classical numerical methods with modern computational needs by exploring how the OMM framework can enable scalable applications, such as representation learning and solving PDEs, using neural networks.

Method: The authors provide a linear-algebraic proof of OMM's consistency, adapt it for training neural networks on decomposing positive semidefinite operators, and evaluate its performance on benchmark tasks.

Result: The adapted OMM framework shows practical advantages across a range of tasks, demonstrating its utility in modern computational workflows, such as numerical simulations and machine learning pipelines.

Conclusion: Revisiting classical methods like OMM through the lens of modern machine learning theory and computation reveals new perspectives and practical tools for scalable and effective applications.

Abstract: Spectral decomposition of linear operators plays a central role in many areas
of machine learning and scientific computing. Recent work has explored training
neural networks to approximate eigenfunctions of such operators, enabling
scalable approaches to representation learning, dynamical systems, and partial
differential equations (PDEs). In this paper, we revisit a classical
optimization framework from the computational physics literature known as the
\emph{orbital minimization method} (OMM), originally proposed in the 1990s for
solving eigenvalue problems in computational chemistry. We provide a simple
linear-algebraic proof of the consistency of the OMM objective, and reveal
connections between this method and several ideas that have appeared
independently across different domains. Our primary goal is to justify its
broader applicability in modern learning pipelines. We adapt this framework to
train neural networks to decompose positive semidefinite operators, and
demonstrate its practical advantages across a range of benchmark tasks. Our
results highlight how revisiting classical numerical methods through the lens
of modern theory and computation can provide not only a principled approach for
deploying neural networks in numerical simulation, but also effective and
scalable tools for machine learning.

*Chieh-Hsin Lai,Yang Song,Dongjun Kim,Yuki Mitsufuji,Stefano Ermon*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper explores diffusion models, describing their principles, mathematical foundations, and the complementary views that enable the transformation of noise into data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a conceptual and mathematically grounded understanding of diffusion models for individuals familiar with deep learning.

Method: The paper introduces three complementary views of diffusion modeling: variational, score-based, and flow-based perspectives, to describe how noise can be reversed into data.

Result: The paper explains diffusion models via a shared backbone—a time-dependent velocity field—and discusses future directions such as controllable generation and improved solvers.

Conclusion: Diffusion models rely on evolving noise into data through continuous trajectories and offer insights for efficient and guided generation.

Abstract: This monograph presents the core principles that have guided the development
of diffusion models, tracing their origins and showing how diverse formulations
arise from shared mathematical ideas. Diffusion modeling starts by defining a
forward process that gradually corrupts data into noise, linking the data
distribution to a simple prior through a continuum of intermediate
distributions. The goal is to learn a reverse process that transforms noise
back into data while recovering the same intermediates. We describe three
complementary views. The variational view, inspired by variational
autoencoders, sees diffusion as learning to remove noise step by step. The
score-based view, rooted in energy-based modeling, learns the gradient of the
evolving data distribution, indicating how to nudge samples toward more likely
regions. The flow-based view, related to normalizing flows, treats generation
as following a smooth path that moves samples from noise to data under a
learned velocity field. These perspectives share a common backbone: a
time-dependent velocity field whose flow transports a simple prior to the data.
Sampling then amounts to solving a differential equation that evolves noise
into data along a continuous trajectory. On this foundation, the monograph
discusses guidance for controllable generation, efficient numerical solvers,
and diffusion-motivated flow-map models that learn direct mappings between
arbitrary times. It provides a conceptual and mathematically grounded
understanding of diffusion models for readers with basic deep-learning
knowledge.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Deep Jump Gaussian Processes (DJGP), enhancing Jump Gaussian Processes for high-dimensional functions by adding localized linear projections and providing scalable variational inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional Jump Gaussian Processes struggle with high-dimensional input spaces, necessitating improved methods for surrogate modeling of complex functions.

Method: DJGP integrates locally linear projection layers with Gaussian Process priors for the projection matrices, capturing local structures and using scalable variational inference for training.

Result: Experiments show DJGP achieves better predictive accuracy and reliable uncertainty quantification compared to existing models on synthetic and benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: DJGP successfully addresses high-dimensional surrogate modeling with enhanced accuracy and robustness by combining local Gaussian Processes with deep projection layers.

Abstract: We introduce Deep Jump Gaussian Processes (DJGP), a novel method for
surrogate modeling of high-dimensional piecewise continuous functions. DJGP
overcomes the limitations of conventional Jump Gaussian Processes in
high-dimensional input spaces by adding a locally linear projection layer to
Jump Gaussian Processes. This projection uses region-specific matrices to
capture local subspace structures, naturally complementing the localized nature
of JGP, a variant of local Gaussian Processes. To control model complexity, we
place a Gaussian Process prior on the projection matrices, allowing them to
evolve smoothly across the input space. The projected inputs are then modeled
with a JGP to capture piecewise continuous relationships with the response.
This yields a distinctive two-layer deep learning of GP/JGP. We further develop
a scalable variational inference algorithm to jointly learn the projection
matrices and JGP hyperparameters. Experiments on synthetic and benchmark
datasets demonstrate that DJGP delivers superior predictive accuracy and more
reliable uncertainty quantification compared to existing approaches.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a hybrid linear feature extraction scheme for better performance in supervised multi-class classification by integrating robust sparse linear discriminant methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve machine learning and pattern recognition by designing better data preprocessing frameworks and transformations for effective feature representation.

Method: Introduces a hybrid linear feature extraction method combining features of robust sparse linear discriminant analysis (RSLDA) and inter-class sparsity-based discriminative least square regression (ICS_DLSR), utilizing sparsity-promoting techniques, iterative alternating minimization, and steepest descent gradient method for optimization.

Result: Experimental results on datasets containing faces, objects, and digits show that the proposed method often outperformed other competing algorithms.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully combines advantages of existing methods, offers tunable and generic applicability, and enhances classification performance in supervised learning tasks.

Abstract: The performance of machine learning and pattern recognition algorithms
generally depends on data representation. That is why, much of the current
effort in performing machine learning algorithms goes into the design of
preprocessing frameworks and data transformations able to support effective
machine learning. The method proposed in this work consists of a hybrid linear
feature extraction scheme to be used in supervised multi-class classification
problems. Inspired by two recent linear discriminant methods: robust sparse
linear discriminant analysis (RSLDA) and inter-class sparsitybased
discriminative least square regression (ICS_DLSR), we propose a unifying
criterion that is able to retain the advantages of these two powerful methods.
The resulting transformation relies on sparsity-promoting techniques both to
select the features that most accurately represent the data and to preserve the
row-sparsity consistency property of samples from the same class. The linear
transformation and the orthogonal matrix are estimated using an iterative
alternating minimization scheme based on steepest descent gradient method and
different initialization schemes. The proposed framework is generic in the
sense that it allows the combination and tuning of other linear discriminant
embedding methods. According to the experiments conducted on several datasets
including faces, objects, and digits, the proposed method was able to
outperform competing methods in most cases.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method for representing molecules using Boltzmann-weighted ensembles of graphs to improve the prediction accuracy of aptamer-ligand interactions, despite experimental biases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Experimental biases in SELEX datasets, such as PCR amplification and sequencing noise, obscure true aptamer-ligand affinities, leading to anomalous candidates.

Method: An exponential-family random graph (ERGM) embedding was developed to model molecules as Boltzmann-weighted ensembles of interaction graphs, enabling robust analysis.

Result: The proposed embedding showed improved community detection and subgraph analysis of aptamer-ligand affinities, particularly in cases with biased observations.

Conclusion: This method effectively addresses experimental biases, aiding the identification of promising aptamer candidates for further testing.

Abstract: Machine-learning methods in biochemistry commonly represent molecules as
graphs of pairwise intermolecular interactions for property and structure
predictions. Most methods operate on a single graph, typically the minimal free
energy (MFE) structure, for low-energy ensembles (conformations) representative
of structures at thermodynamic equilibrium. We introduce a thermodynamically
parameterized exponential-family random graph (ERGM) embedding that models
molecules as Boltzmann-weighted ensembles of interaction graphs. We evaluate
this embedding on SELEX datasets, where experimental biases (e.g., PCR
amplification or sequencing noise) can obscure true aptamer-ligand affinity,
producing anomalous candidates whose observed abundance diverges from their
actual binding strength. We show that the proposed embedding enables robust
community detection and subgraph-level explanations for aptamer ligand
affinity, even in the presence of biased observations. This approach may be
used to identify low-abundance aptamer candidates for further experimental
evaluation.

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenges of defending large language models (LLMs) against novel jailbreak attacks and proposes Adversarial Skill Compositional Training (ASCoT) to enhance robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models are vulnerable to jailbreak attacks, necessitating effective strategies to defend against these evolving threats.

Method: The researchers studied past adversarial attacks, extracted adversarial skills into a sparse dictionary, and developed a training approach (ASCoT) focusing on diverse compositions of these skills instead of isolated attack instances.

Result: The ASCoT method improves robustness to unseen jailbreak attacks, including complex multi-turn scenarios, while avoiding excessive refusals by the model.

Conclusion: Enhancing adversarial skill coverage, rather than merely increasing data scale, is crucial for defending models against novel jailbreak attacks effectively.

Abstract: Large language models remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks that bypass
safety guardrails to elicit harmful outputs. Defending against novel jailbreaks
represents a critical challenge in AI safety. Adversarial training -- designed
to make models robust against worst-case perturbations -- has been the dominant
paradigm for adversarial robustness. However, due to optimization challenges
and difficulties in defining realistic threat models, adversarial training
methods often fail on newly developed jailbreaks in practice. This paper
proposes a new paradigm for improving robustness against unseen jailbreaks,
centered on the Adversarial D\'ej\`a Vu hypothesis: novel jailbreaks are not
fundamentally new, but largely recombinations of adversarial skills from
previous attacks. We study this hypothesis through a large-scale analysis of 32
attack papers published over two years. Using an automated pipeline, we extract
and compress adversarial skills into a sparse dictionary of primitives, with
LLMs generating human-readable descriptions. Our analysis reveals that unseen
attacks can be effectively explained as sparse compositions of earlier skills,
with explanatory power increasing monotonically as skill coverage grows. Guided
by this insight, we introduce Adversarial Skill Compositional Training (ASCoT),
which trains on diverse compositions of skill primitives rather than isolated
attack instances. ASCoT substantially improves robustness to unseen attacks,
including multi-turn jailbreaks, while maintaining low over-refusal rates. We
also demonstrate that expanding adversarial skill coverage, not just data
scale, is key to defending against novel attacks.

### [386] [Is Temporal Difference Learning the Gold Standard for Stitching in RL?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21995)
*Michał Bortkiewicz,Władysław Pałucki,Mateusz Ostaszewski,Benjamin Eysenbach*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This study investigates experience stitching capabilities in reinforcement learning using function approximation and challenges conventional beliefs about Monte Carlo and Temporal Difference methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to evaluate the widely-accepted notion that temporal difference methods are superior to Monte Carlo methods in experience stitching within reinforcement learning, especially with modern function approximation techniques.

Method: The authors conducted empirical experiments comparing the experience stitching capabilities of Monte Carlo and Temporal Difference methods, analyzing the impact of neural network sizes on performance.

Result: Monte Carlo methods can perform experience stitching similarly to Temporal Difference methods, with diminishing performance gaps when larger neural network capacities are used. Increasing model size improves stitching capabilities for both methods.

Conclusion: Traditional assumptions regarding Temporal Difference advantages in stitching may be less relevant today; larger neural models in reinforcement learning can achieve generalization without specialized algorithms.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) promises to solve long-horizon tasks even when
training data contains only short fragments of the behaviors. This experience
stitching capability is often viewed as the purview of temporal difference (TD)
methods. However, outside of small tabular settings, trajectories never
intersect, calling into question this conventional wisdom. Moreover, the common
belief is that Monte Carlo (MC) methods should not be able to recombine
experience, yet it remains unclear whether function approximation could result
in a form of implicit stitching. The goal of this paper is to empirically study
whether the conventional wisdom about stitching actually holds in settings
where function approximation is used. We empirically demonstrate that Monte
Carlo (MC) methods can also achieve experience stitching. While TD methods do
achieve slightly stronger capabilities than MC methods (in line with
conventional wisdom), that gap is significantly smaller than the gap between
small and large neural networks (even on quite simple tasks). We find that
increasing critic capacity effectively reduces the generalization gap for both
the MC and TD methods. These results suggest that the traditional TD inductive
bias for stitching may be less necessary in the era of large models for RL and,
in some cases, may offer diminishing returns. Additionally, our results suggest
that stitching, a form of generalization unique to the RL setting, might be
achieved not through specialized algorithms (temporal difference learning) but
rather through the same recipe that has provided generalization in other
machine learning settings (via scale). Project website:

*Inwoo Hwang,Yushu Pan,Elias Bareinboim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces causal interpretability to understand deep learning predictions via counterfactual queries and designs models ensuring such interpretability, discussing trade-offs with accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding deep learning predictions is crucial for high-stakes applications, requiring counterfactual reasoning to comprehend model behavior beyond observed data.

Method: The authors propose a framework to construct causally interpretable models by defining a graphical criterion, analyzing common predictors, and identifying trade-offs between interpretability and predictive accuracy.

Result: The paper demonstrates that neither blackbox nor concept-based predictors are universally causally interpretable, presents a design framework, and experimentally validates theoretical findings.

Conclusion: Causal interpretability formalizes when models can answer counterfactual inquiries, highlighting trade-offs between interpretability and accuracy while enabling deeper insights into model reasoning.

Abstract: Understanding the predictions made by deep learning models remains a central
challenge, especially in high-stakes applications. A promising approach is to
equip models with the ability to answer counterfactual questions --
hypothetical ``what if?'' scenarios that go beyond the observed data and
provide insight into a model reasoning. In this work, we introduce the notion
of causal interpretability, which formalizes when counterfactual queries can be
evaluated from a specific class of models and observational data. We analyze
two common model classes -- blackbox and concept-based predictors -- and show
that neither is causally interpretable in general. To address this gap, we
develop a framework for building models that are causally interpretable by
design. Specifically, we derive a complete graphical criterion that determines
whether a given model architecture supports a given counterfactual query. This
leads to a fundamental tradeoff between causal interpretability and predictive
accuracy, which we characterize by identifying the unique maximal set of
features that yields an interpretable model with maximal predictive
expressiveness. Experiments corroborate the theoretical findings.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new statistical framework to strengthen watermark detection in large language model outputs, addressing issues due to imperfect pseudorandomness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text watermarking methods for large language models falter under practical conditions where pseudorandomness is not perfect, causing challenges in error control and reliability.

Method: The paper utilizes a two-layer hierarchical partition with minimal units to model dependencies in text generation, applying a minimax hypothesis testing problem for watermark detection.

Result: The framework delivers closed-form optimal rules for watermark strategies, enhances detection power while maintaining error control, and explains the benefits of discarding repeated statistics.

Conclusion: This research establishes the first reliable foundation to address watermarking under non-ideal randomness, delivering improved theoretical and practical tools for ensuring traceability in LLM outputs.

Abstract: Text watermarking plays a crucial role in ensuring the traceability and
accountability of large language model (LLM) outputs and mitigating misuse.
While promising, most existing methods assume perfect pseudorandomness. In
practice, repetition in generated text induces collisions that create
structured dependence, compromising Type I error control and invalidating
standard analyses.
  We introduce a statistical framework that captures this structure through a
hierarchical two-layer partition. At its core is the concept of minimal units
-- the smallest groups treatable as independent across units while permitting
dependence within. Using minimal units, we define a non-asymptotic efficiency
measure and cast watermark detection as a minimax hypothesis testing problem.
  Applied to Gumbel-max and inverse-transform watermarks, our framework
produces closed-form optimal rules. It explains why discarding repeated
statistics often improves performance and shows that within-unit dependence
must be addressed unless degenerate. Both theory and experiments confirm
improved detection power with rigorous Type I error control. These results
provide the first principled foundation for watermark detection under imperfect
pseudorandomness, offering both theoretical insight and practical guidance for
reliable tracing of model outputs.

### [389] [Generalization Bounds for Rank-sparse Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21945)
*Antoine Ledent,Rodrigo Alves,Yunwen Lei*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores how low-rank properties of neural networks impact generalization and provides bounds relying on Schatten p quasi norms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate how the bottleneck rank property observed in neural networks impacts generalization, focusing on approximate low-rank structures.

Method: The authors prove generalization bounds using Schatten p quasi norms of weight matrices, linking sample complexity to network architecture and rank.

Result: The derived bounds show sample complexity scales with weight matrix rank, network width, and depth, with small p providing tighter bounds.

Conclusion: Exploiting the low-rank properties of neural networks offers insights into sample complexity and generalization behavior, depending on Schatten p norms.

Abstract: It has been recently observed in much of the literature that neural networks
exhibit a bottleneck rank property: for larger depths, the activation and
weights of neural networks trained with gradient-based methods tend to be of
approximately low rank. In fact, the rank of the activations of each layer
converges to a fixed value referred to as the ``bottleneck rank'', which is the
minimum rank required to represent the training data. This perspective is in
line with the observation that regularizing linear networks (without
activations) with weight decay is equivalent to minimizing the Schatten $p$
quasi norm of the neural network. In this paper we investigate the implications
of this phenomenon for generalization. More specifically, we prove
generalization bounds for neural networks which exploit the approximate low
rank structure of the weight matrices if present. The final results rely on the
Schatten $p$ quasi norms of the weight matrices: for small $p$, the bounds
exhibit a sample complexity $ \widetilde{O}(WrL^2)$ where $W$ and $L$ are the
width and depth of the neural network respectively and where $r$ is the rank of
the weight matrices. As $p$ increases, the bound behaves more like a norm-based
bound instead.

### [390] [Cost-Sensitive Evaluation for Binary Classifiers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22016)
*Pierangelo Lombardo,Antonio Casoli,Cristian Cingolani,Shola Oshodi,Michele Zanatta*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces Weighted Accuracy (WA), a metric for binary classifiers designed to align with minimizing Total Classification Cost (TCC), and provides a framework for handling class imbalance in cost-sensitive scenarios without relying on rebalancing techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of a universally accepted evaluation metric for classifiers and misconceptions about addressing class imbalance prompted the authors to develop a straightforward and cost-sensitive metric for binary classification.

Method: The authors define Weighted Accuracy (WA) as a linear combination of instance-dependent quantities, specify conditions under which imbalance-handling techniques work, and propose a method for estimating the WA weighting parameter when complete cost information is unavailable.

Result: They demonstrate that WA correlates robustly with TCC and provides consistent results for comparing datasets and models in cost-sensitive classification contexts.

Conclusion: Weighted Accuracy serves as a practical metric for cost-sensitive binary classification, addressing dataset imbalance and enabling reliable model evaluation while aligning with TCC minimization.

Abstract: Selecting an appropriate evaluation metric for classifiers is crucial for
model comparison and parameter optimization, yet there is not consensus on a
universally accepted metric that serves as a definitive standard. Moreover,
there is often a misconception about the perceived need to mitigate imbalance
in datasets used to train classification models. Since the final goal in
classifier optimization is typically maximizing the return of investment or,
equivalently, minimizing the Total Classification Cost (TCC), we define
Weighted Accuracy (WA), an evaluation metric for binary classifiers with a
straightforward interpretation as a weighted version of the well-known accuracy
metric, coherent with the need of minimizing TCC. We clarify the conceptual
framework for handling class imbalance in cost-sensitive scenarios, providing
an alternative to rebalancing techniques. This framework can be applied to any
metric that, like WA, can be expressed as a linear combination of
example-dependent quantities and allows for comparing the results obtained in
different datasets and for addressing discrepancies between the development
dataset, used to train and validate the model, and the target dataset, where
the model will be deployed. It also specifies in which scenarios using
UCCs-unaware class rebalancing techniques or rebalancing metrics aligns with
TCC minimization and when it is instead counterproductive. Finally, we propose
a procedure to estimate the WA weight parameter in the absence of fully
specified UCCs and demonstrate the robustness of WA by analyzing its
correlation with TCC in example-dependent scenarios.

*Masoud Ataei,Vikas Dhiman,Mohammad Javad Khojasteh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Kurkova Kolmogorov-Arnold networks (KKANs), improving previous architectures to enhance function approximation and uncertainty quantification, leading to significant computational and scalability benefits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study seeks to improve function approximation methods through the adoption of semi-parametric architectures to overcome inefficiencies and computational limitations in models like Gaussian Processes and KANs.

Method: KKANs are proposed as an improved neural architecture using Chebyshev layers and multi-layer perceptrons, and a novel algorithm called K-DAREK is introduced for enhanced function approximation and uncertainty handling.

Result: K-DAREK demonstrates improved convergence stability, computational efficiency, scalability, and safety in function modeling tasks, showcasing significant advantages compared to existing methods like KANs, GP, and DAREK.

Conclusion: The advancements in KKAN architecture and the K-DAREK algorithm provide a reliable, scalable, and efficient approach to function approximation with practical applications in dynamical system modeling and safe control tasks.

Abstract: Neural networks are parametric and powerful tools for function approximation,
and the choice of architecture heavily influences their interpretability,
efficiency, and generalization. In contrast, Gaussian processes (GPs) are
nonparametric probabilistic models that define distributions over functions
using a kernel to capture correlations among data points. However, these models
become computationally expensive for large-scale problems, as they require
inverting a large covariance matrix. Kolmogorov- Arnold networks (KANs),
semi-parametric neural architectures, have emerged as a prominent approach for
modeling complex functions with structured and efficient representations
through spline layers. Kurkova Kolmogorov-Arnold networks (KKANs) extend this
idea by reducing the number of spline layers in KAN and replacing them with
Chebyshev layers and multi-layer perceptrons, thereby mapping inputs into
higher-dimensional spaces before applying spline-based transformations.
Compared to KANs, KKANs perform more stable convergence during training, making
them a strong architecture for estimating operators and system modeling in
dynamical systems. By enhancing the KKAN architecture, we develop a novel
learning algorithm, distance-aware error for Kurkova-Kolmogorov networks
(K-DAREK), for efficient and interpretable function approximation with
uncertainty quantification. Our approach establishes robust error bounds that
are distance-aware; this means they reflect the proximity of a test point to
its nearest training points. Through case studies on a safe control task, we
demonstrate that K-DAREK is about four times faster and ten times higher
computationally efficiency than Ensemble of KANs, 8.6 times more scalable than
GP by increasing the data size, and 50% safer than our previous work
distance-aware error for Kolmogorov networks (DAREK).

### [392] [Transformer Based Linear Attention with Optimized GPU Kernel Implementation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21956)
*Armin Gerami,Ramani Duraiswami*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces an optimized linear attention mechanism for Transformers, improving speed and memory usage while maintaining performance accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformers are powerful but computationally expensive due to regular attention; improving their runtime is critical.

Method: Authors developed a novel method for linear attention's forward and backward passes, coupled with highly-optimized CUDA implementation.

Result: The method achieves 3.3x faster speed and 3.6x memory reduction compared to existing approaches, validated on a large-scale language model.

Conclusion: The optimized linear attention method matches regular attention performance while significantly improving efficiency.

Abstract: The original softmax-based attention mechanism (regular attention) in the
extremely successful Transformer architecture computes attention between $N$
tokens, each embedded in a $D$-dimensional head, with a time complexity of
$O(N^2D)$. Given the success of Transformers, improving their runtime during
both training and inference is a popular research area. One such approach is
the introduction of the linear attention (LA) mechanisms, which offers a linear
time complexity of $O(ND^2)$ and have demonstrated comparable accuracy to
regular attention. However, LA in practice lags behind its theoretical
efficiency. We propose a novel method for LA's forward and backward passes,
along with a highly-optimized CUDA implementation. Our approach outperforms the
state-of-the-art by 3.3 times in speed and reduces memory consumption by 3.6
times. We validate these improvements in both single-layer and end-to-end
settings by training a 1.4 billion parameter language model, which demonstrates
similar expressivity to regular attention on major reasoning benchmarks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses Offline Safe Reinforcement Learning (OSRL) by introducing a new method that optimizes rewards while adhering to cost constraints, proving approximate optimality, and showing strong empirical results enforcing safety constraints with high rewards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the challenge of learning safe and reward-maximizing policies in reinforcement learning, specifically under cost constraints in offline settings.

Method: They propose a minimax optimization framework, combining offline reinforcement learning with online optimization algorithms, and offer a practical approximation that works with any offline RL algorithm without the need for policy evaluation.

Result: Results show effective enforcement of safety constraints under strict cost budgets on the DSRL benchmark, alongside achieving high rewards.

Conclusion: This novel method reliably balances safety constraints with reward optimization in OSRL, and its practical implementation demonstrates promising empirical performance.

Abstract: We study the problem of Offline Safe Reinforcement Learning (OSRL), where the
goal is to learn a reward-maximizing policy from fixed data under a cumulative
cost constraint. We propose a novel OSRL approach that frames the problem as a
minimax objective and solves it by combining offline RL with online
optimization algorithms. We prove the approximate optimality of this approach
when integrated with an approximate offline RL oracle and no-regret online
optimization. We also present a practical approximation that can be combined
with any offline RL algorithm, eliminating the need for offline policy
evaluation. Empirical results on the DSRL benchmark demonstrate that our method
reliably enforces safety constraints under stringent cost budgets, while
achieving high rewards. The code is available at

### [394] [Parallel Sampling from Masked Diffusion Models via Conditional Independence Testing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21961)
*Iskander Azangulov,Teodora Pandeva,Niranjani Prasad,Javier Zazo,Sushrut Karmalkar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Masked diffusion models (MDMs) facilitate parallel text generation but face challenges balancing token independence and confidence in updates. The new PUNT sampler addresses this with improved parallel unmasking and shows higher accuracy in longer sequences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop faster inference text generation methods than typical autoregressive models while maintaining accuracy, particularly for generating longer textual sequences efficiently.

Method: The study introduces PUNT, a sampler based on conditional independence testing and confidence thresholding to improve parallel token sampling for masked diffusion models.

Result: PUNT achieves up to 16% higher accuracy compared to strong baselines, including sequential generation methods, especially for longer sequences. It also reduces the need for hyperparameter tuning.

Conclusion: PUNT improves accuracy and computational efficiency in text generation, providing a hierarchical approach for better alignment and organization during the generation process.

Abstract: Masked diffusion models (MDMs) offer a compelling alternative to
autoregressive models (ARMs) for discrete text generation because they enable
parallel token sampling, rather than sequential, left-to-right generation. This
means potentially much faster inference. However, effective parallel sampling
faces two competing requirements: (i) simultaneously updated tokens must be
conditionally independent, and (ii) updates should prioritise high-confidence
predictions. These goals conflict because high-confidence predictions often
cluster and depend on each other, opportunities for parallel updates.
  We present PUNT, a model-agnostic sampler that reconciles this trade-off. Our
method identifies token dependencies and removes lower-confidence tokens from
conflicting groups. This produces sets of indices for unmasking that satisfy
both independence and confidence criteria. Our approach ensures improved
parallel unmasking through approximate conditional independence testing.
  Our experiments show that PUNT delivers a superior trade-off between accuracy
and compute when compared to other strong training-free baselines, especially
for generation of longer sequences. On the IFEval benchmark, it achieves up to
16\% higher accuracy over baseline methods, including sequential generation
(one-by-one). These gains hold across different values of hyperparameters,
mitigating the need for brittle hyperparameter tuning. Moreover, we observe
that PUNT induces an emergent hierarchical generation strategy, where the model
first establishes high-level paragraph structure before local refinement,
suggesting a planning-like generation process that contributes to strong
alignment performance.

*Jincheng Zhou,Mengbo Wang,Anqi He,Yumeng Zhou,Hessam Olya,Murat Kocaoglu,Bruno Ribeiro*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel causal discovery method that combines differentiable $d$-separation scores via soft logic and gradient-based optimization, outperforming traditional methods in low-sample scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address limitations in causal discovery methods—constraint-based approaches struggle with small sample sizes, while score-based ones lack explicit conditional independence testing.

Method: They propose a method using differentiable $d$-separation scores derived from percolation theory via soft logic, allowing gradient-based optimization of conditional independence constraints.

Result: The method demonstrates robust performance in low-sample regimes and outperforms traditional constraint- and score-based methods on real-world datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed approach provides an effective alternative for causal discovery, particularly in scenarios with limited data, combining the strengths of both constraint-based and score-based methods.

Abstract: Causal discovery from observational data is a fundamental task in artificial
intelligence, with far-reaching implications for decision-making, predictions,
and interventions. Despite significant advances, existing methods can be
broadly categorized as constraint-based or score-based approaches.
Constraint-based methods offer rigorous causal discovery but are often hindered
by small sample sizes, while score-based methods provide flexible optimization
but typically forgo explicit conditional independence testing. This work
explores a third avenue: developing differentiable $d$-separation scores,
obtained through a percolation theory using soft logic. This enables the
implementation of a new type of causal discovery method: gradient-based
optimization of conditional independence constraints. Empirical evaluations
demonstrate the robust performance of our approach in low-sample regimes,
surpassing traditional constraint-based and score-based baselines on a
real-world dataset. Code and data of the proposed method are publicly available
at https://github$.$com/PurdueMINDS/DAGPA.

### [396] [Linearized Optimal Transport for Analysis of High-Dimensional Point-Cloud and Single-Cell Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22033)
*Tianxiang Wang,Yingtong Ke,Dhananjay Bhaskar,Smita Krishnaswamy,Alexander Cloninger*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Linear Optimal Transport (LOT) framework for embedding high-dimensional patient point clouds into Euclidean space, facilitating interpretable analysis and generative modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Single-cell technologies produce high-dimensional and irregular point clouds for patient data, which are challenging to compare and interpret biologically. Current predictive methods lack interpretability.

Method: The LOT framework embeds irregular point clouds into a fixed-dimensional Euclidean space, preserving distributional structures and transport geometry, while enabling classification and synthesis of cellular profiles.

Result: LOT enables accurate and interpretable classification of patient states (e.g., for COVID-19), generates synthetic patient data, and facilitates drug testing through barycenter-based cellular averaging.

Conclusion: LOT acts as a unified framework connecting predictive accuracy, biological interpretability, and generative modeling, enhancing understanding of immune variation and treatment effects.

Abstract: Single-cell technologies generate high-dimensional point clouds of cells,
enabling detailed characterization of complex patient states and treatment
responses. Yet each patient is represented by an irregular point cloud rather
than a simple vector, making it difficult to directly quantify and compare
biological differences between individuals. Nonlinear methods such as kernels
and neural networks achieve predictive accuracy but act as black boxes,
offering little biological interpretability.
  To address these limitations, we adapt the Linear Optimal Transport (LOT)
framework to this setting, embedding irregular point clouds into a
fixed-dimensional Euclidean space while preserving distributional structure.
This embedding provides a principled linear representation that preserves
optimal transport geometry while enabling downstream analysis. It also forms a
registration between any two patients, enabling direct comparison of their
cellular distributions. Within this space, LOT enables: (i) \textbf{accurate
and interpretable classification} of COVID-19 patient states, where classifier
weights map back to specific markers and spatial regions driving predictions;
and (ii) \textbf{synthetic data generation} for patient-derived organoids,
exploiting the linearity of the LOT embedding. LOT barycenters yield averaged
cellular profiles representing combined conditions or samples, supporting drug
interaction testing.
  Together, these results establish LOT as a unified framework that bridges
predictive performance, interpretability, and generative modeling. By
transforming heterogeneous point clouds into structured embeddings directly
traceable to the original data, LOT opens new opportunities for understanding
immune variation and treatment effects in high-dimensional biological systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses the issue of capability regression in models trained using reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) and proposes a dynamic objective reweighting strategy named RECAP to preserve general knowledge and improve reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle the observed issue where RLVR often leads to capability regression in models, degrading their foundational skills, such as perception and faithfulness, after prolonged training.

Method: The authors introduce RECAP, a replay strategy with dynamic objective reweighting. This method adapts training focus in real-time, prioritizing objectives based on short-term signals of convergence and instability without requiring additional models or heavy tuning.

Result: Experiments on Qwen2.5-VL-3B and Qwen2.5-VL-7B benchmarks show that RECAP successfully preserves general capabilities and even improves reasoning performance; enabling better trade-offs for in-task rewards.

Conclusion: RECAP is an effective end-to-end solution for mitigating capability regression in RLVR pipelines, maintaining knowledge breadth while enhancing task-specific reasoning abilities.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has delivered
impressive gains in mathematical and multimodal reasoning and has become a
standard post-training paradigm for contemporary language and vision-language
models. However, the RLVR recipe introduces a significant risk of capability
regression, where models forget foundational skills after prolonged training
without employing regularization strategies. We empirically confirm this
concern, observing that open-source reasoning models suffer performance
degradation on core capabilities such as perception and faithfulness. While
imposing regularization terms like KL divergence can help prevent deviation
from the base model, these terms are calculated on the current task, thus they
do not guarantee broader knowledge. Meanwhile, commonly used experience replay
across heterogeneous domains makes it nontrivial to decide how much training
focus each objective should receive. To address this, we propose RECAP-a replay
strategy with dynamic objective reweighting for general knowledge preservation.
Our reweighting mechanism adapts in an online manner using short-horizon
signals of convergence and instability, shifting the post-training focus away
from saturated objectives and toward underperforming or volatile ones. Our
method is end-to-end and readily applicable to existing RLVR pipelines without
training additional models or heavy tuning. Extensive experiments on benchmarks
based on Qwen2.5-VL-3B and Qwen2.5-VL-7B demonstrate the effectiveness of our
method, which not only preserves general capabilities but also improves
reasoning by enabling more flexible trade-offs among in-task rewards.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of the Mallows model in representing real-world user preferences where users only focus on top-k items while being indifferent to others, and to provide tools for better modeling of buyer choices.

Method: The paper introduces (1) a new sampling method for generalized top-k Mallows models, (2) an efficient algorithm to compute choice probabilities, and (3) an active learning-based parameter estimation algorithm using observed data.

Result: The proposed methods are rigorously analyzed mathematically and demonstrated to be scalable and accurate through experiments on both synthetic and real-world data. Comparisons show superior predictive power of the Mallows model for top-k lists against the Multinomial Logit model.

Conclusion: The proposed contributions advance the Mallows model's applicability for real-world top-k preference analysis and improve both its scalability and predictive accuracy, positioning it as a robust alternative to simpler models like the Multinomial Logit.

Abstract: The classic Mallows model is a foundational tool for modeling user
preferences. However, it has limitations in capturing real-world scenarios,
where users often focus only on a limited set of preferred items and are
indifferent to the rest. To address this, extensions such as the top-k Mallows
model have been proposed, aligning better with practical applications. In this
paper, we address several challenges related to the generalized top-k Mallows
model, with a focus on analyzing buyer choices. Our key contributions are: (1)
a novel sampling scheme tailored to generalized top-k Mallows models, (2) an
efficient algorithm for computing choice probabilities under this model, and
(3) an active learning algorithm for estimating the model parameters from
observed choice data. These contributions provide new tools for analysis and
prediction in critical decision-making scenarios. We present a rigorous
mathematical analysis for the performance of our algorithms. Furthermore,
through extensive experiments on synthetic data and real-world data, we
demonstrate the scalability and accuracy of our proposed methods, and we
compare the predictive power of Mallows model for top-k lists compared to the
simpler Multinomial Logit model.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Overdamped Langevin with LAnding (OLLA) as an efficient method for sampling from constrained statistical distributions, overcoming limitations of existing methods dealing with equality and inequality constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sampling constrained distributions is essential in fields like Bayesian statistics and computational chemistry, but current methods are inefficient and lack general applicability to nonconvex constraints involving equality and inequality simultaneously.

Method: The paper proposes OLLA, which designs overdamped Langevin dynamics to handle both equality and inequality constraints without costly projection steps, ensuring exponential convergence to constrained distributions under regularity conditions.

Result: OLLA converges exponentially fast to constrained target distributions, achieving computational efficiency and reasonable empirical mixing compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: OLLA provides a robust, computationally efficient framework for sampling constrained distributions, overcoming challenges in handling mixed constraint types and achieving favorable performance over traditional methods.

Abstract: Sampling from constrained statistical distributions is a fundamental task in
various fields including Bayesian statistics, computational chemistry, and
statistical physics. This article considers the cases where the constrained
distribution is described by an unconstrained density, as well as additional
equality and/or inequality constraints, which often make the constraint set
nonconvex. Existing methods for nonconvex constraint set $\Sigma \subset
\mathbb{R}^d$ defined by equality or inequality constraints commonly rely on
costly projection steps. Moreover, they cannot handle equality and inequality
constraints simultaneously as each method only specialized in one case. In
addition, rigorous and quantitative convergence guarantee is often lacking. In
this paper, we introduce Overdamped Langevin with LAnding (OLLA), a new
framework that can design overdamped Langevin dynamics accommodating both
equality and inequality constraints. The proposed dynamics also
deterministically corrects trajectories along the normal direction of the
constraint surface, thus obviating the need for explicit projections. We show
that, under suitable regularity conditions on the target density and $\Sigma$,
OLLA converges exponentially fast in $W_2$ distance to the constrained target
density $\rho_\Sigma(x) \propto \exp(-f(x))d\sigma_\Sigma$. Lastly, through
experiments, we demonstrate the efficiency of OLLA compared to projection-based
constrained Langevin algorithms and their slack variable variants, highlighting
its favorable computational cost and reasonable empirical mixing.

TL;DR: This paper introduces Deep Gaussian Processes for Functional Maps (DGPFM), a method for function-on-function regression that excels in handling complex nonlinearities and provides reliable uncertainty quantification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for function-on-function regression struggle with capturing nonlinearity and providing robust uncertainty quantification, especially with noisy, sparse, or irregularly sampled data.

Method: The proposed DGPFM framework uses GP-based linear and nonlinear transformations, integral transforms of kernels, GP interpolation, nonlinear activations sampled from GPs, and a variational learning algorithm with inducing points and whitening transformations for scalable probabilistic inference.

Result: DGPFM demonstrates superior predictive performance and uncertainty calibration on real-world and PDE benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: DGPFM effectively addresses the challenges in function-on-function regression, making it a robust and scalable tool for applications requiring accurate prediction and uncertainty quantification.

Abstract: Learning mappings between functional spaces, also known as
function-on-function regression, plays a crucial role in functional data
analysis and has broad applications, e.g. spatiotemporal forecasting, curve
prediction, and climate modeling. Existing approaches, such as functional
linear models and neural operators, either fall short of capturing complex
nonlinearities or lack reliable uncertainty quantification under noisy, sparse,
and irregularly sampled data. To address these issues, we propose Deep Gaussian
Processes for Functional Maps (DGPFM). Our method designs a sequence of
GP-based linear and nonlinear transformations, leveraging integral transforms
of kernels, GP interpolation, and nonlinear activations sampled from GPs. A key
insight simplifies implementation: under fixed locations, discrete
approximations of kernel integral transforms collapse into direct functional
integral transforms, enabling flexible incorporation of various integral
transform designs. To achieve scalable probabilistic inference, we use inducing
points and whitening transformations to develop a variational learning
algorithm. Empirical results on real-world and PDE benchmark datasets
demonstrate that the advantage of DGPFM in both predictive performance and
uncertainty calibration.

*Himadri S. Pandey,Kai Wang,Gian-Gabriel P. Garcia*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Neural Index Policy (NIP) for tackling multi-action restless multi-armed bandits (RMABs) under heterogeneous budget constraints while enabling scalable and optimally performing decision-making.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RMAB frameworks fail to address real-world scenarios involving multiple interventions with varying costs and constraints, such as in healthcare.

Method: Proposed Neural Index Policy (NIP) uses neural networks to assign budget-aware indices to arm-action pairs and solves an allocation problem using a differentiable knapsack layer modeled as an entropy-regularized optimal transport problem.

Result: NIP achieves near-optimal performance (within 5% of the theoretical best) while strictly adhering to heterogeneous budget constraints and scales effectively to large numbers of arms.

Conclusion: The approach provides a general, scalable, and theoretically grounded framework for learning policies in complex, resource-constrained decision problems.

Abstract: Restless multi-armed bandits (RMABs) provide a scalable framework for
sequential decision-making under uncertainty, but classical formulations assume
binary actions and a single global budget. Real-world settings, such as
healthcare, often involve multiple interventions with heterogeneous costs and
constraints, where such assumptions break down. We introduce a Neural Index
Policy (NIP) for multi-action RMABs with heterogeneous budget constraints. Our
approach learns to assign budget-aware indices to arm--action pairs using a
neural network, and converts them into feasible allocations via a
differentiable knapsack layer formulated as an entropy-regularized optimal
transport (OT) problem. The resulting model unifies index prediction and
constrained optimization in a single end-to-end differentiable framework,
enabling gradient-based training directly on decision quality. The network is
optimized to align its induced occupancy measure with the theoretical upper
bound from a linear programming relaxation, bridging asymptotic RMAB theory
with practical learning. Empirically, NIP achieves near-optimal performance
within 5% of the oracle occupancy-measure policy while strictly enforcing
heterogeneous budgets and scaling to hundreds of arms. This work establishes a
general, theoretically grounded, and scalable framework for learning

*Luca Caldera,Giacomo Bottacini,Lara Cavinato*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MAGIC-Flow is a conditional multiscale normalizing flow architecture designed for simultaneous generation and classification, specifically in medical imaging and similar challenging fields.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generative models often lack direct applicability in medical imaging due to their inability to align with specific clinical tasks, limiting their effectiveness.

Method: MAGIC-Flow employs a hierarchy of invertible and differentiable bijections which allow exact likelihood computation, stable optimization, and interpretable sample likelihood visualization. The model incorporates class label conditioning facilitating both generative synthesis and principled classification.

Result: Evaluation across datasets shows MAGIC-Flow generates realistic, diverse samples and improves classification performance, effectively handling data-limited scenarios and scanner noise.

Conclusion: MAGIC-Flow serves as a robust approach for challenging domains like medical imaging, offering benefits such as privacy-preserving augmentation, robust generalization, and enhanced trust in AI-driven applications.

Abstract: Generative modeling has emerged as a powerful paradigm for representation
learning, but its direct applicability to challenging fields like medical
imaging remains limited: mere generation, without task alignment, fails to
provide a robust foundation for clinical use. We propose MAGIC-Flow, a
conditional multiscale normalizing flow architecture that performs generation
and classification within a single modular framework. The model is built as a
hierarchy of invertible and differentiable bijections, where the Jacobian
determinant factorizes across sub-transformations. We show how this ensures
exact likelihood computation and stable optimization, while invertibility
enables explicit visualization of sample likelihoods, providing an
interpretable lens into the model's reasoning. By conditioning on class labels,
MAGIC-Flow supports controllable sample synthesis and principled
class-probability estimation, effectively aiding both generative and
discriminative objectives. We evaluate MAGIC-Flow against top baselines using
metrics for similarity, fidelity, and diversity. Across multiple datasets, it
addresses generation and classification under scanner noise, and
modality-specific synthesis and identification. Results show MAGIC-Flow creates
realistic, diverse samples and improves classification. MAGIC-Flow is an
effective strategy for generation and classification in data-limited domains,
with direct benefits for privacy-preserving augmentation, robust
generalization, and trustworthy medical AI.

*Xixian Liu,Rui Jiao,Zhiyuan Liu,Yurou Liu,Yang Liu,Ziheng Lu,Wenbing Huang,Yang Zhang,Yixin Cao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents AniDS, a novel anisotropic variational autoencoder for 3D molecular denoising, addressing oversimplifications in existing methods and delivering improved force prediction accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations in existing molecular denoising methods that assume isotropic and homoscedastic atomic motions, which are unable to accurately model complex molecular dynamics.

Method: Introduces AniDS framework with an anisotropic noise generator producing atom-specific, full covariance matrices for Gaussian noise distributions, considering pairwise atomic interactions as corrections to an isotropic base.

Result: AniDS achieves superior results with 8.9% and 6.2% improvements in force prediction accuracy on MD17 and OC22 benchmarks, respectively, and effectively suppresses noise directionally in molecular systems.

Conclusion: AniDS improves 3D molecular denoising performance and provides more accurate modeling of atomic dynamics, consistent with physicochemical principles.

Abstract: Coordinate denoising has emerged as a promising method for 3D molecular
pretraining due to its theoretical connection to learning molecular force
field. However, existing denoising methods rely on oversimplied molecular
dynamics that assume atomic motions to be isotropic and homoscedastic. To
address these limitations, we propose a novel denoising framework AniDS:
Anisotropic Variational Autoencoder for 3D Molecular Denoising. AniDS
introduces a structure-aware anisotropic noise generator that can produce
atom-specific, full covariance matrices for Gaussian noise distributions to
better reflect directional and structural variability in molecular systems.
These covariances are derived from pairwise atomic interactions as anisotropic
corrections to an isotropic base. Our design ensures that the resulting
covariance matrices are symmetric, positive semi-definite, and
SO(3)-equivariant, while providing greater capacity to model complex molecular
dynamics. Extensive experiments show that AniDS outperforms prior isotropic and
homoscedastic denoising models and other leading methods on the MD17 and OC22
benchmarks, achieving average relative improvements of 8.9% and 6.2% in force
prediction accuracy. Our case study on a crystal and molecule structure shows
that AniDS adaptively suppresses noise along the bonding direction, consistent
with physicochemical principles. Our code is available at

TL;DR: DPEB integrates multiple protein embedding types and is used for computational prediction tasks like protein-protein interactions, with strong benchmark results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to address the lack of integrated multimodal protein representations for predicting protein-protein interactions (PPIs).

Method: DPEB integrates 22,043 human proteins with embeddings from AlphaFold2 structures, transformer-based sequence models, contextual amino acid patterns (ESM-2), and sequence n-gram statistics, used in graph neural network methods.

Result: GraphSAGE with BioEmbedding achieved the best PPI prediction performance (87.37% AUROC, 79.16% accuracy); additionally, enzyme classification (77.42%) and protein family classification (86.04%) show strong results.

Conclusion: DPEB provides curated embeddings and supports graph neural network-based prediction frameworks for systems biology, drug discovery, and disease analysis applications.

Abstract: Computationally predicting protein-protein interactions (PPIs) is challenging
due to the lack of integrated, multimodal protein representations. DPEB is a
curated collection of 22,043 human proteins that integrates four embedding
types: structural (AlphaFold2), transformer-based sequence (BioEmbeddings),
contextual amino acid patterns (ESM-2: Evolutionary Scale Modeling), and
sequence-based n-gram statistics (ProtVec]). AlphaFold2 protein structures are
available through public databases (e.g., AlphaFold2 Protein Structure
Database), but the internal neural network embeddings are not. DPEB addresses
this gap by providing AlphaFold2-derived embeddings for computational modeling.
Our benchmark evaluations show GraphSAGE with BioEmbedding achieved the highest
PPI prediction performance (87.37% AUROC, 79.16% accuracy). The framework also
achieved 77.42% accuracy for enzyme classification and 86.04% accuracy for
protein family classification. DPEB supports multiple graph neural network
methods for PPI prediction, enabling applications in systems biology, drug
target identification, pathway analysis, and disease mechanism studies.

### [406] [Monitoring State Transitions in Markovian Systems with Sampling Cost](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22327)
*Kumar Saurav,Ness B. Shroff,Yingbin Liang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses efficient state monitoring using a blend of prediction methods and optimal querying, with considerations for costs and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce query costs while maintaining accurate monitoring of time-varying states, leveraging forecasting methods and optimal trade-offs.

Method: Analyzed greedy and optimal strategies in Markovian settings, introducing a PSGD-based learning variant for unknown probabilities.

Result: Greedy policy often suboptimal but effective under certain conditions; PSGD-based variant improves computational efficiency and trade-offs for unknown scenarios.

Conclusion: Optimal monitoring relies on tailored strategies balancing prediction and querying costs, with promising results for computational efficiency in complex cases.

Abstract: We consider a node-monitor pair, where the node's state varies with time. The
monitor needs to track the node's state at all times; however, there is a fixed
cost for each state query. So the monitor may instead predict the state using
time-series forecasting methods, including time-series foundation models
(TSFMs), and query only when prediction uncertainty is high. Since query
decisions influence prediction accuracy, determining when to query is
nontrivial. A natural approach is a greedy policy that predicts when the
expected prediction loss is below the query cost and queries otherwise. We
analyze this policy in a Markovian setting, where the optimal (OPT) strategy is
a state-dependent threshold policy minimizing the time-averaged sum of query
cost and prediction losses. We show that, in general, the greedy policy is
suboptimal and can have an unbounded competitive ratio, but under common
conditions such as identically distributed transition probabilities, it
performs close to OPT. For the case of unknown transition probabilities, we
further propose a projected stochastic gradient descent (PSGD)-based learning
variant of the greedy policy, which achieves a favorable predict-query tradeoff
with improved computational efficiency compared to OPT.

*Naina Balepur,Xingrui Pei,Hari Sundaram*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper explores incorporating institutional trust into Reinforcement Learning for resource allocation, finding that trust-aware approaches improve fairness and community trust but may reduce organizational success.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in current AI policy designs that often overlook the impact of institutional trust on their success and citizen compliance.

Method: A trust-aware RL algorithm based on Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient was developed to simulate resource allocation and model changes in institutional trust, alongside investigating its effects on organizational and community outcomes.

Result: Incorporating trust into RL algorithms improves fairness and community trust, although it can negatively impact organizational success. Conservative trust estimates increase fairness and trust but reduce utility for organizations.

Conclusion: Institutional trust plays a pivotal role in algorithm design, revealing a trade-off between achieving organizational goals and fostering community well-being, with mechanisms such as quota systems showing potential to enhance fairness.

Abstract: Many governmental bodies are adopting AI policies for decision-making. In
particular, Reinforcement Learning has been used to design policies that
citizens would be expected to follow if implemented. Much RL work assumes that
citizens follow these policies, and evaluate them with this in mind. However,
we know from prior work that without institutional trust, citizens will not
follow policies put in place by governments. In this work, we develop a
trust-aware RL algorithm for resource allocation in communities. We consider
the case of humanitarian engineering, where the organization is aiming to
distribute some technology or resource to community members. We use a Deep
Deterministic Policy Gradient approach to learn a resource allocation that fits
the needs of the organization. Then, we simulate resource allocation according
to the learned policy, and model the changes in institutional trust of
community members. We investigate how this incorporation of institutional trust
affects outcomes, and ask how effectively an organization can learn policies if
trust values are private. We find that incorporating trust into RL algorithms
can lead to more successful policies, specifically when the organization's
goals are less certain. We find more conservative trust estimates lead to
increased fairness and average community trust, though organization success
suffers. Finally, we explore a strategy to prevent unfair outcomes to
communities. We implement a quota system by an external entity which decreases
the organization's utility when it does not serve enough community members. We
find this intervention can improve fairness and trust among communities in some
cases, while decreasing the success of the organization. This work underscores
the importance of institutional trust in algorithm design and implementation,
and identifies a tension between organization success and community well-being.

### [408] [Transformer Key-Value Memories Are Nearly as Interpretable as Sparse Autoencoders](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22332)
*Mengyu Ye,Jun Suzuki,Tatsuro Inaba,Tatsuki Kuribayashi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study evaluates the interpretability of feed-forward (FF) layer feature vectors compared to features learned by sparse auto-encoders (SAEs). FF features often perform comparably or even better, questioning SAE advantages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand whether sparse auto-encoders (SAEs) offer superior feature interpretability compared to feed-forward (FF) layers in large language models, aligning with modern interpretability benchmarks.

Method: The authors systematically compared the interpretability of features stored in FF layers against those learned by SAEs, using extensive benchmark evaluations.

Result: SAEs showed minimal improvement in some interpretability aspects, while FFs occasionally outperformed SAEs. Features between SAEs and FFs diverged in quality and faithfulness.

Conclusion: SAEs provide limited advantages over vanilla FF layers in terms of feature quality and interpretability, positioning FF parameters as a strong baseline in interpretability research.

Abstract: Recent interpretability work on large language models (LLMs) has been
increasingly dominated by a feature-discovery approach with the help of proxy
modules. Then, the quality of features learned by, e.g., sparse auto-encoders
(SAEs), is evaluated. This paradigm naturally raises a critical question: do
such learned features have better properties than those already represented
within the original model parameters, and unfortunately, only a few studies
have made such comparisons systematically so far. In this work, we revisit the
interpretability of feature vectors stored in feed-forward (FF) layers, given
the perspective of FF as key-value memories, with modern interpretability
benchmarks. Our extensive evaluation revealed that SAE and FFs exhibits a
similar range of interpretability, although SAEs displayed an observable but
minimal improvement in some aspects. Furthermore, in certain aspects,
surprisingly, even vanilla FFs yielded better interpretability than the SAEs,
and features discovered in SAEs and FFs diverged. These bring questions about
the advantage of SAEs from both perspectives of feature quality and
faithfulness, compared to directly interpreting FF feature vectors, and FF
key-value parameters serve as a strong baseline in modern interpretability
research.

### [409] [Uncertainty quantification in model discovery by distilling interpretable material constitutive models from Gaussian process posteriors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22345)
*David Anton,Henning Wessels,Ulrich Römer,Alexander Henkes,Jorge-Humberto Urrea-Quintero*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Bayesian framework for uncertainty quantification in constitutive model discovery, enabling better handling of noise-affected mechanical test data for identifying model structures and parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for uncertainty quantification in constitutive model discovery have limitations, including reliance on prior selection, restriction to linear coefficients, or limited parameter flexibility. The authors aim to overcome these shortcomings.

Method: The proposed framework involves a four-step process: augmenting stress-deformation data with Gaussian processes, approximating parameter distribution using normalizing flows, matching parameter-induced function distribution with Gaussian process posterior, and performing Sobol' sensitivity analysis for model sparsity and interpretability.

Result: The framework successfully handles isotropic and anisotropic experimental data, as well as linear and non-linear model libraries, demonstrating its flexibility and effectiveness.

Conclusion: This approach provides a robust, prior-free tool for uncertainty quantification and model discovery in mechanical stress-deformation experiments, improving interpretability and usability across different data scenarios.

Abstract: Constitutive model discovery refers to the task of identifying an appropriate
model structure, usually from a predefined model library, while simultaneously
inferring its material parameters. The data used for model discovery are
measured in mechanical tests and are thus inevitably affected by noise which,
in turn, induces uncertainties. Previously proposed methods for uncertainty
quantification in model discovery either require the selection of a prior for
the material parameters, are restricted to the linear coefficients of the model
library or are limited in the flexibility of the inferred parameter probability
distribution. We therefore propose a four-step partially Bayesian framework for
uncertainty quantification in model discovery that does not require prior
selection for the material parameters and also allows for the discovery of
non-linear constitutive models: First, we augment the available
stress-deformation data with a Gaussian process. Second, we approximate the
parameter distribution by a normalizing flow, which allows for capturing
complex joint distributions. Third, we distill the parameter distribution by
matching the distribution of stress-deformation functions induced by the
parameters with the Gaussian process posterior. Fourth, we perform a Sobol'
sensitivity analysis to obtain a sparse and interpretable model. We demonstrate
the capability of our framework for both isotropic and anisotropic experimental
data as well as linear and non-linear model libraries.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the effect of various normalization schemes on token representation clustering and collapse in deep transformers.

Method: The paper models token evolution as interacting particles on a sphere and uses this framework to compare normalization schemes, including innovative ones like Peri-LN.

Result: Normalization schemes regulate token representation dynamics, shaping clustering and preventing collapse, with Peri-LN identified as particularly effective.

Conclusion: A unified, principled framework is provided for analyzing normalization schemes, highlighting Peri-LN's effectiveness in optimizing token representations in transformers.

Abstract: We study the effect of normalization schemes on token representations in deep
transformers. Modeling their evolution as interacting particles on the sphere,
we show that normalization acts as a form of speed regulation. This perspective
enables a unified analysis of several schemes -- including Post-LN, Pre-LN,
Mix-LN, Peri-LN, nGPT, and LN-Scaling -- revealing how they influence
clustering dynamics and representation collapse. Our framework clarifies how
different schemes shape token representations across layers and provides a
principled basis for comparing them, identifying Peri-LN as a particularly
effective choice.

TL;DR: FairGround introduces a framework and Python package comprising 44 tabular datasets with fairness metadata to support reproducible research in fair ML classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fair ML research heavily depends on datasets, but current datasets are often arbitrarily chosen, inconsistently processed, and lack diversity, limiting research reproducibility and generalizability.

Method: FairGround provides a unified framework and Python package. It standardizes dataset loading, preprocessing, transformation, and splitting while annotating datasets with fairness-relevant metadata.

Result: It offers 44 fairness-annotated tabular datasets and streamlines workflows through a standardized Python package.

Conclusion: FairGround enhances reproducible and fair ML research by introducing diverse datasets, robust tools, and open access resources to the community.

Abstract: As machine learning (ML) systems are increasingly adopted in high-stakes
decision-making domains, ensuring fairness in their outputs has become a
central challenge. At the core of fair ML research are the datasets used to
investigate bias and develop mitigation strategies. Yet, much of the existing
work relies on a narrow selection of datasets--often arbitrarily chosen,
inconsistently processed, and lacking in diversity--undermining the
generalizability and reproducibility of results.
  To address these limitations, we present FairGround: a unified framework,
data corpus, and Python package aimed at advancing reproducible research and
critical data studies in fair ML classification. FairGround currently comprises
44 tabular datasets, each annotated with rich fairness-relevant metadata. Our
accompanying Python package standardizes dataset loading, preprocessing,
transformation, and splitting, streamlining experimental workflows. By
providing a diverse and well-documented dataset corpus along with robust
tooling, FairGround enables the development of fairer, more reliable, and more
reproducible ML models. All resources are publicly available to support open

TL;DR: The paper analyzes low-precision streaming PCA, establishing bounds on quantization resolution and demonstrating that quantized versions perform comparably to standard algorithms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the need for estimating principal components in a streaming environment under restricted precision, essential for scalable and resource-efficient machine learning.

Method: The authors investigate Oja's algorithm using unbiased stochastic quantizations in linear and nonlinear settings, proving theoretical guarantees under certain assumptions and validating them through synthetic empirical tests.

Result: The batched algorithm achieves near dimension-free quantization error while empirical evaluations show performance closely tracking standard methods.

Conclusion: Low-precision streaming PCA is effective and feasible under stochastic quantization, maintaining high accuracy with reduced computational requirements.

Abstract: Low-precision streaming PCA estimates the top principal component in a
streaming setting under limited precision. We establish an
information-theoretic lower bound on the quantization resolution required to
achieve a target accuracy for the leading eigenvector. We study Oja's algorithm
for streaming PCA under linear and nonlinear stochastic quantization. The
quantized variants use unbiased stochastic quantization of the weight vector
and the updates. Under mild moment and spectral-gap assumptions on the data
distribution, we show that a batched version achieves the lower bound up to
logarithmic factors under both schemes. This leads to a nearly dimension-free
quantization error in the nonlinear quantization setting. Empirical evaluations
on synthetic streams validate our theoretical findings and demonstrate that our
low-precision methods closely track the performance of standard Oja's
algorithm.

TL;DR: The paper presents PFΔ, a benchmark dataset for power flow simulation, with solutions spanning diverse scenarios and system sizes, addressing computational bottlenecks and variability in real-world grid operations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address computational challenges in power flow calculations and improve performance under diverse operating conditions, escalating with the integration of renewables and climate uncertainties.

Method: Developed PFΔ, a large benchmark dataset comprising 859,800 solved power flow scenarios, evaluating traditional solvers and GNN-based methods under various contingencies and complexities.

Result: The study evaluates the performance of existing solvers on PFΔ, highlights their limitations, and identifies bottlenecks and open research areas.

Conclusion: PFΔ enhances understanding of solvers' limitations in complex scenarios and serves as a valuable resource for advancing power flow analysis methodologies. Its tools are publicly accessible for research.

Abstract: Power flow (PF) calculations are the backbone of real-time grid operations,
across workflows such as contingency analysis (where repeated PF evaluations
assess grid security under outages) and topology optimization (which involves
PF-based searches over combinatorially large action spaces). Running these
calculations at operational timescales or across large evaluation spaces
remains a major computational bottleneck. Additionally, growing uncertainty in
power system operations from the integration of renewables and climate-induced
extreme weather also calls for tools that can accurately and efficiently
simulate a wide range of scenarios and operating conditions. Machine learning
methods offer a potential speedup over traditional solvers, but their
performance has not been systematically assessed on benchmarks that capture
real-world variability. This paper introduces PF$\Delta$, a benchmark dataset
for power flow that captures diverse variations in load, generation, and
topology. PF$\Delta$ contains 859,800 solved power flow instances spanning six
different bus system sizes, capturing three types of contingency scenarios (N ,
N -1, and N -2), and including close-to-infeasible cases near steady-state
voltage stability limits. We evaluate traditional solvers and GNN-based
methods, highlighting key areas where existing approaches struggle, and
identifying open problems for future research. Our dataset is available at

TL;DR: This paper addresses online learning student engagement assessment through an automated system that avoids sensitive feature bias and enhances interpretability with novel techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Monitoring and enhancing student engagement in online learning is critical due to its growing importance and challenges assessing involvement in virtual settings.

Method: The study proposed a novel training method utilizing attribute-orthogonal regularization in a split-model classifier, employing multiple transfer learning strategies to mitigate gender bias.

Result: The method significantly reduced the prediction disparity for sensitive groups, achieving a near-perfect Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.999 in the mitigated model.

Conclusion: This approach not only enforces ethical standards but also enhances interpretability while effectively detecting student engagement levels in virtual environments.

Abstract: With the rise of online and virtual learning, monitoring and enhancing
student engagement have become an important aspect of effective education.
Traditional methods of assessing a student's involvement might not be
applicable directly to virtual environments. In this study, we focused on this
problem and addressed the need to develop an automated system to detect student
engagement levels during online learning. We proposed a novel training method
which can discourage a model from leveraging sensitive features like gender for
its predictions. The proposed method offers benefits not only in the
enforcement of ethical standards, but also to enhance interpretability of the
model predictions. We applied an attribute-orthogonal regularization technique
to a split-model classifier, which uses multiple transfer learning strategies
to achieve effective results in reducing disparity in the distribution of
prediction for sensitivity groups from a Pearson correlation coefficient of
0.897 for the unmitigated model, to 0.999 for the mitigated model. The source

*Patrick Pynadath,Jiaxin Shi,Ruqi Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces CANDI, a hybrid framework combining discrete and continuous diffusion, to mitigate issues in applying continuous diffusion to discrete data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the underperformance of continuous diffusion methods when applied to discrete spaces, compared to discrete-only approaches.

Method: The authors propose token identifiability as an analytical framework to understand corruption mechanisms in discrete data. They introduce CANDI, which combines discrete and continuous corruption techniques for better conditional structure and geometry learning.

Result: CANDI successfully avoids temporal dissonance, enabling effective application of continuous diffusion methods in discrete data domains. The approach shows improved results in controlled generation and text creation tasks.

Conclusion: The study concludes that blending discrete and continuous diffusion methods can overcome challenges in discrete data domains, unlocking the benefits of continuous score functions for improved outcomes.

Abstract: While continuous diffusion has shown remarkable success in continuous domains
such as image generation, its direct application to discrete data has
underperformed compared to purely discrete formulations. This gap is
counterintuitive, given that continuous diffusion learns score functions that
enable joint evolution across multiple positions. To understand this gap, we
introduce token identifiability as an analytical framework for understanding
how Gaussian noise corrupts discrete data through two mechanisms: discrete
identity corruption and continuous rank degradation. We reveal that these
mechanisms scale differently with vocabulary size, creating a temporal
dissonance: at noise levels where discrete corruption preserves enough
structure for conditional learning, continuous denoising is trivial; at noise
levels where continuous denoising is meaningful, discrete corruption destroys
nearly all conditional structure. To solve this, we propose CANDI (Continuous
ANd DIscrete diffusion), a hybrid framework that decouples discrete and
continuous corruption, enabling simultaneous learning of both conditional
structure and continuous geometry. We empirically validate the temporal
dissonance phenomenon and demonstrate that CANDI successfully avoids it. This
unlocks the benefits of continuous diffusion for discrete spaces: on controlled
generation, CANDI enables classifier-based guidance with off-the-shelf
classifiers through simple gradient addition; on text generation, CANDI
outperforms masked diffusion at low NFE, demonstrating the value of learning
continuous gradients for discrete spaces.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper evaluates pruning and quantization methods to reduce the computational resource cost of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reducing the computational and resource costs of GNNs while aiming to retain their high accuracy in learning from graph-structured data.

Method: Three pruning and three quantization methods were empirically tested on GNN tasks like graph classification, node classification, and link prediction across datasets such as Cora, Proteins, and BBBP.

Result: Unstructured fine-grained and global pruning reduced model size by 50% and maintained/improved precision. Quantization methods had varied impacts on accuracy, inference time, and model size depending on the dataset.

Conclusion: Pruning can effectively reduce GNN size while preserving or enhancing accuracy, and quantization methods have varying implications for different datasets.

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) are known to operate with high accuracy on
learning from graph-structured data, but they suffer from high computational
and resource costs. Neural network compression methods are used to reduce the
model size while maintaining reasonable accuracy. Two of the common neural
network compression techniques include pruning and quantization. In this
research, we empirically examine the effects of three pruning methods and three
quantization methods on different GNN models, including graph classification
tasks, node classification tasks, and link prediction. We conducted all
experiments on three graph datasets, including Cora, Proteins, and BBBP. Our
findings demonstrate that unstructured fine-grained and global pruning can
significantly reduce the model's size(50\%) while maintaining or even improving
precision after fine-tuning the pruned model. The evaluation of different
quantization methods on GNN shows diverse impacts on accuracy, inference time,
and model size across different datasets.

*Wei Chen,Linjun Peng,Zhiyi Huang,Haoyue Dai,Zhifeng Hao,Ruichu Cai,Kun Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to infer causal structures in the presence of latent variables using specific higher-order cumulant matrices, demonstrating effectiveness despite latent confounders.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in recovering causal structures in scenarios with multiple latent variables, which other methods fail to handle without strict assumptions.

Method: Analysis of linear, non-Gaussian cases using joint higher-order cumulant matrices. Identifiability is achieved without iterative procedures, leveraging rank deficiency properties.

Result: The proposed method identifies causal asymmetry and shows effectiveness and asymptotic correctness in experiments.

Conclusion: The method provides a novel and reliable approach for identifying causal structures amidst latent variables, bypassing limitations of prior techniques.

Abstract: Recovering causal structure in the presence of latent variables is an
important but challenging task. While many methods have been proposed to handle
it, most of them require strict and/or untestable assumptions on the causal
structure. In real-world scenarios, observed variables may be affected by
multiple latent variables simultaneously, which, generally speaking, cannot be
handled by these methods. In this paper, we consider the linear, non-Gaussian
case, and make use of the joint higher-order cumulant matrix of the observed
variables constructed in a specific way. We show that, surprisingly, causal
asymmetry between two observed variables can be directly seen from the rank
deficiency properties of such higher-order cumulant matrices, even in the
presence of an arbitrary number of latent confounders. Identifiability results
are established, and the corresponding identification methods do not even
involve iterative procedures. Experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness and asymptotic correctness of our proposed method.

Result: The framework achieves comparable performance with state-of-the-art methods across various machine learning tasks, while handling complex data types and missing data effectively.

Conclusion: This novel approach offers a viable alternative to neural networks, focusing on scalable and human-interpretable machine learning grounded in the physics of information.

Abstract: Traditional machine learning relies on explicit models and domain
assumptions, limiting flexibility and interpretability. We introduce a
model-free framework using surprisal (information theoretic uncertainty) to
directly analyze and perform inferences from raw data, eliminating distribution
modeling, reducing bias, and enabling efficient updates including direct edits
and deletion of training data. By quantifying relevance through uncertainty,
the approach enables generalizable inference across tasks including generative
inference, causal discovery, anomaly detection, and time series forecasting. It
emphasizes traceability, interpretability, and data-driven decision making,
offering a unified, human-understandable framework for machine learning, and
achieves at or near state-of-the-art performance across most common machine
learning tasks. The mathematical foundations create a ``physics'' of
information, which enable these techniques to apply effectively to a wide
variety of complex data types, including missing data. Empirical results
indicate that this may be a viable alternative path to neural networks with
regard to scalable machine learning and artificial intelligence that can
maintain human understandability of the underlying mechanics.

*Siyu Zhu,Anastasiya Karpovich,Albert Chen,Jessica Koscheka,Shailesh Jannu,Di Wen,Yuqing Zhu,Rohit Jain,Alborz Geramifard*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study focuses on improving the training of reliable code-fixing agents in real-world repositories by introducing a verifiable pipeline and applying reinforcement learning (RL) along with supervised fine-tuned (SFT) models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the instability in evaluating code-fixing agents in real-world repositories caused by complex builds and shifting dependencies, and develop a scalable approach for training reliable agents.

Method: Created a verifiable pipeline with dependency pinning and automated build validation. Used supervised fine-tuned (SFT) models distilled from GPT-4.1 followed by reinforcement learning in a scalable environment.

Result: The SFT model successfully distilled GPT-4.1 trajectories and performed comparably while being 56x smaller. RL provided additional performance improvements of 7-20% under consistent train-test conditions. However, none of the models could generalize across environments.

Conclusion: Matching train-test environments is critical for building reliable code-fixing agents, and while the refined pipeline and models showed promise, generalization across different environments remains an unresolved challenge.

Abstract: We tackle the challenge of training reliable code-fixing agents in real
repositories, where complex builds and shifting dependencies make evaluation
unstable. We developed a verifiable pipeline with success defined as post-fix
build validation and improved reproducibility across ~1K real issues by pinning
dependencies and disabling automatic upgrades. Building on this, we introduced
a scalable simplified pipeline for large-scale reinforcement learning (RL).
Using this setup, we supervised fine-tuned Qwen3-32B in the full pipeline and
applied RL on top of the SFT model in the simplified environment. The SFT model
distilled from GPT-4.1 trajectories performs on par while being 56x smaller,
and RL added 7-20% absolute gains under matched train-test conditions.
"Thinking mode" was on par or worse in our experiments. Both SFT and RL models
failed to generalize across environments, highlighting the importance of
matching train-test environments for building reliable real-world code-fixing
agents.

*Thomas Bailie,S. Karthik Mukkavilli,Varvara Vetrova,Yun Sing Koh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introducing HiFlowCast and HiAntFlow, innovative Hierarchical Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs) designed for multiscale climate prediction, significantly improving accuracy and reducing model errors across diverse timescales, especially for rare events.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate weather prediction faces challenges due to the complexity of physical processes across diverse spatio-temporal scales, which conventional fixed-resolution methods fail to capture. The paper aims to integrate physics more effectively into forecasting models.

Method: The paper introduces HGNN-based models, HiFlowCast and HiAntFlow, with two key innovations: Latent-Memory-Retention to preserve global trends during downward mappings, and Latent-to-Physics branches to integrate PDE solutions across scales.

Result: HiFlowCast and its ensemble variant improved prediction accuracy, cutting errors by over 5% at 13-day lead times and 5-8% under extreme quantiles. They also converge rapidly, reducing training costs and their carbon footprint.

Conclusion: HiFlowCast and HiAntFlow are efficient, accurate HGNNs for climate forecasting that advance sustainability in machine learning while providing superior predictions, especially for rare weather events.

Abstract: Climate events arise from intricate, multivariate dynamics governed by
global-scale drivers, profoundly impacting food, energy, and infrastructure.
Yet, accurate weather prediction remains elusive due to physical processes
unfolding across diverse spatio-temporal scales, which fixed-resolution methods
cannot capture. Hierarchical Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs) offer a multiscale
representation, but nonlinear downward mappings often erase global trends,
weakening the integration of physics into forecasts. We introduce HiFlowCast
and its ensemble variant HiAntFlow, HGNNs that embed physics within a
multiscale prediction framework. Two innovations underpin their design: a
Latent-Memory-Retention mechanism that preserves global trends during downward
traversal, and a Latent-to-Physics branch that integrates PDE solution fields
across diverse scales. Our Flow models cut errors by over 5% at 13-day lead
times and by 5-8% under 1st and 99th quantile extremes, improving reliability
for rare events. Leveraging pretrained model weights, they converge within a
single epoch, reducing training cost and their carbon footprint. Such
efficiency is vital as the growing scale of machine learning challenges
sustainability and limits research accessibility. Code and model weights are in
the supplementary materials.

*Dominik Meier,Shixing Yu,Sagnik Nandy,Promit Ghosal,Kyra Gan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a latent plug-and-play diffusion framework for single-cell RNA sequencing data, addressing challenges in clustering accuracy by improving denoising and preserving data structure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate clustering of single-cell data is challenging due to measurement noise and biological variability, hindering downstream analyses.

Method: The method involves a new Gibbs sampling procedure, separating denoising into a low-dimensional latent space, while steering the process via noise reintroduction in the high-dimensional observation space.

Result: The framework enhances clustering accuracy on synthetic data, adapts effectively to varied noise levels and dataset shifts, and improves biological coherence in real single-cell data clusters.

Conclusion: This approach achieves better noise handling, uncertainty quantification, generalizable denoising, and improves clustering performance, contributing to more accurate single-cell analysis.

Abstract: Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) enables the study of cellular
heterogeneity. Yet, clustering accuracy, and with it downstream analyses based
on cell labels, remain challenging due to measurement noise and biological
variability. In standard latent spaces (e.g., obtained through PCA), data from
different cell types can be projected close together, making accurate
clustering difficult. We introduce a latent plug-and-play diffusion framework
that separates the observation and denoising space. This separation is
operationalized through a novel Gibbs sampling procedure: the learned diffusion
prior is applied in a low-dimensional latent space to perform denoising, while
to steer this process, noise is reintroduced into the original high-dimensional
observation space. This unique "input-space steering" ensures the denoising
trajectory remains faithful to the original data structure. Our approach offers
three key advantages: (1) adaptive noise handling via a tunable balance between
prior and observed data; (2) uncertainty quantification through principled
uncertainty estimates for downstream analysis; and (3) generalizable denoising
by leveraging clean reference data to denoise noisier datasets, and via
averaging, improve quality beyond the training set. We evaluate robustness on
both synthetic and real single-cell genomics data. Our method improves
clustering accuracy on synthetic data across varied noise levels and dataset
shifts. On real-world single-cell data, our method demonstrates improved
biological coherence in the resulting cell clusters, with cluster boundaries
that better align with known cell type markers and developmental trajectories.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores using deep learning for PBPK modeling and introduces a Dynamic Graph Neural Network (Dynamic GNN), outperforming traditional and baseline approaches in drug concentration prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional PBPK modeling relies on simplifying assumptions with ordinary differential equations, limiting adaptability to nonlinear physiological interactions. This study aims to overcome these limitations with data-driven approaches.

Method: Baseline models (MLP and LSTM) were implemented alongside a proposed Dynamic GNN, which uses recurrent message-passing processes to model connections between organs.

Result: The Dynamic GNN achieved superior predictive performance (R^2 of 0.9342, RMSE of 0.0159, MAE of 0.0116) compared to MLP (R^2 of 0.8705) and LSTM (R^2 of 0.8059).

Conclusion: Explicitly modeling spatial and temporal dependencies of organ interactions via Dynamic GNN offers a scalable and accurate alternative to traditional PBPK modeling in drug development settings.

Abstract: Physiologically Based Pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling plays a critical role
in drug development by predicting drug concentration dynamics across organs.
Traditional approaches rely on ordinary differential equations with strong
simplifying assumptions, which limit their adaptability to nonlinear
physiological interactions. In this study, we explore data-driven alternatives
for PBPK prediction using deep learning. Two baseline architectures - a
multilayer perceptron (MLP) and a long short-term memory (LSTM) network - are
implemented to capture molecular and temporal dependencies, respectively. To
incorporate inter-organ interactions, we propose a Dynamic Graph Neural Network
(Dynamic GNN) that models physiological connections as recurrent
message-passing processes between organs. Experimental results demonstrate that
the proposed Dynamic GNN achieves the highest predictive performance among all
models, with an R^2 of 0.9342, an RMSE of 0.0159, and an MAE of 0.0116. In
comparison, the MLP baseline obtains an R^2 of 0.8705 and the LSTM achieves
0.8059. These results highlight that explicitly modeling the spatial and
temporal dependencies of organ interactions enables more accurate and
generalizable drug concentration prediction. The Dynamic GNN provides a
scalable, equation-free alternative to traditional PBPK formulations and
demonstrates strong potential for data-driven pharmacokinetic modeling in
preclinical and clinical research.

*Divyesh Savaliya,Marius E. Yamakou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a Physics-Informed Machine Learning framework using neural networks to predict self-induced stochastic resonance (SISR) in excitable systems, specifically the stochastic FitzHugh-Nagumo neuron.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a data-efficient, accurate, and interpretable framework for understanding and predicting noise-induced coherence in multiscale stochastic systems, which are challenging to model and simulate using conventional purely data-driven approaches.

Method: The study employed a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) integrated with a Noise-Augmented State Predictor architecture. The loss function incorporates data fidelity, dynamical constraints, and physical constraints based on Kramers' escape theory to model SISR.

Result: The proposed approach accurately captures spike-train coherence as a function of system variables such as noise intensity and timescale separation. It matches the accuracy of stochastic simulations while requiring less computation and outperforming purely data-driven methods.

Conclusion: The framework successfully provides an efficient and interpretable surrogate model for simulating SISR in multiscale stochastic systems, enhancing the ability to study noise-induced coherent phenomena in complex systems.

Abstract: Self-induced stochastic resonance (SISR) is the emergence of coherent
oscillations in slow-fast excitable systems driven solely by noise, without
external periodic forcing or proximity to a bifurcation. This work presents a
physics-informed machine learning framework for modeling and predicting SISR in
the stochastic FitzHugh-Nagumo neuron. We embed the governing stochastic
differential equations and SISR-asymptotic timescale-matching constraints
directly into a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) based on a
Noise-Augmented State Predictor architecture. The composite loss integrates
data fidelity, dynamical residuals, and barrier-based physical constraints
derived from Kramers' escape theory. The trained PINN accurately predicts the
dependence of spike-train coherence on noise intensity, excitability, and
timescale separation, matching results from direct stochastic simulations with
substantial improvements in accuracy and generalization compared with purely
data-driven methods, while requiring significantly less computation. The
framework provides a data-efficient and interpretable surrogate model for
simulating and analyzing noise-induced coherence in multiscale stochastic
systems.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how network architecture shapes the inductive biases of score-based generative models and predict generalization before training.

Method: Introduces SADs, architecture-dependent directions that align with network output geometry, demonstrated via synthetic and standard image benchmarks.

Result: SADs reliably capture model behavior and correlate with downstream performance measured by Wasserstein metrics.

Conclusion: The research provides a new framework to explain and predict directional biases of generative models, emphasizing the role of architecture-induced adaptive bases.

Abstract: We investigate the role of network architecture in shaping the inductive
biases of modern score-based generative models. To this end, we introduce the
Score Anisotropy Directions (SADs), architecture-dependent directions that
reveal how different networks preferentially capture data structure. Our
analysis shows that SADs form adaptive bases aligned with the architecture's
output geometry, providing a principled way to predict generalization ability
in score models prior to training. Through both synthetic data and standard
image benchmarks, we demonstrate that SADs reliably capture fine-grained model
behavior and correlate with downstream performance, as measured by Wasserstein
metrics. Our work offers a new lens for explaining and predicting directional
biases of generative models.

*Shiji Zhou,Tianbai Yu,Zhi Zhang,Heng Chang,Xiao Zhou,Dong Wu,Han Zhao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces an optimized method for Machine Unlearning (MU) using constrained optimization, ensuring unlearning efficacy while preserving model's performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for efficiently removing sensitive or harmful data from pre-trained models while maintaining their original utility.

Method: The authors propose solving MU as a constrained optimization problem and introduce an implicit gradient surgery method for efficient and utility-preserving unlearning.

Result: The proposed algorithm outperforms existing baselines in achieving a better tradeoff between unlearning efficacy and utility preservation.

Conclusion: This study presents a novel approach for efficient Machine Unlearning, supported by theoretical analysis and extensive empirical evaluations, with code provided for reproducibility.

Abstract: Machine unlearning (MU) aims to efficiently remove sensitive or harmful
memory from a pre-trained model. The key challenge is to balance the potential
tradeoff between unlearning efficacy and utility preservation, which involves
forgetting undesirable information as defined while maintaining the model's
original performance. One potential way to tackle this problem is to use
multi-objective optimization to jointly optimize both the unlearning and
utility preservation objectives. However, existing multi-objective methods only
guarantee finding a Pareto-optimal solution without fine-grained control, which
causes under-optimization of the unlearning objective. To this end, we first
model MU as a constrained optimization problem, that is, optimizing the
unlearning objective under the constraint of a bounded increase for utility
loss. We then show that solving this optimization problem is equivalent to
unilateral gradient surgery on the unlearning objective. To resolve the
additional computational cost brought by gradient surgery, we propose an
implicit gradient surgery method, which approximates the solution to the
aforementioned constrained optimization problem via only one backpropagation,
thereby achieving efficient utility-preserving MU. Theoretically, we provide a
tight convergence analysis of the algorithm. Empirically, our extensive
experiments show that the proposed algorithm achieves better tradeoff results
than existing baselines. Codes are available at

*Daniel Sin,Milad Toutounchian*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Segmented Sampling for Boundary Approximation (SSBA), a method for generating counterfactual explanations by discretized searching and binary search on decision boundaries, with improved distance reductions and runtime comparisons.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of generating effective counterfactual explanations in high-dimensional spaces while incorporating real-world constraints.

Method: The SSBA method involves 4 steps: fitting data to a model, identifying the decision boundary, setting problem constraints, and calculating the nearest feasible counterfactual explanation using a discretized approach and binary search.

Result: Testing across four datasets, SSBA showed $5\%$ to $50\%$ improved reductions in $L_2$ norm distances, and faster runtime than grid-based methods by multiple orders of magnitude.

Conclusion: SSBA provides a simple, model-agnostic solution for generating realistic counterfactual explanations that adhere to constraints like immutable and categorical features, improving both distance metrics and performance.

Abstract: In our article, we describe a method for generating counterfactual
explanations in high-dimensional spaces using four steps that involve fitting
our dataset to a model, finding the decision boundary, determining constraints
on the problem, and computing the closest point (counterfactual explanation)
from that boundary. We propose a discretized approach where we find many
discrete points on the boundary and then identify the closest feasible
counterfactual explanation. This method, which we later call $\textit{Segmented
Sampling for Boundary Approximation}$ (SSBA), applies binary search to find
decision boundary points and then searches for the closest boundary point.
Across four datasets of varying dimensionality, we show that our method can
outperform current methods for counterfactual generation with reductions in
distance between $5\%$ to $50\%$ in terms of the $L_2$ norm. Our method can
also handle real-world constraints by restricting changes to immutable and
categorical features, such as age, gender, sex, height, and other related
characteristics such as the case for a health-based dataset. In terms of
runtime, the SSBA algorithm generates decision boundary points on multiple
orders of magnitude in the same given time when we compare to a grid-based
approach. In general, our method provides a simple and effective model-agnostic
method that can compute nearest feasible (i.e. realistic with constraints)
counterfactual explanations. All of our results and our code can be found here

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The opacity of NCO models' decisions and internal representations hampers both academic research and practical use, necessitating methods to interpret these black-box models.

Method: Probing tasks are used to investigate NCO representations, and a new tool, CS-Probing, is introduced to analyze coefficients and statistical significance.

Result: Experiments show NCO models encode both low-level and high-level information. CS-Probing reveals inductive biases, generalization properties, and important embedding dimensions. Minor code changes improve model generalization.

Conclusion: The paper provides systematic insights into interpreting NCO models, presenting probing as a valuable method to explore their inner workings and enhance understanding for the academic and practical domains.

Abstract: Neural combinatorial optimization (NCO) has achieved remarkable performance,
yet its learned model representations and decision rationale remain a black
box. This impedes both academic research and practical deployment, since
researchers and stakeholders require deeper insights into NCO models. In this
paper, we take the first critical step towards interpreting NCO models by
investigating their representations through various probing tasks. Moreover, we
introduce a novel probing tool named Coefficient Significance Probing
(CS-Probing) to enable deeper analysis of NCO representations by examining the
coefficients and statistical significance during probing. Extensive experiments
and analysis reveal that NCO models encode low-level information essential for
solution construction, while capturing high-level knowledge to facilitate
better decisions. Using CS-Probing, we find that prevalent NCO models impose
varying inductive biases on their learned representations, uncover direct
evidence related to model generalization, and identify key embedding dimensions
associated with specific knowledge. These insights can be potentially
translated into practice, for example, with minor code modifications, we
improve the generalization of the analyzed model. Our work represents a first
systematic attempt to interpret black-box NCO models, showcasing probing as a
promising tool for analyzing their internal mechanisms and revealing insights
for the NCO community. The source code is publicly available.

*Mohammad Tariqul Islam,Du Liu,Deblina Sarkar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Manifold approximated Kernel Alignment (MKA) as an improvement over CKA by incorporating manifold geometry into representation comparison.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CKA is widely used for comparing representations but fails to account for the underlying manifold geometry, leading to inconsistency across data scales.

Method: The authors develop MKA, which integrates manifold geometry into the alignment process and provide a theoretical framework alongside empirical evaluations.

Result: Empirical evaluations on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that MKA delivers more consistent and robust measurements of representations compared to CKA.

Conclusion: Manifold-aware kernel alignment (MKA) is presented as a robust alternative to CKA, showing promise in representation learning applications.

Abstract: Centered kernel alignment (CKA) is a popular metric for comparing
representations, determining equivalence of networks, and neuroscience
research. However, CKA does not account for the underlying manifold and relies
on numerous heuristics that cause it to behave differently at different scales
of data. In this work, we propose Manifold approximated Kernel Alignment (MKA),
which incorporates manifold geometry into the alignment task. We derive a
theoretical framework for MKA. We perform empirical evaluations on synthetic
datasets and real-world examples to characterize and compare MKA to its
contemporaries. Our findings suggest that manifold-aware kernel alignment
provides a more robust foundation for measuring representations, with potential
applications in representation learning.

*Farzaneh Heidari,Chao Li,Farzaneh Heidari*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel method (TN-SHAP) is introduced to calculate Shapley values more efficiently using tensor networks, drastically reducing computational cost and achieving significant speedups.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard computation of Shapley values involves exhaustive enumeration, which is computationally expensive (O(2^n)) for large numbers of features. This paper seeks to create a more efficient approach for computing such values.

Method: The paper proposes TN-SHAP: representing a predictor's behavior as a factorized multilinear map to simplify coalition evaluations. It uses tensor networks and focuses on extracting order-k Shapley interactions with fewer targeted evaluations.

Result: TN-SHAP provides theoretical approximation guarantees, significantly reduces computational overhead, and achieves 25-1000x speedups over KernelSHAP-IQ while maintaining comparable accuracy in experiments on UCI datasets.

Conclusion: TN-SHAP demonstrates efficient computation of Shapley values by exploiting tensor network representations, offering an accurate and scalable alternative to traditional methods.

Abstract: We show how to replace the O(2^n) coalition enumeration over n features
behind Shapley values and Shapley-style interaction indices with a
few-evaluation scheme on a tensor-network (TN) surrogate: TN-SHAP. The key idea
is to represent a predictor's local behavior as a factorized multilinear map,
so that coalitional quantities become linear probes of a coefficient tensor.
TN-SHAP replaces exhaustive coalition sweeps with just a small number of
targeted evaluations to extract order-k Shapley interactions. In particular,
both order-1 (single-feature) and order-2 (pairwise) computations have cost
O(n*poly(chi) + n^2), where chi is the TN's maximal cut rank. We provide
theoretical guarantees on the approximation error and tractability of TN-SHAP.
On UCI datasets, our method matches enumeration on the fitted surrogate while
reducing evaluation by orders of magnitude and achieves 25-1000x wall-clock
speedups over KernelSHAP-IQ at comparable accuracy, while amortizing training
across local cohorts.

*Bhavya Vasudeva,Puneesh Deora,Yize Zhao,Vatsal Sharan,Christos Thrampoulidis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study investigates the generalization properties of spectral optimizers like SpecGD, showing they promote balanced learning of data components and outperform traditional methods in imbalanced datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing use of spectrum-aware matrix-valued optimizers in deep learning necessitates a deeper understanding of their generalization performance and advantages.

Method: The authors use imbalanced data, Gaussian mixture models, and canonical forms of spectral optimizers like SpecGD for theoretical and empirical comparisons to traditional methods (e.g., Euclidean GD) in various models.

Result: SpecGD balances the learning of principal components, yielding superior generalization and balanced accuracy, even in deep linear models and compared to adaptive methods like Adam.

Conclusion: Spectral optimizers promote balanced learning, outperforming traditional methods in both theory and empirical datasets, with depth amplifying their advantages.

Abstract: The growing adoption of spectrum-aware matrix-valued optimizers such as Muon
and Shampoo in deep learning motivates a systematic study of their
generalization properties and, in particular, when they might outperform
competitive algorithms. We approach this question by introducing appropriate
simplifying abstractions as follows: First, we use imbalanced data as a
testbed. Second, we study the canonical form of such optimizers, which is
Spectral Gradient Descent (SpecGD) -- each update step is $UV^T$ where $U\Sigma
V^T$ is the truncated SVD of the gradient. Third, within this framework we
identify a canonical setting for which we precisely quantify when SpecGD
outperforms vanilla Euclidean GD. For a Gaussian mixture data model and both
linear and bilinear models, we show that unlike GD, which prioritizes learning
dominant principal components of the data first, SpecGD learns all principal
components of the data at equal rates. We demonstrate how this translates to a
growing gap in balanced accuracy favoring SpecGD early in training and further
show that the gap remains consistent even when the GD counterpart uses adaptive
step-sizes via normalization. By extending the analysis to deep linear models,
we show that depth amplifies these effects. We empirically verify our
theoretical findings on a variety of imbalanced datasets. Our experiments
compare practical variants of spectral methods, like Muon and Shampoo, against
their Euclidean counterparts and Adam. The results validate our findings that
these spectral optimizers achieve superior generalization by promoting a more
balanced learning of the data's underlying components.

*Jinzhe Liu,Junshu Sun,Shufan Shen,Chenxue Yang,Shuhui Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces NMKE, a novel method for precise lifelong knowledge editing in large language models, improving accuracy and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the issue of error accumulation and performance degradation in existing lifelong knowledge editing methods.

Method: The proposed NMKE framework integrates neuron-level attribution and dynamic sparse masking, categorizing neurons and using an entropy-guided sparse mask for precise editing.

Result: Experimental tests show NMKE achieves superior editing success rates and maintains the model's general capabilities during thousands of sequential edits.

Conclusion: NMKE offers an enhanced approach to knowledge editing in LLMs, ensuring both accuracy and generalization are preserved over time.

Abstract: Lifelong knowledge editing enables continuous, precise updates to outdated
knowledge in large language models (LLMs) without computationally expensive
full retraining. However, existing methods often accumulate errors throughout
the editing process, causing a gradual decline in both editing accuracy and
generalization. To tackle this problem, we propose Neuron-Specific Masked
Knowledge Editing (NMKE), a novel fine-grained editing framework that combines
neuron-level attribution with dynamic sparse masking. Leveraging neuron
functional attribution, we identify two key types of knowledge neurons, with
knowledge-general neurons activating consistently across prompts and
knowledge-specific neurons activating to specific prompts. NMKE further
introduces an entropy-guided dynamic sparse mask, locating relevant neurons to
the target knowledge. This strategy enables precise neuron-level knowledge
editing with fewer parameter modifications. Experimental results from thousands
of sequential edits demonstrate that NMKE outperforms existing methods in
maintaining high editing success rates and preserving model general
capabilities in lifelong editing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enhance the performance of random forest models by introducing an adaptive approach for weighting trees, improving upon existing models like RF and XGBoost.

Method: AF combines OP2T for tailored, input-dependent tree weights and MIO for dynamically refining these weights, thereby optimizing overall performance.

Result: Adaptive Forests (AF) consistently outperform Random Forests, XGBoost, and other weighted RFs in classification tasks on over 20 real-world datasets.

Conclusion: AF is a superior alternative to popular ensemble models due to its adaptive weighting mechanism, showing significant improvement in both binary and multi-class classification problems.

Abstract: Random Forests (RF) and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) are two of the
most widely used and highly performing classification and regression models.
They aggregate equally weighted CART trees, generated randomly in RF or
sequentially in XGBoost. In this paper, we propose Adaptive Forests (AF), a
novel approach that adaptively selects the weights of the underlying CART
models. AF combines (a) the Optimal Predictive-Policy Trees (OP2T) framework to
prescribe tailored, input-dependent unequal weights to trees and (b) Mixed
Integer Optimization (MIO) to refine weight candidates dynamically, enhancing
overall performance. We demonstrate that AF consistently outperforms RF,
XGBoost, and other weighted RF in binary and multi-class classification
problems over 20+ real-world datasets.

Method: The authors propose algorithms utilizing sublinear memory space and query time for ANN in streaming models, introducing a sketch storing a sublinear fraction of inputs. For A-KDE, they also present a sublinear size sketch under the Sliding-Window model.

Result: The algorithms achieve near-optimal trade-offs in memory usage and approximation accuracy for ANN, and provide the first sublinear sketch guarantee for A-KDE in the Sliding-Window model. Experiments demonstrate their efficiency and low errors across various real-world datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed techniques provide practical and theoretical advancements in sketching models for dynamic data streams, enabling scalable and efficient solutions for ANN and A-KDE problems.

Abstract: Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) search and Approximate Kernel Density
Estimation (A-KDE) are fundamental problems at the core of modern machine
learning, with broad applications in data analysis, information systems, and
large-scale decision making. In massive and dynamic data streams, a central
challenge is to design compact sketches that preserve essential structural
properties of the data while enabling efficient queries.
  In this work, we develop new sketching algorithms that achieve sublinear
space and query time guarantees for both ANN and A-KDE for a dynamic stream of
data. For ANN in the streaming model, under natural assumptions, we design a
sublinear sketch that requires only $\mathcal{O}(n^{1+\rho-\eta})$ memory by
storing only a sublinear ($n^{-\eta}$) fraction of the total inputs, where
$\rho$ is a parameter of the LSH family, and $0<\eta<1$. Our method supports
sublinear query time, batch queries, and extends to the more general Turnstile
model. While earlier works have focused on Exact NN, this is the first result
on ANN that achieves near-optimal trade-offs between memory size and
approximation error.
  Next, for A-KDE in the Sliding-Window model, we propose a sketch of size
$\mathcal{O}\left(RW \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{1+\epsilon} - 1} \log^2 N\right)$,
where $R$ is the number of sketch rows, $W$ is the LSH range, $N$ is the window
size, and $\epsilon$ is the approximation error. This, to the best of our
knowledge, is the first theoretical sublinear sketch guarantee for A-KDE in the
Sliding-Window model.
  We complement our theoretical results with experiments on various real-world
datasets, which show that the proposed sketches are lightweight and achieve
consistently low error in practice.

*Lorenzo Magnino,Kai Shao,Zida Wu,Jiacheng Shen,Mathieu Laurière*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm for non-stationary continuous mean field games (MFGs), addressing scalability and density approximation issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current reinforcement learning methods for MFGs are restricted to finite spaces or stationary models, limiting their real-world application. There is a need to develop approaches for non-stationary continuous MFG scenarios.

Method: The authors develop a DRL algorithm combining a Fictitious Play methodology, DRL for best-response computation, supervised learning for average policy representation, and Conditional Normalizing Flow for time-dependent population distribution representation.

Result: The proposed method was validated on three examples of increasing complexity and showed improved scalability and better density approximations for MFG problems.

Conclusion: This study makes a key contribution by advancing DRL methods for solving complex MFG problems, moving the field closer to solving real-world multi-agent systems.

Abstract: Mean field games (MFGs) have emerged as a powerful framework for modeling
interactions in large-scale multi-agent systems. Despite recent advancements in
reinforcement learning (RL) for MFGs, existing methods are typically limited to
finite spaces or stationary models, hindering their applicability to real-world
problems. This paper introduces a novel deep reinforcement learning (DRL)
algorithm specifically designed for non-stationary continuous MFGs. The
proposed approach builds upon a Fictitious Play (FP) methodology, leveraging
DRL for best-response computation and supervised learning for average policy
representation. Furthermore, it learns a representation of the time-dependent
population distribution using a Conditional Normalizing Flow. To validate the
effectiveness of our method, we evaluate it on three different examples of
increasing complexity. By addressing critical limitations in scalability and
density approximation, this work represents a significant advancement in
applying DRL techniques to complex MFG problems, bringing the field closer to
real-world multi-agent systems.

### [435] [Quantitative Bounds for Sorting-Based Permutation-Invariant Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22186)
*Nadav Dym,Matthias Wellershoff,Efstratios Tsoukanis,Daniel Levy,Radu Balan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper examines the sorting-based embedding used in graph deep learning, improving bounds on embedding dimension for injectivity and analyzing bi-Lipschitz distortion properties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address gaps in understanding sorting-based embeddings, specifically determining optimal embedding dimensions for injectivity and estimating bi-Lipschitz constants.

Method: The authors improve upper bounds for embedding dimensions, provide lower bounds, and analyze the bi-Lipschitz distortion by constructing specific matrices and exploring related variants.

Result: They obtained tighter bounds on embedding dimension requirements and established quadratic and lower bounds for bi-Lipschitz distortion in specific cases.

Conclusion: The findings enhance theoretical understanding of sorting-based embeddings, providing improved metrics for graph deep learning applications.

Abstract: We study the sorting-based embedding $\beta_{\mathbf A} : \mathbb R^{n \times
d} \to \mathbb R^{n \times D}$, $\mathbf X \mapsto {\downarrow}(\mathbf X
\mathbf A)$, where $\downarrow$ denotes column wise sorting of matrices. Such
embeddings arise in graph deep learning where outputs should be invariant to
permutations of graph nodes. Previous work showed that for large enough $D$ and
appropriate $\mathbf A$, the mapping $\beta_{\mathbf A}$ is injective, and
moreover satisfies a bi-Lipschitz condition. However, two gaps remain: firstly,
the optimal size $D$ required for injectivity is not yet known, and secondly,
no estimates of the bi-Lipschitz constants of the mapping are known.
  In this paper, we make substantial progress in addressing both of these gaps.
Regarding the first gap, we improve upon the best known upper bounds for the
embedding dimension $D$ necessary for injectivity, and also provide a lower
bound on the minimal injectivity dimension. Regarding the second gap, we
construct matrices $\mathbf A$, so that the bi-Lipschitz distortion of
$\beta_{\mathbf A} $ depends quadratically on $n$, and is completely
independent of $d$. We also show that the distortion of $\beta_{\mathbf A}$ is
necessarily at least in $\Omega(\sqrt{n})$. Finally, we provide similar results
for variants of $\beta_{\mathbf A}$ obtained by applying linear projections to
reduce the output dimension of $\beta_{\mathbf A}$.

### [436] [The Benchmarking Epistemology: Construct Validity for Evaluating Machine Learning Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23191)
*Timo Freiesleben,Sebastian Zezulka*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Predictive benchmarking evaluates machine learning models on performance and rankings. While benchmark scores reflect relative model performance, substantial scientific inferences require assumptions about learning structures and data distributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the validity and assumptions underlying the use of predictive benchmarking in machine learning for scientific claims.

Method: The paper develops conditions of construct validity inspired by psychological measurement theory and analyzes benchmarking through three case studies (ImageNet, WeatherBench, and Fragile Families Challenge).

Result: It identifies assumptions necessary for meaningful scientific inference from benchmark scores and clarifies their role in evaluating models systematically.

Conclusion: The work emphasizes the importance of epistemological reasoning in predictive benchmarking and highlights its role in conceptual advances in machine learning research.

Abstract: Predictive benchmarking, the evaluation of machine learning models based on
predictive performance and competitive ranking, is a central epistemic practice
in machine learning research and an increasingly prominent method for
scientific inquiry. Yet, benchmark scores alone provide at best measurements of
model performance relative to an evaluation dataset and a concrete learning
problem. Drawing substantial scientific inferences from the results, say about
theoretical tasks like image classification, requires additional assumptions
about the theoretical structure of the learning problems, evaluation functions,
and data distributions. We make these assumptions explicit by developing
conditions of construct validity inspired by psychological measurement theory.
We examine these assumptions in practice through three case studies, each
exemplifying a typical intended inference: measuring engineering progress in
computer vision with ImageNet; evaluating policy-relevant weather predictions
with WeatherBench; and examining limitations of the predictability of life
events with the Fragile Families Challenge. Our framework clarifies the
conditions under which benchmark scores can support diverse scientific claims,
bringing predictive benchmarking into perspective as an epistemological
practice and a key site of conceptual and theoretical reasoning in machine
learning.

*Nnamdi Aghanya,Jun Li,Kewei Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces Error-Bounded Predictive Coding (EPC), a lossy text compression technique using Masked Language Models to improve compression ratios while maintaining fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to improve lossy text compression by leveraging powerful predictive capabilities of Large Language Models for better compression rates while preserving reconstruction quality.

Method: Error-Bounded Predictive Coding (EPC) utilizes a Masked Language Model to predict masked content. Minimal corrections are stored only when the model's top prediction fails, enabling rate-distortion control.

Result: EPC achieves superior fidelity and significantly lower bit rates compared to Predictive Masking (PM) and Vector Quantisation (VQ+RE), owing to efficient use of the model's intrinsic knowledge.

Conclusion: EPC is a promising approach to achieving efficient lossy text compression by balancing fidelity and bit rate using Large Language Models.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can achieve near-optimal lossless compression by
acting as powerful probability models. We investigate their use in the lossy
domain, where reconstruction fidelity is traded for higher compression ratios.
This paper introduces Error-Bounded Predictive Coding (EPC), a lossy text codec
that leverages a Masked Language Model (MLM) as a decompressor. Instead of
storing a subset of original tokens, EPC allows the model to predict masked
content and stores minimal, rank-based corrections only when the model's top
prediction is incorrect. This creates a residual channel that offers continuous
rate-distortion control. We compare EPC to a simpler Predictive Masking (PM)
baseline and a transform-based Vector Quantisation with a Residual Patch
(VQ+RE) approach. Through an evaluation that includes precise bit accounting
and rate-distortion analysis, we demonstrate that EPC consistently dominates
PM, offering superior fidelity at a significantly lower bit rate by more
efficiently utilising the model's intrinsic knowledge.

### [438] [Robust Iterative Learning Hidden Quantum Markov Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23237)
*Ning Ning*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Adversarially Corrupted Hidden Quantum Markov Models (AC-HQMM) and proposes a robust learning algorithm to address sensitivity to data corruption.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HQMMs are vulnerable to adversarial data corruption and lack robustness analysis tools.

Method: The authors propose the Robust Iterative Learning Algorithm (RILA), featuring entropy filtering and stochastic resampling for robust quantum model learning.

Result: RILA shows better convergence stability, resilience to corruption, and physical validity in HQMM and HMM benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed approach offers an effective method for robust quantum sequential learning, setting a foundation for handling corrupted data.

Abstract: Hidden Quantum Markov Models (HQMMs) extend classical Hidden Markov Models to
the quantum domain, offering a powerful probabilistic framework for modeling
sequential data with quantum coherence. However, existing HQMM learning
algorithms are highly sensitive to data corruption and lack mechanisms to
ensure robustness under adversarial perturbations. In this work, we introduce
the Adversarially Corrupted HQMM (AC-HQMM), which formalizes robustness
analysis by allowing a controlled fraction of observation sequences to be
adversarially corrupted. To learn AC-HQMMs, we propose the Robust Iterative
Learning Algorithm (RILA), a derivative-free method that integrates a Remove
Corrupted Rows by Entropy Filtering (RCR-EF) module with an iterative
stochastic resampling procedure for physically valid Kraus operator updates.
RILA incorporates L1-penalized likelihood objectives to enhance stability,
resist overfitting, and remain effective under non-differentiable conditions.
Across multiple HQMM and HMM benchmarks, RILA demonstrates superior convergence
stability, corruption resilience, and preservation of physical validity
compared to existing algorithms, establishing a principled and efficient
approach for robust quantum sequential learning.

*Siddharth Jain,Shyamgopal Karthik,Vineet Gandhi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper examines leveraging pre-trained models for performance improvement through bidirectional knowledge transfer and data partitioning strategies. It achieves notable performance boosts in image classification, semantic segmentation, and video saliency prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Explore how pre-trained models with diverse generalization behaviors can collaboratively enhance each other's performance by utilizing large model repositories.

Method: Introduce a data partitioning strategy where pretrained models autonomously act as teachers or students for bidirectional knowledge transfer across tasks.

Result: Performance increased in various tasks: 1.4% improvement in image classification (ViT-B with ViT-T), enhanced semantic segmentation metrics, and a state-of-the-art in video saliency prediction.

Conclusion: Collaborative knowledge transfer between pretrained models from repositories effectively enhances task-specific performance for multiple diverse models.

Abstract: Pretrained models are ubiquitous in the current deep learning landscape,
offering strong results on a broad range of tasks. Recent works have shown that
models differing in various design choices exhibit categorically diverse
generalization behavior, resulting in one model grasping distinct data-specific
insights unavailable to the other. In this paper, we propose to leverage large
publicly available model repositories as an auxiliary source of model
improvements. We introduce a data partitioning strategy where pretrained models
autonomously adopt either the role of a student, seeking knowledge, or that of
a teacher, imparting knowledge. Experiments across various tasks demonstrate
the effectiveness of our proposed approach. In image classification, we
improved the performance of ViT-B by approximately 1.4% through bidirectional
knowledge transfer with ViT-T. For semantic segmentation, our method boosted
all evaluation metrics by enabling knowledge transfer both within and across
backbone architectures. In video saliency prediction, our approach achieved a
new state-of-the-art. We further extend our approach to knowledge transfer
between multiple models, leading to considerable performance improvements for
all model participants.

### [440] [GCAO: Group-driven Clustering via Gravitational Attraction and Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23259)
*Qi Li,Jun Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Group-driven Clustering via Gravitational Attraction and Optimization (GCAO) for effective clustering of high-dimensional and non-uniform data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clustering algorithms often fail on high-dimensional and non-uniform data due to disturbances in low-density boundary samples by neighboring clusters, resulting in poor clustering results.

Method: GCAO employs a group-level optimization mechanism where boundary points are aggregated into moving groups instead of individual point-based processing. Combining local density and neighborhood topology, GCAO uses gravitational interactions to ensure stable, consistent clustering.

Result: GCAO significantly outperforms 11 other clustering methods with average improvements of 37.13% (NMI), 52.08% (ARI), 44.98% (Homogeneity), and 38.81% (ACC) on high-dimensional datasets while maintaining efficiency and scalability.

Conclusion: GCAO is superior in enhancing cluster integrity, boundary separability, and robustness in complex data distributions, providing consistently better clustering outcomes.

Abstract: Traditional clustering algorithms often struggle with high-dimensional and
non-uniformly distributed data, where low-density boundary samples are easily
disturbed by neighboring clusters, leading to unstable and distorted clustering
results. To address this issue, we propose a Group-driven Clustering via
Gravitational Attraction and Optimization (GCAO) algorithm. GCAO introduces a
group-level optimization mechanism that aggregates low-density boundary points
into collaboratively moving groups, replacing the traditional point-based
contraction process. By combining local density estimation with neighborhood
topology, GCAO constructs effective gravitational interactions between groups
and their surroundings, enhancing boundary clarity and structural consistency.
Using groups as basic motion units, a gravitational contraction strategy
ensures globally stable and directionally consistent convergence. Experiments
on multiple high-dimensional datasets demonstrate that GCAO outperforms 11
representative clustering methods, achieving average improvements of 37.13%,
52.08%, 44.98%, and 38.81% in NMI, ARI, Homogeneity, and ACC, respectively,
while maintaining competitive efficiency and scalability. These results
highlight GCAO's superiority in preserving cluster integrity, enhancing
boundary separability, and ensuring robust performance on complex data
distributions.

*Sofoklis Kitharidis,Cor J. Veenman,Thomas Bäck,Niki van Stein*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework for navigating fairness-performance trade-offs in machine learning models, helping stakeholders select models that fit their criteria.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Stakeholders face challenges in choosing machine learning models that balance fairness and performance based on their values and needs.

Method: The authors propose an interactive framework using weakly supervised metric learning to determine fairness-performance similarity and clustering (k-means) to group models with similar attributes.

Result: Their approach organizes models into clusters, enabling users to explore models with similar predictive and fairness behaviors.

Conclusion: This framework aids stakeholders in making informed decisions by understanding trade-offs and feature-driven differences in models.

Abstract: In the context of algorithmic decision-making, fair machine learning methods
often yield multiple models that balance predictive fairness and performance in
varying degrees. This diversity introduces a challenge for stakeholders who
must select a model that aligns with their specific requirements and values. To
address this, we propose an interactive framework that assists in navigating
and interpreting the trade-offs across a portfolio of models. Our approach
leverages weakly supervised metric learning to learn a Mahalanobis distance
that reflects similarity in fairness and performance outcomes, effectively
structuring the feature importance space of the models according to
stakeholder-relevant criteria. We then apply clustering technique (k-means) to
group models based on their transformed representations of feature importances,
allowing users to explore clusters of models with similar predictive behaviors
and fairness characteristics. This facilitates informed decision-making by
helping users understand how models differ not only in their
fairness-performance balance but also in the features that drive their
predictions.

*Hanzhang Wang,Zonglin Liu,Jingyi Xu,Chenyang Wang,Zhiwei Zhong,Qiangqiang Shen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel proximal gradient algorithm (SSO-PGA) that ensures robust convergence and superior performance for non-negative inverse problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the instability and suboptimality of traditional proximal gradient algorithms in solving non-negative inverse problems.

Method: The authors replace the gradient descent step with a sigmoid-based operator enforcing non-negativity and boundedness. They also incorporate a sliding parameter for enhanced stability and unfold the optimization algorithm into a deep network.

Result: SSO-PGA demonstrates significant improvements in robustness, expressive capacity, and noise immunity compared to traditional PGA, validated by extensive numerical and real-world experiments.

Conclusion: SSO-PGA effectively resolves limitations of existing methods, ensuring improved performance and stability in non-negative inverse problems.

Abstract: Proximal gradient algorithms (PGA), while foundational for inverse problems
like image reconstruction, often yield unstable convergence and suboptimal
solutions by violating the critical non-negativity constraint. We identify the
gradient descent step as the root cause of this issue, which introduces
negative values and induces high sensitivity to hyperparameters. To overcome
these limitations, we propose a novel multiplicative update proximal gradient
algorithm (SSO-PGA) with convergence guarantees, which is designed for
robustness in non-negative inverse problems. Our key innovation lies in
superseding the gradient descent step with a learnable sigmoid-based operator,
which inherently enforces non-negativity and boundedness by transforming
traditional subtractive updates into multiplicative ones. This design,
augmented by a sliding parameter for enhanced stability and convergence, not
only improves robustness but also boosts expressive capacity and noise
immunity. We further formulate a degradation model for multi-modal restoration
and derive its SSO-PGA-based optimization algorithm, which is then unfolded
into a deep network to marry the interpretability of optimization with the
power of deep learning. Extensive numerical and real-world experiments
demonstrate that our method significantly surpasses traditional PGA and other
state-of-the-art algorithms, ensuring superior performance and stability.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates the effects of layer pruning on long-chain reasoning in large language models, showing that even small pruning can severely impair reasoning benchmarks while maintaining stable performance on other tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the largely unexplored impact of layer pruning on long-chain reasoning abilities in large language models, which are crucial for inference.

Method: Extensive experiments assessing the impact of layer pruning on test-time scaling and long-chain reasoning tasks, alongside in-depth analyses to understand underlying mechanisms.

Result: Layer pruning deteriorates test-time scaling, significantly reducing performance on reasoning-intensive benchmarks. Standard fine-tuning methods fail to restore effective performance.

Conclusion: Layer pruning presents fundamental risks for reasoning-intensive tasks in LLMs, necessitating a reconsideration of pruning strategies to preserve reasoning robustness.

Abstract: Layer pruning has emerged as a widely adopted technique for improving the
efficiency of large language models (LLMs). Although existing methods
demonstrate strong performance retention on general knowledge tasks, their
effect on long-chain reasoning, a more brittle yet crucial capability, remains
largely unexplored. In this work, we study the impact of layer pruning on
long-chain reasoning through the lens of test-time scaling, a key mechanism in
modern LLMs that enables strong reasoning capacity by allocating more
computation at inference time. With extensive experiments, we demonstrate that
pruning even one or two layers can severely impair test-time scaling, with
performance collapsing drastically on long reasoning benchmarks even when
performance on knowledge-intensive and shallow reasoning tasks remains stable.
Furthermore, we find that standard supervised fine-tuning remedies fail to
recover test-time scaling once it has deteriorated. Through in-depth analyses,
we identify the mechanisms underlying this fragility of test-time scaling and
highlight the fundamental risks of applying layer pruning to
reasoning-intensive LLMs. These findings call for a rethinking of layer pruning
strategies and provide insights for developing methods that preserve the
robustness of reasoning. We open-source the codebase in

*Lingxiao Huang,Zhize Li,Nisheeth K. Vishnoi,Runkai Yang,Haoyu Zhao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses constructing efficient coresets for $(k, z)$-clustering under stochastic noise using innovative surrogate error metrics, achieving improved performance and smaller coresets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve clustering quality when datasets are affected by stochastic noise by leveraging appropriate error metrics.

Method: The authors introduce and analyze new surrogate error metrics and design an algorithm based on these metrics to construct coresets with improved guarantees.

Result: They demonstrate that the new metrics reduce coreset size by up to $\mathrm{poly}(k)$ compared to classical approaches, with theory-supported and experimental validation.

Conclusion: Using the proposed metric not only aligns better with the true clustering cost but also enables practical improvements in coreset construction under noisy conditions.

Abstract: We study the problem of constructing coresets for $(k, z)$-clustering when
the input dataset is corrupted by stochastic noise drawn from a known
distribution. In this setting, evaluating the quality of a coreset is
inherently challenging, as the true underlying dataset is unobserved. To
address this, we investigate coreset construction using surrogate error metrics
that are tractable and provably related to the true clustering cost. We analyze
a traditional metric from prior work and introduce a new error metric that more
closely aligns with the true cost. Although our metric is defined independently
of the noise distribution, it enables approximation guarantees that scale with
the noise level. We design a coreset construction algorithm based on this
metric and show that, under mild assumptions on the data and noise, enforcing
an $\varepsilon$-bound under our metric yields smaller coresets and tighter
guarantees on the true clustering cost than those obtained via classical
metrics. In particular, we prove that the coreset size can improve by a factor
of up to $\mathrm{poly}(k)$, where $n$ is the dataset size. Experiments on
real-world datasets support our theoretical findings and demonstrate the
practical advantages of our approach.

*Berkay Döner,Thorir Mar Ingolfsson,Luca Benini,Yawei Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents LUNA, a scalable and topology-agnostic self-supervised model for EEG signal processing, achieving state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks with improved computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Developing large-scale models for EEG data is challenging due to electrode layout heterogeneity in public datasets, which limits generalization.

Method: The LUNA model reconciles diverse electrode layouts, compressing multi-channel EEG into fixed-size latent space using learned queries and cross-attention, followed by transformer operations on the latent representation.

Result: LUNA showed competitive performance on tasks such as abnormality detection and emotion recognition, achieving state-of-the-art results while significantly reducing computation and GPU memory usage.

Conclusion: LUNA enables effective processing of EEG data across different configurations, improving generalization, computational efficiency, and task performance.

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) offers a non-invasive lens into human brain
activity, but building large-scale models is hampered by topological
heterogeneity: each public EEG data defines its own electrode layout, limiting
generalization. We introduce LUNA (Latent Unified Network Architecture), a
self-supervised foundation model that reconciles disparate electrode geometries
while scaling linearly -- not quadratically -- with channel count. LUNA
compresses multi-channel EEG into a fixed-size, topology-agnostic latent space
via learned queries and cross-attention. Downstream transformer blocks then
operate exclusively on this latent representation using patch-wise temporal
self-attention, decoupling computation from electrode count. Pre-trained on
TUEG and Siena (over 21,000 hours of raw EEG across diverse montages) using a
masked-patch reconstruction objective, LUNA transfers effectively to four
downstream tasks: abnormality detection, artifact rejection, slowing
classification, and emotion recognition. It demonstrates highly competitive
performance across several benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art results on
TUAR and TUSL, e.g., 0.921 AUROC on TUAR, while reducing FLOPs by 300x and
trimming GPU memory use by up to 10x. Critically, these gains are consistent
across all evaluated electrode configurations. Code is available at

TL;DR: This paper explores out-of-distribution generalization in meta-learning using information theory, presenting scenarios and generalization bounds in meta-reinforcement learning and analyzing algorithm performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to understand and improve generalization in meta-learning under testing conditions where environments differ or are narrower than training.

Method: The researchers employ information-theoretic principles to formalize generalization bounds and analyze gradient-based meta-reinforcement learning.

Result: They establish theoretical generalization bounds and evaluate the generalization performance of a specific algorithm.

Conclusion: This work advances understanding of generalization in meta-learning, providing insights into algorithm effectiveness in mismatched or narrowed testing environments.

Abstract: In this work, we study out-of-distribution generalization in meta-learning
from an information-theoretic perspective. We focus on two scenarios: (i) when
the testing environment mismatches the training environment, and (ii) when the
training environment is broader than the testing environment. The first
corresponds to the standard distribution mismatch setting, while the second
reflects a broad-to-narrow training scenario. We further formalize the
generalization problem in meta-reinforcement learning and establish
corresponding generalization bounds. Finally, we analyze the generalization
performance of a gradient-based meta-reinforcement learning algorithm.

*Shireen Kudukkil Manchingal*

TL;DR: This paper introduces Epistemic Deep Learning to quantify uncertainty in AI models using Random-Set Neural Networks (RS-NN), specifically addressing overconfidence in predictions under various conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Machine learning struggles in safety-critical domains due to overconfident predictions caused by its inability to handle uncertainty.

Method: The methodology leverages RS-NN to model epistemic uncertainty through random set theory, predicting belief functions and adapting the technique to applications like LLMs and autonomous racing.

Result: Integrating epistemic awareness into deep learning reduces overconfidence in predictions and provides a unified framework for evaluating uncertainty-aware classifiers.

Conclusion: Incorporating epistemic uncertainty into deep learning enhances AI robustness by enabling models to recognize their limitations and act accordingly.

Abstract: Machine learning has achieved remarkable successes, yet its deployment in
safety-critical domains remains hindered by an inherent inability to manage
uncertainty, resulting in overconfident and unreliable predictions when models
encounter out-of-distribution data, adversarial perturbations, or naturally
fluctuating environments. This thesis, titled Epistemic Deep Learning: Enabling
Machine Learning Models to 'Know When They Do Not Know', addresses these
critical challenges by advancing the paradigm of Epistemic Artificial
Intelligence, which explicitly models and quantifies epistemic uncertainty: the
uncertainty arising from limited, biased, or incomplete training data, as
opposed to the irreducible randomness of aleatoric uncertainty, thereby
empowering models to acknowledge their limitations and refrain from
overconfident decisions when uncertainty is high.
  Central to this work is the development of the Random-Set Neural Network
(RS-NN), a novel methodology that leverages random set theory to predict belief
functions over sets of classes, capturing the extent of epistemic uncertainty
through the width of associated credal sets, applications of RS-NN, including
its adaptation to Large Language Models (LLMs) and its deployment in weather
classification for autonomous racing. In addition, the thesis proposes a
unified evaluation framework for uncertainty-aware classifiers. Extensive
experiments validate that integrating epistemic awareness into deep learning
not only mitigates the risks associated with overconfident predictions but also
lays the foundation for a paradigm shift in artificial intelligence, where the
ability to 'know when it does not know' becomes a hallmark of robust and
dependable systems. The title encapsulates the core philosophy of this work,
emphasizing that true intelligence involves recognizing and managing the limits
of one's own knowledge.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches to Federated Learning suffer from privacy and convergence limitations due to noisy channel aggregation and constrained assumptions on network models and loss functions.

Method: The authors propose a theoretical framework for deriving a novel bound on user-level Differential Privacy (DP) and convergence under general loss functions, alongside optimizing beamforming and power allocations.

Result: They demonstrate that DP can be naturally achieved without artificial noise, ensuring privacy while maintaining optimal convergence in over-the-air Federated Learning.

Conclusion: Over-the-air Federated Learning can leverage inherent channel noise as a privacy-preserving advantage without sacrificing model training efficiency, validated by simulations.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a distributed learning paradigm that preserves
privacy by eliminating the need to exchange raw data during training. In its
prototypical edge instantiation with underlying wireless transmissions enabled
by analog over-the-air computing (AirComp), referred to as \emph{over-the-air
FL (AirFL)}, the inherent channel noise plays a unique role of \emph{frenemy}
in the sense that it degrades training due to noisy global aggregation while
providing a natural source of randomness for privacy-preserving mechanisms,
formally quantified by \emph{differential privacy (DP)}. It remains,
nevertheless, challenging to effectively harness such channel impairments, as
prior arts, under assumptions of either simple channel models or restricted
types of loss functions, mostly considering (local) DP enhancement with a
single-round or non-convergent bound on privacy loss. In this paper, we study
AirFL over multiple-access fading channels with a multi-antenna base station
(BS) subject to user-level DP requirements. Despite a recent study, which
claimed in similar settings that artificial noise (AN) must be injected to
ensure DP in general, we demonstrate, on the contrary, that DP can be gained as
a \emph{perk} even \emph{without} employing any AN. Specifically, we derive a
novel bound on DP that converges under general bounded-domain assumptions on
model parameters, along with a convergence bound with general smooth and
non-convex loss functions. Next, we optimize over receive beamforming and power
allocations to characterize the optimal convergence-privacy trade-offs, which
also reveal explicit conditions in which DP is achievable without compromising
training. Finally, our theoretical findings are validated by extensive
numerical results.

### [449] [A Multi-level Analysis of Factors Associated with Student Performance: A Machine Learning Approach to the SAEB Microdata](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22266)
*Rodrigo Tertulino,Ricardo Almeida*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper identifies key factors influencing student performance in Brazilian basic education using a multi-level machine learning approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in effective public policy formulation by understanding factors driving student performance in basic education in Brazil.

Method: The study employed a Random Forest model and Explainable AI (SHAP) on data from student, teacher, school, and management sources to classify and interpret student proficiency.

Result: The Random Forest model achieved high accuracy (90.2%) and AUC (96.7%), with systemic factors like school socioeconomic level being dominant predictors.

Conclusion: Student academic performance is a systemic issue linked to the school's environment, requiring policies aimed at promoting educational equity and addressing school-level disparities.

Abstract: Identifying the factors that influence student performance in basic education
is a central challenge for formulating effective public policies in Brazil.
This study introduces a multi-level machine learning approach to classify the
proficiency of 9th-grade and high school students using microdata from the
System of Assessment of Basic Education (SAEB). Our model uniquely integrates
four data sources: student socioeconomic characteristics, teacher professional
profiles, school indicators, and director management profiles. A comparative
analysis of four ensemble algorithms confirmed the superiority of a Random
Forest model, which achieved 90.2% accuracy and an Area Under the Curve (AUC)
of 96.7%. To move beyond prediction, we applied Explainable AI (XAI) using
SHAP, which revealed that the school's average socioeconomic level is the most
dominant predictor, demonstrating that systemic factors have a greater impact
than individual characteristics in isolation. The primary conclusion is that
academic performance is a systemic phenomenon deeply tied to the school's
ecosystem. This study provides a data-driven, interpretable tool to inform
policies aimed at promoting educational equity by addressing disparities
between schools.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a machine learning-based early warning system analyzing real-time financial distress indicators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address household financial distress risks in increasingly unstable economic environments using real-time data.

Method: Utilizes panel dataset of households, real-time digital/macroeconomic signals, and advanced machine learning models with feature engineering.

Result: Engineered digital economy features improve prediction accuracy; inflation volatility and ICT demand are key predictors.

Conclusion: Provides scalable, interpretable system for near-real-time financial distress detection to inform intervention policies.

Abstract: The growing instability of both global and domestic economic environments has
increased the risk of financial distress at the household level. However,
traditional econometric models often rely on delayed and aggregated data,
limiting their effectiveness. This study introduces a machine learning-based
early warning system that utilizes real-time digital and macroeconomic signals
to identify financial distress in near real-time. Using a panel dataset of 750
households tracked over three monitoring rounds spanning 13 months, the
framework combines socioeconomic attributes, macroeconomic indicators (such as
GDP growth, inflation, and foreign exchange fluctuations), and digital economy
measures (including ICT demand and market volatility). Through data
preprocessing and feature engineering, we introduce lagged variables,
volatility measures, and interaction terms to capture both gradual and sudden
changes in financial stability. We benchmark baseline classifiers, such as
logistic regression and decision trees, against advanced ensemble models
including random forests, XGBoost, and LightGBM. Our results indicate that the
engineered features from the digital economy significantly enhance predictive
accuracy. The system performs reliably for both binary distress detection and
multi-class severity classification, with SHAP-based explanations identifying
inflation volatility and ICT demand as key predictors. Crucially, the framework
is designed for scalable deployment in national agencies and low-bandwidth
regional offices, ensuring it is accessible for policymakers and practitioners.
By implementing machine learning in a transparent and interpretable manner,
this study demonstrates the feasibility and impact of providing near-real-time
early warnings of financial distress. This offers actionable insights that can
strengthen household resilience and guide preemptive intervention strategies.

### [451] [Does Homophily Help in Robust Test-time Node Classification?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22289)
*Yan Jiang,Ruihong Qiu,Zi Huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper discusses 'GrapHoST', a novel method to adaptively transform graph structures at test-time, improving robustness and node classification performance for Graph Neural Networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address data quality issues and distribution shifts in test-time graphs, which degrade pre-trained Graph Neural Network (GNN) performance.

Method: The authors propose GrapHoST, a test-time graph structural transformation method using a homophily predictor to adaptively modify test graphs based on predicted homophily scores.

Result: GrapHoST achieves state-of-the-art performance on nine benchmark datasets, demonstrating up to 10.92% improvement under various test-time conditions.

Conclusion: GrapHoST enhances robustness and performance of pre-trained GNNs on node classification tasks, without requiring model retraining, by focusing on homophily-based test-time graph transformation.

Abstract: Homophily, the tendency of nodes from the same class to connect, is a
fundamental property of real-world graphs, underpinning structural and semantic
patterns in domains such as citation networks and social networks. Existing
methods exploit homophily through designing homophily-aware GNN architectures
or graph structure learning strategies, yet they primarily focus on GNN
learning with training graphs. However, in real-world scenarios, test graphs
often suffer from data quality issues and distribution shifts, such as domain
shifts across users from different regions in social networks and temporal
evolution shifts in citation network graphs collected over varying time
periods. These factors significantly compromise the pre-trained model's
robustness, resulting in degraded test-time performance. With empirical
observations and theoretical analysis, we reveal that transforming the test
graph structure by increasing homophily in homophilic graphs or decreasing it
in heterophilic graphs can significantly improve the robustness and performance
of pre-trained GNNs on node classifications, without requiring model training
or update. Motivated by these insights, a novel test-time graph structural
transformation method grounded in homophily, named GrapHoST, is proposed.
Specifically, a homophily predictor is developed to discriminate test edges,
facilitating adaptive test-time graph structural transformation by the
confidence of predicted homophily scores. Extensive experiments on nine
benchmark datasets under a range of test-time data quality issues demonstrate
that GrapHoST consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance, with
improvements of up to 10.92%. Our code has been released at

*Mary E. An,Paul Griffin,Jonathan G. Stine,Ramakrishna Balakrishnan,Ram Sriram,Soundar Kumara*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents a MASLD prediction model utilizing LASSO logistic regression, achieving competitive results while making trade-offs between fairness and predictive performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MASLD affects a significant portion of U.S. adults and can lead to severe complications like cirrhosis. Early detection is crucial to prevent disease progression through lifestyle changes.

Method: The study uses LASSO logistic regression, random forest, XGBoost, and neural networks, and applies an equal opportunity postprocessing method to enhance fairness across racial and ethnic subgroups.

Result: The LASSO model with top-ranked SHAP features performed with AUROC of 0.84 and accuracy of 78%, showing competitive results. Fairness improvement adjusted accuracy to 81% but reduced sensitivity, demonstrating a performance and fairness trade-off.

Conclusion: The MASER prediction model provides competitive predictive outcomes and ensures a balance between interpretability and fairness, highlighting the feasibility of achieving equity in healthcare diagnostics.

Abstract: Background: Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatotic Liver Disease (MASLD)
affects ~33% of U.S. adults and is the most common chronic liver disease.
Although often asymptomatic, progression can lead to cirrhosis. Early detection
is important, as lifestyle interventions can prevent disease progression. We
developed a fair, rigorous, and reproducible MASLD prediction model and
compared it to prior methods using a large electronic health record database.
  Methods: We evaluated LASSO logistic regression, random forest, XGBoost, and
a neural network for MASLD prediction using clinical feature subsets, including
the top 10 SHAP-ranked features. To reduce disparities in true positive rates
across racial and ethnic subgroups, we applied an equal opportunity
postprocessing method.
  Results: This study included 59,492 patients in the training data, 24,198 in
the validating data, and 25,188 in the testing data. The LASSO logistic
regression model with the top 10 features was selected for its interpretability
and comparable performance. Before fairness adjustment, the model achieved
AUROC of 0.84, accuracy of 78%, sensitivity of 72%, specificity of 79%, and
F1-score of 0.617. After equal opportunity postprocessing, accuracy modestly
increased to 81% and specificity to 94%, while sensitivity decreased to 41% and
F1-score to 0.515, reflecting the fairness trade-off.
  Conclusions: We developed the MASER prediction model (MASLD Static EHR Risk
Prediction), a LASSO logistic regression model which achieved competitive
performance for MASLD prediction (AUROC 0.836, accuracy 77.6%), comparable to
previously reported ensemble and tree-based models. Overall, this approach
demonstrates that interpretable models can achieve a balance of predictive
performance and fairness in diverse patient populations.

*Yujie Xiao,Gongzhen Tang,Wenhui Liu,Jun Li,Guangkun Nie,Zhuoran Kan,Deyun Zhang,Qinghao Zhao,Shenda Hong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper explores using transfer learning on a large ECG model to predict laboratory values non-invasively, showing moderate-to-strong success in many indicators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the limitations of invasive and delayed laboratory testing by leveraging ECG signals for quick and non-invasive lab value estimation.

Method: The study uses transfer learning to fine-tune a pre-trained ECG model (ECGFounder) on the MC-MED dataset, which includes over 20 million ECG segments. Predictive performance was evaluated for a wide range of laboratory indicators.

Result: The model showed strong predictive performance for 33 lab indicators, moderate performance for 59 indicators, and limited performance for 16 indicators.

Conclusion: This research demonstrates the feasibility of using AI for real-time, non-invasive lab value estimation with potential clinical applications.

Abstract: Timely access to laboratory values is critical for clinical decision-making,
yet current approaches rely on invasive venous sampling and are intrinsically
delayed. Electrocardiography (ECG), as a non-invasive and widely available
signal, offers a promising modality for rapid laboratory estimation. Recent
progress in deep learning has enabled the extraction of latent hematological
signatures from ECGs. However, existing models are constrained by low
signal-to-noise ratios, substantial inter-individual variability, limited data
diversity, and suboptimal generalization, especially when adapted to low-lead
wearable devices. In this work, we conduct an exploratory study leveraging
transfer learning to fine-tune ECGFounder, a large-scale pre-trained ECG
foundation model, on the Multimodal Clinical Monitoring in the Emergency
Department (MC-MED) dataset from Stanford. We generated a corpus of more than
20 million standardized ten-second ECG segments to enhance sensitivity to
subtle biochemical correlates. On internal validation, the model demonstrated
strong predictive performance (area under the curve above 0.65) for
thirty-three laboratory indicators, moderate performance (between 0.55 and
0.65) for fifty-nine indicators, and limited performance (below 0.55) for
sixteen indicators. This study provides an efficient artificial-intelligence
driven solution and establishes the feasibility scope for real-time,
non-invasive estimation of laboratory values.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper demonstrates how large language models (LLMs) can be used for analogical reasoning to identify novel battery materials.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the challenge of human limitation in generating deeper analogies for scientific discoveries, focusing on the potential of LLMs to overcome these limitations.

Method: The researchers leverage large language models to (1) retrieve cross-domain analogies to explore unconventional ideas, and (2) create analogy-based templates from a few examples for targeted insights.

Result: The strategies led to the identification of novel battery material candidates beyond known compositional spaces, outperforming conventional methods.

Conclusion: LLMs can serve as interpretable, expert-like tools for hypothesis generation, demonstrating their potential in facilitating scientific innovation through analogical reasoning.

Abstract: Analogical reasoning, the transfer of relational structures across contexts
(e.g., planet is to sun as electron is to nucleus), is fundamental to
scientific discovery. Yet human insight is often constrained by domain
expertise and surface-level biases, limiting access to deeper, structure-driven
analogies both within and across disciplines. Large language models (LLMs),
trained on vast cross-domain data, present a promising yet underexplored tool
for analogical reasoning in science. Here, we demonstrate that LLMs can
generate novel battery materials by (1) retrieving cross-domain analogs and
analogy-guided exemplars to steer exploration beyond conventional dopant
substitutions, and (2) constructing in-domain analogical templates from few
labeled examples to guide targeted exploitation. These explicit analogical
reasoning strategies yield candidates outside established compositional spaces
and outperform standard prompting baselines. Our findings position LLMs as
interpretable, expert-like hypothesis generators that leverage analogy-driven
generalization for scientific innovation.

TL;DR: ATLAS improves web agent adaptability by simulating actions in cognitive space, achieving a 63% success rate on WebArena-Lite.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current web-agents lack adaptability to new environments and produce inefficient plans due to being unaware of environmental structures and dynamics.

Method: ATLAS uses a memory-augmented architecture with cognitive mapping, hierarchical planning, action simulation, and a critic for decision-making.

Result: ATLAS significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art systems with a 63% success rate on WebArena-Lite Benchmark without requiring website-specific LLM fine-tuning.

Conclusion: The modular design of ATLAS leverages complementary features like world modeling and hierarchical planning, efficiently addressing limitations in adaptive web-agent performance.

Abstract: We observe that current state-of-the-art web-agents are unable to effectively
adapt to new environments without neural network fine-tuning, without which
they produce inefficient execution plans due to a lack of awareness of the
structure and dynamics of the new environment. To address this limitation, we
introduce ATLAS (Actor-Critic Task-completion with Look-ahead Action
Simulation), a memory-augmented agent that is able to make plans grounded in a
model of the environment by simulating the consequences of those actions in
cognitive space. Our agent starts by building a "cognitive map" by performing a
lightweight curiosity driven exploration of the environment. The planner
proposes candidate actions; the simulator predicts their consequences in
cognitive space; a critic analyzes the options to select the best roll-out and
update the original plan; and a browser executor performs the chosen action. On
the WebArena-Lite Benchmark, we achieve a 63% success rate compared to 53.9%
success rate for the previously published state-of-the-art. Unlike previous
systems, our modular architecture requires no website-specific LLM fine-tuning.
Ablations show sizable drops without the world-model, hierarchical planner, and
look-ahead-based replanner confirming their complementary roles within the
design of our system

*Jiazheng Li,Andreas Damianou,J Rosser,José Luis Redondo García,Konstantina Palla*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents Concept Walk, a framework to evaluate the faithfulness of reasoning traces in language models by analyzing internal activations related to concepts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges of faithfulness in reasoning traces generated by language models, which can mislead practitioners.

Method: Concept Walk projects reasoning steps onto internal concept directions learned from contrastive data, observing the dynamics of reasoning traces in activation space.

Result: Perturbed reasoning traces in simple cases are ignored by the model, but in complex cases, they create sustained shifts in internal activations, indicating faithful reasoning.

Conclusion: Concept Walk aids in assessing reasoning trace faithfulness, helping practitioners distinguish genuine reasoning from decorative traces.

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) traces promise transparency for reasoning language
models, but prior work shows they are not always faithful reflections of
internal computation. This raises challenges for oversight: practitioners may
misinterpret decorative reasoning as genuine. We introduce Concept Walk, a
general framework for tracing how a model's internal stance evolves with
respect to a concept direction during reasoning. Unlike surface text, Concept
Walk operates in activation space, projecting each reasoning step onto the
concept direction learned from contrastive data. This allows us to observe
whether reasoning traces shape outcomes or are discarded. As a case study, we
apply Concept Walk to the domain of Safety using Qwen 3-4B. We find that in
'easy' cases, perturbed CoTs are quickly ignored, indicating decorative
reasoning, whereas in 'hard' cases, perturbations induce sustained shifts in
internal activations, consistent with faithful reasoning. The contribution is
methodological: Concept Walk provides a lens to re-examine faithfulness through
concept-specific internal dynamics, helping identify when reasoning traces can
be trusted and when they risk misleading practitioners.

*Zirui Pang,Hao Zheng,Zhijie Deng,Ling Li,Zixin Zhong,Jiaheng Wei*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes Smoothed Gradient Ascent (SGA) to address the instability of gradient ascent in unlearning undesired knowledge, achieving improved stability and model utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enable large language models (LLMs) to unlearn hazardous or undesired knowledge while maintaining model performance.

Method: Smoothed Gradient Ascent (SGA) modifies Gradient Ascent by blending forget data with normal data using a tunable smoothing rate, enabling stable learning and preserving utility.

Result: SGA surpasses original Gradient Ascent and ranks top-2 among baseline methods on multiple benchmarks.

Conclusion: SGA is a more effective and stable approach for LLM unlearning, combining theoretical guidance and empirical evidence for optimal performance.

Abstract: LLM unlearning has emerged as a promising approach, aiming to enable models
to forget hazardous/undesired knowledge at low cost while preserving as much
model utility as possible. Among existing techniques, the most straightforward
method is performing Gradient Ascent (GA) w.r.t. the forget data, thereby
forcing the model to unlearn the forget dataset. However, GA suffers from
severe instability, as it drives updates in a divergent direction, often
resulting in drastically degraded model utility. To address this issue, we
propose Smoothed Gradient Ascent (SGA). SGA combines the forget data with
multiple constructed normal data through a tunable smoothing rate. Intuitively,
this extends GA from learning solely on the forget data to jointly learning
across both forget and normal data, enabling more stable unlearning while
better preserving model utility. Theoretically, we provide the theoretical
guidance on the selection of the optimal smoothing rate. Empirically, we
evaluate SGA on three benchmarks: TOFU, Harry Potter, and MUSE-NEWS.
Experimental results demonstrate that SGA consistently outperforms the original
Gradient Ascent (GA) method across all metrics and achieves top-2 performance
among all baseline methods on several key metrics.

*David Freire-Obregón,José Salas-Cáceres,Modesto Castrillón-Santana*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes substituting dropout with Conway's Game of Life (GoL) for neural network regularization. GoL introduces dynamic unit deactivation, showing comparable performance to dropout and offers interpretability through visual patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dropout, while effective in regularization, has limitations such as static behavior and a lack of interpretability.

Method: The paper leverages Conway's Game of Life (GoL) as a dynamic regularization strategy. Neural network units are modeled as GoL grid cells, and rules from GoL are applied to create dynamic unit deactivation.

Result: When applied to the CIFAR-10 dataset, the proposed method achieves performance comparable to traditional dropout techniques and enhances the interpretability of network behavior.

Conclusion: Dynamic unit deactivation using GoL provides an effective alternative to dropout, improving interpretability and being applicable across deeper architectures.

Abstract: Regularization techniques play a crucial role in preventing overfitting and
improving the generalization performance of neural networks. Dropout, a widely
used regularization technique, randomly deactivates units during training to
introduce redundancy and prevent co-adaptation among neurons. Despite its
effectiveness, dropout has limitations, such as its static nature and lack of
interpretability. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to regularization
by substituting dropout with Conway's Game of Life (GoL), a cellular automata
with simple rules that govern the evolution of a grid of cells. We introduce
dynamic unit deactivation during training by representing neural network units
as cells in a GoL grid and applying the game's rules to deactivate units. This
approach allows for the emergence of spatial patterns that adapt to the
training data, potentially enhancing the network's ability to generalize. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on the CIFAR-10 dataset, showing
that dynamic unit deactivation using GoL achieves comparable performance to
traditional dropout techniques while offering insights into the network's
behavior through the visualization of evolving patterns. Furthermore, our
discussion highlights the applicability of our proposal in deeper
architectures, demonstrating how it enhances the performance of different
dropout techniques.

*Yasas Senarath,Hemant Purohit*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses the issue of data drift and catastrophic forgetting in behavioral analytics models by proposing an augmentation-based approach utilizing external knowledge in continual learning frameworks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to improve models for behavioral analytics, which suffer performance degradation due to data drift and catastrophic forgetting when frequently updated.

Method: The authors suggest incorporating external knowledge through data augmentation into replay-based continual learning, which maintains a buffer of important past training instances.

Result: Evaluation on three datasets related to deviant behavior classification shows that the proposed augmentation method surpasses baseline replay-based approaches.

Conclusion: Integrating external knowledge via data augmentation in continual learning effectively mitigates catastrophic forgetting and enhances model performance on evolving online behavioral data.

Abstract: User behavior on online platforms is evolving, reflecting real-world changes
in how people post, whether it's helpful messages or hate speech. Models that
learn to capture this content can experience a decrease in performance over
time due to data drift, which can lead to ineffective behavioral analytics
systems. However, fine-tuning such a model over time with new data can be
detrimental due to catastrophic forgetting. Replay-based approaches in
continual learning offer a simple yet efficient method to update such models,
minimizing forgetting by maintaining a buffer of important training instances
from past learned tasks. However, the main limitation of this approach is the
fixed size of the buffer. External knowledge bases can be utilized to overcome
this limitation through data augmentation. We propose a novel
augmentation-based approach to incorporate external knowledge in the
replay-based continual learning framework. We evaluate several strategies with
three datasets from prior studies related to deviant behavior classification to
assess the integration of external knowledge in continual learning and
demonstrate that augmentation helps outperform baseline replay-based
approaches.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces SmartMixed, a training strategy optimizing per-neuron activation functions for computational efficiency and adaptability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most neural networks rely on uniform activation functions, potentially limiting their flexibility and efficiency.

Method: The proposed SmartMixed method uses a two-phase training approach where neurons select their activation functions in a differentiable manner and subsequently fix them for computationally efficient training.

Result: SmartMixed was evaluated on MNIST dataset, showing varied activation function preferences per layer, highlighting intra-layer functional diversity.

Conclusion: SmartMixed enhances neural network performance by enabling optimal activation function selection per neuron while maintaining computational efficiency during inference.

Abstract: The choice of activation function plays a critical role in neural networks,
yet most architectures still rely on fixed, uniform activation functions across
all neurons. We introduce SmartMixed, a two-phase training strategy that allows
networks to learn optimal per-neuron activation functions while preserving
computational efficiency at inference. In the first phase, neurons adaptively
select from a pool of candidate activation functions (ReLU, Sigmoid, Tanh,
Leaky ReLU, ELU, SELU) using a differentiable hard-mixture mechanism. In the
second phase, each neuron's activation function is fixed according to the
learned selection, resulting in a computationally efficient network that
supports continued training with optimized vectorized operations. We evaluate
SmartMixed on the MNIST dataset using feedforward neural networks of varying
depths. The analysis shows that neurons in different layers exhibit distinct
preferences for activation functions, providing insights into the functional
diversity within neural architectures.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces GraphTOP, a graph topology-oriented prompting framework that modifies graph topology to improve the adaptation of pre-trained GNN models for downstream tasks, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing graph prompting methods focus on modifying features but fail to optimize performance as they overlook topology-based prompting, which could significantly enhance pre-trained GNN adaptation.

Method: The proposed method formulates topology-oriented prompting as an edge rewiring problem within multi-hop local subgraphs, relaxed into a continuous probability space to maintain graph sparsity and tight relaxation.

Result: GraphTOP outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on multiple node classification tasks across five graph datasets and four pre-training strategies.

Conclusion: GraphTOP demonstrates that topology-oriented prompting is an effective method for adapting pre-trained GNNs, offering a robust alternative to feature-oriented techniques.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have revolutionized the field of graph learning
by learning expressive graph representations from massive graph data. As a
common pattern to train powerful GNNs, the "pre-training, adaptation" scheme
first pre-trains GNNs over unlabeled graph data and subsequently adapts them to
specific downstream tasks. In the adaptation phase, graph prompting is an
effective strategy that modifies input graph data with learnable prompts while
keeping pre-trained GNN models frozen. Typically, existing graph prompting
studies mainly focus on *feature-oriented* methods that apply graph prompts to
node features or hidden representations. However, these studies often achieve
suboptimal performance, as they consistently overlook the potential of
*topology-oriented* prompting, which adapts pre-trained GNNs by modifying the
graph topology. In this study, we conduct a pioneering investigation of graph
prompting in terms of graph topology. We propose the first **Graph**
**T**opology-**O**riented **P**rompting (GraphTOP) framework to effectively
adapt pre-trained GNN models for downstream tasks. More specifically, we
reformulate topology-oriented prompting as an edge rewiring problem within
multi-hop local subgraphs and relax it into the continuous probability space
through reparameterization while ensuring tight relaxation and preserving graph
sparsity. Extensive experiments on five graph datasets under four pre-training
strategies demonstrate that our proposed GraphTOP outshines six baselines on
multiple node classification datasets. Our code is available at

*Jing Yang,Kaitong Cai,Yijia Fan,Yufeng Yang,Keze Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GradLite proposes a new memory-efficient optimizer for fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) by enabling efficient training with discarded or approximated activations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for reducing memory consumption in training large language models, as conventional optimizers require exact gradients from cached activations, leading to high memory usage.

Method: GradLite employs low-rank Jacobian approximation to reduce dimensionality and error-feedback correction to mitigate approximation errors while preserving convergence guarantees.

Result: It reduces optimizer-state and activation memory consumption by up to 50% while delivering comparable or improved performance on various benchmarks.

Conclusion: GradLite provides a promising approach to optimize LLM fine-tuning efficiently, reducing memory demands without compromising performance or requiring architectural changes.

Abstract: Full fine-tuning of Large Language Models (LLMs) is notoriously
memory-intensive, primarily because conventional optimizers such as SGD or Adam
assume access to exact gradients derived from cached activations. Existing
solutions either alter the model architecture (e.g., reversible networks) or
trade memory for computation (e.g., activation checkpointing), but the
optimizer itself remains untouched. In this work, we introduce GradLite, a
backward-friendly optimizer that relaxes the requirement of exact gradients,
enabling efficient training even when intermediate activations are aggressively
discarded or approximated. GradLite leverages two key techniques: (i) low-rank
Jacobian approximation, which reduces the dimensionality of backpropagated
error signals, and (ii) error-feedback correction, which accumulates and
compensates approximation errors across iterations to preserve convergence
guarantees. We provide a theoretical analysis showing that GradLite maintains
unbiased gradient estimates with bounded variance, ensuring convergence rates
comparable to Adam. Empirically, GradLite reduces optimizer-state and
activation memory consumption by up to 50\% without architectural changes, and
achieves on-par or superior downstream performance on reasoning (MMLU, GSM8K),
multilingual, and dialogue benchmarks compared to checkpointing and
optimizer-centric baselines (LoMo, GaLore).

*Pritish Chakraborty,Indradyumna Roy,Soumen Chakrabarti,Abir De*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces CORGII, a novel graph indexing framework to improve retrieval efficiency and accuracy of subgraph isomorphism tasks, using contextual dense graph representation and differentiable discretization for indexing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for subgraph isomorphism retrieval rely on exhaustive scoring of corpus graphs, limiting their efficiency despite high accuracy.

Method: CORGII uses contextual dense graph representations combined with differentiable discretization to create sparse binary codes over a learned latent vocabulary for efficient indexing. It integrates data-driven, trainable impact weights and token expansion for flexible accuracy-efficiency tradeoffs.

Result: CORGII significantly improves retrieval trade-offs in accuracy and efficiency, surpassing several baseline methods in experimental evaluations.

Conclusion: The framework introduces an innovative indexing method and demonstrates the practicality of discrete token-based dense graph representations for building efficient inverted indices and enhancing graph search capabilities.

Abstract: Retrieving graphs from a large corpus, that contain a subgraph isomorphic to
a given query graph, is a core operation in many real-world applications. While
recent multi-vector graph representations and scores based on set alignment and
containment can provide accurate subgraph isomorphism tests, their use in
retrieval remains limited by their need to score corpus graphs exhaustively. We
introduce CORGII (Contextual Representation of Graphs for Inverted Indexing), a
graph indexing framework in which, starting with a contextual dense graph
representation, a differentiable discretization module computes sparse binary
codes over a learned latent vocabulary. This text document-like representation
allows us to leverage classic, highly optimized inverted indices, while
supporting soft (vector) set containment scores. Pushing this paradigm further,
we replace the classical, fixed impact weight of a `token' on a graph (such as
TFIDF or BM25) with a data-driven, trainable impact weight. Finally, we explore
token expansion to support multi-probing the index for smoother
accuracy-efficiency tradeoffs. To our knowledge, CORGII is the first indexer of
dense graph representations using discrete tokens mapping to efficient inverted
lists. Extensive experiments show that CORGII provides better trade-offs
between accuracy and efficiency, compared to several baselines.

*Ghadi Nehme,Yanxia Zhang,Dule Shu,Matt Klenk,Faez Ahmed*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LAMP is a framework for controllable and interpretable 3D geometry generation using minimal data with high extrapolation ability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for 3D generation struggle with data efficiency, controllability, and generalization beyond training datasets.

Method: LAMP aligns signed distance function decoders and uses a parameter-constrained mixing problem in weight space for generating geometries. A safety metric ensures validity by detecting linearity mismatches.

Result: LAMP achieves controlled interpolation with few samples, safe extrapolation beyond training ranges, and physics-driven optimization, outperforming baseline methods.

Conclusion: LAMP offers significant advancements in data-efficient and controllable 3D generation, enhancing design exploration and performance-driven applications.

Abstract: Generating high-fidelity 3D geometries that satisfy specific parameter
constraints has broad applications in design and engineering. However, current
methods typically rely on large training datasets and struggle with
controllability and generalization beyond the training distributions. To
overcome these limitations, we introduce LAMP (Linear Affine Mixing of
Parametric shapes), a data-efficient framework for controllable and
interpretable 3D generation. LAMP first aligns signed distance function (SDF)
decoders by overfitting each exemplar from a shared initialization, then
synthesizes new geometries by solving a parameter-constrained mixing problem in
the aligned weight space. To ensure robustness, we further propose a safety
metric that detects geometry validity via linearity mismatch. We evaluate LAMP
on two 3D parametric benchmarks: DrivAerNet++ and BlendedNet. We found that
LAMP enables (i) controlled interpolation within bounds with as few as 100
samples, (ii) safe extrapolation by up to 100% parameter difference beyond
training ranges, (iii) physics performance-guided optimization under fixed
parameters. LAMP significantly outperforms conditional autoencoder and Deep
Network Interpolation (DNI) baselines in both extrapolation and data
efficiency. Our results demonstrate that LAMP advances controllable,
data-efficient, and safe 3D generation for design exploration, dataset
generation, and performance-driven optimization.

### [465] [Scalable Oversight via Partitioned Human Supervision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22500)
*Ren Yin,Takashi Ishida,Masashi Sugiyama*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a scalable oversight framework using human-provided complementary labels to evaluate and train superhuman AI systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As AI surpasses human expertise in various domains, obtaining high-quality human supervision becomes difficult because even experts lack multi-domain knowledge.

Method: They utilize complementary labels—human experts identifying incorrect options rather than correct ones—and develop unbiased estimators along with scalable methods for combining complementary and ordinary labels.

Result: The framework can evaluate AI systems without ground truth labels and train AI systems using these weak complementary signals effectively.

Conclusion: The approach allows scalable evaluation and training of advanced AI systems by leveraging human partitioned supervision, using weak and complementary labels efficiently.

Abstract: As artificial intelligence (AI) systems approach and surpass expert human
performance across a broad range of tasks, obtaining high-quality human
supervision for evaluation and training becomes increasingly challenging. Our
focus is on tasks that require deep knowledge and skills of multiple domains.
Unfortunately, even the best human experts are knowledgeable only in a single
narrow area, and will not be able to evaluate the correctness of advanced AI
systems on such superhuman tasks. However, based on their narrow expertise,
humans may provide a weak signal, i.e., a complementary label indicating an
option that is incorrect. For example, a cardiologist could state that "this is
not related to cardiology,'' even if they cannot identify the true disease.
Based on this weak signal, we propose a scalable oversight framework that
enables us to evaluate frontier AI systems without the need to prepare the
ground truth. We derive an unbiased estimator of top-1 accuracy from
complementary labels and quantify how many complementary labels are needed to
match the variance of ordinary labels. We further introduce two estimators to
combine scarce ordinary labels with abundant complementary labels. We provide
finite-sample deviation guarantees for both complementary-only and the mixed
estimators. Empirically, we show that we can evaluate the output of large
language models without the ground truth, if we have complementary labels. We
further show that we can train an AI system with such weak signals: we show how
we can design an agentic AI system automatically that can perform better with
this partitioned human supervision. Our code is available at

*Seohong Park,Aditya Oberai,Pranav Atreya,Sergey Levine*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces Transitive Reinforcement Learning (TRL), an algorithm designed for offline goal-conditioned reinforcement learning, demonstrating superior performance in long-horizon tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address challenges in offline goal-conditioned reinforcement learning, particularly issues like bias accumulation and variance in value learning methods.

Method: TRL utilizes a divide-and-conquer strategy to convert triangle inequality structures in GCRL into a practical value update rule, reducing bias and variance compared to Temporal Difference and Monte Carlo methods.

Result: Experiments show that TRL achieves better performance than previous algorithms in complex, long-horizon benchmark tasks.

Conclusion: TRL is an effective and efficient solution for offline GCRL problems, combining the strengths of dynamic programming with reduced errors in bias and variance.

Abstract: In this work, we present Transitive Reinforcement Learning (TRL), a new value
learning algorithm based on a divide-and-conquer paradigm. TRL is designed for
offline goal-conditioned reinforcement learning (GCRL) problems, where the aim
is to find a policy that can reach any state from any other state in the
smallest number of steps. TRL converts a triangle inequality structure present
in GCRL into a practical divide-and-conquer value update rule. This has several
advantages compared to alternative value learning paradigms. Compared to
temporal difference (TD) methods, TRL suffers less from bias accumulation, as
in principle it only requires $O(\log T)$ recursions (as opposed to $O(T)$ in
TD learning) to handle a length-$T$ trajectory. Unlike Monte Carlo methods, TRL
suffers less from high variance as it performs dynamic programming.
Experimentally, we show that TRL achieves the best performance in highly
challenging, long-horizon benchmark tasks compared to previous offline GCRL
algorithms.

### [467] [Toward Robust Signed Graph Learning through Joint Input-Target Denoising](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22513)
*Junran Wu,Beng Chin Ooi,Ke Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a robust signed graph learning framework called RIDGE, enhancing Signed Graph Neural Networks (SGNNs) by jointly denoising inputs and supervision targets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the lack of robust SGNNs guided by theoretical principles, focusing on handling noise in signed graphs for improved representation learning.

Method: RIDGE builds on the graph information bottleneck (GIB) theory and introduces a joint denoising mechanism for input and target spaces using a reparameterization and variational approximation approach.

Result: Experimental validation on four signed graph datasets demonstrates significant robustness enhancements of SGNN models under varying noise conditions.

Conclusion: RIDGE successfully strengthens SGNNs' robustness by integrating theoretical foundations of joint input and target space denoising, showing promising results for noisy signed graph scenarios.

Abstract: Signed Graph Neural Networks (SGNNs) are widely adopted to analyze complex
patterns in signed graphs with both positive and negative links. Given the
noisy nature of real-world connections, the robustness of SGNN has also emerged
as a pivotal research area. Under the supervision of empirical properties,
graph structure learning has shown its robustness on signed graph
representation learning, however, there remains a paucity of research
investigating a robust SGNN with theoretical guidance. Inspired by the success
of graph information bottleneck (GIB) in information extraction, we propose
RIDGE, a novel framework for Robust sI gned graph learning through joint
Denoising of Graph inputs and supervision targEts. Different from the basic
GIB, we extend the GIB theory with the capability of target space denoising as
the co-existence of noise in both input and target spaces. In instantiation,
RIDGE effectively cleanses input data and supervision targets via a tractable
objective function produced by reparameterization mechanism and variational
approximation. We extensively validate our method on four prevalent signed
graph datasets, and the results show that RIDGE clearly improves the robustness
of popular SGNN models under various levels of noise.

### [468] [A Scalable Global Optimization Algorithm For Constrained Clustering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22519)
*Pedro Chumpitaz-Flores,My Duong,Cristobal Heredia,Kaixun Hua*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel algorithm for constrained clustering that can handle large-scale datasets, outperforming current methods both in scale and efficiency, while maintaining global optimality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current constrained clustering approaches struggle with scalability and global optimization due to the NP-hard nature of incorporating pairwise constraints.

Method: The authors propose the SDC-GBB framework, which uses grouped-sample Lagrangian decomposition and geometric elimination rules to achieve scalable k-Means constrained clustering with global optimality.

Result: The experimental results demonstrate that the algorithm can process datasets 200-1500 times larger than existing methods with an optimality gap of less than 3%.

Conclusion: The proposed approach offers scalable and globally optimal constrained clustering, addressing shortcomings of existing methods and handling much larger datasets.

Abstract: Constrained clustering leverages limited domain knowledge to improve
clustering performance and interpretability, but incorporating pairwise
must-link and cannot-link constraints is an NP-hard challenge, making global
optimization intractable. Existing mixed-integer optimization methods are
confined to small-scale datasets, limiting their utility. We propose
Sample-Driven Constrained Group-Based Branch-and-Bound (SDC-GBB), a
decomposable branch-and-bound (BB) framework that collapses must-linked samples
into centroid-based pseudo-samples and prunes cannot-link through geometric
rules, while preserving convergence and guaranteeing global optimality. By
integrating grouped-sample Lagrangian decomposition and geometric elimination
rules for efficient lower and upper bounds, the algorithm attains highly
scalable pairwise k-Means constrained clustering via parallelism. Experimental
results show that our approach handles datasets with 200,000 samples with
cannot-link constraints and 1,500,000 samples with must-link constraints, which
is 200 - 1500 times larger than the current state-of-the-art under comparable
constraint settings, while reaching an optimality gap of less than 3%. In
providing deterministic global guarantees, our method also avoids the search
failures that off-the-shelf heuristics often encounter on large datasets.

*Michael Ito,Danai Koutra,Jenna Wiens*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RSNNs address expressivity issues in RWNNs by offering efficient full node and edge coverage on sparse graphs, leading to better performance with reduced sampling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RWNNs face limitations in capturing global structures under realistic sampling constraints, which hinders their graph representation learning capabilities.

Method: The proposal is RSNNs operating on random searches, ensuring complete node coverage and requiring fewer searches for full edge coverage compared to RWNNs.

Result: RSNNs achieve comparable or superior performance on benchmarks with significantly fewer sampled sequences while maintaining isomorphism invariance.

Conclusion: RSNNs enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of graph learning by resolving coverage limitations in RWNNs and leveraging universal sequence models.

Abstract: Random walk neural networks (RWNNs) have emerged as a promising approach for
graph representation learning, leveraging recent advances in sequence models to
process random walks. However, under realistic sampling constraints, RWNNs
often fail to capture global structure even in small graphs due to incomplete
node and edge coverage, limiting their expressivity. To address this, we
propose \textit{random search neural networks} (RSNNs), which operate on random
searches, each of which guarantees full node coverage. Theoretically, we
demonstrate that in sparse graphs, only $O(\log |V|)$ searches are needed to
achieve full edge coverage, substantially reducing sampling complexity compared
to the $O(|V|)$ walks required by RWNNs (assuming walk lengths scale with graph
size). Furthermore, when paired with universal sequence models, RSNNs are
universal approximators. We lastly show RSNNs are probabilistically invariant
to graph isomorphisms, ensuring their expectation is an isomorphism-invariant
graph function. Empirically, RSNNs consistently outperform RWNNs on molecular
and protein benchmarks, achieving comparable or superior performance with up to
16$\times$ fewer sampled sequences. Our work bridges theoretical and practical
advances in random walk based approaches, offering an efficient and expressive
framework for learning on sparse graphs.

*Ashwin Ramachandran,Vaibhav Raj,Indrayumna Roy,Soumen Chakrabarti,Abir De*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: IsoNet++ enhances graph retrieval performance using early interaction GNN, iterative alignment refinement, and novel node-pair partner interaction methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving graph retrieval methods for applications such as scene graph retrieval, molecular fingerprint detection, and circuit design.

Method: Developed IsoNet++, utilizing early interaction GNN, iterative alignment refinement, and innovative node-pair partner interactions paired with embeddings.

Result: IsoNet++ demonstrates progressive alignment refinement and better retrieval performance than previous approaches through multiple datasets.

Conclusion: The technical advances in IsoNet++ significantly improve retrieval accuracy, showcasing the importance of its innovations in graph matching tasks.

Abstract: Graph retrieval based on subgraph isomorphism has several real-world
applications such as scene graph retrieval, molecular fingerprint detection and
circuit design. Roy et al. [35] proposed IsoNet, a late interaction model for
subgraph matching, which first computes the node and edge embeddings of each
graph independently of paired graph and then computes a trainable alignment
map. Here, we present IsoNet++, an early interaction graph neural network
(GNN), based on several technical innovations. First, we compute embeddings of
all nodes by passing messages within and across the two input graphs, guided by
an injective alignment between their nodes. Second, we update this alignment in
a lazy fashion over multiple rounds. Within each round, we run a layerwise GNN
from scratch, based on the current state of the alignment. After the completion
of one round of GNN, we use the last-layer embeddings to update the alignments,
and proceed to the next round. Third, IsoNet++ incorporates a novel notion of
node-pair partner interaction. Traditional early interaction computes attention
between a node and its potential partners in the other graph, the attention
then controlling messages passed across graphs. In contrast, we consider node
pairs (not single nodes) as potential partners. Existence of an edge between
the nodes in one graph and non-existence in the other provide vital signals for
refining the alignment. Our experiments on several datasets show that the
alignments get progressively refined with successive rounds, resulting in
significantly better retrieval performance than existing methods. We
demonstrate that all three innovations contribute to the enhanced accuracy. Our
code and datasets are publicly available at

*Yuyang Ding,Chi Zhang,Juntao Li,Haibin Lin,Xin Liu,Min Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes Flawed-Aware Policy Optimization (FAPO), a method to address unreliable reasoning patterns in reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) for large language models, aiming for stable early gains and enhanced reasoning over time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address flawed-positive rollouts in RLVR, where unreliable reasoning patterns are adopted due to equal rewards for flawed and correct outcomes, limiting reasoning capabilities of large language models.

Method: Flawed-Aware Policy Optimization (FAPO) introduces a parameter-free reward penalty for flawed-positive rollouts to balance rapid initial learning and reliable reasoning refinement. It also uses a generative reward model (GenRM) to detect reasoning errors precisely.

Result: Experiments confirm FAPO's effectiveness across various domains by achieving better outcome correctness, reasoning reliability, and stable training without extra computational cost.

Conclusion: FAPO provides a nuanced reward mechanism that mitigates flawed reasoning patterns in RLVR, enabling models to optimize reasoning capabilities more effectively throughout training stages.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a
promising paradigm for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language
models (LLMs). In this context, models explore reasoning trajectories and
exploit rollouts with correct answers as positive signals for policy
optimization. However, these rollouts might involve flawed patterns such as
answer-guessing and jump-in-reasoning. Such flawed-positive rollouts are
rewarded identically to fully correct ones, causing policy models to
internalize these unreliable reasoning patterns. In this work, we first conduct
a systematic study of flawed-positive rollouts in RL and find that they enable
rapid capability gains during the early optimization stage, while constraining
reasoning capability later by reinforcing unreliable patterns. Building on
these insights, we propose Flawed-Aware Policy Optimization (FAPO), which
presents a parameter-free reward penalty for flawed-positive rollouts, enabling
the policy to leverage them as useful shortcuts in the warm-up stage, securing
stable early gains, while gradually shifting optimization toward reliable
reasoning in the later refinement stage. To accurately and comprehensively
detect flawed-positive rollouts, we introduce a generative reward model (GenRM)
with a process-level reward that precisely localizes reasoning errors.
Experiments show that FAPO is effective in broad domains, improving outcome
correctness, process reliability, and training stability without increasing the
token budget.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a deep learning method using Diffusion Denoising Probabilistic Models (DDPM) for recovering stochastic traces from non-deterministic process logs with significant performance improvements demonstrated.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing presence of stochastically-known logs from non-deterministic sources, like uncertain sensors or machine learning models, necessitates reliable means for trace recovery to better understand the processes in such systems.

Method: The proposed method utilizes Diffusion Denoising Probabilistic Models (DDPM) to recover traces by denoising, leveraging process knowledge either implicitly (discovering models) or explicitly (injecting knowledge during training).

Result: Experimental results show up to a 25% improvement in performance compared to existing methods, with enhanced robustness under high noise conditions.

Conclusion: The developed DDPM-based approach provides a reliable solution for stochastic trace recovery, outperforming previous techniques and proving effective even in challenging scenarios with high noise.

Abstract: With recent technological advances, process logs, which were traditionally
deterministic in nature, are being captured from non-deterministic sources,
such as uncertain sensors or machine learning models (that predict activities
using cameras). In the presence of stochastically-known logs, logs that contain
probabilistic information, the need for stochastic trace recovery increases, to
offer reliable means of understanding the processes that govern such systems.
We design a novel deep learning approach for stochastic trace recovery, based
on Diffusion Denoising Probabilistic Models (DDPM), which makes use of process
knowledge (either implicitly by discovering a model or explicitly by injecting
process knowledge in the training phase) to recover traces by denoising. We
conduct an empirical evaluation demonstrating state-of-the-art performance with
up to a 25% improvement over existing methods, along with increased robustness
under high noise levels.

*Dhruv Sarkar,Abhishek Sinha*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel anytime online algorithm for sequential learning with adversarial convex costs and constraints. It avoids prior limitations like the standard doubling trick and uses time-varying Lyapunov functions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of this paper is to address the limitations of existing sequential online algorithms, particularly focusing on optimal performance without requiring the knowledge of the horizon length and improving real-world practicalities by avoiding techniques like the doubling trick.

Method: The method involves designing an anytime online algorithm based on time-varying Lyapunov functions, offering a novel analytical approach that overcomes challenges posed by non-monotonic properties.

Result: The algorithm achieves $O(\sqrt{t})$ regret and $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{t})$ constraint violation bounds for any step $t$. It also adapts to dynamic and optimistic settings for enhanced performance.

Conclusion: This paper provides an innovative solution to adversarial online learning, showcasing theoretical bounds and practical utility via numerical experiments, such as the online shortest path problem.

Abstract: We propose an anytime online algorithm for the problem of learning a sequence
of adversarial convex cost functions while approximately satisfying another
sequence of adversarial online convex constraints. A sequential algorithm is
called \emph{anytime} if it provides a non-trivial performance guarantee for
any intermediate timestep $t$ without requiring prior knowledge of the length
of the entire time horizon $T$. Our proposed algorithm achieves optimal
performance bounds without resorting to the standard doubling trick, which has
poor practical performance due to multiple restarts. Our core technical
contribution is the use of time-varying Lyapunov functions to keep track of
constraint violations. This must be contrasted with prior works that used a
fixed Lyapunov function tuned to the known horizon length $T$. The use of
time-varying Lyapunov function poses unique analytical challenges as
properties, such as \emph{monotonicity}, on which the prior proofs rest, no
longer hold. By introducing a new analytical technique, we show that our
algorithm achieves $O(\sqrt{t})$ regret and $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{t})$ cumulative
constraint violation bounds for any $t\geq 1$.
  We extend our results to the dynamic regret setting, achieving bounds that
adapt to the path length of the comparator sequence without prior knowledge of
its total length. We also present an adaptive algorithm in the optimistic
setting, whose performance gracefully scales with the cumulative prediction
error. We demonstrate the practical utility of our algorithm through numerical
experiments involving the online shortest path problem.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge in semi-supervised learning where the quality of pseudo-labels impacts model performance, aiming to reduce bias introduced by inaccurate pseudo-labels.

Method: The paper proposes balancing the contributions of labeled and pseudo-labeled data using an interpolation parameter that is tuned on-the-fly through a one-dimensional online learning algorithm.

Result: The proposed method demonstrated improved performance over traditional SSL baselines and existing PPI approaches across experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: The dynamic tuning of interpolation parameters enhances semi-supervised learning by effectively utilizing unlabeled data while mitigating the harm caused by inaccurate pseudo-labels.

Abstract: Prediction-Powered Inference (PPI) is a recently proposed statistical
inference technique for parameter estimation that leverages pseudo-labels on
both labeled and unlabeled data to construct an unbiased, low-variance
estimator. In this work, we extend its core idea to semi-supervised learning
(SSL) for model training, introducing a novel unbiased gradient estimator. This
extension addresses a key challenge in SSL: while unlabeled data can improve
model performance, its benefit heavily depends on the quality of pseudo-labels.
Inaccurate pseudo-labels can introduce bias, leading to suboptimal models.To
balance the contributions of labeled and pseudo-labeled data, we utilize an
interpolation parameter and tune it on the fly, alongside the model parameters,
using a one-dimensional online learning algorithm. We verify the practical
advantage of our approach through experiments on both synthetic and real
datasets, demonstrating improved performance over classic SSL baselines and PPI
methods that tune the interpolation parameter offline.

Conclusion: Discrete curvature is vital for understanding intrinsic geometric structures and its integration into learning models offers substantial benefits for data analysis.

Abstract: Geometric data analysis and learning has emerged as a distinct and rapidly
developing research area, increasingly recognized for its effectiveness across
diverse applications. At the heart of this field lies curvature, a powerful and

numerous tasks, from community detection to geometric deep learning. A wide
range of discrete curvature models have been proposed for various data
representations, including graphs, simplicial complexes, cubical complexes, and
point clouds sampled from manifolds. These models not only provide efficient
characterizations of data geometry but also constitute essential components in
geometric learning frameworks. In this paper, we present the first
comprehensive review of existing discrete curvature models, covering their
mathematical foundations, computational formulations, and practical
applications in data analysis and learning. In particular, we discuss discrete
curvature from both Riemannian and metric geometry perspectives and propose a
systematic pipeline for curvature-driven data analysis. We further examine the
corresponding computational algorithms across different data representations,

TL;DR: CLEANet is a framework designed to address the challenges of anomaly detection in contaminated multivariate time series by improving robustness and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of training data contamination and inefficient model inference in real-world multivariate time series anomaly detection.

Method: Proposing a framework called CLEANet, which includes a Contamination-Resilient Training Framework (CRTF) to handle corrupted samples using reconstruction weighting and clustering-guided contrastive learning. Additionally, it implements a lightweight conjugate MLP for disentangling dependencies and enhancing efficiency.

Result: CLEANet shows up to 73.04% higher F1 scores and 81.28% reduced runtime compared to ten baseline approaches across five datasets. When CRTF is integrated into other models, it offers significant performance improvements.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that CLEANet successfully addresses data contamination and inefficiency in multivariate time series anomaly detection, offering both robust and generalizable results.

Abstract: Multivariate time series (MTS) anomaly detection is essential for maintaining
the reliability of industrial systems, yet real-world deployment is hindered by
two critical challenges: training data contamination (noises and hidden
anomalies) and inefficient model inference. Existing unsupervised methods
assume clean training data, but contamination distorts learned patterns and
degrades detection accuracy. Meanwhile, complex deep models often overfit to
contamination and suffer from high latency, limiting practical use. To address
these challenges, we propose CLEANet, a robust and efficient anomaly detection
framework in contaminated multivariate time series. CLEANet introduces a
Contamination-Resilient Training Framework (CRTF) that mitigates the impact of
corrupted samples through an adaptive reconstruction weighting strategy
combined with clustering-guided contrastive learning, thereby enhancing
robustness. To further avoid overfitting on contaminated data and improve
computational efficiency, we design a lightweight conjugate MLP that
disentangles temporal and cross-feature dependencies. Across five public
datasets, CLEANet achieves up to 73.04% higher F1 and 81.28% lower runtime
compared with ten state-of-the-art baselines. Furthermore, integrating CRTF
into three advanced models yields an average 5.35% F1 gain, confirming its
strong generalizability.

*Divya Jyoti Bajpai,Manjesh Kumar Hanawal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FastVLM leverages a Self-Speculative Decoding framework to address the computational inefficiencies of Vision-language Models, enhancing speed by up to 1.85x with minimal performance loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to overcome the computational cost and inference latency issues faced by Vision-language Models when using autoregressive decoding.

Method: FastVLM uses a lightweight draft model for autoregressive token generation coupled with a full model for non-autoregressive token verification, refining rejected tokens through imitation learning.

Result: The method achieves a speed-up of 1.55-1.85x during inference with negligible performance degradation.

Conclusion: FastVLM strikes an effective balance between efficiency and accuracy, presenting a novel decoding framework for Vision-language Models.

Abstract: Vision-language Models (VLMs) have made significant strides in visual
understanding and query response generation, but often face challenges of high
computational cost and inference latency due to autoregressive decoding. In
this work, we introduce an imitation-learning-based Self-Speculative Decoding
(SSD) framework, named FastVLM, to address these limitations. Our approach
employs a lightweight draft model for token generation in an autoregressive
manner, while a full model verifies these tokens non-autoregressively. Accepted
tokens proceed seamlessly, while rejected tokens are corrected by the full
model and used to guide the draft model's refinement. Through an imitation
network, FastVLM enhances the draft model by integrating deeper level insights
from the full model's architecture. Also, it maintains the performance
integrity of the full model while training the draft model, achieving a balance
between efficiency and accuracy. Our method speeds up the inference process by
1.55-1.85x as compared to the final layer with minimal loss in performance.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces RS-Pool, a robust pooling strategy for Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to improve adversarial robustness in graph classification tasks. RS-Pool leverages the dominant singular vector for constructing graph-level representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limited exploration of adversarial robustness in graph classification tasks, particularly focusing on the role of pooling operations in Graph Neural Networks.

Method: The authors analyze standard pooling methods theoretically, derive vulnerabilities, and propose a novel RS-Pool strategy using the dominant singular vector of the node embedding matrix. RS-Pool is implemented efficiently via power iteration.

Result: RS-Pool demonstrates superior robustness against adversarial attacks compared to existing pooling methods while maintaining competitive accuracy on real-world benchmarks.

Conclusion: RS-Pool enhances the robustness of GNNs in graph classification tasks, providing insights into pooling operator design and effectiveness for adversarial robustness without sacrificing clean performance.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved strong performance across a range
of graph representation learning tasks, yet their adversarial robustness in
graph classification remains underexplored compared to node classification.
While most existing defenses focus on the message-passing component, this work
investigates the overlooked role of pooling operations in shaping robustness.
We present a theoretical analysis of standard flat pooling methods (sum,
average and max), deriving upper bounds on their adversarial risk and
identifying their vulnerabilities under different attack scenarios and graph
structures. Motivated by these insights, we propose \textit{Robust Singular
Pooling (RS-Pool)}, a novel pooling strategy that leverages the dominant
singular vector of the node embedding matrix to construct a robust graph-level
representation. We theoretically investigate the robustness of RS-Pool and
interpret the resulting bound leading to improved understanding of our proposed
pooling operator. While our analysis centers on Graph Convolutional Networks
(GCNs), RS-Pool is model-agnostic and can be implemented efficiently via power
iteration. Empirical results on real-world benchmarks show that RS-Pool
provides better robustness than the considered pooling methods when subject to
state-of-the-art adversarial attacks while maintaining competitive clean
accuracy. Our code is publicly available

*Lu Xu,Tsai Hor Chan,Kwok Fai Lam,Lequan Yu,Guosheng Yin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Variational Polya Tree (VPT) model, a Bayesian nonparametric approach for density estimation to improve interpretability and uncertainty quantification in deep learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing neural network-based density estimation techniques lack interpretability and robust uncertainty quantification. Bayesian nonparametric methods, like the Polya tree, address these issues but face computational and scalability challenges, limiting their integration into deep learning.

Method: The paper proposes the Variational Polya Tree (VPT) model, which employs stochastic variational inference to compute posterior distributions. It enhances posterior approximation by utilizing the joint distribution likelihood and supports stochastic gradient optimization.

Result: The proposed VPT model demonstrated competitive performance in density estimation tasks on real data and images, compared to state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, it showcased improved interpretability and uncertainty quantification.

Conclusion: The VPT model effectively addresses the limitations of existing methods by introducing a scalable and interpretable Bayesian nonparametric approach to density estimation, making it valuable for deep learning applications.

Abstract: Density estimation is essential for generative modeling, particularly with
the rise of modern neural networks. While existing methods capture complex data
distributions, they often lack interpretability and uncertainty quantification.
Bayesian nonparametric methods, especially the \polya tree, offer a robust
framework that addresses these issues by accurately capturing function behavior
over small intervals. Traditional techniques like Markov chain Monte Carlo
(MCMC) face high computational complexity and scalability limitations,
hindering the use of Bayesian nonparametric methods in deep learning. To tackle
this, we introduce the variational \polya tree (VPT) model, which employs
stochastic variational inference to compute posterior distributions. This model
provides a flexible, nonparametric Bayesian prior that captures latent
densities and works well with stochastic gradient optimization. We also
leverage the joint distribution likelihood for a more precise variational
posterior approximation than traditional mean-field methods. We evaluate the
model performance on both real data and images, and demonstrate its
competitiveness with other state-of-the-art deep density estimation methods. We
also explore its ability in enhancing interpretability and uncertainty
quantification. Code is available at

*Sofiane Ennadir,Johannes F. Lutzeyer,Michalis Vazirgiannis,El Houcine Bergou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper explores how weight initialization and related hyper-parameters impact the robustness of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to adversarial perturbations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There are concerns about GNNs being susceptible to adversarial attacks, and existing defenses mainly focus on pre-processing methods and adaptive message-passing. The motivation is to investigate the overlooked impact of weight initialization on model robustness.

Method: The authors propose a theoretical framework that links initialization strategies to adversarial resilience. They also extend this framework to provide a general upper-bound for Deep Neural Networks. Experiments are conducted across models and datasets under various attacks.

Result: The study establishes a direct relationship between initial weights, training epochs, and model vulnerability. Experiments show that appropriate initialization can improve robustness with observed performance gaps of up to 50% compared to other initialization methods.

Conclusion: The findings highlight the importance of selecting proper weight initialization and demonstrate its significant role in enhancing adversarial robustness beyond traditional defense methods.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across
a spectrum of graph-related tasks, however concerns persist regarding their
vulnerability to adversarial perturbations. While prevailing defense strategies
focus primarily on pre-processing techniques and adaptive message-passing
schemes, this study delves into an under-explored dimension: the impact of
weight initialization and associated hyper-parameters, such as training epochs,
on a model's robustness. We introduce a theoretical framework bridging the
connection between initialization strategies and a network's resilience to
adversarial perturbations. Our analysis reveals a direct relationship between
initial weights, number of training epochs and the model's vulnerability,
offering new insights into adversarial robustness beyond conventional defense
mechanisms. While our primary focus is on GNNs, we extend our theoretical
framework, providing a general upper-bound applicable to Deep Neural Networks.
Extensive experiments, spanning diverse models and real-world datasets
subjected to various adversarial attacks, validate our findings. We illustrate
that selecting appropriate initialization not only ensures performance on clean
datasets but also enhances model robustness against adversarial perturbations,
with observed gaps of up to 50\% compared to alternative initialization
approaches.

*Ilgam Latypov,Alexandra Suvorikova,Alexey Kroshnin,Alexander Gasnikov,Yuriy Dorn*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces M-LCB, a meta-algorithm designed to select and update multiple adaptive experts under fixed resource constraints, while providing regret guarantees in a stochastic setting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of dynamically selecting and updating multiple adaptive learning algorithms in online environments, particularly under resource constraints, such as bandwidth in streaming, financial trading strategies, or orchestrating contextual learning agents.

Method: The proposed approach, M-LCB, is a UCB-style meta-algorithm that dynamically selects predictors among multiple learning experts. Regret guarantees are achieved by building confidence intervals from realized losses without additional complex optimizations, while respecting per-round budget constraints for updating experts.

Result: M-LCB achieves a regret bound of \(\tilde{O}(\sqrt{KT/M} + (K/M)^{1-\alpha} T^\alpha)\), where \(\alpha\) reflects the convergence of the experts. This is demonstrated with scenarios involving parametric models and multi-armed bandit algorithms.

Conclusion: The paper contributes a novel way to extend classical bandit paradigms to scenarios involving multiple self-learning models operating under constrained resources, creating new possibilities for adaptive learning in practical applications.

Abstract: In many modern applications, a system must dynamically choose between several
adaptive learning algorithms that are trained online. Examples include model
selection in streaming environments, switching between trading strategies in
finance, and orchestrating multiple contextual bandit or reinforcement learning
agents. At each round, a learner must select one predictor among $K$ adaptive
experts to make a prediction, while being able to update at most $M \le K$ of
them under a fixed training budget.
  We address this problem in the \emph{stochastic setting} and introduce
\algname{M-LCB}, a computationally efficient UCB-style meta-algorithm that
provides \emph{anytime regret guarantees}. Its confidence intervals are built
directly from realized losses, require no additional optimization, and
seamlessly reflect the convergence properties of the underlying experts. If
each expert achieves internal regret $\tilde O(T^\alpha)$, then \algname{M-LCB}
ensures overall regret bounded by $\tilde O\!\Bigl(\sqrt{\tfrac{KT}{M}} \;+\;
(K/M)^{1-\alpha}\,T^\alpha\Bigr)$.
  To our knowledge, this is the first result establishing regret guarantees
when multiple adaptive experts are trained simultaneously under per-round
budget constraints. We illustrate the framework with two representative cases:
(i) parametric models trained online with stochastic losses, and (ii) experts
that are themselves multi-armed bandit algorithms. These examples highlight how
\algname{M-LCB} extends the classical bandit paradigm to the more realistic
scenario of coordinating stateful, self-learning experts under limited
resources.

*Berken Utku Demirel,Christian Holz*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a self-supervised learning approach to replace handcrafted augmentations with views generated from orthonormal bases and overcomplete frames, achieving performance gains without data diversity augmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the limitations of handcrafted augmentations, which require domain-specific knowledge and impose representational invariances that can hinder generalization.

Method: The method involves generating views using orthonormal bases and overcomplete frames to explore complementary geometric biases and distinct manifold properties for representation learning.

Result: The approach achieves significant performance improvements, with up to 15-20% gains over existing self-supervised methods across datasets and tasks, without relying on augmentation-induced diversity.

Conclusion: Using orthonormal bases and overcomplete frames for view generation effectively addresses challenges associated with augmentations, improving representation learning performance across diverse tasks.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for
learning representations without labeled data. Most SSL approaches rely on
strong, well-established, handcrafted data augmentations to generate diverse
views for representation learning. However, designing such augmentations
requires domain-specific knowledge and implicitly imposes representational
invariances on the model, which can limit generalization. In this work, we
propose an unsupervised representation learning method that replaces
augmentations by generating views using orthonormal bases and overcomplete
frames. We show that embeddings learned from orthonormal and overcomplete
spaces reside on distinct manifolds, shaped by the geometric biases introduced
by representing samples in different spaces. By jointly leveraging the
complementary geometry of these distinct manifolds, our approach achieves
superior performance without artificially increasing data diversity through
strong augmentations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on nine
datasets across five temporal sequence tasks, where signal-specific
characteristics make data augmentations particularly challenging. Without
relying on augmentation-induced diversity, our method achieves performance
gains of up to 15--20\% over existing self-supervised approaches. Source code:

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces FlowCritic, a generative approach to value estimation in reinforcement learning using flow matching, overcoming limitations of multi-critic ensembles and distributional RL.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve the reliability and expressiveness of value estimation in reinforcement learning, addressing shortcomings of existing methods like multi-critic ensembles and distributional RL.

Method: Proposed FlowCritic uses flow matching to model complex value distributions and generate samples for enhanced value estimation.

Result: By modeling value distributions generatively, FlowCritic potentially provides more precise and expressive value estimation.

Conclusion: FlowCritic redefines value prediction strategies in reinforcement learning, offering more robust and flexible estimation.

Abstract: Reliable value estimation serves as the cornerstone of reinforcement learning
(RL) by evaluating long-term returns and guiding policy improvement,
significantly influencing the convergence speed and final performance. Existing
works improve the reliability of value function estimation via multi-critic
ensembles and distributional RL, yet the former merely combines multi point
estimation without capturing distributional information, whereas the latter
relies on discretization or quantile regression, limiting the expressiveness of
complex value distributions. Inspired by flow matching's success in generative
modeling, we propose a generative paradigm for value estimation, named
FlowCritic. Departing from conventional regression for deterministic value
prediction, FlowCritic leverages flow matching to model value distributions and
generate samples for value estimation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve faithful reasoning and transparency in medical VLMs by providing visual grounding and textual rationales with accurate alignment.

Method: The study introduces S-Chain, a large-scale dataset with 12,000 images annotated with structured visual Chain-of-Thought (SV-CoT) reasoning steps linked to visual regions, supporting multilingual VQA with over 700k pairs.

Result: S-Chain significantly enhances interpretability, grounding fidelity, and robustness in medical and general-purpose VLMs. Synergy with retrieval-augmented generation was explored, showing better alignment between domain knowledge and visual grounding.

Conclusion: S-Chain establishes a benchmark for grounded reasoning in medical VLMs, leading to more trustworthy and explainable models.

Abstract: Faithful reasoning in medical vision-language models (VLMs) requires not only
accurate predictions but also transparent alignment between textual rationales
and visual evidence. While Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has shown promise
in medical visual question answering (VQA), no large-scale expert-level dataset
has captured stepwise reasoning with precise visual grounding. We introduce
S-Chain, the first large-scale dataset of 12,000 expert-annotated medical
images with bounding boxes and structured visual CoT (SV-CoT), explicitly
linking visual regions to reasoning steps. The dataset further supports 16
languages, totaling over 700k VQA pairs for broad multilingual applicability.
Using S-Chain, we benchmark state-of-the-art medical VLMs (ExGra-Med,
LLaVA-Med) and general-purpose VLMs (Qwen2.5-VL, InternVL2.5), showing that
SV-CoT supervision significantly improves interpretability, grounding fidelity,
and robustness. Beyond benchmarking, we study its synergy with
retrieval-augmented generation, revealing how domain knowledge and visual
grounding interact during autoregressive reasoning. Finally, we propose a new
mechanism that strengthens the alignment between visual evidence and reasoning,
improving both reliability and efficiency. S-Chain establishes a new benchmark
for grounded medical reasoning and paves the way toward more trustworthy and
explainable medical VLMs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper critiques Gaussian-Process-based Bayesian Optimization (GP-BO) for database management system (DBMS) auto-tuning and introduces Centrum, which leverages stochastic gradient boosting and conformal prediction to improve tuning outcomes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to overcome the shortcomings of GP-BO frameworks in DBMS auto-tuning, including modeling inaccuracies and inefficient tuning performance, by exploring and advancing alternative methods.

Method: Centrum employs stochastic gradient boosting ensembles for improved point and interval estimation and integrates locally-adaptive conformal prediction for enhancing uncertainty estimation and acquisition functions in Bayesian optimization.

Result: Extensive experiments on two DBMSs and three workloads demonstrate Centrum's superior performance, surpassing 21 state-of-the-art methods in efficiency and effectiveness.

Conclusion: Centrum establishes a new benchmark for DBMS auto-tuning by addressing GP-BO limitations, using gradient boosting ensembles and conformal inference to deliver a distribution-free and practical optimization framework.

Abstract: Gaussian-Process-based Bayesian optimization (GP-BO), is a prevailing
model-based framework for DBMS auto-tuning. However, recent work shows
GP-BO-based DBMS auto-tuners significantly outperformed auto-tuners based on
SMAC, which features random forest surrogate models; such results motivate us
to rethink and investigate the limitations of GP-BO in auto-tuner design. We
find the fundamental assumptions of GP-BO are widely violated when modeling and
optimizing DBMS performance, while tree-ensemble-BOs (e.g., SMAC) can avoid the
assumption pitfalls and deliver improved tuning efficiency and effectiveness.
Moreover, we argue that existing tree-ensemble-BOs restrict further advancement
in DBMS auto-tuning. First, existing tree-ensemble-BOs can only achieve
distribution-free point estimates, but still impose unrealistic distributional
assumptions on uncertainty estimates, compromising surrogate modeling and
distort the acquisition function. Second, recent advances in gradient boosting,
which can further enhance surrogate modeling against vanilla GP and random
forest counterparts, have rarely been applied in optimizing DBMS auto-tuners.
To address these issues, we propose a novel model-based DBMS auto-tuner,
Centrum. Centrum improves distribution-free point and interval estimation in
surrogate modeling with a two-phase learning procedure of stochastic gradient
boosting ensembles. Moreover, Centrum adopts a generalized SGBE-estimated
locally-adaptive conformal prediction to facilitate a distribution-free
uncertainty estimation and acquisition function. To our knowledge, Centrum is
the first auto-tuner to realize distribution-freeness, enhancing BO's
practicality in DBMS auto-tuning, and the first to seamlessly fuse gradient
boosting ensembles and conformal inference in BO. Extensive physical and
simulation experiments on two DBMSs and three workloads show Centrum
outperforms 21 SOTA methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance robustness and generalization in statistical learning and optimization via an effective ambiguity set in the DRO framework.

Method: The authors introduce a diffusion-based ambiguity set design that extends beyond the nominal distribution's support space, and propose D-DRO, solving inner maximization in the diffusion model space.

Result: D-DRO demonstrates both formal stationary convergence and improved Out-of-Distribution generalization performance in a machine learning prediction task.

Conclusion: The proposed D-DRO effectively balances robustness and tractability, offering superior OOD generalization performance, validated through theoretical and empirical results.

Abstract: This paper studies Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO), a fundamental
framework for enhancing the robustness and generalization of statistical
learning and optimization. An effective ambiguity set for DRO must involve
distributions that remain consistent with the nominal distribution while being
diverse enough to account for a variety of potential scenarios. Moreover, it
should lead to tractable DRO solutions. To this end, we propose a
diffusion-based ambiguity set design that captures various adversarial
distributions beyond the nominal support space while maintaining consistency
with the nominal distribution. Building on this ambiguity modeling, we propose
Diffusion-based DRO (D-DRO), a tractable DRO algorithm that solves the inner
maximization over the parameterized diffusion model space. We formally
establish the stationary convergence performance of D-DRO and empirically
demonstrate its superior Out-of-Distribution (OOD) generalization performance
in a ML prediction task.

TL;DR: TALE is an algorithm that prunes transformer layers of LLMs during inference, improving performance and computational efficiency without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the inefficiency and degraded task-relevant representations caused by bottleneck layers in transformers for large language models.

Method: TALE prunes transformer layers by optimizing task-specific validation performance. Evaluated on 9 tasks and 5 models, it operates under zero-shot and few-shot conditions, without requiring retraining.

Result: TALE improves model accuracy, reduces computational cost, enhances performance during fine-tuning, and supports user control over accuracy-efficiency trade-offs.

Conclusion: TALE remedies bottlenecks via layer elimination, yielding faster, compact, interpretable, and more accurate transformer models.

Abstract: In this paper we introduce Tale, Task-Aware Layer Elimination, an
inference-time algorithm that prunes entire transformer layers in an LLM by
directly optimizing task-specific validation performance. We evaluate TALE on 9
tasks and 5 models, including LLaMA 3.1 8B, Qwen 2.5 7B, Qwen 2.5 0.5B, Mistral
7B, and Lucie 7B, under both zero-shot and few-shot settings. Unlike prior
approaches, TALE requires no retraining and consistently improves accuracy
while reducing computational cost across all benchmarks. Furthermore, applying
TALE during finetuning leads to additional performance gains. Finally, TALE
provides flexible user control over trade-offs between accuracy and efficiency.
Mutual information analysis shows that certain layers act as bottlenecks,
degrading task-relevant representations. Tale's selective layer removal
remedies this problem, producing smaller, faster, and more accurate models that
are also faster to fine-tune while offering new insights into transformer
interpretability.

TL;DR: SeeDNorm introduces dynamically adjustable scaling coefficients based on input norms, enhancing representational capability for normalization layers in neural networks, outperforming existing layers like RMSNorm and LayerNorm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of RMSNorm in handling diverse input data and distributional shifts, especially for large language models in zero-shot conditions.

Method: Proposes SeeDNorm, preserving input norm information and enabling dynamic, self-rescaled normalization through learnable, input-dependent scaling coefficients.

Result: SeeDNorm improves training stability and outperforms RMSNorm, LayerNorm, and alternatives like DyT across various tasks and model sizes.

Conclusion: SeeDNorm enhances performance without significantly impacting efficiency, presenting a robust solution for normalization in neural networks.

Abstract: Normalization layer constitutes an essential component in neural networks. In
transformers, the predominantly used RMSNorm constrains vectors to a unit
hypersphere, followed by dimension-wise rescaling through a learnable scaling
coefficient $\gamma$ to maintain the representational capacity of the model.
However, RMSNorm discards the input norm information in forward pass and a
static scaling factor $\gamma$ may be insufficient to accommodate the wide
variability of input data and distributional shifts, thereby limiting further
performance improvements, particularly in zero-shot scenarios that large
language models routinely encounter. To address this limitation, we propose
SeeDNorm, which enhances the representational capability of the model by
dynamically adjusting the scaling coefficient based on the current input,
thereby preserving the input norm information and enabling data-dependent,
self-rescaled dynamic normalization. During backpropagation, SeeDNorm retains
the ability of RMSNorm to dynamically adjust gradient according to the input
norm. We provide a detailed analysis of the training optimization for SeedNorm
and proposed corresponding solutions to address potential instability issues
that may arise when applying SeeDNorm. We validate the effectiveness of
SeeDNorm across models of varying sizes in large language model pre-training as
well as supervised and unsupervised computer vision tasks. By introducing a
minimal number of parameters and with neglligible impact on model efficiency,
SeeDNorm achieves consistently superior performance compared to previously
commonly used normalization layers such as RMSNorm and LayerNorm, as well as
element-wise activation alternatives to normalization layers like DyT.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitation of graph-based recommender systems in transductive settings which hinder generalization to new users, items, or datasets.

Method: Developed NBF-Rec to dynamically compute node embeddings at inference time, allowing inductive transfer learning and avoiding domain-specific retraining.

Result: NBF-Rec demonstrated competitive zero-shot performance and improvements with fine-tuning across diverse real-world datasets.

Conclusion: Inductive transfer learning is feasible in graph-based recommendation, and interaction-based message passing enables generalization without requiring alignment of users or items.

Abstract: Graph-based recommender systems are commonly trained in transductive
settings, which limits their applicability to new users, items, or datasets. We
propose NBF-Rec, a graph-based recommendation model that supports inductive
transfer learning across datasets with disjoint user and item sets. Unlike
conventional embedding-based methods that require retraining for each domain,
NBF-Rec computes node embeddings dynamically at inference time. We evaluate the
method on seven real-world datasets spanning movies, music, e-commerce, and
location check-ins. NBF-Rec achieves competitive performance in zero-shot
settings, where no target domain data is used for training, and demonstrates
further improvements through lightweight fine-tuning. These results show that
inductive transfer is feasible in graph-based recommendation and that
interaction-level message passing supports generalization across datasets
without requiring aligned users or items.

*Jingyuan Liu,Hao Qiu,Lin Yang,Mengfan Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper investigates distributed multi-agent multi-armed bandit problems over random communication graphs and proposes a fully distributed algorithm, achieving a regret bound of order $\log T$, with theoretical analysis and numerical validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges in minimizing cumulative regret in distributed multi-agent environments with heterogeneous rewards and dynamic random communication structures.

Method: The paper introduces a distributed algorithm combining arm elimination strategies with the random gossip algorithm, and analyzes its regret bounds considering communication graph properties.

Result: The regret upper bound is $\log T$, incorporating both centralized optimal regret and additional terms highlighting the impact of communication graph connectivity and link probabilities. Numerical experiments confirm the theoretical findings.

Conclusion: The proposed algorithm achieves theoretical regret scaling and significantly outperforms existing benchmarks, demonstrating its efficiency in addressing communication-regret trade-offs in multi-agent systems.

Abstract: We study the distributed multi-agent multi-armed bandit problem with
heterogeneous rewards over random communication graphs. Uniquely, at each time
step $t$ agents communicate over a time-varying random graph $G_t$ generated by
applying the Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi model to a fixed connected base graph $G$ (for
classical Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graphs, $G$ is a complete graph), where each
potential edge in $G$ is randomly and independently present with the link
probability $p$. Notably, the resulting random graph is not necessarily
connected at each time step. Each agent's arm rewards follow time-invariant
distributions, and the reward distribution for the same arm may differ across
agents. The goal is to minimize the cumulative expected regret relative to the
global mean reward of each arm, defined as the average of that arm's mean
rewards across all agents. To this end, we propose a fully distributed
algorithm that integrates the arm elimination strategy with the random gossip
algorithm. We theoretically show that the regret upper bound is of order $\log
T$ and is highly interpretable, where $T$ is the time horizon. It includes the
optimal centralized regret $O\left(\sum_{k: \Delta_k>0} \frac{\log
T}{\Delta_k}\right)$ and an additional term $O\left(\frac{N^2 \log T}{p
\lambda_{N-1}(Lap(G))} + \frac{KN^2 \log T}{p}\right)$ where $N$ and $K$ denote
the total number of agents and arms, respectively. This term reflects the
impact of $G$'s algebraic connectivity $\lambda_{N-1}(Lap(G))$ and the link
probability $p$, and thus highlights a fundamental trade-off between
communication efficiency and regret. As a by-product, we show a nearly optimal
regret lower bound. Finally, our numerical experiments not only show the
superiority of our algorithm over existing benchmarks, but also validate the
theoretical regret scaling with problem complexity.

### [492] [Air Quality Prediction Using LOESS-ARIMA and Multi-Scale CNN-BiLSTM with Residual-Gated Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22818)
*Soham Pahari,Sandeep Chand Kumain*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study introduces a hybrid framework for accurate short-term AQI forecasting in Indian megacities, using a combination of statistical modeling, deep learning, and advanced optimization techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the challenge of accurately forecasting AQI in Indian megacities, where air pollution demonstrates linear trends, seasonal changes, and abrupt nonlinear patterns. Accurate predictions are critical for timely interventions to improve public health.

Method: The proposed method utilizes LOESS decomposition to divide AQI data into trend, seasonal, and residual components. ARIMA models smooth components, while a CNN-BiLSTM network with a residual-gated attention mechanism captures nonlinear volatility. The Unified Adaptive Multi-Stage Metaheuristic Optimizer (UAMMO) tunes hyperparameters for better model efficiency.

Result: Based on AQI datasets from 2021 to 2023, the proposed framework achieved 5-8% lower MSE and R^2 scores above 0.94 for pollutants like PM2.5, O3, CO, and NOx in Delhi, Kolkata, and Mumbai, outperforming existing models.

Conclusion: The framework is validated as robust and effective for urban AQI forecasting, offering improved sensitivity to sudden pollution events and potential for enhanced air quality management in megacities.

Abstract: Air pollution remains a critical environmental and public health concern in
Indian megacities such as Delhi, Kolkata, and Mumbai, where sudden spikes in
pollutant levels challenge timely intervention. Accurate Air Quality Index
(AQI) forecasting is difficult due to the coexistence of linear trends,
seasonal variations, and volatile nonlinear patterns. This paper proposes a
hybrid forecasting framework that integrates LOESS decomposition, ARIMA
modeling, and a multi-scale CNN-BiLSTM network with a residual-gated attention
mechanism. The LOESS step separates the AQI series into trend, seasonal, and
residual components, with ARIMA modeling the smooth components and the proposed
deep learning module capturing multi-scale volatility in the residuals. Model
hyperparameters are tuned via the Unified Adaptive Multi-Stage Metaheuristic
Optimizer (UAMMO), combining multiple optimization strategies for efficient
convergence. Experiments on 2021-2023 AQI datasets from the Central Pollution
Control Board show that the proposed method consistently outperforms
statistical, deep learning, and hybrid baselines across PM2.5, O3, CO, and NOx
in three major cities, achieving up to 5-8% lower MSE and higher R^2 scores
(>0.94) for all pollutants. These results demonstrate the framework's
robustness, sensitivity to sudden pollution events, and applicability to urban
air quality management.

### [493] [Last Iterate Analyses of FTRL in Stochasitc Bandits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22819)
*Jingxin Zhan,Yuze Han,Zhihua Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper studies last-iterate convergence in multi-armed bandits, focusing on the commonly used Follow-the-Regularized-Leader (FTRL) algorithms, and proves a theoretical convergence rate of $t^{-1/2}$.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap in existing research that emphasizes order of regret over last-iterate convergence rates in multi-armed bandits, especially for the widely employed FTRL algorithms.

Method: The paper conducts a theoretical analysis using Bregman divergence, specifically for the $1/2$-Tsallis-INF FTRL algorithm, to evaluate the convergence rate of probability distributions over arm sets toward the optimal arm.

Result: It demonstrates that the Bregman divergence between the optimal arm's distribution and the algorithm's output at iteration t converges at a rate of $t^{-1/2}$.

Conclusion: A partial confirmation is provided for the intuition that logarithmic regret corresponds to $t^{-1}$ last-iterate convergence rate, offering insights into last-iterate theoretical guarantees in FTRL algorithms.

Abstract: The convergence analysis of online learning algorithms is central to machine
learning theory, where last-iterate convergence is particularly important, as
it captures the learner's actual decisions and describes the evolution of the
learning process over time. However, in multi-armed bandits, most existing
algorithmic analyses mainly focus on the order of regret, while the
last-iterate (simple regret) convergence rate remains less explored --
especially for the widely studied Follow-the-Regularized-Leader (FTRL)
algorithms. Recently, a growing line of work has established the
Best-of-Both-Worlds (BOBW) property of FTRL algorithms in bandit problems,
showing in particular that they achieve logarithmic regret in stochastic
bandits. Nevertheless, their last-iterate convergence rate has not yet been
studied. Intuitively, logarithmic regret should correspond to a $t^{-1}$
last-iterate convergence rate. This paper partially confirms this intuition
through theoretical analysis, showing that the Bregman divergence, defined by
the regular function $\Psi(p)=-4\sum_{i=1}^{d}\sqrt{p_i}$ associated with the
BOBW FTRL algorithm $1/2$-Tsallis-INF (arXiv:1807.07623), between the point
mass on the optimal arm and the probability distribution over the arm set
obtained at iteration $t$, decays at a rate of $t^{-1/2}$.

### [494] [Logical GANs: Adversarial Learning through Ehrenfeucht Fraisse Games](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22824)
*Mirco A. Mannucci*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LOGAN proposes a framework for logic-bounded GANs with interpretable failures, improved property satisfaction, and a compact, reproducible toolkit.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GANs currently aim for indistinguishability, but lack logical depth and structured methods to handle interpretable failures effectively.

Method: LOGAN introduces a bounded discriminator using logical depth and implements simulated EF-probes, MSO-style checkers, and neural GAN training experiments.

Result: The framework achieves high property satisfaction (92%-98%) in simulation and real GAN training improves challenging properties by 5%-14% with 98% connectivity satisfaction.

Conclusion: LOGAN demonstrates a practical and effective approach for logic-guided generative models, providing a reproducible framework with adjustable depth control and proven results.

Abstract: GANs promise indistinguishability, logic explains it. We put the two on a
budget: a discriminator that can only ``see'' up to a logical depth $k$, and a
generator that must look correct to that bounded observer. \textbf{LOGAN}
(LOGical GANs) casts the discriminator as a depth-$k$ Ehrenfeucht--Fra\"iss\'e
(EF) \emph{Opponent} that searches for small, legible faults (odd cycles,
nonplanar crossings, directed bridges), while the generator plays
\emph{Builder}, producing samples that admit a $k$-round matching to a target
theory $T$. We ship a minimal toolkit -- an EF-probe simulator and MSO-style
graph checkers -- and four experiments including real neural GAN training with
PyTorch. Beyond verification, we score samples with a \emph{logical loss} that
mixes budgeted EF round-resilience with cheap certificate terms, enabling a
practical curriculum on depth. Framework validation demonstrates $92\%$--$98\%$
property satisfaction via simulation (Exp.~3), while real neural GAN training
achieves $5\%$--$14\%$ improvements on challenging properties and $98\%$
satisfaction on connectivity (matching simulation) through adversarial learning
(Exp.~4). LOGAN is a compact, reproducible path toward logic-bounded generation
with interpretable failures, proven effectiveness (both simulated and real
training), and dials for control.

*Marianne Arriola,Yair Schiff,Hao Phung,Aaron Gokaslan,Volodymyr Kuleshov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents Efficient Encoder-Decoder Diffusion (E2D2), enabling faster and computationally efficient discrete diffusion-based token generation, improving quality and speed for tasks like summarization, translation, and reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce the high computational cost associated with discrete diffusion models using decoder-only architectures by optimizing token sampling and introducing an encoder-decoder framework.

Method: The authors developed an encoder-decoder diffusion architecture with specialized training and sampling algorithms, where the encoder handles clean token representation while a lightweight decoder refines noised sequences.

Result: E2D2 achieves better trade-offs between generation quality and inference speed, demonstrating advancements in summarization, translation, and mathematical reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: By employing an encoder-decoder structure for discrete diffusion models, E2D2 proves to be more efficient, providing faster inference and improved model performance. All resources are made publicly available.

Abstract: Discrete diffusion models enable parallel token sampling for faster inference
than autoregressive approaches. However, prior diffusion models use a
decoder-only architecture, which requires sampling algorithms that invoke the
full network at every denoising step and incur high computational cost. Our key
insight is that discrete diffusion models perform two types of computation: 1)
representing clean tokens and 2) denoising corrupted tokens, which enables us
to use separate modules for each task. We propose an encoder-decoder
architecture to accelerate discrete diffusion inference, which relies on an
encoder to represent clean tokens and a lightweight decoder to iteratively
refine a noised sequence. We also show that this architecture enables faster
training of block diffusion models, which partition sequences into blocks for
better quality and are commonly used in diffusion language model inference. We
introduce a framework for Efficient Encoder-Decoder Diffusion (E2D2),
consisting of an architecture with specialized training and sampling
algorithms, and we show that E2D2 achieves superior trade-offs between
generation quality and inference throughput on summarization, translation, and
mathematical reasoning tasks. We provide the code, model weights, and blog post

*Jie Zhao,Kang Hao Cheong*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: This paper proposes using image-based encoding to preserve graph topology and employs multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to enhance evolutionary algorithms for graph optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional encoding schemes fail to effectively represent the structural properties of graphs, limiting their ability to perform structure-aware optimization.

Method: The authors use image-based encoding, graph sparsification, cooperative evolutionary optimization, and ensemble strategies to enhance robustness and performance in graph optimization.

Result: Experiments conducted on real-world networks show improvements in solution quality and reliability when using the proposed approach.

Conclusion: The study effectively combines MLLMs and innovative strategies, presenting an enhanced method for structure-aware evolutionary optimization over graph data.

Abstract: Evolutionary algorithms (EAs) have proven effective in exploring the vast
solution spaces typical of graph-structured combinatorial problems. However,
traditional encoding schemes, such as binary or numerical representations,
often fail to straightforwardly capture the intricate structural properties of
networks. Through employing the image-based encoding to preserve topological
context, this study utilizes multimodal large language models (MLLMs) as
evolutionary operators to facilitate structure-aware optimization over graph
data. To address the visual clutter inherent in large-scale network
visualizations, we leverage graph sparsification techniques to simplify
structures while maintaining essential structural features. To further improve
robustness and mitigate bias from different sparsification views, we propose a
cooperative evolutionary optimization framework that facilitates cross-domain
knowledge transfer and unifies multiple sparsified variants of diverse
structures. Additionally, recognizing the sensitivity of MLLMs to network
layout, we introduce an ensemble strategy that aggregates outputs from various
layout configurations through consensus voting. Finally, experiments on
real-world networks through various tasks demonstrate that our approach
improves both the quality and reliability of solutions in MLLM-driven
evolutionary optimization.

### [498] [Enabling Robust In-Context Memory and Rapid Task Adaptation in Transformers with Hebbian and Gradient-Based Plasticity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21908)
*Siddharth Chaudhary*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: This paper explores enhancing Transformer models with biologically inspired plasticity mechanisms to improve their task-specific adaptation and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformers rely on static weights during inference, whereas biological systems adapt dynamically via synaptic plasticity. The paper investigates whether incorporating explicit plasticity can enhance in-sequence adaptation.

Method: The authors augment decoder-only Transformers with fast-weight modules using a neuromodulated Hebbian rule and gradient-based plasticity mechanisms, and evaluate their performance on copying, regression, and few-shot classification tasks (CIFAR-FS, Omniglot).

Result: Hebbian plasticity consistently demonstrates lower loss and better generalization in few-shot tasks, while gradient-based plasticity excels in long-horizon credit assignments. A boundary condition is established where plasticity is most beneficial.

Conclusion: Explicit plasticity enables rapid, task-specific adaptation in Transformer models and complements attention mechanisms. Different plasticity mechanisms perform best under specific conditions, enhancing adaptability.

Abstract: Large language models display in-context learning as an emergent effect of
scale, but they rely on static weights during inference. In contrast,
biological systems continually adapt via synaptic plasticity. We investigate
whether explicit, biologically inspired plasticity can endow Transformers with
faster in-sequence adaptation. To this end, we augment decoder-only
Transformers with fast-weight modules updated either by (i) a neuromodulated
Hebbian rule or (ii) the gradient-based plasticity mechanism of Duan et al.
(2023). Across copying, regression, and few-shot classification tasks
(CIFAR-FS, Omniglot), Hebbian plasticity consistently achieves lower loss and
stronger few-shot generalization, while gradient-based updates perform best on
long-horizon credit assignment. When associations are short and linearly
separable, static weights suffice, defining a clear boundary condition for when
plasticity helps. Analysis of learned modulatory signals reveals that
gradient-based rules maintain large, persistent updates, whereas Hebbian
plasticity is sharply gated around salient events. Together, these results show
that explicit plasticity complements attention by enabling rapid, task-specific
adaptation, and clarify when different plasticity mechanisms are most
effective.

TL;DR: The paper investigates the alignment of AI models with human neural representations of color qualia using fMRI data and representational similarity analysis, revealing a divergence between artificial and biological systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the relationship between AI model representations and human subjective experience, advancing the development of more neurally plausible AI systems.

Method: The authors use fMRI data with a 'no-report' paradigm to compare the representational geometry of color qualia between vision models and human brain activity via Representational Similarity Analysis under two conditions: pure perception and task-modulated perception.

Result: (1) State-of-the-art AI models align better with neural representations of pure perception. (2) The impact of training paradigms, like Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training, varies by model architecture, improving some and hurting others. (3) A new benchmark task for color qualia exhibits divergence in inductive biases of biological versus artificial vision systems.

Conclusion: The study enhances cognitive neuroscience and AI alignment by highlighting gaps in the neural plausibility of vision models and providing a new benchmark task.

Abstract: Probing the computational underpinnings of subjective experience, or qualia,
remains a central challenge in cognitive neuroscience. This project tackles
this question by performing a rigorous comparison of the representational
geometry of color qualia between state-of-the-art AI models and the human
brain. Using a unique fMRI dataset with a "no-report" paradigm, we use
Representational Similarity Analysis (RSA) to compare diverse vision models
against neural activity under two conditions: pure perception ("no-report") and
task-modulated perception ("report"). Our analysis yields three principal
findings. First, nearly all models align better with neural representations of
pure perception, suggesting that the cognitive processes involved in task
execution are not captured by current feedforward architectures. Second, our
analysis reveals a critical interaction between training paradigm and
architecture, challenging the simple assumption that Contrastive Language-Image
Pre-training(CLIP) training universally improves neural plausibility. In our
direct comparison, this multi-modal training method enhanced brain-alignment
for a vision transformer(ViT), yet had the opposite effect on a ConvNet. Our
work contributes a new benchmark task for color qualia to the field, packaged
in a Brain-Score compatible format. This benchmark reveals a fundamental
divergence in the inductive biases of artificial and biological vision systems,
offering clear guidance for developing more neurally plausible models.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a hybrid framework combining Graph Neural Networks (GNN) with Genetic Algorithms (GA) for efficient structural parameter optimization, drastically reducing computational costs compared to conventional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the computational inefficiency of conventional methods like FEM and CFD in iterative optimization of structural parameters.

Method: A GNN is trained on SDOF system response datasets (generated via Newmark Beta method) for rapid prediction of dynamic displacement responses. This is combined with a GA optimizer for global parameter search.

Result: The proposed framework achieves strong convergence, generalization, and reduces computational costs while maintaining robust optimization results.

Conclusion: Integrating machine learning (GNN) with evolutionary algorithms (GA) is effective for intelligent structural design, offering high efficiency and reduced reliance on expensive simulations.

Abstract: The optimization of structural parameters, such as mass(m), stiffness(k), and
damping coefficient(c), is critical for designing efficient, resilient, and
stable structures. Conventional numerical approaches, including Finite Element
Method (FEM) and Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations, provide
high-fidelity results but are computationally expensive for iterative
optimization tasks, as each evaluation requires solving the governing equations
for every parameter combination. This study proposes a hybrid data-driven
framework that integrates a Graph Neural Network (GNN) surrogate model with a
Genetic Algorithm (GA) optimizer to overcome these challenges. The GNN is
trained to accurately learn the nonlinear mapping between structural parameters
and dynamic displacement responses, enabling rapid predictions without
repeatedly solving the system equations. A dataset of single-degree-of-freedom
(SDOF) system responses is generated using the Newmark Beta method across
diverse mass, stiffness, and damping configurations. The GA then searches for
globally optimal parameter sets by minimizing predicted displacements and
enhancing dynamic stability. Results demonstrate that the GNN and GA framework
achieves strong convergence, robust generalization, and significantly reduced
computational cost compared to conventional simulations. This approach
highlights the effectiveness of combining machine learning surrogates with
evolutionary optimization for automated and intelligent structural design.

*Qiuyang Chen,Huiqi Yang,Qingyan Meng,Zhengyu Ma*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework for converting Artificial Neural Networks to Spiking Neural Networks with single-timestep inference, significantly reducing latency and computational costs, achieving state-of-the-art results on various tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current ANN-to-SNN conversion methods rely on large timesteps, causing high inference latency and computational costs. Addressing this limitation in resource-constrained settings is critical.

Method: Temporal-to-Spatial Equivalence Theory was developed to replace multi-timestep integrate-and-fire neurons with single-timestep multi-threshold neurons. The Scale-and-Fire Neuron (SFN) and SFN-based Spiking Transformer (SFormer) were devised to optimize single-timestep spiking and reduce hardware overhead.

Result: Experimental results on tasks such as image classification and object detection demonstrate state-of-the-art accuracy using single-timestep SNN inference, achieving 88.8% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K.

Conclusion: The proposed methodology effectively reduces inference latency and computational costs while enhancing SNN performance, particularly in resource-limited scenarios.

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are gaining attention as energy-efficient
alternatives to Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), especially in
resource-constrained settings. While ANN-to-SNN conversion (ANN2SNN) achieves
high accuracy without end-to-end SNN training, existing methods rely on large
time steps, leading to high inference latency and computational cost. In this
paper, we propose a theoretical and practical framework for single-timestep
ANN2SNN. We establish the Temporal-to-Spatial Equivalence Theory, proving that
multi-timestep integrate-and-fire (IF) neurons can be equivalently replaced by
single-timestep multi-threshold neurons (MTN). Based on this theory, we
introduce the Scale-and-Fire Neuron (SFN), which enables effective
single-timestep ($T=1$) spiking through adaptive scaling and firing.
Furthermore, we develop the SFN-based Spiking Transformer (SFormer), a
specialized instantiation of SFN within Transformer architectures, where spike
patterns are aligned with attention distributions to mitigate the
computational, energy, and hardware overhead of the multi-threshold design.
Extensive experiments on image classification, object detection, and instance
segmentation demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance
under single-timestep inference. Notably, we achieve 88.8% top-1 accuracy on
ImageNet-1K at $T=1$, surpassing existing conversion methods.

*Yi Lu,Xiaoming Xue,Kai Zhang,Liming Zhang,Guodong Chen,Chenming Cao,Piyang Liu,Kay Chen Tan*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: This paper introduces a Bayesian approach to improve surrogate-assisted optimization for handling multiple expensive optimization problems (EOPs) by addressing the cold-start issue and enhancing knowledge transfer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiencies in surrogate-assisted evolutionary optimization for expensive optimization problems, particularly focusing on improving cold-start performance and avoiding negative transfer.

Method: A Bayesian competitive knowledge transfer (BCKT) method is proposed, leveraging both prior beliefs and empirical evidence to accurately assess knowledge transferability and adaptively use promising solutions.

Result: Empirical validation shows the effectiveness of the BCKT method in enhancing various surrogate-assisted search algorithms for multi-task and many-task optimization problems. Comparative studies and real-world applications demonstrate its superiority.

Conclusion: The Bayesian competitive approach enables more efficient and adaptive optimization, mitigating issues like negative transfer and enhancing the performance of surrogate-assisted optimization techniques in complex scenarios.

Abstract: Expensive optimization problems (EOPs) present significant challenges for
traditional evolutionary optimization due to their limited evaluation calls.
Although surrogate-assisted search (SAS) has become a popular paradigm for
addressing EOPs, it still suffers from the cold-start issue. In response to
this challenge, knowledge transfer has been gaining popularity for its ability
to leverage search experience from potentially related instances, ultimately
facilitating head-start optimization for more efficient decision-making.
However, the curse of negative transfer persists when applying knowledge
transfer to EOPs, primarily due to the inherent limitations of existing methods
in assessing knowledge transferability. On the one hand, a priori
transferability assessment criteria are intrinsically inaccurate due to their
imprecise understandings. On the other hand, a posteriori methods often
necessitate sufficient observations to make correct inferences, rendering them
inefficient when applied to EOPs. Considering the above, this paper introduces
a Bayesian competitive knowledge transfer (BCKT) method developed to improve
multi-task SAS (MSAS) when addressing multiple EOPs simultaneously.
Specifically, the transferability of knowledge is estimated from a Bayesian
perspective that accommodates both prior beliefs and empirical evidence,
enabling accurate competition between inner-task and inter-task solutions,
ultimately leading to the adaptive use of promising solutions while effectively
suppressing inferior ones. The effectiveness of our method in boosting various
SAS algorithms for both multi-task and many-task problems is empirically
validated, complemented by comparative studies that demonstrate its superiority
over peer algorithms and its applicability to real-world scenarios. The source
code of our method is available at https://github.com/XmingHsueh/MSAS-BCKT.

Motivation: The paper aims to bridge the performance gap between processors and memory in modern computing, addressing the shortcomings of traditional prefetching methods that rely on predefined heuristics or simplified models.

Method: The proposed framework includes modular components: route mapper (extracts structural information), graph constructor (creates graph representations), walk session generator (simulates user behavior), and GNN prefetch module (handles training and prediction).

Result: The study demonstrates that GNN-based approaches can model intricate dependencies in data access patterns more effectively than conventional methods, highlighting their potential in optimizing graph-driven systems.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that leveraging GNNs for caching and prefetching offers a superior, replicable pipeline for addressing complex, non-linear data dependencies, providing theoretical and practical advancements in system optimization.

Abstract: Caching and prefetching techniques are fundamental to modern computing,
serving to bridge the growing performance gap between processors and memory.
Traditional prefetching strategies are often limited by their reliance on
predefined heuristics or simplified statistical models, which fail to capture
the complex, non-linear dependencies in modern data access patterns. This paper
introduces a modular framework leveraging Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to model

navigation and hierarchical file systems. The toolchain consists of: a route
mapper for extracting structural information, a graph constructor for creating
graph representations, a walk session generator for simulating user behaviors,
and a gnn prefetch module for training and inference. We provide a detailed
conceptual analysis showing how GNN-based approaches can outperform
conventional methods by learning intricate dependencies. This work offers both
theoretical foundations and a practical, replicable pipeline for future

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: The paper explores the integration of linearity, effects, and exceptions in programming languages by introducing a monad model and applying it to resource-safe calculi.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in safely combining linearity, effects, and exceptions in programming languages while ensuring resource safety.

Method: The authors introduced an allocation monad to model resource-safety properties and analyzed two linear calculi: one with allocation effects and another with exceptions and destructors.

Result: The study established resource-safety for both calculi and demonstrated how destructors and move operations help manage resources safely in the presence of effects and exceptions.

Conclusion: The paper provides a comprehensive framework for integrating exceptions and effects within linear programming models, ensuring resource safety.

Abstract: We analyse the problem of combining linearity, effects, and exceptions, in
abstract models of programming languages, as the issue of providing some kind
of strength for a monad $T(- \oplus E)$ in a linear setting. We consider in
particular for $T$ the allocation monad, which we introduce to model and study
resource-safety properties. We apply these results to a series of two linear
effectful calculi for which we establish their resource-safety properties.
  The first calculus is a linear call-by-push-value language with two
allocation effects $\mathit{new}$ and $\mathit{delete}$. The resource-safety
properties follow from the linear (and even ordered) character of the typing
rules.
  We then explain how to integrate exceptions on top of linearity and effects
by adjoining default destruction actions to types, as inspired by C++/Rust
destructors. We see destructors as objects $\delta : A\rightarrow TI$ in the
slice category over $TI$. This construction gives rise to a second calculus, an
affine ordered call-by-push-value language with exceptions and destructors, in
which the weakening rule performs a side-effect. As in C++/Rust, a ``move''
operation is necessary to allow random-order release of resources, as opposed
to last-in-first-out order. Moving resources is modelled as an exchange rule
that performs a side-effect.

*Xumin Gao,Mark Stevens,Grzegorz Cielniak*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The study introduces a robotic stirring method with trajectory optimization and adaptive speed control to improve pest counting in water traps, addressing the issue of pest occlusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to overcome limitations in current pest monitoring techniques, particularly image-based methods, which struggle with pest occlusion.

Method: A robotic arm was developed to stir pests in water traps using six different trajectories, optimized based on counting errors and confidence across scenarios. Adaptive-speed stirring control adjusts speed based on counting confidence.

Result: Experimental findings confirm that the proposed method enhances pest counting accuracy while addressing occlusion issues in monitoring.

Conclusion: The study establishes that trajectory optimization and adaptive-speed control for stirring significantly improve pest counting in water traps, and introduces advancements for dynamic liquid environments.

Abstract: Accurate monitoring of pest population dynamics is crucial for informed
decision-making in precision agriculture. Currently, mainstream image-based
pest counting methods primarily rely on image processing combined with machine
learning or deep learning for pest counting. However, these methods have
limitations and struggle to handle situations involving pest occlusion. To
address this issue, this paper proposed a robotic stirring method with
trajectory optimization and adaptive speed control for accurate pest counting
in water traps. First, we developed an automated stirring system for pest
counting in yellow water traps based on a robotic arm. Stirring alters the
distribution of pests in the yellow water trap, making some of the occluded
individuals visible for detection and counting. Then, we investigated the
impact of different stirring trajectories on pest counting performance and
selected the optimal trajectory for pest counting. Specifically, we designed
six representative stirring trajectories, including circle, square, triangle,
spiral, four small circles, and random lines, for the robotic arm to stir. And
by comparing the overall average counting error and counting confidence of
different stirring trajectories across various pest density scenarios, we
determined the optimal trajectory. Finally, we proposed a counting
confidence-driven closed-loop control system to achieve adaptive-speed

*Giovanni Battista Regazzo,Wim-Alexander Beckers,Xuan Thao Ha,Mouloud Ourak,Johan Vlekken,Emmanuel Vander Poorten*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Real-time sensing during robot-assisted left atrial appendage closure (LAAC) minimizes stress on surrounding anatomy using force-displacement profiling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Left atrial appendage closure (LAAC) addresses the increased risk of thromboembolic events in atrial fibrillation patients, but current deployment methods face precision and radiation limitations.

Method: A force-sensing catheter delivery sheath with fiber Bragg gratings (FBGs) embedded and electromagnetic tracking measured interaction forces and catheter positioning during robot-assisted LAAC within a phantom.

Result: The force profiles showed minimal mechanical stress on the anatomy during occluder deployment, demonstrating improved procedural feedback and deployment outcomes.

Conclusion: The novel sensing and profiling method enhances intraoperative feedback during LAAC, potentially reducing reliance on radiation and increasing deployment precision.

Abstract: Atrial fibrillation (AF) increases the risk of thromboembolic events due to
impaired function of the left atrial appendage (LAA). Left atrial appendage
closure (LAAC) is a minimally invasive intervention designed to reduce stroke
risk by sealing the LAA with an expandable occluder device. Current deployment
relies on manual catheter control and imaging modalities like fluoroscopy and
transesophageal echocardiography, which carry limitations including radiation
exposure and limited positioning precision. In this study, we leverage a
previously developed force-sensing delivery sheath integrating fiber Bragg
gratings (FBGs) at the interface between the catheter and the occluder.
Combined with electromagnetic (EM) tracking, this setup enables real-time
measurement of interaction forces and catheter tip position during
robot-assisted LAAC deployment in an anatomical phantom. We present a novel
force-displacement profiling method that characterizes occluder deployment
dynamics and identifies key procedural steps without relying on ionizing
radiation. The force profiles reveal low-magnitude interaction forces,
suggesting minimal mechanical stress on the surrounding anatomy. This approach
shows promise in providing clinicians with enhanced intraoperative feedback,
improving deployment outcome. Future work will focus on automating deployment
steps classification and validating the sensing strategy in dynamic, realistic
environments.

*Yuhui Liu,Shian Wang,Ansel Panicker,Kate Embry,Ayana Asanova,Tianyi Li*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Development and validation of a Phase-Aware AI car-following model specifically for electric vehicles to address their distinct dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing microscopic models fail to accurately describe the unique car-following dynamics of EVs, necessitating a new analytical approach due to the increasing prevalence of EVs in traffic.

Method: A Phase-Aware AI model was developed by combining physics-based frameworks with AI components that adapt to distinct EV driving phases (e.g., acceleration and regenerative braking).

Result: Simulations using real-world trajectory data showed significant improvements in prediction accuracy of EV behavior compared to traditional car-following models.

Conclusion: The Phase-Aware AI model is an effective tool for representing the unique dynamics of EVs in traffic simulations, filling a gap in existing analytical frameworks.

Abstract: Internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles and electric vehicles (EVs) exhibit
distinct vehicle dynamics. EVs provide rapid acceleration, with electric motors
producing peak power across a wider speed range, and achieve swift deceleration
through regenerative braking. While existing microscopic models effectively
capture the driving behavior of ICE vehicles, a modeling framework that
accurately describes the unique car-following dynamics of EVs is lacking.
Developing such a model is essential given the increasing presence of EVs in
traffic, yet creating an easy-to-use and accurate analytical model remains
challenging.
  To address these gaps, this study develops and validates a Phase-Aware AI
(PAAI) car-following model specifically for EVs. The proposed model enhances
traditional physics-based frameworks with an AI component that recognizes and
adapts to different driving phases, such as rapid acceleration and regenerative
braking. Using real-world trajectory data from vehicles equipped with adaptive
cruise control (ACC), we conduct comprehensive simulations to validate the
model's performance. The numerical results demonstrate that the PAAI model
significantly improves prediction accuracy over traditional car-following
models, providing an effective tool for accurately representing EV behavior in
traffic simulations.

*Yuhui Liu,Samannita Halder,Shian Wang,Tianyi Li*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel ACC control framework for automated vehicles using LSTM networks and physics-informed constraints, emphasizing interactions with human-driven vehicles and traffic flow dynamics to improve system efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AV control strategies neglect the interactions with human-driven vehicles and broader traffic flow, leading to congestion and reduced efficiency. This paper aims to address this gap.

Method: The framework utilizes a neural network-based approach with social value orientation (SVO) integrated into utility functions to balance AVs' objectives with traffic flow considerations.

Result: Numerical results show improved traffic dynamics, including individual energy consumption reduction by at least 58.99% and individual average speed improvement of at least 38.39%.

Conclusion: The proposed socially compliant AV control framework enhances traffic system-wide efficiency, promotes adaptive behaviors, and reduces congestion and energy consumption.

Abstract: This study introduces a novel control framework for adaptive cruise control
(ACC) in automated driving, leveraging Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks
and physics-informed constraints. As automated vehicles (AVs) adopt advanced
features like ACC, transportation systems are becoming increasingly intelligent
and efficient. However, existing AV control strategies primarily focus on
optimizing the performance of individual vehicles or platoons, often neglecting
their interactions with human-driven vehicles (HVs) and the broader impact on
traffic flow. This oversight can exacerbate congestion and reduce overall
system efficiency. To address this critical research gap, we propose a neural
network-based, socially compliant AV control framework that incorporates social
value orientation (SVO). This framework enables AVs to account for their
influence on HVs and traffic dynamics. By leveraging AVs as mobile traffic
regulators, the proposed approach promotes adaptive driving behaviors that
reduce congestion, improve traffic efficiency, and lower energy consumption.
Within this framework, we define utility functions for both AVs and HVs, which
are optimized based on the SVO of each AV to balance its own control objectives
with broader traffic flow considerations. Numerical results demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed method in adapting to varying traffic conditions,
thereby enhancing system-wide efficiency. Specifically, when the AV's control
mode shifts from prioritizing energy consumption to optimizing traffic flow
efficiency, vehicles in the following platoon experience at least a 58.99%
increase in individual energy consumption alongside at least a 38.39%
improvement in individual average speed, indicating significant enhancements in
traffic dynamics.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Next-Generation LLM for UAV (NeLV) system, emphasizing LLMs' integration into varied-scale UAV operations including multi-UAV patrol, multi-POI delivery, multi-hop relocation, and outlines a five-level automation taxonomy for future applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of current UAV research confined to small-scale applications and isolated functionalities, advocating for a comprehensive system for real-world scenarios and larger UAV platforms.

Method: The NeLV system integrates LLMs into UAV operations using components such as natural language instruction parsing, route planning, path generation, control implementation, and monitoring. Three use cases demonstrate its applicability.

Result: The system is shown feasible for multi-UAV patrol, multi-POI deliveries, and multi-hop relocation, while a five-level automation taxonomy is introduced for future advancements.

Conclusion: The paper provides a roadmap for advancing UAV autonomy using LLMs, and highlights challenges and requirements for achieving a fully autonomous system for UAV operations.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs), their
capabilities in various automation domains, particularly Unmanned Aerial
Vehicle (UAV) operations, have garnered increasing attention. Current research
remains predominantly constrained to small-scale UAV applications, with most
studies focusing on isolated components such as path planning for toy drones,
while lacking comprehensive investigation of medium- and long-range UAV systems
in real-world operational contexts. Larger UAV platforms introduce distinct
challenges, including stringent requirements for airport-based take-off and
landing procedures, adherence to complex regulatory frameworks, and specialized
operational capabilities with elevated mission expectations. This position
paper presents the Next-Generation LLM for UAV (NeLV) system -- a comprehensive
demonstration and automation roadmap for integrating LLMs into multi-scale UAV
operations. The NeLV system processes natural language instructions to
orchestrate short-, medium-, and long-range UAV missions through five key
technical components: (i) LLM-as-Parser for instruction interpretation, (ii)
Route Planner for Points of Interest (POI) determination, (iii) Path Planner
for waypoint generation, (iv) Control Platform for executable trajectory
implementation, and (v) UAV monitoring. We demonstrate the system's feasibility
through three representative use cases spanning different operational scales:
multi-UAV patrol, multi-POI delivery, and multi-hop relocation. Beyond the
current implementation, we establish a five-level automation taxonomy that
charts the evolution from current LLM-as-Parser capabilities (Level 1) to fully
autonomous LLM-as-Autopilot systems (Level 5), identifying technical
prerequisites and research challenges at each stage.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: FORGE-Tree improves long-horizon robot manipulation by addressing trajectory drift and exposure bias using stage-aligned diffusion and Monte Carlo Tree refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome challenges in long-horizon robot manipulation tasks, including drift and exposure bias, which degrade performance in Vision-Language-Action (VLA) policies.

Method: Introduce FORGE-Tree: a control layer combining Diffusion Forcing (DF) and Monte Carlo Tree Diffusion (MCTD) for efficient trajectory refinement through local edits and scene-aware priors.

Result: FORGE-Tree raises success rates by 13.4–17.2 pp over standard VLA baselines, with improvements maintained across long-horizon variants.

Conclusion: FORGE-Tree is a scalable and effective method for improving long-horizon robot manipulation tasks by coupling precise refinement strategies with search-based denoising.

Abstract: Long-horizon robot manipulation tasks remain challenging for
Vision-Language-Action (VLA) policies due to drift and exposure bias, often
denoise the entire trajectory with fixed hyperparameters, causing small
geometric errors to compound across stages and offering no mechanism to
allocate extra test-time compute where clearances are tight. To address these
challenges, we introduce FORGE-Tree, a plug-in control layer that couples a
stage-aligned Diffusion Forcing (DF) head with test-time Monte Carlo Tree
Diffusion (MCTD). With a frozen VLA encoder, DF aligns timesteps to subtask
stages; during inference we partially denoise only a target segment while
keeping other tokens frozen, turning trajectory refinement into a sequence of
local edits. We then apply Monte Carlo Tree Diffusion to select the next
segment to refine. A scene graph supplies priors for expansion and geometry
relation-aware scoring for rollouts, yielding tree-structured denoising whose
performance scales with search budget while preserving the executed prefix.
Evaluation on LIBERO, FORGE-Tree improves success rate by 13.4 to 17.2 pp over
the native VLA baselines with both OpenVLA and Octo-Base. Gains remain
consistent under comparable compute budgets, especially on long-horizon
variants. Videos available at: https://taco-group.github.io/FORGE-Tree/

TL;DR: The paper introduces Avi, a 3D Vision-Language-Action model for robotic action generation using spatial reasoning over 3D point clouds instead of low-level policy learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in 2D vision-language-action models in robotics, such as vulnerability to occlusions and camera variations, and inefficiencies in opaque policy learning.

Method: Avi uses 3D point clouds and language-grounded scene understanding to perform classical geometric transformations rather than relying on end-to-end training of task-specific action policies.

Result: Initial results demonstrate robust, scalable action decision-making in robotics, showing resilience to occlusions, camera pose changes, and viewpoint variations.

Conclusion: Avi establishes a promising framework for structured 3D reasoning in robotics, bypassing opaque policy learning to better align language instructions with actuation behaviors.

Abstract: We propose Avi, a novel 3D Vision-Language-Action (VLA) architecture that
reframes robotic action generation as a problem of 3D perception and spatial
reasoning, rather than low-level policy learning. While existing VLA models
primarily operate on 2D visual inputs and are trained end-to-end on
task-specific action policies, Avi leverages 3D point clouds and
language-grounded scene understanding to compute actions through classical
geometric transformations. Most notably, Avi does not train on previous action
tokens, rather, we build upon a 3D Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM) to
generate the next point cloud and explicitly calculate the actions through
classical transformations. This approach enables generalizable behaviors that
are robust to occlusions, camera pose variations, and changes in viewpoint. By
treating the robotic decision-making process as a structured reasoning task
over 3D representations, Avi bridges the gap between high-level language
instructions and low-level actuation without requiring opaque policy learning.
Our preliminary results highlight the potential of 3D vision-language reasoning
as a foundation for scalable, robust robotic systems. Check it out at

within a unified Mixed-Integer Quadratic Programming (MIQP) framework. By
leveraging Model Predictive Control (MPC), we develop trajectories that
optimize both the traversal of speed bumps and overall passenger comfort. A key
contribution of this work is the formulation of speed bump handling constraints
that closely emulate human driving behavior, seamlessly integrating these with
broader road navigation requirements. Through extensive simulations in varied
urban driving environments, we demonstrate the efficacy of our approach,
highlighting its ability to ensure smooth speed transitions over speed bumps
while maintaining computational efficiency suitable for real-time deployment.

constraints, alongside expert human driving, represents a significant step
forward in trajectory planning for urban

Result: Evaluation reveals substantial performance improvement in multimodal perception tasks with detailed object attributes, alongside the identification of differences between proprietary and open-source VLMs.

Conclusion: Rich, detailed attribute annotations are crucial for advancing robot perception capabilities in dynamic environments.

Abstract: We introduce J-ORA, a novel multimodal dataset that bridges the gap in robot
perception by providing detailed object attribute annotations within Japanese
human-robot dialogue scenarios. J-ORA is designed to support three critical
perception tasks, object identification, reference resolution, and next-action
prediction, by leveraging a comprehensive template of attributes (e.g.,
category, color, shape, size, material, and spatial relations). Extensive
evaluations with both proprietary and open-source Vision Language Models (VLMs)
reveal that incorporating detailed object attributes substantially improves
multimodal perception performance compared to without object attributes.
Despite the improvement, we find that there still exists a gap between
proprietary and open-source VLMs. In addition, our analysis of object
affordances demonstrates varying abilities in understanding object
functionality and contextual relationships across different VLMs. These
findings underscore the importance of rich, context-sensitive attribute

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the impending global shortage of human caregivers anticipated by 2050, aiming to provide an accessible and affordable robotic solution for assistive tasks.

Method: The system integrates imitation learning from demonstration videos, PACT for temporal reasoning and task segmentation, and TE for refining trajectory accuracy and smoothness. It utilizes six servo motors, dual cameras, and 3D-printed grippers.

Result: Through real-world testing and evaluation, the robotic arm achieved over 90% task accuracy and demonstrated significant performance improvements compared to baselines, with PACT enabling substantial model size reduction.

Conclusion: The study provides a promising robotic solution contributing to the automation of assistive care, along with clear advancements in accuracy, efficiency, and affordability.

Abstract: By 2050, the global demand for assistive care is expected to reach 3.5
billion people, far outpacing the availability of human caregivers. Existing
robotic solutions remain expensive and require technical expertise, limiting
accessibility. This work introduces a low-cost robotic arm for assistive tasks
such as feeding, cleaning spills, and fetching medicine. The system uses
imitation learning from demonstration videos, requiring no task-specific
programming or manual labeling. The robot consists of six servo motors, dual
cameras, and 3D-printed grippers. Data collection via teleoperation with a
leader arm yielded 50,000 video frames across the three tasks. A novel Phased
Action Chunking Transformer (PACT) captures temporal dependencies and segments
motion dynamics, while a Temporal Ensemble (TE) method refines trajectories to
improve accuracy and smoothness. Evaluated across five model sizes and four
architectures, with ten hours of real-world testing, the system achieved over
90% task accuracy, up to 40% higher than baselines. PACT enabled a 5x model
size reduction while maintaining 75% accuracy. Saliency analysis showed
reliance on key visual cues, and phase token gradients peaked at critical
trajectory moments, indicating effective temporal reasoning. Future work will

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Legged robots require efficient and reliable QP solvers for modules such as inverse dynamics, Model Predictive Control, and Whole-Body Control under computational and energy constraints.

Method: Four main types of QP algorithms (interior-point methods, active-set strategies, operator splitting schemes, augmented Lagrangian approaches) were studied, tested against benchmarks to evaluate speed, accuracy, constraint handling, and robustness.

Result: The study highlights the trade-offs between solver speed, accuracy, and energy consumption, providing insights into task-specific solver choices such as sparse IPMs for MPC and dense active-set methods for high-frequency WBC.

Conclusion: The research offers guidance for selecting QP solvers, emphasizing alignment between solver features, task requirements, and hardware constraints to enable agile legged robotic systems.

Abstract: Quadratic programming (QP) underpins real-time robotics by enabling
efficient, constrained optimization in state estimation, motion planning, and
control. In legged locomotion and manipulation, essential modules like inverse
dynamics, Model Predictive Control (MPC), and Whole-Body Control (WBC) are
inherently QP-based, demanding reliable solutions amid tight timing, energy,
and computational limits on embedded platforms. This paper presents a
comprehensive analysis and benchmarking study of cutting-edge QP solvers for
legged robotics. We begin by formulating the standard convex QP and classify
solvers into four principal algorithmic approaches, including interior-point
methods, active-set strategies, operator splitting schemes, and augmented
Lagrangian approaches. Each solver is examined in terms of algorithmic
structure, computational characteristics, and its ability to exploit problem
structure and warm-starting. Performance is evaluated using publicly available
benchmarks, focusing on metrics such as computation time, constraint
satisfaction, and robustness under perturbations. Feature tables and
comparisons yield practical guidance for solver selection, underscoring
trade-offs in speed, accuracy, and energy efficiency. Our findings emphasize
the synergy between solver, task, and hardware, sparse IPMs for long-horizon
MPC, and dense active-set for high frequency WBC to advance agile, autonomous
legged systems, with emerging extensions to nonconvex and distributed QP.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Vision-Language-Action models lack real-time interruption handling and concurrent interaction features, leading to rigid and unresponsive user experiences.

Method: VITA-E employs a dual-model architecture with 'Active Model' and 'Standby Model' for multitasking. It also includes a 'model-as-controller' paradigm, linking model reasoning with system behavior.

Result: Experiments on a humanoid platform showed VITA-E's effectiveness in handling speech interruptions, emergency stops, and simultaneous speech-action execution.

Conclusion: VITA-E enhances the natural and dynamic capabilities of embodied assistants, advancing seamless collaboration and multitasking abilities.

Abstract: Current Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models are often constrained by a rigid,
static interaction paradigm, which lacks the ability to see, hear, speak, and
act concurrently as well as handle real-time user interruptions dynamically.
This hinders seamless embodied collaboration, resulting in an inflexible and
unresponsive user experience. To address these limitations, we introduce
VITA-E, a novel embodied interaction framework designed for both behavioral
concurrency and nearly real-time interruption. The core of our approach is a
dual-model architecture where two parallel VLA instances operate as an ``Active
Model'' and a ``Standby Model'', allowing the embodied agent to observe its
environment, listen to user speech, provide verbal responses, and execute
actions, all concurrently and interruptibly, mimicking human-like multitasking
capabilities. We further propose a ``model-as-controller'' paradigm, where we
fine-tune the VLM to generate special tokens that serve as direct system-level
commands, coupling the model's reasoning with the system's behavior.
Experiments conducted on a physical humanoid platform demonstrate that VITA-E
can reliably handle complex interactive scenarios. Our framework is compatible
with various dual-system VLA models, achieving an extremely high success rate
on emergency stops and speech interruptions while also successfully performing
concurrent speech and action. This represents a significant step towards more
natural and capable embodied assistants.

TL;DR: This paper reviews calibration techniques for Stewart-Gough platforms, focusing on inverse kinematics approaches to enhance their accuracy for critical applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Stewart-Gough platforms offer precise, repeatable movement control for critical applications such as space research or medical fields. Accurate calibration is vital for meeting application-specific accuracy requirements.

Method: The study evaluated various calibration techniques, including the use of external instruments, constrained system motions, and additional sensors for self-calibration, primarily using inverse kinematics.

Result: Researchers identified key methodologies for calibration and observed that errors mainly arise from kinematic, structural, and occasionally environmental factors. Calibration was mainly conducted under no-load conditions.

Conclusion: The paper highlights the importance of improving calibration accuracy and reviews current techniques, considering various error sources for Stewart-Gough platforms.

Abstract: Researchers have studied Stewart-Gough platforms, also known as Gough-Stewart
platforms or hexapod platforms extensively for their inherent fine control
characteristics. Their studies led to the potential deployment opportunities of
Stewart-Gough Platforms in many critical applications such as the medical
field, engineering machines, space research, electronic chip manufacturing,
automobile manufacturing, etc. Some of these applications need micro and
nano-level movement control in 3D space for the motions to be precise,
complicated, and repeatable; a Stewart-Gough platform fulfills these challenges
smartly. For this, the platform must be more accurate than the specified
application accuracy level and thus proper calibration for a parallel robot is
crucial. Forward kinematics-based calibration for these hexapod machines
becomes unnecessarily complex and inverse kinematics complete this task with
much ease. To experiment with different calibration techniques, various
calibration approaches were implemented by using external instruments,
constraining one or more motions of the system, and using extra sensors for
auto or self-calibration. This survey paid attention to those key
methodologies, their outcome, and important details related to inverse
kinematic-based parallel robot calibrations. It was observed during this study
that the researchers focused on improving the accuracy of the platform position
and orientation considering the errors contributed by one source or multiple
sources. The error sources considered are mainly kinematic and structural, in
some cases, environmental factors also are reviewed, however, those
calibrations are done under no-load conditions. This study aims to review the
present state of the art in this field and highlight the processes and errors
considered for the calibration of Stewart-Gough platforms.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate and enhance the practical intelligence of LLM-controlled robots in navigating complex physical world scenarios.

Method: Using Butter-Bench, an isolated assessment focusing on LLM capabilities in robotic systems without relying on VLA models.

Result: Humans scored 95% on Butter-Bench, while the best LLMs achieved only 40%. Fine-tuning had no significant effect.

Conclusion: Current LLMs lack practical intelligence in complex tasks like spatial planning and social understanding, needing further advancements.

Abstract: We present Butter-Bench, a benchmark evaluating large language model (LLM)
controlled robots for practical intelligence, defined as the ability to
navigate the messiness of the physical world. Current state-of-the-art robotic
systems use a hierarchical architecture with LLMs in charge of high-level
reasoning, and a Vision Language Action (VLA) model for low-level control.
Butter-Bench evaluates the LLM part in isolation from the VLA. Although LLMs
have repeatedly surpassed humans in evaluations requiring analytical
intelligence, we find humans still outperform LLMs on Butter-Bench. The best
LLMs score 40% on Butter-Bench, while the mean human score is 95%. LLMs
struggled the most with multi-step spatial planning and social understanding.
We also evaluate LLMs that are fine-tuned for embodied reasoning and conclude
that this training does not improve their score on Butter-Bench.

Method: A PINN framework is developed, embedding UAV dynamics, wind disturbances, and obstacle avoidance. It learns feasible trajectories through minimizing physical residuals and risk-aware objectives without requiring supervised data.

Result: The approach outperformed traditional methods (A* and Kino-RRT*) in terms of energy efficiency, path smoothness, and safety margins while retaining comparable flight efficiency.

Conclusion: The findings demonstrate the capability of physics-informed learning to integrate model-based and data-driven approaches for UAV trajectory planning, offering scalability and physical consistency.

Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) operating in dynamic wind fields must
generate safe and energy-efficient trajectories under physical and
environmental constraints. Traditional planners, such as A* and kinodynamic
RRT*, often yield suboptimal or non-smooth paths due to discretization and
sampling limitations. This paper presents a physics-informed neural network
(PINN) framework that embeds UAV dynamics, wind disturbances, and obstacle
avoidance directly into the learning process. Without requiring supervised
data, the PINN learns dynamically feasible and collision-free trajectories by
minimizing physical residuals and risk-aware objectives. Comparative
simulations show that the proposed method outperforms A* and Kino-RRT* in
control energy, smoothness, and safety margin, while maintaining similar flight
efficiency. The results highlight the potential of physics-informed learning to
unify model-based and data-driven planning, providing a scalable and physically
consistent framework for UAV trajectory optimization.

### [521] [Two-Steps Diffusion Policy for Robotic Manipulation via Genetic Denoising](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21991)
*Mateo Clemente,Leo Brunswic,Rui Heng Yang,Xuan Zhao,Yasser Khalil,Haoyu Lei,Amir Rasouli,Yinchuan Li*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper improves diffusion models for robotic manipulation by adapting inference strategies and introducing genetic denoising, resulting in enhanced performance with fewer neural function evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models are effective for robotic manipulation when imitating expert demonstrations, but their inference strategies are not optimized for low-dimensional, structured control tasks.

Method: The paper tailors the denoising process for embodied AI tasks and introduces a population-based sampling strategy called genetic denoising to enhance performance and stability.

Result: The method achieves up to 20% performance improvement, solving tasks effectively with only 2 neural function evaluations across 14 robotic manipulation benchmarks.

Conclusion: By adapting diffusion models to embodied AI tasks and leveraging genetic denoising, the approach significantly improves performance and efficiency in robotic manipulation.

Abstract: Diffusion models, such as diffusion policy, have achieved state-of-the-art
results in robotic manipulation by imitating expert demonstrations. While
diffusion models were originally developed for vision tasks like image and
video generation, many of their inference strategies have been directly
transferred to control domains without adaptation. In this work, we show that
by tailoring the denoising process to the specific characteristics of embodied
AI tasks -- particularly structured, low-dimensional nature of action
distributions -- diffusion policies can operate effectively with as few as 5
neural function evaluations (NFE).
  Building on this insight, we propose a population-based sampling strategy,
genetic denoising, which enhances both performance and stability by selecting
denoising trajectories with low out-of-distribution risk. Our method solves
challenging tasks with only 2 NFE while improving or matching performance. We
evaluate our approach across 14 robotic manipulation tasks from D4RL and
Robomimic, spanning multiple action horizons and inference budgets. In over 2
million evaluations, our method consistently outperforms standard
diffusion-based policies, achieving up to 20\% performance gains with
significantly fewer inference steps.

*Harsha Karunanayaka,Siavash Rezazadeh*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper investigates how feedforward stabilization through stride frequency adjustments affects bipedal system stability, with analysis on model parameters' role.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how inherent system parameters like mass, stiffness, and leg dimensions influence bipedal frontal plane stability and reduce energy/control effort during locomotion.

Method: The study analyzes the relationship between individual model parameters (e.g., mass, hip width, leg length) and natural frequency to predict the minimum stride frequency required for stability.

Result: A method was developed to predict minimum stride frequencies. Findings were validated against actual values for randomly generated models, revealing insights into stability mechanisms.

Conclusion: Feedforward stabilization effectively reduces control effort and enhances stability in bipedal systems, offering improved understanding of locomotion mechanisms.

Abstract: Stability of bipedal systems in frontal plane is affected by the hip offset,
to the extent that adjusting stride time using feedforward retraction and
extension of the legs can lead to stable oscillations without feedback control.
This feedforward stabilization can be leveraged to reduce the control effort
and energy expenditure and increase the locomotion robustness. However, there
is limited understanding of how key parameters, such as mass, stiffness, leg
length, and hip width, affect stability and the minimum stride frequency needed
to maintain it. This study aims to address these gaps through analyzing how
individual model parameters and the system's natural frequency influence the
minimum stride frequency required to maintain a stable cycle. We propose a
method to predict the minimum stride frequency, and compare the predicted
stride frequencies with actual values for randomly generated models. The
findings of this work provide a better understanding of the frontal plane
stability mechanisms and how feedforward stabilization can be leveraged to
reduce the control effort.

TL;DR: This paper explores a gaze-guided robotic manipulation system using a Mixed Reality (MR) headset for individuals with mobility impairments; achieving greater intuitiveness, accuracy, and accessibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Joystick-based robotic interfaces for object manipulation are challenging and unintuitive for those with mobility impairments due to high precision requirements and restrictive designs.

Method: The authors propose an egocentric interface using a MR headset for gaze-guided robot control, leveraging natural gaze fixation, augmented reality cues, a pretrained vision model, and robotic arm for object manipulation.

Result: The system improved manipulation accuracy, reduced latency, and achieved over 88% single-pass intent and object recognition accuracy in real-world scenarios.

Conclusion: The approach significantly improves accessibility and interaction intuitiveness, making it a valuable contribution to assistive robotics.

Abstract: Robotic manipulators are increasingly used to assist individuals with
mobility impairments in object retrieval. However, the predominant
joystick-based control interfaces can be challenging due to high precision
requirements and unintuitive reference frames. Recent advances in human-robot
interaction have explored alternative modalities, yet many solutions still rely
on external screens or restrictive control schemes, limiting their
intuitiveness and accessibility. To address these challenges, we present an
egocentric, gaze-guided robotic manipulation interface that leverages a
wearable Mixed Reality (MR) headset. Our system enables users to interact
seamlessly with real-world objects using natural gaze fixation from a
first-person perspective, while providing augmented visual cues to confirm
intent and leveraging a pretrained vision model and robotic arm for intent
recognition and object manipulation. Experimental results demonstrate that our
approach significantly improves manipulation accuracy, reduces system latency,
and achieves single-pass intention and object recognition accuracy greater than
88% across multiple real-world scenarios. These results demonstrate the
system's effectiveness in enhancing intuitiveness and accessibility,
underscoring its practical significance for assistive robotics applications.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing UUV attitude control methods face challenges like lack of generalizability, robustness to disturbances, and efficient deployment.

Method: Developed EasyUUV, a framework combining parallelized RL, a hybrid control architecture (learned policy and adaptive controller), and LLMs for dynamic parameter tuning.

Result: Validated through simulations and real-world experiments, demonstrating robustness and adaptability in diverse underwater scenarios.

Conclusion: EasyUUV effectively addresses UUV control limitations with innovative frameworks and proves versatile across various underwater conditions.

Abstract: Despite recent advances in Unmanned Underwater Vehicle (UUV) attitude
control, existing methods still struggle with generalizability, robustness to
real-world disturbances, and efficient deployment. To address the above
challenges, this paper presents EasyUUV, a Large Language Model (LLM)-enhanced,
universal, and lightweight simulation-to-reality reinforcement learning (RL)
framework for robust attitude control of UUVs. EasyUUV combines parallelized RL
training with a hybrid control architecture, where a learned policy outputs
high-level attitude corrections executed by an adaptive S-Surface controller. A
multimodal LLM is further integrated to adaptively tune controller parameters
at runtime using visual and textual feedback, enabling training-free adaptation
to unmodeled dynamics. Also, we have developed a low-cost 6-DoF UUV platform
and applied an RL policy trained through efficient parallelized simulation.
Extensive simulation and real-world experiments validate the effectiveness and

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide individuals with lower-limb disabilities a consistent and reliable mobility solution using self-balancing exoskeletons that adapt to dynamic environmental changes.

Method: Developed LT-Exosense, a multi-session mapping system that incrementally fuses spatial data, detects changes, updates global maps, and enables adaptive path planning.

Result: Real-world experiments show LT-Exosense creates scalable multi-session maps, achieving point-to-point error below 5 cm, and supports adaptive path planning in changing indoor environments.

Conclusion: LT-Exosense offers a robust solution for long-term exoskeleton navigation by combining vision-based mapping and intelligent planning for dynamic and persistent environment adaptation.

Abstract: Self-balancing exoskeletons offer a promising mobility solution for
individuals with lower-limb disabilities. For reliable long-term operation,
these exoskeletons require a perception system that is effective in changing
environments. In this work, we introduce LT-Exosense, a vision-centric,
multi-session mapping system designed to support long-term (semi)-autonomous
navigation for exoskeleton users. LT-Exosense extends single-session mapping
capabilities by incrementally fusing spatial knowledge across multiple
sessions, detecting environmental changes, and updating a persistent global
map. This representation enables intelligent path planning, which can adapt to
newly observed obstacles and can recover previous routes when obstructions are
removed. We validate LT-Exosense through several real-world experiments,
demonstrating a scalable multi-session map that achieves an average
point-to-point error below 5 cm when compared to ground-truth laser scans. We
also illustrate the potential application of adaptive path planning in
dynamically changing indoor environments.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces Action Coherence Guidance (ACG), a test-time algorithm to enhance the precision of Vision-Language-Action (VLA) robot models by improving action coherence and addressing noise-related issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The high generative capacity of VLA models causes sensitivity to noise, such as jerks or pauses, in human demonstrations, leading to instability and failure during deployment, especially in fine-grained tasks requiring precision.

Method: ACG is a training-free, test-time guidance algorithm designed to refine VLA model execution by enhancing action coherence.

Result: ACG showed consistent improvements in action coherence and increased success rates across multiple robot manipulation tasks (RoboCasa, DexMimicGen, and SO-101 experiments).

Conclusion: ACG improves the reliability and precision of robot actions, addressing deficiencies caused by noise in imitation learning, and demonstrates its efficacy across various manipulation tasks.

Abstract: Diffusion and flow matching models have emerged as powerful robot policies,
enabling Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models to generalize across diverse
scenes and instructions. Yet, when trained via imitation learning, their high
generative capacity makes them sensitive to noise in human demonstrations:
jerks, pauses, and jitter which reduce action coherence. Reduced action
coherence causes instability and trajectory drift during deployment, failures
that are catastrophic in fine-grained manipulation where precision is crucial.
In this paper, we present Action Coherence Guidance (ACG) for VLA models, a
training-free test-time guidance algorithm that improves action coherence and
thereby yields performance gains. Evaluated on RoboCasa, DexMimicGen, and
real-world SO-101 tasks, ACG consistently improves action coherence and boosts
success rates across diverse manipulation tasks. Code and project page are

*Weixian Qian,Sebastian Schroder,Yao Deng,Jiaohong Yao,Linfeng Liang,Xiao Cheng,Richard Han,Xi Zheng*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: NeuroSymLand combines symbolic reasoning with lightweight foundation models to improve autonomous UAV landing in unstructured environments, achieving enhanced accuracy, robustness, and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of vision-based and deep learning models in UAV autonomous landing, particularly under covariate shifts and poor interpretability.

Method: This framework integrates an offline symbolic knowledge synthesis pipeline using LLMs and human refinement with an online real-time reasoning pipeline using semantic segmentation and geometric computations.

Result: NeuroSymLand demonstrated higher accuracy, robustness to environmental variations, and better efficiency compared to state-of-the-art methods, validated through extensive testing on diverse simulation maps and real hardware.

Conclusion: By leveraging neuro-symbolic reasoning, NeuroSymLand offers improved UAV safety and reliability for critical missions like emergency response, surveillance, and delivery.

Abstract: Autonomous landing in unstructured (cluttered, uneven, and map-poor)
environments is a core requirement for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), yet
purely vision-based or deep learning models often falter under covariate shift
and provide limited interpretability. We propose NeuroSymLand, a neuro-symbolic
framework that tightly couples two complementary pipelines: (i) an offline
pipeline, where Large Language Models (LLMs) and human-in-the-loop refinement
synthesize Scallop code from diverse landing scenarios, distilling
generalizable and verifiable symbolic knowledge; and (ii) an online pipeline,
where a compact foundation-based semantic segmentation model generates
probabilistic Scallop facts that are composed into semantic scene graphs for
real-time deductive reasoning. This design combines the perceptual strengths of
lightweight foundation models with the interpretability and verifiability of
symbolic reasoning. Node attributes (e.g., flatness, area) and edge relations
(adjacency, containment, proximity) are computed with geometric routines rather
than learned, avoiding the data dependence and latency of train-time graph
builders. The resulting Scallop program encodes landing principles (avoid water
and obstacles; prefer large, flat, accessible regions) and yields calibrated
safety scores with ranked Regions of Interest (ROIs) and human-readable
justifications. Extensive evaluations across datasets, diverse simulation maps,
and real UAV hardware show that NeuroSymLand achieves higher accuracy, stronger
robustness to covariate shift, and superior efficiency compared with
state-of-the-art baselines, while advancing UAV safety and reliability in
emergency response, surveillance, and delivery missions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional Lidar-Inertial Odometry algorithms fail in dynamic environments due to their reliance on static-world assumptions. Accurate localization and dynamic feature identification are interdependent, creating a challenge.

Method: The paper integrates dynamic awareness into point cloud registration using spatio-temporal normal analysis and spatial consistency verification techniques.

Result: Experimental evaluations show significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art systems in dynamic, geometrically sparse environments.

Conclusion: The proposed approach enhances LIO in dynamic scenes, solving a fundamental challenge with practical applications. Code and dataset are made publicly available for validation.

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of Lidar-Inertial Odometry (LIO) in
dynamic environments, where conventional methods often fail due to their
static-world assumptions. Traditional LIO algorithms perform poorly when
dynamic objects dominate the scenes, particularly in geometrically sparse
environments. Current approaches to dynamic LIO face a fundamental challenge:
accurate localization requires a reliable identification of static features,
yet distinguishing dynamic objects necessitates precise pose estimation. Our
solution breaks this circular dependency by integrating dynamic awareness
directly into the point cloud registration process. We introduce a novel
dynamic-aware iterative closest point algorithm that leverages spatio-temporal
normal analysis, complemented by an efficient spatial consistency verification
method to enhance static map construction. Experimental evaluations demonstrate
significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art LIO systems in
challenging dynamic environments with limited geometric structure. The code and

Motivation: Enhancing humanoid robots' capability for fall recovery to improve safety, resilience, and autonomy in human-like workspaces.

Method: Joint optimization of control policy and physical morphology in humanoids, combining pretrained shared policies, human-inspired priors, and a priority buffer for efficient morphology updates.

Result: RoboCraft achieves a 44.55% average performance improvement across seven humanoid robots, with morphology optimization contributing at least 40% in four cases.

Conclusion: Humanoid co-design focusing on fall recovery significantly boosts robot performance and autonomy by efficiently integrating policy and morphology improvements.

Abstract: Humanoid robots represent a central frontier in embodied intelligence, as
their anthropomorphic form enables natural deployment in humans' workspace.
Brain-body co-design for humanoids presents a promising approach to realizing
this potential by jointly optimizing control policies and physical morphology.
Within this context, fall recovery emerges as a critical capability. It not
only enhances safety and resilience but also integrates naturally with
locomotion systems, thereby advancing the autonomy of humanoids. In this paper,
we propose RoboCraft, a scalable humanoid co-design framework for fall recovery
that iteratively improves performance through the coupled updates of control
policy and morphology. A shared policy pretrained across multiple designs is
progressively finetuned on high-performing morphologies, enabling efficient
adaptation without retraining from scratch. Concurrently, morphology search is
guided by human-inspired priors and optimization algorithms, supported by a
priority buffer that balances reevaluation of promising candidates with the
exploration of novel designs. Experiments show that \ourmethod{} achieves an
average performance gain of 44.55% on seven public humanoid robots, with
morphology optimization drives at least 40% of improvements in co-designing
four humanoid robots, underscoring the critical role of humanoid co-design.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods struggle with precise shape estimation of flexible continuum robots under varying load conditions.

Method: The paper employs a spatiotemporal neural network architecture combining tendon displacement data and RGB images, coupled with recurrent and encoding modules for temporal and spatial feature extraction, alongside a multi-modal fusion approach.

Result: Experimental results show mean shape estimation errors of 0.08 mm (unloaded) and 0.22 mm (loaded), surpassing existing methods.

Conclusion: By leveraging deep learning and multimodal data fusion, the study achieves precise 3D shape reconstructions of continuum robots under external loads, setting a new benchmark in the field.

Abstract: This paper presents a learning-based approach for accurately estimating the
3D shape of flexible continuum robots subjected to external loads. The proposed
method introduces a spatiotemporal neural network architecture that fuses
multi-modal inputs, including current and historical tendon displacement data
and RGB images, to generate point clouds representing the robot's deformed
configuration. The network integrates a recurrent neural module for temporal
feature extraction, an encoding module for spatial feature extraction, and a
multi-modal fusion module to combine spatial features extracted from visual
data with temporal dependencies from historical actuator inputs. Continuous 3D
shape reconstruction is achieved by fitting B\'ezier curves to the predicted
point clouds. Experimental validation demonstrates that our approach achieves
high precision, with mean shape estimation errors of 0.08 mm (unloaded) and
0.22 mm (loaded), outperforming state-of-the-art methods in shape sensing for
TDCRs. The results validate the efficacy of deep learning-based spatiotemporal

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces BLIP-FusePPO, a multimodal RL framework combining semantic embeddings, geometric states, LiDAR, and PID feedback to improve autonomous lane-keeping, ensuring robust policy learning and better driving adaptability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of this work is to enhance autonomous lane-keeping by integrating high-level semantic understanding from vision-language models with low-level control and spatial signals, aiming for situational awareness and robust, interpretable policy learning.

Method: The proposed BLIP-FusePPO architecture fuses semantic embeddings from vision-language models with geometric states, LiDAR data, and PID control feedback. It employs a hybrid reward function emphasizing semantic alignment, lane-keeping accuracy, obstacle avoidance, and speed regulation.

Result: Simulation evaluations demonstrate that BLIP-FusePPO outperforms existing vision-based and multimodal RL methods in lane-keeping stability and adaptability across challenging driving scenarios.

Conclusion: BLIP-FusePPO improves autonomous lane-keeping performance by seamlessly integrating semantic and geometric information into state representations, enabling robust, efficient, and generalizable policy learning. The code is made available for further research.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose Bootstrapped Language-Image Pretraining-driven
Fused State Representation in Proximal Policy Optimization (BLIP-FusePPO), a
novel multimodal reinforcement learning (RL) framework for autonomous
lane-keeping (LK), in which semantic embeddings generated by a vision-language
model (VLM) are directly fused with geometric states, LiDAR observations, and
Proportional-Integral-Derivative-based (PID) control feedback within the agent
observation space. The proposed method lets the agent learn driving rules that
are aware of their surroundings and easy to understand by combining high-level
scene understanding from the VLM with low-level control and spatial signals.
Our architecture brings together semantic, geometric, and control-aware
representations to make policy learning more robust. A hybrid reward function
that includes semantic alignment, LK accuracy, obstacle avoidance, and speed
regulation helps learning to be more efficient and generalizable. Our method is
different from the approaches that only use semantic models to shape rewards.
Instead, it directly embeds semantic features into the state representation.
This cuts down on expensive runtime inference and makes sure that semantic
guidance is always available. The simulation results show that the proposed
model is better at LK stability and adaptability than the best vision-based and
multimodal RL baselines in a wide range of difficult driving situations. We
make our code publicly available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-dimensional stochastic systems in robotics and autonomous vehicles face challenges such as the curse of dimensionality, lack of temporal abstraction, and inability to ensure stochastic stability.

Method: The MTLHRL framework uses hierarchical reinforcement learning with a high-level policy for strategic planning and a low-level policy for reactive control. Stability is ensured using Lyapunov functions optimized via Lagrangian relaxation and multi-timescale actor-critic updates.

Result: MTLHRL demonstrates superior performance and stability in simulations on hyperchaotic systems and robotic manipulators, achieving significantly lower error indices compared to baseline methods.

Conclusion: MTLHRL provides a robust and efficient solution for controlling complex stochastic systems, exhibiting theoretical validity and practical effectiveness in ensuring stability and improved performance.

Abstract: Controlling high-dimensional stochastic systems, critical in robotics,
autonomous vehicles, and hyperchaotic systems, faces the curse of
dimensionality, lacks temporal abstraction, and often fails to ensure
stochastic stability. To overcome these limitations, this study introduces the
Multi-Timescale Lyapunov-Constrained Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning
(MTLHRL) framework. MTLHRL integrates a hierarchical policy within a
semi-Markov Decision Process (SMDP), featuring a high-level policy for
strategic planning and a low-level policy for reactive control, which
effectively manages complex, multi-timescale decision-making and reduces
dimensionality overhead. Stability is rigorously enforced using a neural
Lyapunov function optimized via Lagrangian relaxation and multi-timescale
actor-critic updates, ensuring mean-square boundedness or asymptotic stability
in the face of stochastic dynamics. The framework promotes efficient and
reliable learning through trust-region constraints and decoupled optimization.
Extensive simulations on an 8D hyperchaotic system and a 5-DOF robotic
manipulator demonstrate MTLHRL's empirical superiority. It significantly
outperforms baseline methods in both stability and performance, recording the
lowest error indices (e.g., Integral Absolute Error (IAE): 3.912 in
hyperchaotic control and IAE: 1.623 in robotics), achieving faster convergence,
and exhibiting superior disturbance rejection. MTLHRL offers a theoretically
grounded and practically viable solution for robust control of complex
stochastic systems.

Motivation: The lack of a standard method to benchmark Social Robot Navigation hinders progress and creates contradicting conclusions within the field.

Method: The authors conducted a review of 85 relevant papers from IEEE Xplore, focusing exclusively on benchmarking practices, including metrics, algorithms, and human survey techniques.

Result: Key trends and practices in benchmarking Social Robot Navigation, including metrics, algorithms, and human survey methodologies, were identified.

Conclusion: Standardized benchmarks are needed to unify practices in Social Robot Navigation and to enhance consistency and progress in the field.

Abstract: Social Robot Navigation is the skill that allows robots to move efficiently

Unlike other areas of research, the scientific community has not yet achieved
an agreement on how Social Robot Navigation should be benchmarked. This is
notably important, as the lack of a de facto standard to benchmark Social Robot

exclusively on benchmarking trends in the period from January 2020 to July
2025. Of the 130 papers identified by our search using IEEE Xplore, we analysed
the 85 papers that met the criteria of the review. This review addresses the
metrics used in the literature for benchmarking purposes, the algorithms
employed in such benchmarks, the use of human surveys for benchmarking, and how
conclusions are drawn from the benchmarking results, when applicable.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a way to generate unique forward-kinematic solutions for Stewart platforms using inverse kinematics and a new iterative algorithm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the complexity and multiple solution generation problem in forward kinematics of Stewart platforms, making them directly usable without manual pose verification.

Method: An iterative algorithm employing a modified Denavit-Hartenberg convention to solve forward-kinematic solutions using valid workspace data and actuator lengths.

Result: The method successfully provides unique feasible forward-kinematic solutions without manual verification for each valid pose.

Conclusion: The approach enhances forward kinematics usability for practical applications like precision force control in materials testing systems.

Abstract: This paper presents a method to generate feasible, unique forward-kinematic
solutions for a general Stewart platform. This is done by using inverse
kinematics to obtain valid workspace data and corresponding actuator lengths
for the moving platform. For parallel kinematic machines, such as the Stewart
Platform, inverse kinematics are straight forward, but the forward kinematics
are complex and generates multiple solutions due to the closed loop structure
of the kinematic links. In this research, a simple iterative algorithm has been
used employing modified Denavit-Hartenberg convention. The outcome is
encouraging as this method generates a single feasible forward kinematic
solution for each valid pose with the solved DH parameters and unlike earlier
forward kinematics solutions, this unique solution does not need to be manually
verified. Therefore, the forward kinematic solutions can be used directly for
further calculations without the need for manual pose verification. This
capability is essential for the six degree of freedom materials testing system
developed by the authors in their laboratory. The developed system is aimed at
characterizing additively manufactured materials under complex combined
multiple loading conditions. The material characterization is done by enabling
high precision force control on the moving platform via in situ calibration of
the as-built kinematics of the Stewart Gough Platform.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This study evaluates how various factors (tip load, pressure, length, diameter, and fabrication methods) influence the steerability of vine robots used in complex environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of the paper is to address the challenges faced by vine robots in field applications, where their performance is limited by design choices, control strategies, and the weight of attached tools. This investigation aims to optimize the steerability of these robots for applications like urban search and rescue.

Method: The researchers conducted two sets of experiments: one focusing on tip load, chamber pressure, length, and diameter of self-supporting robots against gravity, and another exploring fabrication techniques and pressure ratios in robots supported on flat surfaces.

Result: The study found that steerability decreases with higher tip load, performs best at moderate chamber pressures, improves with increasing length, and is independent of diameter. External actuators allow curving at lower pressures, while integrated actuators achieve greater curvature at higher pressures.

Conclusion: Vine robots with optimized parameters based on the discovered principles demonstrate improved mobility, particularly in achieving upward and horizontal curvatures, compared to those with arbitrary configurations.

Abstract: Vine robots extend their tubular bodies by everting material from the tip,
enabling navigation in complex environments with a minimalist soft body.
Despite their promise for field applications, especially in the urban search
and rescue domain, performance is constrained by the weight of attached sensors
or tools, as well as other design and control choices. This work investigates
how tip load, pressure, length, diameter, and fabrication method shape vine
robot steerability--the ability to maneuver with controlled curvature--for
robots that steer with series pouch motor-style pneumatic actuators. We conduct
two groups of experiments: (1) studying tip load, chamber pressure, length, and
diameter in a robot supporting itself against gravity, and (2) studying
fabrication method and ratio of actuator to chamber pressure in a robot
supported on the ground. Results show that steerability decreases with
increasing tip load, is best at moderate chamber pressure, increases with
length, and is largely unaffected by diameter. Robots with actuators attached
on their exterior begin curving at low pressure ratios, but curvature saturates
at high pressure ratios; those with actuators integrated into the robot body
require higher pressure ratios to begin curving but achieve higher curvature
overall. We demonstrate that robots optimized with these principles outperform
those with ad hoc parameters in a mobility task that involves maximizing upward
and horizontal curvatures.

*Shenbagaraj Kannapiran,Elena Oikonomou,Albert Chu,Spring Berman,Theodore P. Pavlic*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The study introduces two decentralized controllers for robotic swarms inspired by army ants, aiming to maintain separation between tasks through emergent structures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inspired by how army ants balance competing demands by forming temporary structures, this research aims to create robotic swarm systems that can prevent task interference and optimize spatial separation.

Method: Two controllers were developed: (1) a finite-state machine (FSM)-based controller employing encounter-triggered transitions for stable walls; and (2) a DQN-enhanced controller combining FSM states with Deep Q-Networks for adaptive control.

Result: Both controllers successfully reduced subgroup mixing during concurrent tasks, with the DQN-enhanced controller achieving 40-50% reduction in mixing and faster convergence.

Conclusion: The proposed controllers demonstrate effective mechanisms for spatial separation in robotic swarms, with the DQN-enhanced model offering superior adaptability and performance.

Abstract: In natural systems, emergent structures often arise to balance competing
demands. Army ants, for example, form temporary "walls" that prevent
interference between foraging trails. Inspired by this behavior, we developed
two decentralized controllers for heterogeneous robotic swarms to maintain
spatial separation while executing concurrent tasks. The first is a
finite-state machine (FSM)-based controller that uses encounter-triggered
transitions to create rigid, stable walls. The second integrates FSM states
with a Deep Q-Network (DQN), dynamically optimizing separation through emergent
"demilitarized zones." In simulation, both controllers reduce mixing between
subgroups, with the DQN-enhanced controller improving adaptability and reducing
mixing by 40-50% while achieving faster convergence.

Result: CRUISE offers significantly improved racing speeds, maintains high success rates, and scales effectively with increased agent density compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: CRUISE provides a scalable and robust method for training in competitive, dynamic tasks, showcasing promise for real-world autonomous system deployment.

Abstract: The coordination of multiple autonomous agents in high-speed, competitive
environments represents a significant engineering challenge. This paper
presents CRUISE (Curriculum-Based Iterative Self-Play for Scalable Multi-Drone
Racing), a reinforcement learning framework designed to solve this challenge in
the demanding domain of multi-drone racing. CRUISE overcomes key scalability
limitations by synergistically combining a progressive difficulty curriculum
with an efficient self-play mechanism to foster robust competitive behaviors.
Validated in high-fidelity simulation with realistic quadrotor dynamics, the
resulting policies significantly outperform both a standard reinforcement
learning baseline and a state-of-the-art game-theoretic planner. CRUISE
achieves nearly double the planner's mean racing speed, maintains high success
rates, and demonstrates robust scalability as agent density increases. Ablation
studies confirm that the curriculum structure is the critical component for
this performance leap. By providing a scalable and effective training
methodology, CRUISE advances the development of autonomous systems for dynamic,

*Huilin Yin,Zhaolin Yang,Linchuan Zhang,Gerhard Rigoll,Johannes Betz*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces RoGER-SLAM, a robust SLAM framework designed to improve mapping and tracking performance under noisy and low-light conditions by integrating novel mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D Gaussian Splatting-based SLAM systems struggle with noise and low-light conditions, causing poor mapping and localization performance. The study aims to address this vulnerability while maintaining mapping fidelity.

Method: RoGER-SLAM employs three key innovations: 1) SP-RoFusion mechanism to integrate appearance, depth, and edge cues, 2) an adaptive tracking objective with residual balancing, and 3) a CLIP-based enhancement module for semantic and structural restoration under severe conditions.

Result: The proposed system improves trajectory accuracy and reconstruction quality in experiments conducted on Replica, TUM, and real-world datasets, especially in adverse conditions like noise and low light.

Conclusion: RoGER-SLAM enhances the robustness of 3D SLAM systems by addressing compounded degradations while ensuring high-fidelity mapping and localization.

Abstract: The reliability of Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) is severely
constrained in environments where visual inputs suffer from noise and low
illumination. Although recent 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) based SLAM
frameworks achieve high-fidelity mapping under clean conditions, they remain
vulnerable to compounded degradations that degrade mapping and tracking
performance. A key observation underlying our work is that the original 3DGS
rendering pipeline inherently behaves as an implicit low-pass filter,
attenuating high-frequency noise but also risking over-smoothing. Building on
this insight, we propose RoGER-SLAM, a robust 3DGS SLAM system tailored for
noise and low-light resilience. The framework integrates three innovations: a
Structure-Preserving Robust Fusion (SP-RoFusion) mechanism that couples
rendered appearance, depth, and edge cues; an adaptive tracking objective with
residual balancing regularization; and a Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining
(CLIP)-based enhancement module, selectively activated under compounded
degradations to restore semantic and structural fidelity. Comprehensive
experiments on Replica, TUM, and real-world sequences show that RoGER-SLAM
consistently improves trajectory accuracy and reconstruction quality compared
with other 3DGS-SLAM systems, especially under adverse imaging conditions.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper explores the deployment of Random-Set Neural Networks (RS-NNs) in autonomous vehicles for explicit uncertainty quantification, enhancing safety and robust performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the susceptibility of AV perception systems to errors caused by overly-confident predictions when encountering rare events or out-of-sample data.

Method: Random-Set Neural Networks (RS-NNs) were integrated into the AV software stack to quantify prediction uncertainty, tested in real-world scenarios, and compared against CNNs and Bayesian methods.

Result: RS-NNs outperformed traditional CNNs and Bayesian neural networks in accuracy and uncertainty calibration, improving safety and performance by dynamically adjusting vehicle speed based on confidence in predictions.

Conclusion: Uncertainty-aware neural networks, particularly RS-NNs, provide a practical approach for enhancing safety and robustness in autonomous driving by effectively managing predictive uncertainty.

Abstract: Autonomous Vehicle (AV) perception systems have advanced rapidly in recent
years, providing vehicles with the ability to accurately interpret their
environment. Perception systems remain susceptible to errors caused by
overly-confident predictions in the case of rare events or out-of-sample data.
This study equips an autonomous vehicle with the ability to 'know when it is
uncertain', using an uncertainty-aware image classifier as part of the AV
software stack. Specifically, the study exploits the ability of Random-Set
Neural Networks (RS-NNs) to explicitly quantify prediction uncertainty. Unlike
traditional CNNs or Bayesian methods, RS-NNs predict belief functions over sets
of classes, allowing the system to identify and signal uncertainty clearly in
novel or ambiguous scenarios. The system is tested in a real-world autonomous
racing vehicle software stack, with the RS-NN classifying the layout of the
road ahead and providing the associated uncertainty of the prediction.
Performance of the RS-NN under a range of road conditions is compared against
traditional CNN and Bayesian neural networks, with the RS-NN achieving
significantly higher accuracy and superior uncertainty calibration. This
integration of RS-NNs into Robot Operating System (ROS)-based vehicle control
pipeline demonstrates that predictive uncertainty can dynamically modulate
vehicle speed, maintaining high-speed performance under confident predictions
while proactively improving safety through speed reductions in uncertain
scenarios. These results demonstrate the potential of uncertainty-aware neural
networks - in particular RS-NNs - as a practical solution for safer and more
robust autonomous driving.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the growing demand for fully autonomous spacecraft capable of performing complex maneuvers, focusing on challenges like model uncertainties and evolving mission dynamics.

Method: Introduced a model-based RL algorithm DreamerV3, compared to PPO and TD3 baselines, trained on the Space Robotics Bench (SRB) for high-fidelity simulations of orbital tasks.

Result: Model-based RL offered superior trajectory fidelity, sample efficiency, and adaptability across varying spacecraft morphologies and mission goals.

Conclusion: Reinforcement learning can provide scalable, adaptable control solutions, proving promising for future autonomous space operations and inspections.

Abstract: The growing need for autonomous on-orbit services such as inspection,
maintenance, and situational awareness calls for intelligent spacecraft capable
of complex maneuvers around large orbital targets. Traditional control systems
often fall short in adaptability, especially under model uncertainties,
multi-spacecraft configurations, or dynamically evolving mission contexts. This
paper introduces RL-AVIST, a Reinforcement Learning framework for Autonomous
Visual Inspection of Space Targets. Leveraging the Space Robotics Bench (SRB),
we simulate high-fidelity 6-DOF spacecraft dynamics and train agents using
DreamerV3, a state-of-the-art model-based RL algorithm, with PPO and TD3 as
model-free baselines. Our investigation focuses on 3D proximity maneuvering
tasks around targets such as the Lunar Gateway and other space assets. We
evaluate task performance under two complementary regimes: generalized agents
trained on randomized velocity vectors, and specialized agents trained to
follow fixed trajectories emulating known inspection orbits. Furthermore, we
assess the robustness and generalization of policies across multiple spacecraft
morphologies and mission domains. Results demonstrate that model-based RL
offers promising capabilities in trajectory fidelity, and sample efficiency,
paving the way for scalable, retrainable control solutions for future space
operations

*Wentao Guo,Wenzeng Zhang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces pinch-lifting grippers with environment adaptability using two distinct SCAL finger designs (rotational and linear) that achieve reliable grasps across varied objects with minimal sensing/control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address challenges in grasping and lifting low-profile or challenging objects in diverse environments with minimal sensing and control.

Method: Design and implementation of two SCAL-based finger designs (SCAL-R and SCAL-L), coupled with experiments and quasi-static analysis for testing their effectiveness.

Result: Both finger designs demonstrated consistent grasping and lifting performance across multiple trials and object types through simple actuation mechanisms.

Conclusion: The study highlights the complementary adaptability of SCAL-R and SCAL-L designs, showcasing their potential for robust and practical grasping solutions in varied environments.

Abstract: This paper presents environment-adaptive pinch-lifting built on a
slot-constrained adaptive linkage (SCAL) and instantiated in two complementary
fingers: SCAL-R, a rotational-drive design with an active fingertip that folds
inward after contact to form an envelope, and SCAL-L, a linear-drive design
that passively opens on contact to span wide or weak-feature objects. Both
fingers convert surface following into an upward lifting branch while
maintaining fingertip orientation, enabling thin or low-profile targets to be
raised from supports with minimal sensing and control. Two-finger grippers are
fabricated via PLA-based 3D printing. Experiments evaluate (i)
contact-preserving sliding and pinch-lifting on tabletops, (ii) ramp
negotiation followed by lift, and (iii) handling of bulky objects via active
enveloping (SCAL-R) or contact-triggered passive opening (SCAL-L). Across
dozens of trials on small parts, boxes, jars, and tape rolls, both designs
achieve consistent grasps with limited tuning. A quasi-static analysis provides
closed-form fingertip-force models for linear parallel pinching and two-point
enveloping, offering geometry-aware guidance for design and operation. Overall,
the results indicate complementary operating regimes and a practical path to
robust, environment-adaptive grasping with simple actuation.

*Sai Krishna Ghanta,Ramviyas Parasuraman*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces a distributed pose-graph optimization (PGO) framework using Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) to improve accuracy in multi-robot simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) with scalable, outlier-robust solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Innovate a method for overcoming local minima issues in conventional PGO approaches and to improve the suboptimal estimates currently resulting in multi-agent SLAM.

Method: Authors cast distributed PGO as a partially observable Markov game and implemented a recurrent edge-conditioned Graph Neural Network with adaptive edge-gating for noise filtering, coupled with a hybrid policy for iterative pose refinement.

Result: Proposed MARL framework reduced the optimization objective by 37.5% compared to the state-of-the-art distributed PGO methods and accelerated inference efficiency by at least 6-fold.

Conclusion: This scalable approach significantly improves optimization and efficiency for multi-robot distributed SLAM systems, demonstrating reusable policies that adapt seamlessly to larger robot teams without additional training.

Abstract: We consider the distributed pose-graph optimization (PGO) problem, which is
fundamental in accurate trajectory estimation in multi-robot simultaneous
localization and mapping (SLAM). Conventional iterative approaches linearize a
highly non-convex optimization objective, requiring repeated solving of normal
equations, which often converge to local minima and thus produce suboptimal
estimates. We propose a scalable, outlier-robust distributed planar PGO
framework using Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL). We cast distributed
PGO as a partially observable Markov game defined on local pose-graphs, where
each action refines a single edge's pose estimate. A graph partitioner
decomposes the global pose graph, and each robot runs a recurrent
edge-conditioned Graph Neural Network (GNN) encoder with adaptive edge-gating
to denoise noisy edges. Robots sequentially refine poses through a hybrid
policy that utilizes prior action memory and graph embeddings. After local
graph correction, a consensus scheme reconciles inter-robot disagreements to
produce a globally consistent estimate. Our extensive evaluations on a
comprehensive suite of synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our
learned MARL-based actors reduce the global objective by an average of 37.5%
more than the state-of-the-art distributed PGO framework, while enhancing
inference efficiency by at least 6X. We also demonstrate that actor replication
allows a single learned policy to scale effortlessly to substantially larger
robot teams without any retraining. Code is publicly available at

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: TWC-SLAM enhances multi-agent cooperative SLAM in indoor environments using text semantics and WiFi signals for better location identification and loop closure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address inaccuracies in location identification and mapping in multi-agent SLAM systems caused by repetitive indoor structures.

Method: Develop TWC-SLAM framework combining FAST-LIO2 odometry, text semantics, WiFi features, and global mapping modules.

Result: TWC-SLAM improves location accuracy and mapping performance in challenging indoor environments with repetitive layouts.

Conclusion: Incorporating textual and WiFi features in SLAM systems effectively improves collaborative mapping in similar architectural setups.

Abstract: Multi-agent cooperative SLAM often encounters challenges in similar indoor
environments characterized by repetitive structures, such as corridors and
rooms. These challenges can lead to significant inaccuracies in shared location
identification when employing point cloud-based techniques. To mitigate these
issues, we introduce TWC-SLAM, a multi-agent cooperative SLAM framework that
integrates text semantics and WiFi signal features to enhance location
identification and loop closure detection. TWC-SLAM comprises a single-agent
front-end odometry module based on FAST-LIO2, a location identification and
loop closure detection module that leverages text semantics and WiFi features,
and a global mapping module. The agents are equipped with sensors capable of
capturing textual information and detecting WiFi signals. By correlating these
data sources, TWC-SLAM establishes a common location, facilitating point cloud
alignment across different agents' maps. Furthermore, the system employs loop
closure detection and optimization modules to achieve global optimization and
cohesive mapping. We evaluated our approach using an indoor dataset featuring
similar corridors, rooms, and text signs. The results demonstrate that TWC-SLAM
significantly improves the performance of cooperative SLAM systems in complex
environments with repetitive architectural features.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes PIP-LLM for translating natural language commands into efficient multi-robot plans using team-level PDDL and robot-level IP-based planning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in multi-robot coordination stemming from brittle task decomposition, scalability issues, and inefficient coordination when translating natural language commands.

Method: Developed PIP-LLM, which uses team-level PDDL for abstract planning and dependency graphs for efficient task allocation through Integer Programming (IP).

Result: PIP-LLM improves success rates, lowers travel costs, and achieves better workload distribution compared to baseline methods.

Conclusion: PIP-LLM effectively bridges natural language commands to coordinated multi-robot actions with improved efficiency and scalability.

Abstract: Enabling robot teams to execute natural language commands requires
translating high-level instructions into feasible, efficient multi-robot plans.
While Large Language Models (LLMs) combined with Planning Domain Description
Language (PDDL) offer promise for single-robot scenarios, existing approaches
struggle with multi-robot coordination due to brittle task decomposition, poor
scalability, and low coordination efficiency.
  We introduce PIP-LLM, a language-based coordination framework that consists
of PDDL-based team-level planning and Integer Programming (IP) based
robot-level planning. PIP-LLMs first decomposes the command by translating the
command into a team-level PDDL problem and solves it to obtain a team-level
plan, abstracting away robot assignment. Each team-level action represents a
subtask to be finished by the team. Next, this plan is translated into a
dependency graph representing the subtasks' dependency structure. Such a
dependency graph is then used to guide the robot-level planning, in which each
subtask node will be formulated as an IP-based task allocation problem,
explicitly optimizing travel costs and workload while respecting robot
capabilities and user-defined constraints. This separation of planning from
assignment allows PIP-LLM to avoid the pitfalls of syntax-based decomposition
and scale to larger teams. Experiments across diverse tasks show that PIP-LLM
improves plan success rate, reduces maximum and average travel costs, and
achieves better load balancing compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enabling safe and autonomous navigation for legged robots in cluttered environments by improving motion prediction accuracy.

Method: A neural observer with UUB guarantees for stable latent state estimation paired with a predictor for efficient trajectory evaluation integrated into an MPPI-based planner.

Result: Demonstrated accurate motion predictions enabling effective, limb-aware planning in hardware tests with Vision 60 quadruped.

Conclusion: The framework improves limb-level collision-aware planning on dynamic robotic platforms, providing robust solutions for autonomous navigation challenges.

Abstract: Accurate full-body motion prediction is essential for the safe, autonomous
navigation of legged robots, enabling critical capabilities like limb-level
collision checking in cluttered environments. Simplified kinematic models often
fail to capture the complex, closed-loop dynamics of the robot and its
low-level controller, limiting their predictions to simple planar motion. To
address this, we present a learning-based observer-predictor framework that
accurately predicts this motion. Our method features a neural observer with
provable UUB guarantees that provides a reliable latent state estimate from a
history of proprioceptive measurements. This stable estimate initializes a
computationally efficient predictor, designed for the rapid, parallel
evaluation of thousands of potential trajectories required by modern
sampling-based planners. We validated the system by integrating our neural
predictor into an MPPI-based planner on a Vision 60 quadruped. Hardware
experiments successfully demonstrated effective, limb-aware motion planning in
a challenging, narrow passage and over small objects, highlighting our system's
ability to provide a robust foundation for high-performance, collision-aware
planning on dynamic robotic platforms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world deployment of swarm robotics is rare due to challenges in predicting emergent behaviors resulting from simple local interactions.

Method: The framework combines engineering, artificial life, and chemistry concepts, treating swarm parameters like thermodynamic variables, with phase diagram analysis for systematic exploration of parameter impacts.

Result: The study identified conditions and parameter regions that reliably produce behaviors like milling and diffusion, with preliminary validation on real robots.

Conclusion: Analytical Swarm Chemistry provides a principled approach to achieve predictable and interpretable emergent behaviors in real-world swarm robotics systems.

Abstract: Swarm robotics has potential for a wide variety of applications, but
real-world deployments remain rare due to the difficulty of predicting emergent
behaviors arising from simple local interactions. Traditional engineering
approaches design controllers to achieve desired macroscopic outcomes under
idealized conditions, while agent-based and artificial life studies explore
emergent phenomena in a bottom-up, exploratory manner. In this work, we
introduce Analytical Swarm Chemistry, a framework that integrates concepts from
engineering, agent-based and artificial life research, and chemistry. This
framework combines macrostate definitions with phase diagram analysis to
systematically explore how swarm parameters influence emergent behavior.
Inspired by concepts from chemistry, the framework treats parameters like
thermodynamic variables, enabling visualization of regions in parameter space
that give rise to specific behaviors. Applying this framework to agents with
minimally viable capabilities, we identify sufficient conditions for behaviors
such as milling and diffusion and uncover regions of the parameter space that
reliably produce these behaviors. Preliminary validation on real robots
demonstrates that these regions correspond to observable behaviors in practice.
By providing a principled, interpretable approach, this framework lays the
groundwork for predictable and reliable emergent behavior in real-world swarm
systems.

*Nan Zhang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A method is proposed to expand the rotational workspace of cable-driven robots using a reconfigurable end-effector design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Increasing the number of cables to augment translational workspace in cable-driven robots leads to cable interference and non-unique tension solutions, challenging control and decreasing rotational workspace.

Method: A reconfigurable end-effector design incorporating a spring, helical-grooved shaft, matching nut, and bearing converts relative linear motions into rotations and adds a rotational degree of freedom.

Result: The design broadens the rotational workspace and enables pure kinematic control without requiring tension sensing and control.

Conclusion: The proposed mechanism resolves cable interference and minimizes redundancy, facilitating straightforward and effective robot control.

Abstract: To enlarge the translational workspace of cable-driven robots, one common
approach is to increase the number of cables. However, this introduces two
challenges: (1) cable interference significantly reduces the rotational
workspace, and (2) the solution of tensions in cables becomes non-unique,
resulting in difficulties for kinematic control of the robot. In this work, we
design structurally simple reconfigurable end-effectors for cable robots. By
incorporating a spring, a helical-grooved shaft, and a matching nut, relative
linear motions between end-effector components are converted into relative
rotations, thereby expanding the rotational workspace of the mechanism.
Meanwhile, a bearing is introduced to provide an additional rotational degree
of freedom, making the mechanism non-redundant. As a result, the robot's motion
can be controlled purely through kinematics without additional tension sensing
and control.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces Adaptive Virtual Model Control (VMC) integrated with Large Language Models (LLM) and Lyapunov-Based Reinforcement Learning (RL) to enhance robotic arm adaptability and ensure stability under uncertain conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robotic arms face challenges in uncertain environments due to rigid control pipelines and VMC's fixed parameters, limiting adaptability and stability. Enhancing compliant behaviors while preserving stability is critical.

Method: The authors propose Adaptive VMC, combining LLM for coordination and task adjustment with Lyapunov-based RL for stability enforcement, enabling safe, interpretable, and adaptive control.

Result: Simulations on a 7-DoF Panda robotic arm show that Adaptive VMC achieves superior performance in dynamic tasks, balancing objectives and highlighting benefits of LLM and Lyapunov-constrained adaptation.

Conclusion: Integrating LLM and Lyapunov-based RL within Adaptive VMC leads to more adaptable and stable robotic arm control, proving effective for dynamic and uncertain environments.

Abstract: Robotic arms are increasingly deployed in uncertain environments, yet
conventional control pipelines often become rigid and brittle when exposed to
perturbations or incomplete information. Virtual Model Control (VMC) enables
compliant behaviors by embedding virtual forces and mapping them into joint
torques, but its reliance on fixed parameters and limited coordination among
virtual components constrains adaptability and may undermine stability as task
objectives evolve. To address these limitations, we propose Adaptive VMC with
Large Language Model (LLM)- and Lyapunov-Based Reinforcement Learning (RL),
which preserves the physical interpretability of VMC while supporting
stability-guaranteed online adaptation. The LLM provides structured priors and
high-level reasoning that enhance coordination among virtual components,
improve sample efficiency, and facilitate flexible adjustment to varying task
requirements. Complementarily, Lyapunov-based RL enforces theoretical stability
constraints, ensuring safe and reliable adaptation under uncertainty. Extensive
simulations on a 7-DoF Panda arm demonstrate that our approach effectively
balances competing objectives in dynamic tasks, achieving superior performance
while highlighting the synergistic benefits of LLM guidance and
Lyapunov-constrained adaptation.

object directly and autonomously in an unknown environment. Effective
perception in navigation in unknown environment is critical for autonomous
robots. While egocentric observations from RGB-D sensors provide abundant local
information, real-time top-down maps offer valuable global context for ObjNav.
Nevertheless, the majority of existing studies focus on a single source, seldom
integrating these two complementary perceptual modalities, despite the fact
that humans naturally attend to both. With the rapid advancement of
Vision-Language Models(VLMs), we propose Hybrid Perception Navigation
(HyPerNav), leveraging VLMs' strong reasoning and vision-language understanding
capabilities to jointly perceive both local and global information to enhance
the effectiveness and intelligence of navigation in unknown environments. In
both massive simulation evaluation and real-world validation, our methods
achieved state-of-the-art performance against popular baselines. Benefiting
from hybrid perception approach, our method captures richer cues and finds the
objects more effectively, by simultaneously leveraging information
understanding from egocentric observations and the top-down map. Our ablation
study further proved that either of the hybrid perception contributes to the
navigation performance.

Abstract: This paper presents the complete design, control, and experimental validation
of a low-cost Stewart platform prototype developed as an affordable yet capable
robotic testbed for research and education. The platform combines off the shelf
components with 3D printed and custom fabricated parts to deliver full six
degrees of freedom motions using six linear actuators connecting a moving

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address inefficiencies in water usage and adapt to challenging terrains in precision agriculture.

Method: Uses multi-sensor fusion, lightweight YOLO model for plant detection, simplified hand-eye calibration for robot arms, and active leveling systems for terrain stabilization.

Result: Achieved over 96% plant detection accuracy, precise robot arm positioning (>90%), and stabilized irrigation on slopes up to 10 degrees with reduced water consumption by 30-50%.

Conclusion: The system effectively enhances water efficiency and adaptability in diverse agricultural environments, showing promise for broader implementation in precision farming.

Abstract: This paper introduces an intelligent water-saving irrigation system designed
to address critical challenges in precision agriculture, such as inefficient
water use and poor terrain adaptability. The system integrates advanced
computer vision, robotic control, and real-time stabilization technologies via
a multi-sensor fusion approach. A lightweight YOLO model, deployed on an
embedded vision processor (K210), enables real-time plant container detection
with over 96% accuracy under varying lighting conditions. A simplified hand-eye
calibration algorithm-designed for 'handheld camera' robot arm
configurations-ensures that the end effector can be precisely positioned, with
a success rate exceeding 90%. The active leveling system, driven by the
STM32F103ZET6 main control chip and JY901S inertial measurement data, can
stabilize the irrigation platform on slopes up to 10 degrees, with a response
time of 1.8 seconds. Experimental results across three simulated agricultural
environments (standard greenhouse, hilly terrain, complex lighting) demonstrate
a 30-50% reduction in water consumption compared to conventional flood
irrigation, with water use efficiency exceeding 92% in all test cases.

*Zhuo Li,Junjia Liu,Dianxi Li,Tao Teng,Miao Li,Sylvain Calinon,Darwin Caldwell,Fei Chen*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces ManiDP, a method that improves robot bimanual manipulation by incorporating posture-dependent features into diffusion models, achieving higher success rates and task compatibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing robot bimanual skill learning methods lack posture-dependent task features, which are critical for adapting dual-arm configurations for dexterous manipulation with specific force and velocity requirements.

Method: The authors developed ManiDP, an imitation learning framework that extracts manipulability from expert demonstrations, encodes posture features using Riemannian-based probabilistic models, and integrates them into a conditional diffusion process for generating optimized bimanual trajectories.

Result: ManiDP showed a 39.33% increase in average manipulation success rate and a 0.45 improvement in task compatibility in six real-world bimanual tasks compared to baseline methods.

Conclusion: The study emphasizes that integrating posture-relevant robotic priors into bimanual skill learning enables improved adaptability and dexterity, supporting more human-like manipulation performance.

Abstract: Recent work has demonstrated the potential of diffusion models in robot
bimanual skill learning. However, existing methods ignore the learning of
posture-dependent task features, which are crucial for adapting dual-arm
configurations to meet specific force and velocity requirements in dexterous
bimanual manipulation. To address this limitation, we propose
Manipulability-Aware Diffusion Policy (ManiDP), a novel imitation learning
method that not only generates plausible bimanual trajectories, but also
optimizes dual-arm configurations to better satisfy posture-dependent task
requirements. ManiDP achieves this by extracting bimanual manipulability from
expert demonstrations and encoding the encapsulated posture features using
Riemannian-based probabilistic models. These encoded posture features are then
incorporated into a conditional diffusion process to guide the generation of
task-compatible bimanual motion sequences. We evaluate ManiDP on six real-world
bimanual tasks, where the experimental results demonstrate a 39.33$\%$ increase
in average manipulation success rate and a 0.45 improvement in task
compatibility compared to baseline methods. This work highlights the importance
of integrating posture-relevant robotic priors into bimanual skill diffusion to
enable human-like adaptability and dexterity.

*Oskar Natan,Jun Miura*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Seq-DeepIPC is an end-to-end model for legged robot navigation, integrating multi-modal perception and temporal fusion for enhanced spatial features and control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to advance legged robot navigation by integrating multi-modal sensing and providing better spatial features for autonomous navigation.

Method: Seq-DeepIPC uses EfficientNet-B0 for encoding, GNSS for heading estimation, semantic segmentation, depth prediction, and sequential inputs for improved navigation performance.

Result: Seq-DeepIPC demonstrates competitive performance in diverse terrains with efficient computation and reasonable model size, showing reliability in open areas despite GNSS limitations near buildings.

Conclusion: Seq-DeepIPC successfully adapts navigation systems to legged robots with temporally-aware frameworks and plans to release its implementation for future research.

Abstract: We present Seq-DeepIPC, a sequential end-to-end perception-to-control model
for legged robot navigation in realworld environments. Seq-DeepIPC advances
intelligent sensing for autonomous legged navigation by tightly integrating
multi-modal perception (RGB-D + GNSS) with temporal fusion and control. The
model jointly predicts semantic segmentation and depth estimation, giving
richer spatial features for planning and control. For efficient deployment on
edge devices, we use EfficientNet-B0 as the encoder, reducing computation while
maintaining accuracy. Heading estimation is simplified by removing the noisy
IMU and instead computing the bearing angle directly from consecutive GNSS
positions. We collected a larger and more diverse dataset that includes both
road and grass terrains, and validated Seq-DeepIPC on a robot dog. Comparative
and ablation studies show that sequential inputs improve perception and control
in our models, while other baselines do not benefit. Seq-DeepIPC achieves
competitive or better results with reasonable model size; although GNSS-only
heading is less reliable near tall buildings, it is robust in open areas.
Overall, Seq-DeepIPC extends end-to-end navigation beyond wheeled robots to
more versatile and temporally-aware systems. To support future research, we
will release the codes to our GitHub repository at
https://github.com/oskarnatan/Seq-DeepIPC.

*Yongtong Zhu,Lei Li,Iggy Qian,WenBin Zhou,Ye Yuan,Qingdu Li,Na Liu,Jianwei Zhang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces a biomimetic robotic face and a novel learning framework for autonomously generating human-like facial expressions in humanoid social robots.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current facial expression generation in humanoid robots is heavily reliant on manually coded behaviors, demanding substantial human and time investment.

Method: The study involves designing a biomimetic robotic face with animated facial units, utilizing KAN and attention mechanisms for end-to-end learning, and developing an automated facial dataset collection system.

Result: The approach demonstrates accurate and diverse facial mimicry across various test subjects, supported by the first open-source facial dataset for humanoid robots.

Conclusion: The combination of biomimetic design and autonomous learning offers a promising solution for enhancing human-like interaction capabilities of humanoid robots.

Abstract: The facial expression generation capability of humanoid social robots is
critical for achieving natural and human-like interactions, playing a vital
role in enhancing the fluidity of human-robot interactions and the accuracy of
emotional expression. Currently, facial expression generation in humanoid
social robots still relies on pre-programmed behavioral patterns, which are
manually coded at high human and time costs. To enable humanoid robots to
autonomously acquire generalized expressive capabilities, they need to develop
the ability to learn human-like expressions through self-training. To address
this challenge, we have designed a highly biomimetic robotic face with
physical-electronic animated facial units and developed an end-to-end learning
framework based on KAN (Kolmogorov-Arnold Network) and attention mechanisms.
Unlike previous humanoid social robots, we have also meticulously designed an
automated data collection system based on expert strategies of facial motion
primitives to construct the dataset. Notably, to the best of our knowledge,
this is the first open-source facial dataset for humanoid social robots.
Comprehensive evaluations indicate that our approach achieves accurate and
diverse facial mimicry across different test subjects.

*Sunyou Hwang,Christophe De Wagter,Bart Remes,Guido de Croon*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces SAOS to address energy inefficiency in MAVs during orographic soaring, improving position convergence and reducing energy usage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance energy efficiency and flight stability for MAVs during orographic soaring by solving control conflicts causing circling behavior.

Method: The proposed SAOS control switching method selectively manages horizontal or vertical axes and incorporates angle of attack into INDI control for better force estimation.

Result: Simulations and wind tunnel experiments on MAVs showed improved position convergence, reduced throttle usage, and mitigated roll oscillations.

Conclusion: The SAOS method significantly boosts energy efficiency and flight stability in challenging orographic soaring conditions.

Abstract: Orographic soaring can significantly extend the endurance of micro aerial
vehicles (MAVs), but circling behavior, arising from control conflicts between
the longitudinal and vertical axes, increases energy consumption and the risk
of divergence. We propose a control switching method, named SAOS: Switched
Control for Autonomous Orographic Soaring, which mitigates circling behavior by
selectively controlling either the horizontal or vertical axis, effectively
transforming the system from underactuated to fully actuated during soaring.
Additionally, the angle of attack is incorporated into the INDI controller to
improve force estimation. Simulations with randomized initial positions and
wind tunnel experiments on two MAVs demonstrate that the SAOS improves position
convergence, reduces throttle usage, and mitigates roll oscillations caused by
pitch-roll coupling. These improvements enhance energy efficiency and flight
stability in constrained soaring environments.

*Bernhard Rameder,Hubert Gattringer,Ronald Naderer,Andreas Mueller*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper presents a cost-effective automated tape laying (ATL) system with integrated force and temperature control for optimal tape compaction and consolidation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop an efficient ATL system ensuring precise compaction forces and temperature for improved layer bonding and handling of compact, complex shapes.

Method: The system design includes divided modules such as tape storage, guiding roller, processing unit, heating zone, consolidation unit, and introduces fixed tape laying device with robot movement for testing.

Result: The functionality of the system and modules was successfully validated through experimental trials using carbon fiber reinforced HDPE tape.

Conclusion: This ATL system's design demonstrated reliability and functionality, offering an effective solution for advanced tape laying processes with robust force and temperature control.

Abstract: This paper deals with the design of a cost effective automated tape laying
system (ATL system) with integrated uniaxial force control to ensure the
necessary compaction forces as well as with an accurate temperature control to
guarantee the used tape being melted appropriate. It is crucial to control the
substrate and the oncoming tape onto a specific temperature level to ensure an
optimal consolidation between the different layers of the product. Therefore,
it takes several process steps from the spooled tape on the coil until it is
finally tacked onto the desired mold. The different modules are divided into
the tape storage spool, a tape-guiding roller, a tape processing unit, a
heating zone and the consolidation unit. Moreover, a special robot control
concept for testing the ATL system is presented. In contrast to many other
systems, with this approach, the tape laying device is spatially fixed and the
shape is moved accordingly by the robot, which allows for handling of rather
compact and complex shapes. The functionality of the subsystems and the taping
process itself was finally approved in experimental results using a carbon
fiber reinforced HDPE tape.

*Yi-Lin Wei,Zhexi Luo,Yuhao Lin,Mu Lin,Zhizhao Liang,Shuoyu Chen,Wei-Shi Zheng*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces OmniDexGrasp, a framework combining foundation models and control strategies for generalizable robotic grasping across diverse objects and tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robotics lacks generalization in dexterous grasping and manipulation due to limited semantic datasets; leveraging foundation models offers potential enhancement.

Method: The framework integrates foundation models for human grasp image generation, a transfer strategy to convert human demonstrations into robot actions, and a force-aware adaptive strategy for stable grasping.

Result: Experiments demonstrate successful applications across various user prompts, tasks, and dexterous hands, with proven extensibility to manipulation tasks.

Conclusion: OmniDexGrasp bridges the gap between model knowledge and robot execution, achieving generalizable dexterous grasp capabilities for enhanced robotic manipulation.

Abstract: Enabling robots to dexterously grasp and manipulate objects based on human
commands is a promising direction in robotics. However, existing approaches are
challenging to generalize across diverse objects or tasks due to the limited
scale of semantic dexterous grasp datasets. Foundation models offer a new way
to enhance generalization, yet directly leveraging them to generate feasible
robotic actions remains challenging due to the gap between abstract model
knowledge and physical robot execution. To address these challenges, we propose
OmniDexGrasp, a generalizable framework that achieves omni-capabilities in user
prompting, dexterous embodiment, and grasping tasks by combining foundation
models with the transfer and control strategies. OmniDexGrasp integrates three
key modules: (i) foundation models are used to enhance generalization by
generating human grasp images supporting omni-capability of user prompt and
task; (ii) a human-image-to-robot-action transfer strategy converts human
demonstrations into executable robot actions, enabling omni dexterous
embodiment; (iii) force-aware adaptive grasp strategy ensures robust and stable
grasp execution. Experiments in simulation and on real robots validate the
effectiveness of OmniDexGrasp on diverse user prompts, grasp task and dexterous
hands, and further results show its extensibility to dexterous manipulation
tasks.

*Bharath Santhanam,Alex Mitrevski,Santosh Thoduka,Sebastian Houben,Teena Hassan*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework that integrates learned robot policies with anomaly detection and recovery mechanisms to prevent execution failures in open environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robots using learned policies often fail in complex open environments due to the lack of methods for recognizing and reacting to execution failures, which can result in unreliable and unsafe behavior.

Method: The framework trains an anomaly detection model based on data from typical policy executions. This model detects deviations during policy execution, triggering a three-level recovery process: temporary pause, local state perturbation, and resetting to a safe state using a learned execution success model.

Result: The approach was tested on two different robot tasks, demonstrating improved success rates in handling anomalies such as trajectory deviations and adversarial interventions.

Conclusion: Integrating anomaly detection and recovery mechanisms improves reliability and safety of robot policy execution in complex environments.

Abstract: Learned robot policies have consistently been shown to be versatile, but they
typically have no built-in mechanism for handling the complexity of open
environments, making them prone to execution failures; this implies that
deploying policies without the ability to recognise and react to failures may
lead to unreliable and unsafe robot behaviour. In this paper, we present a
framework that couples a learned policy with a method to detect visual
anomalies during policy deployment and to perform recovery behaviours when
necessary, thereby aiming to prevent failures. Specifically, we train an
anomaly detection model using data collected during nominal executions of a
trained policy. This model is then integrated into the online policy execution
process, so that deviations from the nominal execution can trigger a
three-level sequential recovery process that consists of (i) pausing the
execution temporarily, (ii) performing a local perturbation of the robot's
state, and (iii) resetting the robot to a safe state by sampling from a learned
execution success model. We verify our proposed method in two different
scenarios: (i) a door handle reaching task with a Kinova Gen3 arm using a
policy trained in simulation and transferred to the real robot, and (ii) an
object placing task with a UFactory xArm 6 using a general-purpose policy
model. Our results show that integrating policy execution with anomaly
detection and recovery increases the execution success rate in environments
with various anomalies, such as trajectory deviations and adversarial human
interventions.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a two-layer framework for coordinating large fleets of mobile robots in dynamic industrial environments, combining high-level scheduling with low-level control to ensure safety and adaptability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for scalable and flexible coordination of large fleets of mobile robots for efficient material handling in industries.

Method: A two-layer framework including a compositional scheduling algorithm (ComSat) for task assignment and scheduling, and a distributed Model Predictive Control system for real-time trajectory computation.

Result: Simulated evaluations demonstrate high task completion rates and robust performance under various traffic conditions, including congestion and disruptions.

Conclusion: The proposed modular and computationally efficient framework is suitable for real-world deployment, ensuring collision-free operation and adaptability in complex industrial settings.

Abstract: The deployment of mobile robots for material handling in industrial
environments requires scalable coordination of large fleets in dynamic
settings. This paper presents a two-layer framework that combines high-level
scheduling with low-level control. Tasks are assigned and scheduled using the
compositional algorithm ComSat, which generates time-parameterized routes for
each robot. These schedules are then used by a distributed Model Predictive
Control (MPC) system in real time to compute local reference trajectories,
accounting for static and dynamic obstacles. The approach ensures safe,
collision-free operation, and supports rapid rescheduling in response to
disruptions such as robot failures or environmental changes. We evaluate the
method in simulated 2D environments with varying road capacities and traffic
conditions, demonstrating high task completion rates and robust behavior even
under congestion. The modular structure of the framework allows for
computational tractability and flexibility, making it suitable for deployment
in complex, real-world industrial scenarios.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes an adaptable control frequency method for robotics using reinforcement learning, validated on real robots.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current fixed-frequency control systems in robotics require trade-offs between efficiency and robustness, unlike adaptable biological systems.

Method: Developed a reinforcement learning method that adjusts control frequency dynamically based on situational needs.

Result: Experiments showed autonomous frequency modulation with performance matching or exceeding fixed-frequency methods, on RC cars and quadrupedal robots.

Conclusion: Robots using adaptive control achieve comparable or superior results while reducing control frequency in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Fixed-frequency control in robotics imposes a trade-off between the
efficiency of low-frequency control and the robustness of high-frequency
control, a limitation not seen in adaptable biological systems. We address this
with a reinforcement learning approach in which policies jointly select control
actions and their application durations, enabling robots to autonomously
modulate their control frequency in response to situational demands. We
validate our method with zero-shot sim-to-real experiments on two distinct
hardware platforms: a high-speed RC car and a quadrupedal robot. Our method
matches or outperforms fixed-frequency baselines in terms of rewards while
significantly reducing the control frequency and exhibiting adaptive frequency
control under real-world conditions.

*Giulia Pusceddu,Giulio Antonio Abbo,Francesco Rea,Tony Belpaeme,Alessandra Sciutti*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The study explored whether robotic agents perceived as value-aware influence human decision-making, finding that value awareness increases perceived loyalty and attention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how value-aware robots impact human decision-making and their perceived actions, particularly whether they can encourage reflection or risk manipulation.

Method: Participants interacted with two Furhat robots (Value-Aware vs Non-Value-Aware) in an image labeling task focusing on human values. Gaze, choices, and reactions during disagreements were analyzed.

Result: Participants paid more attention to and perceived the Value-Aware robot as more loyal. Disagreement with both robots introduced hesitation, with conformity in one out of four trials.

Conclusion: Value-awareness in robots enhances perceived loyalty and encourages reflective decision-making but may also pose manipulation risks if misused.

Abstract: This study investigates whether the opinions of robotic agents are more
likely to influence human decision-making when the robots are perceived as
value-aware (i.e., when they display an understanding of human principles). We
designed an experiment in which participants interacted with two Furhat robots
- one programmed to be Value-Aware and the other Non-Value-Aware - during a
labeling task for images representing human values. Results indicate that
participants distinguished the Value-Aware robot from the Non-Value-Aware one.
Although their explicit choices did not indicate a clear preference for one
robot over the other, participants directed their gaze more toward the
Value-Aware robot. Additionally, the Value-Aware robot was perceived as more
loyal, suggesting that value awareness in a social robot may enhance its
perceived commitment to the group. Finally, when both robots disagreed with the
participant, conformity occurred in about one out of four trials, and
participants took longer to confirm their responses, suggesting that two robots
expressing dissent may introduce hesitation in decision-making. On one hand,
this highlights the potential risk that robots, if misused, could manipulate
users for unethical purposes. On the other hand, it reinforces the idea that
social robots might encourage reflection in ambiguous situations and help users
avoid scams.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Precise motion planning for robotic manipulators requires an accurate understanding of the environment to avoid collisions and define restricted areas.

Method: The process involves acquiring point cloud data from various sensors, segmenting collision objects with region growing and VCCS algorithms, and approximating point clusters.

Result: Sensors and their differences in capturing collision environments are compared, showing the workflow from detection to collision environment creation.

Conclusion: By implementing and comparing sensor technologies and algorithms, the study enhances robotic collision detection within defined environments for improved motion planning.

Abstract: Motion planning for robotic manipulators relies on precise knowledge of the
environment in order to be able to define restricted areas and to take
collision objects into account. To capture the workspace, point clouds of the
environment are acquired using various sensors. The collision objects are
identified by region growing segmentation and VCCS algorithm. Subsequently the
point clusters are approximated. The aim of the present paper is to compare
different sensors, to illustrate the process from detection to the finished

environment.

TL;DR: The paper presents a lifetime estimation method for flexible robotic manipulators, aiding in lightweight design with sustainable control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable sustainable industrial automation with lightweight robotic design and optimal time and energy control.

Method: The methodology involves fatigue analysis using the rainflow counting algorithm, critical cutting plane method, Tresca hypothesis, and linear damage accumulation for lifetime estimation.

Result: Geometry optimization is shown for flexible manipulators performing pick-and-place tasks with a focus on weight and vibration characteristics.

Conclusion: The approach optimizes robot geometry using a Pareto front to balance lifetime and vibration performance, demonstrated on a three DOF robotic manipulator.

Abstract: Resourceful operation and design of robots is key for sustainable industrial
automation. This will be enabled by lightweight design along with time and
energy optimal control of robotic manipulators. Design and control of such
systems is intertwined as the control must take into account inherent
mechanical compliance while the design must accommodate the dynamic
requirements demanded by the control. As basis for such design optimization, a
method for estimating the lifetime of elastic link robotic manipulators is
presented. This is applied to the geometry optimization of flexible serial
manipulators performing pick-and-place operations, where the optimization
objective is a combination of overall weight and vibration amplitudes. The
lifetime estimation draws from a fatigue analysis combining the rainflow
counting algorithm and the method of critical cutting plane. Tresca hypothesis
is used to formulate an equivalent stress, and linear damage accumulation is
assumed. The final robot geometry is selected from a Pareto front as a tradeoff
of lifetime and vibration characteristic. The method is illustrated for a three
degrees of freedom articulated robotic manipulator.

TL;DR: This paper proposes a deep Active Inference framework for unifying exploration and goal-directed robotic navigation in real-world environments, utilizing a diffusion policy and a recurrent state-space model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a unified approach for autonomous robotic navigation that achieves both exploration for environmental learning and efficient goal-directed movement.

Method: The study introduces a deep Active Inference framework that includes a diffusion policy for generating diverse actions and a recurrent state-space model for long-horizon predictions. Actions are selected by minimizing the expected free energy.

Result: The proposed framework outperformed baselines in real-world experiments, achieving higher success rates and fewer collisions, especially in scenarios requiring significant exploration.

Conclusion: This work demonstrates the effectiveness of Active Inference driven by expected free energy minimization to integrate exploration and navigation tasks in real-world robotic environments.

Abstract: Autonomous robotic navigation in real-world environments requires exploration
to acquire environmental information as well as goal-directed navigation in
order to reach specified targets. Active inference (AIF) based on the
free-energy principle provides a unified framework for these behaviors by
minimizing the expected free energy (EFE), thereby combining epistemic and
extrinsic values. To realize this practically, we propose a deep AIF framework
that integrates a diffusion policy as the policy model and a multiple timescale
recurrent state-space model (MTRSSM) as the world model. The diffusion policy
generates diverse candidate actions while the MTRSSM predicts their
long-horizon consequences through latent imagination, enabling action selection
that minimizes EFE. Real-world navigation experiments demonstrated that our
framework achieved higher success rates and fewer collisions compared with the
baselines, particularly in exploration-demanding scenarios. These results
highlight how AIF based on EFE minimization can unify exploration and
goal-directed navigation in real-world robotic settings.

*Jin Huang,Yingqiang Wang,Haoda Li,Zichen Liu,Zhikun Wang,Ying Chen*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper addresses time synchronization issues in underwater integrated navigation systems with acoustic positioning, proposing a tightly coupled framework incorporating precise delay measurement and compensation techniques, significantly improving navigation performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the challenge of time delays in multi-sensor underwater systems with acoustic positioning, which degrade navigation accuracy due to misaligned measurement and fusion moments.

Method: The authors propose a tightly coupled navigation framework combining piUSBL, SINS, and depth gauge systems under precise time synchronization. They develop a novel delay measurement strategy that quantifies and explicitly estimates acoustic propagation and system processing delays.

Result: The approach was validated through simulations and field experiments, showing significant improvements: a 40.45% reduction in RMSE and a 32.55% decrease in maximum error in underwater navigation.

Conclusion: Precise delay measurement and compensation enhance underwater navigation accuracy and provide a generalizable framework for time alignment and data fusion in latency-sensitive multi-sensor systems.

Abstract: In multi-sensor systems, time synchronization between sensors is a
significant challenge, and this issue is particularly pronounced in underwater
integrated navigation systems incorporating acoustic positioning. Such systems
are highly susceptible to time delay, which can significantly degrade accuracy
when measurement and fusion moments are misaligned. To address this challenge,
this paper introduces a tightly coupled navigation framework that integrates a
passive inverted ultra-short baseline (piUSBL) acoustic positioning system, a
strapdown inertial navigation system (SINS), and a depth gauge under precise
time synchronization. The framework fuses azimuth and slant range from the
piUSBL with depth data, thereby avoiding poor vertical-angle observability in
planar arrays. A novel delay measurement strategy is introduced, combining
synchronized timing with acoustic signal processing, which redefines
delay-traditionally an unobservable error-into a quantifiable parameter,
enabling explicit estimation of both acoustic propagation and system processing
delays. Simulations and field experiments confirm the feasibility of the
proposed method, with delay-compensated navigation reducing RMSE by 40.45% and
maximum error by 32.55%. These findings show that precise delay measurement and
compensation not only enhance underwater navigation accuracy but also establish
a generalizable framework for acoustic positioning integration, offering
valuable insights into time alignment and data fusion in latency-sensitive
multi-sensor systems.

### [567] [Transferable Deep Reinforcement Learning for Cross-Domain Navigation: from Farmland to the Moon](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23329)
*Shreya Santra,Thomas Robbins,Kazuya Yoshida*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Explores cross-domain Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) for autonomous navigation policies, training in terrestrial environments and achieving notable success in extraterrestrial simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robots in unstructured environments need efficient navigation under uncertainty, but traditional methods lack scalability. DRL may offer scalable solutions.

Method: Developed a 3D simulation of an agricultural rover that uses Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) for goal-oriented navigation and tested its cross-domain generalization in lunar-like simulations.

Result: The DRL policy trained on terrestrial domains achieved nearly 50% success in lunar-like environments without retraining.

Conclusion: Cross-domain DRL enables adaptable autonomous navigation, reducing retraining costs for planetary exploration missions.

Abstract: Autonomous navigation in unstructured environments is essential for field and
planetary robotics, where robots must efficiently reach goals while avoiding
obstacles under uncertain conditions. Conventional algorithmic approaches often
require extensive environment-specific tuning, limiting scalability to new
domains. Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) provides a data-driven alternative,
allowing robots to acquire navigation strategies through direct interactions
with their environment. This work investigates the feasibility of DRL policy
generalization across visually and topographically distinct simulated domains,
where policies are trained in terrestrial settings and validated in a zero-shot
manner in extraterrestrial environments. A 3D simulation of an agricultural
rover is developed and trained using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to
achieve goal-directed navigation and obstacle avoidance in farmland settings.
The learned policy is then evaluated in a lunar-like simulated environment to
assess transfer performance. The results indicate that policies trained under
terrestrial conditions retain a high level of effectiveness, achieving close to
50\% success in lunar simulations without the need for additional training and
fine-tuning. This underscores the potential of cross-domain DRL-based policy
transfer as a promising approach to developing adaptable and efficient
autonomous navigation for future planetary exploration missions, with the added
benefit of minimizing retraining costs.

This review aims to serve as a valuable reference for researchers and
practitioners in the fields of artificial intelligence and robotics.

*Chungeng Tian,Ning Hao,Fenghua He*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Transformed ESKF (T-ESKF) to address observability mismatch in visual-inertial navigation systems (VINS).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The inconsistency problem arises due to observability mismatch, which impacts the accuracy of visual-inertial navigation systems.

Method: A linear time-varying transformation is applied to the error-state within the Error-State Kalman Filter (ESKF), ensuring observability consistency. A new efficient covariance propagation technique is also proposed.

Result: The proposed T-ESKF demonstrates better or comparable performance in simulations and experiments compared to existing state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The T-ESKF is effective in addressing observability mismatches in VINS and offers consistent state estimation, validated by competitive performance outcomes.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to address the inconsistency problem
caused by observability mismatch in visual-inertial navigation systems (VINS).
The key idea involves applying a linear time-varying transformation to the
error-state within the Error-State Kalman Filter (ESKF). This transformation
ensures that \textrr{the unobservable subspace of the transformed error-state
system} becomes independent of the state, thereby preserving the correct
observability of the transformed system against variations in linearization
points. We introduce the Transformed ESKF (T-ESKF), a consistent VINS estimator
that performs state estimation using the transformed error-state system.
Furthermore, we develop an efficient propagation technique to accelerate the
covariance propagation based on the transformation relationship between the
transition and accumulated matrices of T-ESKF and ESKF. We validate the
proposed method through extensive simulations and experiments, demonstrating
better (or competitive at least) performance compared to state-of-the-art
methods. The code is available at github.com/HITCSC/T-ESKF.

*Alvaro Paz,Mahdi Hejrati,Pauli Mustalahti,Jouni Mattila*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper proposes a real-time nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) framework for heavy-duty hydraulic manipulators (HHMs) to enforce constraints and ensure safe operation under nonlinear dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of ensuring safe and reliable operation of HHMs while maintaining compliance with actuator constraints like force, velocity, and position limits, which is critical but underexplored in real-time control systems.

Method: The proposed NMPC framework uses a multiple-shooting strategy combined with real-time sensor feedback and virtual decomposition control (VDC) for precise joint tracking to guarantee constraint satisfaction at a frequency of 1 kHz.

Result: Experimental results validate the NMPC framework, achieving joint-level and end-effector constraint compliance in Cartesian space, ensuring high-accuracy trajectory tracking under safety-critical limits.

Conclusion: The NMPC framework provides a robust real-time control approach for HHMs, advancing safety and precision in large-scale hydraulic systems and setting a new benchmark in the field.

Abstract: Heavy-duty hydraulic manipulators (HHMs) operate under strict physical and
safety-critical constraints due to their large size, high power, and complex
nonlinear dynamics. Ensuring that both joint-level and end-effector
trajectories remain compliant with actuator capabilities, such as force,
velocity, and position limits, is essential for safe and reliable operation,
yet remains largely underexplored in real-time control frameworks. This paper
presents a nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) framework designed to
guarantee constraint satisfaction throughout the full nonlinear dynamics of
HHMs, while running at a real-time control frequency of 1 kHz. The proposed
method combines a multiple-shooting strategy with real-time sensor feedback,
and is supported by a robust low-level controller based on virtual
decomposition control (VDC) for precise joint tracking. Experimental validation
on a full-scale hydraulic manipulator shows that the NMPC framework not only
enforces actuator constraints at the joint level, but also ensures
constraint-compliant motion in Cartesian space for the end-effector. These
results demonstrate the method's capability to deliver high-accuracy trajectory
tracking while strictly respecting safety-critical limits, setting a new
benchmark for real-time control in large-scale hydraulic systems.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: COOPERA is a novel framework designed to enhance long-term, open-ended human-robot collaboration, focusing on learning human traits and personalized intents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robotic assistants generally fail to account for individual human traits and habits over time, limiting their ability to collaborate effectively with humans in dynamic environments.

Method: COOPERA introduces a simulated human-robot interaction framework with psychology-driven human traits and integrates continual human feedback, enabling the study of long-term collaborations.

Result: The experiments validate COOPERA's ability to simulate realistic human behaviors and its effectiveness in personalizing actions for human intents in various collaborative tasks.

Conclusion: COOPERA shows promise in advancing human-robot collaboration with more personalized, long-lasting interactions by leveraging learned human traits and intents.

Abstract: To understand and collaborate with humans, robots must account for individual
human traits, habits, and activities over time. However, most robotic
assistants lack these abilities, as they primarily focus on predefined tasks in
structured environments and lack a human model to learn from. This work
introduces COOPERA, a novel framework for COntinual, OPen-Ended human-Robot
Assistance, where simulated humans, driven by psychological traits and
long-term intentions, interact with robots in complex environments. By
integrating continuous human feedback, our framework, for the first time,
enables the study of long-term, open-ended human-robot collaboration (HRC) in
different collaborative tasks across various time-scales. Within COOPERA, we
introduce a benchmark and an approach to personalize the robot's collaborative
actions by learning human traits and context-dependent intents. Experiments
validate the extent to which our simulated humans reflect realistic human
behaviors and demonstrate the value of inferring and personalizing to human
intents for open-ended and long-term HRC. Project Page:

*Weizheng Wang,Obi Ike,Soyun Choi,Sungeun Hong,Byung-Cheol Min*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces NaviWM, which integrates a socially-aware world model and a logic-driven reasoning process to enhance robot navigation in dynamic human spaces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the unpredictable and unsafe behaviors of robots relying solely on large language models for navigation in dynamic human areas.

Method: The authors propose NaviWM, consisting of a spatial-temporal world model to track agents and a deductive reasoning module for logic-based inference, ensuring navigation adheres to social norms and safety constraints.

Result: NaviWM improves success rates and reduces social violations during navigation, especially in crowded environments.

Conclusion: NaviWM demonstrates the effectiveness of combining formal reasoning with large language models for socially-compliant and safe robot navigation.

Abstract: Social robot navigation increasingly relies on large language models for
reasoning, path planning, and enabling movement in dynamic human spaces.
However, relying solely on LLMs for planning often leads to unpredictable and
unsafe behaviors, especially in dynamic human spaces, due to limited physical
grounding and weak logical consistency. In this work, we introduce NaviWM, a
socially-aware robot Navigation World Model that augments LLM reasoning with a
structured world model and a logic-driven chain-of-thought process. NaviWM
consists of two main components: (1) a spatial-temporal world model that
captures the positions, velocities, and activities of agents in the
environment, and (2) a deductive reasoning module that guides LLMs through a
multi-step, logic-based inference process. This integration enables the robot
to generate navigation decisions that are both socially compliant and
physically safe, under well-defined constraints such as personal space,
collision avoidance, and timing. Unlike previous methods based on prompting or
fine-tuning, NaviWM encodes social norms as first-order logic, enabling
interpretable and verifiable reasoning. Experiments show that NaviWM improves
success rates and reduces social violations, particularly in crowded
environments. These results demonstrate the benefit of combining formal
reasoning with LLMs for robust social navigation. Additional experimental

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a marker-free proprioception method using stereo-RGB cameras and deep learning to localize draped surgical robots and improve tracking visibility and context-aware control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Surgical robots lack spatial awareness, leading to operational issues such as collisions and system recoveries, worsened by distributed, multi-armed robots. Current tracking systems are limited and inconvenient for crowded operating rooms.

Method: The study uses stereo-RGB cameras paired with transformer-based deep learning models on the largest robotic surgery dataset (1.4M images) to enable precise localization of surgical robots.

Result: The proposed method demonstrated enhanced tracking visibility by 25%, holistic robot and scene tracking robust to occlusions, and benefits like breathing compensation and advanced multi-robot system localization.

Conclusion: As the first marker-free proprioception approach for fully draped surgical robots, the method reduces complexity, improves safety, and advances autonomous robotic surgery capabilities.

Abstract: Despite their mechanical sophistication, surgical robots remain blind to
their surroundings. This lack of spatial awareness causes collisions, system
recoveries, and workflow disruptions, issues that will intensify with the
introduction of distributed robots with independent interacting arms. Existing
tracking systems rely on bulky infrared cameras and reflective markers,
providing only limited views of the surgical scene and adding hardware burden
in crowded operating rooms. We present a marker-free proprioception method that
enables precise localisation of surgical robots under their sterile draping
despite associated obstruction of visual cues. Our method solely relies on
lightweight stereo-RGB cameras and novel transformer-based deep learning
models. It builds on the largest multi-centre spatial robotic surgery dataset
to date (1.4M self-annotated images from human cadaveric and preclinical in
vivo studies). By tracking the entire robot and surgical scene, rather than
individual markers, our approach provides a holistic view robust to occlusions,
supporting surgical scene understanding and context-aware control. We
demonstrate an example of potential clinical benefits during in vivo breathing
compensation with access to tissue dynamics, unobservable under state of the
art tracking, and accurately locate in multi-robot systems for future
intelligent interaction. In addition, and compared with existing systems, our
method eliminates markers and improves tracking visibility by 25%. To our
knowledge, this is the first demonstration of marker-free proprioception for
fully draped surgical robots, reducing setup complexity, enhancing safety, and
paving the way toward modular and autonomous robotic surgery.

*Anthony Opipari,Aravindhan K Krishnan,Shreekant Gayaka,Min Sun,Cheng-Hao Kuo,Arnie Sen,Odest Chadwicke Jenkins*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper proposes enhancing class-agnostic video segmentation models by incorporating explicit 3D memory through 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), improving segmentation accuracy and consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video segmentation algorithms lack effective memory mechanisms for consistent object-level predictions, either utilizing no memory or only implicit recurrent neural networks. Improving the memory system can enhance both accuracy and consistency.

Method: The paper introduces a 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) memory to store object-level segments during video processing. It integrates this explicit memory into foundation models named FastSAM-Splat and SAM2-Splat, leveraging fusion techniques to enhance performance.

Result: Through ablation and benchmarking experiments, models equipped with explicit 3D memory consistently outperform those with no memory or implicit memory systems in both accuracy and consistency.

Conclusion: Explicit 3D memory significantly improves video segmentation algorithms, offering more reliable and precise predictions compared to traditional methods.

Abstract: Remembering where object segments were predicted in the past is useful for
improving the accuracy and consistency of class-agnostic video segmentation
algorithms. Existing video segmentation algorithms typically use either no
object-level memory (e.g. FastSAM) or they use implicit memories in the form of
recurrent neural network features (e.g. SAM2). In this paper, we augment both
types of segmentation models using an explicit 3D memory and show that the
resulting models have more accurate and consistent predictions. For this, we
develop an online 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) technique to store predicted
object-level segments generated throughout the duration of a video. Based on
this 3DGS representation, a set of fusion techniques are developed, named
FastSAM-Splat and SAM2-Splat, that use the explicit 3DGS memory to improve
their respective foundation models' predictions. Ablation experiments are used
to validate the proposed techniques' design and hyperparameter settings.
Results from both real-world and simulated benchmarking experiments show that
models which use explicit 3D memories result in more accurate and consistent
predictions than those which use no memory or only implicit neural network
memories. Project Page: https://topipari.com/projects/FastSAM-Splat/

TL;DR: This paper introduces a scalable evaluation framework for robot generalists by transforming real-world video demonstrations into simulated environments, leveraging vision-language models, and incorporating human feedback.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations of current evaluation methods for robot policies, which are constrained by challenges such as labor intensity, safety issues, lack of scalability in real-world testing, and limited simulation benchmarks that are neither diverse nor robust.

Method: The authors propose a framework that converts video demonstrations into simulated scenarios using advances in vision-language models, generative modeling, and rendering. They employ online human feedback to assess and improve policies, while scaling evaluation by testing robust performance under controlled perturbations in simulated environments.

Result: The framework enables scalable and reproducible benchmarking of robot manipulation policies, transforming the process of human assessment into a more efficient task. It also provides a method to test robustness by systematically varying environmental conditions.

Conclusion: This new framework addresses critical issues in robotics evaluation by enabling scalable, reproducible, and robust benchmarking of robot generalists, bridging the gap between real-world task performance and simulated testing environments.

Abstract: The pursuit of robot generalists - instructable agents capable of performing
diverse tasks across diverse environments - demands rigorous and scalable
evaluation. Yet real-world testing of robot policies remains fundamentally
constrained: it is labor-intensive, slow, unsafe at scale, and difficult to
reproduce. Existing simulation benchmarks are similarly limited, as they train
and test policies within the same synthetic domains and cannot assess models
trained from real-world demonstrations or alternative simulation environments.
As policies expand in scope and complexity, these barriers only intensify,
since defining "success" in robotics often hinges on nuanced human judgments of
execution quality. In this paper, we introduce a new benchmarking framework
that overcomes these challenges by shifting VLA evaluation into large-scale
simulated environments augmented with online human feedback. Leveraging
advances in vision-language models, 2D-to-3D generative modeling, and
differentiable rendering, our approach automatically converts video
demonstrations from widely used robot datasets into simulated counterparts.
Within these digital twins, we assess VLA policies using both automated
VLM-guided scoring and scalable human preference judgments collected from
crowdworkers, transforming human involvement from tedious scene setup,
resetting, and safety supervision into lightweight preference comparisons. To
measure robustness, we systematically perturb simulated environments along
multiple axes, such as textures and object placements, stress-testing policy
generalization under controlled variation. The result is a continuously
evolving, reproducible, and scalable benchmark for real-world trained robot
manipulation policies, addressing a critical missing capability in today's
robotics landscape.

TL;DR: The paper introduces UrbanVLA, a Vision-Language-Action framework for scalable urban navigation in dynamic environments, excelling in both high-level route alignment and low-level navigation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for effective and reliable navigation methods in urban micromobility applications, such as delivery robots, due to challenges presented by dynamic and unstructured city settings.

Method: A two-stage training pipeline combining supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with simulated environments and web-video derived data, followed by reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) on mixed simulation and real-world datasets.

Result: UrbanVLA demonstrates over 55% improvement compared to strong baselines in SocialNav task on MetaUrban and achieves scalability and robustness in real-world urban settings.

Conclusion: UrbanVLA effectively integrates route alignment with visual observations and offers a scalable solution for urban micromobility navigation, addressing real-world uncertainties and large-scale environment challenges.

Abstract: Urban micromobility applications, such as delivery robots, demand reliable
navigation across large-scale urban environments while following long-horizon
route instructions. This task is particularly challenging due to the dynamic
and unstructured nature of real-world city areas, yet most existing navigation
methods remain tailored to short-scale and controllable scenarios. Effective
urban micromobility requires two complementary levels of navigation skills:
low-level capabilities such as point-goal reaching and obstacle avoidance, and
high-level capabilities, such as route-visual alignment. To this end, we
propose UrbanVLA, a route-conditioned Vision-Language-Action (VLA) framework
designed for scalable urban navigation. Our method explicitly aligns noisy
route waypoints with visual observations during execution, and subsequently
plans trajectories to drive the robot. To enable UrbanVLA to master both levels
of navigation, we employ a two-stage training pipeline. The process begins with
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) using simulated environments and trajectories
parsed from web videos. This is followed by Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) on
a mixture of simulation and real-world data, which enhances the model's safety
and adaptability in real-world settings. Experiments demonstrate that UrbanVLA
surpasses strong baselines by more than 55% in the SocialNav task on MetaUrban.
Furthermore, UrbanVLA achieves reliable real-world navigation, showcasing both
scalability to large-scale urban environments and robustness against real-world
uncertainties.

Motivation: To investigate the effectiveness of SWE-Agents in generating controllers for embodied tasks, which require information discovery and reasoning, as opposed to traditional software engineering tasks with accessible codebases.

Method: Adapted a Mini-SWE-Agent (MSWEA) to solve 20 embodied tasks in the Minigrid environment. Conducted experiments comparing agent performance under various conditions of information access, including access to environment source codes and dynamic exploration capabilities.

Abstract: Software Engineering Agents (SWE-Agents) have proven effective for
traditional software engineering tasks with accessible codebases, but their
performance for embodied tasks requiring well-designed information discovery
remains unexplored. We present the first extended evaluation of SWE-Agents on
controller generation for embodied tasks, adapting Mini-SWE-Agent (MSWEA) to
solve 20 diverse embodied tasks from the Minigrid environment. Our experiments
compare agent performance across different information access conditions: with

interactive exploration. We quantify how different information access levels
affect SWE-Agent performance for embodied tasks and analyze the relative
importance of static code analysis versus dynamic exploration for task solving.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper proposes ToM-SWE, a dual-agent system integrating a software-engineering agent with a theory-of-mind agent for better understanding and tracking user intent, achieving superior performance in benchmarks and high satisfaction in practical use.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current coding agents struggle with understanding and tracking user intent when instructions are unclear or context-dependent.

Method: The system uses a dual-agent architecture: a primary software-engineering (SWE) agent paired with a theory-of-mind (ToM) agent. The ToM agent infers user goals, constraints, preferences, and maintains a persistent memory of user interactions to assist the SWE agent.

Result: In ambiguous and stateful SWE benchmarks, ToM-SWE improves task success rates substantially. Notably, it achieves 59.7% task success compared to 18.1% from OpenHands in the new stateful SWE benchmark. Professional developers found it useful 86% of the time in a three-week study.

Conclusion: ToM-SWE demonstrates significant improvements in task performance and user satisfaction due to its capability for stateful user modeling, making it valuable for practical software engineering tasks.

Abstract: Recent advances in coding agents have made them capable of planning, editing,
running, and testing complex code bases. Despite their growing ability in
coding tasks, these systems still struggle to infer and track user intent,
especially when instructions are underspecified or context-dependent. To bridge
this gap, we introduce ToM-SWE, a dual-agent architecture that pairs a primary
software-engineering (SWE) agent with a lightweight theory-of-mind (ToM)
partner agent dedicated to modeling the user's mental state. The ToM agent
infers user goals, constraints, and preferences from instructions and
interaction history, maintains a \textbf{persistent memory} of the user, and
provides user-related suggestions to the SWE agent. In two software engineering
benchmarks (ambiguous SWE-bench and stateful SWE-bench), ToM-SWE improves task
success rates and user satisfaction. Notably, on the stateful SWE benchmark, a
newly introduced evaluation that provides agents with a user simulator along
with previous interaction histories, ToM-SWE achieves a substantially higher
task success rate of 59.7\% compared to 18.1\% for OpenHands, a
state-of-the-art SWE agent. Furthermore, in a three-week study with
professional developers using ToM-SWE in their daily work, participants found
it useful 86\% of the time, underscoring the value of stateful user modeling
for practical coding agents.

Result: RAG-assisted responses were more comprehensive than human developers' (62.50% vs. 54.17%) and almost as helpful (75.00% vs. 79.17%), but they were less concise and often verbose.

Conclusion: RAG demonstrates potential to enhance developer assistance in OSS like Mozilla Firefox, although future improvements should focus on reducing verbosity to better streamline responses.

Abstract: The use of Large Language Models (LLMs) to support tasks in software
development has steadily increased over recent years. From assisting developers
in coding activities to providing conversational agents that answer newcomers'
questions. In collaboration with the Mozilla Foundation, this study evaluates
the effectiveness of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) in assisting
developers within the Mozilla Firefox project. We conducted an empirical
analysis comparing responses from human developers, a standard GPT model, and a
GPT model enhanced with RAG, using real queries from Mozilla's developer chat
rooms. To ensure a rigorous evaluation, Mozilla experts assessed the responses
based on helpfulness, comprehensiveness, and conciseness. The results show that
RAG-assisted responses were more comprehensive than human developers (62.50% to
54.17%) and almost as helpful (75.00% to 79.17%), suggesting RAG's potential to
enhance developer assistance. However, the RAG responses were not as concise
and often verbose. The results show the potential to apply RAG-based tools to
Open Source Software (OSS) to minimize the load to core maintainers without
losing answer quality. Toning down retrieval mechanisms and making responses
even shorter in the future would enhance developer assistance in massive
projects like Mozilla Firefox.

*Musengamana Jean de Dieu,Ruiyin Li,Peng Liang,Mojtaba Shahin,Muhammad Waseem,Arif Ali Khan,Bangchao Wang,Mst Shamima Aktar*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper presents ArchISMiner, a framework for extracting architectural knowledge from Stack Overflow using machine learning models achieving high accuracy. The tool provides datasets and replication packages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Architectural knowledge on Stack Overflow is hard to locate due to unstructured content and fragmented discussions, necessitating an automated solution.

Method: ArchISMiner consists of ArchPI for detecting architecture-related posts using ML/DL, PLMs, and LLMs, and ArchISPE for identifying architectural issue-solution pairs using BERT embeddings and TextCNN features.

Result: ArchPI achieves 0.960 F1-score in identifying architecture-related posts, and ArchISPE obtains 0.883 F1-score for issues and 0.894 for solutions, validated by a user study and applied across forums creating a dataset of over 18K pairs.

Conclusion: ArchISMiner significantly improves the process of identifying and extracting architectural knowledge, aiding developers and architects with accurate and efficient tools.

Abstract: Stack Overflow (SO), a leading online community forum, is a rich source of
software development knowledge. However, locating architectural knowledge, such
as architectural solutions remains challenging due to the overwhelming volume
of unstructured content and fragmented discussions. Developers must manually
sift through posts to find relevant architectural insights, which is
time-consuming and error-prone. This study introduces ArchISMiner, a framework
for mining architectural knowledge from SO. The framework comprises two
complementary components: ArchPI and ArchISPE. ArchPI trains and evaluates
multiple models, including conventional ML/DL models, Pre-trained Language
Models (PLMs), and Large Language Models (LLMs), and selects the
best-performing model to automatically identify Architecture-Related Posts
(ARPs) among programming-related discussions. ArchISPE employs an indirect
supervised approach that leverages diverse features, including BERT embeddings
and local TextCNN features, to extract architectural issue-solution pairs. Our
evaluation shows that the best model in ArchPI achieves an F1-score of 0.960 in
ARP detection, and ArchISPE outperforms baselines in both SE and NLP fields,
achieving F1-scores of 0.883 for architectural issues and 0.894 for solutions.
A user study further validated the quality (e.g., relevance and usefulness) of
the identified ARPs and the extracted issue-solution pairs. Moreover, we
applied ArchISMiner to three additional forums, releasing a dataset of over 18K
architectural issue-solution pairs. Overall, ArchISMiner can help architects
and developers identify ARPs and extract succinct, relevant, and useful
architectural knowledge from developer communities more accurately and
efficiently. The replication package of this study has been provided at

*Yupeng Qi,Ran Xu,Xu Chu*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: FeaGPT is introduced to automate finite element analysis workflows through conversational interfaces, enabling natural language control over geometry-mesh-simulation processes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to simplify and democratize access to computational engineering tools using natural language interfaces, overcoming manual intervention barriers.

Method: FeaGPT integrates a fully automated Geometry-Mesh-Simulation-Analysis pipeline to interpret design intent, generate adaptive meshes, configure simulations, and perform analyses autonomously.

Result: Experimental validation on industrial turbocharger cases and NACA airfoil configurations demonstrates consistency, scalability, and physical realism in computational results.

Conclusion: Natural language interfaces offered by FeaGPT can provide robust, scalable, and democratic access to advanced computational workflows without sacrificing analytical precision.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are establishing new paradigms for engineering
applications by enabling natural language control of complex computational
workflows. This paper introduces FeaGPT, the first framework to achieve
complete geometry-mesh-simulation workflows through conversational interfaces.
Unlike existing tools that automate individual FEA components, FeaGPT
implements a fully integrated Geometry-Mesh-Simulation-Analysis (GMSA) pipeline
that transforms engineering specifications into validated computational results
without manual intervention. The system interprets engineering intent,
automatically generates physics-aware adaptive meshes, configures complete FEA
simulations with proper boundary condition inference, and performs
multi-objective analysis through closed-loop iteration.
  Experimental validation confirms complete end-to-end automation capability.
Industrial turbocharger cases (7-blade compressor and 12-blade turbine at
\SI{110000}{rpm}) demonstrate the system successfully transforms natural
language specifications into validated CalculiX simulations, producing
physically realistic results for rotating machinery analysis. Additional
validation through 432 NACA airfoil configurations confirms scalability for
parametric design exploration. These results demonstrate that natural language
interfaces can effectively democratize access to advanced computational
engineering tools while preserving analytical rigor.

Abstract: Generative AI (GenAI) is reshaping enterprise architecture work in agile
software organizations, yet evidence on its effects remains scattered. We
report a systematic literature review (SLR), following established SLR
protocols of Kitchenham and PRISMA, of 1,697 records, yielding 33 studies
across enterprise, solution, domain, business, and IT architect roles. GenAI
most consistently supports (i) design ideation and trade-off exploration; (ii)
rapid creation and refinement of artifacts (e.g., code, models, documentation);
and (iii) architectural decision support and knowledge retrieval. Reported
risks include opacity and bias, contextually incorrect outputs leading to
rework, privacy and compliance concerns, and social loafing. We also identify
emerging skills and competencies, including prompt engineering, model
evaluation, and professional oversight, and organizational enablers around
readiness and adaptive governance. The review contributes with (1) a mapping of
GenAI use cases and risks in agile architecting, (2) implications for
capability building and governance, and (3) an initial research agenda on
human-AI collaboration in architecture. Overall, the findings inform
responsible adoption of GenAI that accelerates digital transformation while
safeguarding architectural integrity.

### [584] [LSPRAG: LSP-Guided RAG for Language-Agnostic Real-Time Unit Test Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22210)
*Gwihwan Go,Quan Zhang,Chijin Zhou,Zhao Wei,Yu Jiang*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper introduces LSPRAG, a method for generating unit tests for various programming languages efficiently using LLMs and Language Server Protocols.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to create an effective, real-time, and language-agnostic approach to generating high-coverage unit tests, overcoming limitations of existing language-specific or imprecise methods.

Method: LSPRAG uses off-the-shelf Language Server Protocol back-ends to provide precise symbol definitions and references for LLMs. This enables concise and accurate context retrieval for generating tests without extensive language-specific engineering.

Result: LSPRAG achieved significant improvements in line coverage in unit tests for Golang (174.55%), Java (213.31%), and Python (31.57%) compared to baseline methods.

Conclusion: LSPRAG offers a practical, low-effort, and effective solution for real-time, multi-language unit test generation by combining the strengths of LLMs and existing LSP infrastructure.

Abstract: Automated unit test generation is essential for robust software development,
yet existing approaches struggle to generalize across multiple programming
languages and operate within real-time development. While Large Language Models
(LLMs) offer a promising solution, their ability to generate high coverage test
code depends on prompting a concise context of the focal method. Current
solutions, such as Retrieval-Augmented Generation, either rely on imprecise
similarity-based searches or demand the creation of costly, language-specific
static analysis pipelines. To address this gap, we present LSPRAG, a framework
for concise-context retrieval tailored for real-time, language-agnostic unit
test generation. LSPRAG leverages off-the-shelf Language Server Protocol (LSP)
back-ends to supply LLMs with precise symbol definitions and references in real
time. By reusing mature LSP servers, LSPRAG provides an LLM with language-aware
context retrieval, requiring minimal per-language engineering effort. We
evaluated LSPRAG on open-source projects spanning Java, Go, and Python.
Compared to the best performance of baselines, LSPRAG increased line coverage
by up to 174.55% for Golang, 213.31% for Java, and 31.57% for Python.

*Guan-Yan Yang,Farn Wang*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper discusses the FAME framework which ensures reliability in AI-integrated safety-critical systems by blending formal synthesis and runtime monitoring to identify silent failures effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI in safety-critical systems can produce silent failures with confident but dangerous outputs, creating a need for provable safety frameworks.

Method: The paper proposes the FAME framework, combining offline formal synthesis with online runtime monitoring to provide a reliable safety mechanism for AI systems.

Result: FAME was shown to detect 93.5% of critical silent safety violations in an autonomous vehicle perception system.

Conclusion: FAME shifts the paradigm from probabilistic performance to certifiable, provable safety for AI systems, aligning with ISO safety standards.

Abstract: The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into safety-critical systems
introduces a new reliability paradigm: silent failures, where AI produces
confident but incorrect outputs that can be dangerous. This paper introduces
the Formal Assurance and Monitoring Environment (FAME), a novel framework that
confronts this challenge. FAME synergizes the mathematical rigor of offline
formal synthesis with the vigilance of online runtime monitoring to create a
verifiable safety net around opaque AI components. We demonstrate its efficacy
in an autonomous vehicle perception system, where FAME successfully detected
93.5% of critical safety violations that were otherwise silent. By
contextualizing our framework within the ISO 26262 and ISO/PAS 8800 standards,
we provide reliability engineers with a practical, certifiable pathway for
deploying trustworthy AI. FAME represents a crucial shift from accepting
probabilistic performance to enforcing provable safety in next-generation
systems.

### [586] [Understanding Self-Admitted Technical Debt in Test Code: An Empirical Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22249)
*Ibuki Nakamura,Yutaro Kashiwa,Bin Lin,Hajimu Iida*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The study investigates Self-Admitted Technical Debt (SATD) in test code, examining its types, distribution, and relationship with test quality. Models like CodeBERT are used for classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Developers often create technical debt to meet deadlines. Research on SATD predominantly focuses on production code, leaving a gap in understanding SATD in test code, which may differ in nature.

Method: The study analyzed 17,766 SATD comments (including 2,779 from test code) from 50 repositories, categorized SATD types, and developed machine learning models, including CodeBERT, for classification.

Result: SATD is prevalent in test code but shows no direct association with test smells. CodeBERT-based models perform best in classifying SATD comments by type, though performance varies by type.

Conclusion: SATD in test code requires separate consideration from production code due to unique characteristics. Effective classification using machine learning can aid in managing SATD efficiently.

Abstract: Developers often opt for easier but non-optimal implementation to meet
deadlines or create rapid prototypes, leading to additional effort known as
technical debt to improve the code later. Oftentimes, developers explicitly
document the technical debt in code comments, referred to as Self-Admitted
Technical Debt (SATD). Numerous researchers have investigated the impact of
SATD on different aspects of software quality and development processes.
However, most of these studies focus on SATD in production code, often
overlooking SATD in the test code or assuming that it shares similar
characteristics with SATD in production code. In fact, a significant amount of
SATD is also present in the test code, with many instances not fitting into
existing categories for the production code. This study aims to fill this gap
and disclose the nature of SATD in the test code by examining its distribution
and types. Moreover, the relation between its presence and test quality is also
analyzed. Our empirical study, involving 17,766 SATD comments (14,987 from
production code, 2,779 from test code) collected from 50 repositories,
demonstrates that while SATD widely exists in test code, it is not directly
associated with test smells. Our study also presents comprehensive categories
of SATD types in the test code, and machine learning models are developed to
automatically classify SATD comments based on their types for easier
management. Our results show that the CodeBERT-based model outperforms other
machine learning models in terms of recall and F1-score. However, the
performance varies on different types of SATD.

### [587] [CodeAD: Synthesize Code of Rules for Log-based Anomaly Detection with LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22986)
*Junjie Huang,Minghua He,Jinyang Liu,Yintong Huo,Domenico Bianculli,Michael R. Lyu*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: CodeAD is a new framework that uses large language models (LLMs) to synthesize Python rule functions for log-based anomaly detection (LogAD), offering improved accuracy, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing log anomaly detection methods like machine learning, deep learning, and rule-based systems face challenges such as limited interpretability, high costs, and manual effort, impacting their scalability and efficiency.

Method: CodeAD employs hierarchical clustering and anchor-grounded sampling to curate representative log samples, enabling LLMs to identify anomaly patterns. It iteratively generates, tests, repairs, and refines Python rule functions for online anomaly detection.

Result: CodeAD outperformed state-of-the-art baselines in anomaly detection by 3.6% F1 score on average and processed datasets up to 4x faster, with low operation costs (under $4 per dataset).

Conclusion: CodeAD provides a practical, scalable, and interpretable solution for anomaly detection in online monitoring systems, improving efficiency and reducing costs.

Abstract: Log-based anomaly detection (LogAD) is critical for maintaining the
reliability and availability of large-scale online service systems. While
machine learning, deep learning, and large language models (LLMs)-based methods
have advanced the LogAD, they often suffer from limited interpretability, high
inference costs, and extensive preprocessing requirements, limiting their
practicality for real-time, high-volume log analysis. In contrast, rule-based
systems offer efficiency and transparency, but require significant manual
effort and are difficult to scale across diverse and evolving environments. In
this paper, We present CodeAD, a novel framework that automatically synthesizes
lightweight Python rule functions for LogAD using LLMs. CodeAD introduces a
hierarchical clustering and anchor-grounded sampling strategy to construct
representative contrastive log windows, enabling LLMs to discern discriminative
anomaly patterns. To ensure robustness and generalizability, CodeAD employs an
agentic workflow that iteratively generates, tests, repairs, and refines the
rules until it meets correctness and abstraction requirements. The synthesized
rules are interpretable, lightweight, and directly executable on raw logs,
supporting efficient and transparent online anomaly detection. Our
comprehensive experiments on three public datasets (BGL, Hadoop, Thunderbird)
demonstrate that CodeAD achieves an average absolute improvement of 3.6% F1
score over the state-of-the-art baselines, while processing large datasets up
to 4x faster and at a fraction of the cost (total LLM invocation cost under 4
USD per dataset). These results highlight CodeAD as a practical and scalable
solution for online monitoring systems, enabling interpretable, efficient, and
automated LogAD in real-world environment.

TL;DR: The paper defines ten rules to balance AI-assisted coding's advantages with ensuring scientific rigor and integrity in software development for scientific research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI coding tools can expedite software development, but researchers need methods to ensure scientific validity and quality in AI-assisted coding.

Method: The paper proposes ten practical rules, categorized into four themes: problem understanding, interaction management, validation and testing, and iterative improvement.

Result: The proposed rules aim to ensure human oversight, validation processes, domain-specific accuracy, and scientific reproducibility in codes developed with AI assistance.

Conclusion: The paper highlights harnessing AI's potential for faster and reliable software development, maintaining high scientific standards through practical rules.

Abstract: While AI coding tools have demonstrated potential to accelerate software
development, their use in scientific computing raises critical questions about
code quality and scientific validity. In this paper, we provide ten practical
rules for AI-assisted coding that balance leveraging capabilities of AI with
maintaining scientific and methodological rigor. We address how AI can be
leveraged strategically throughout the development cycle with four key themes:
problem preparation and understanding, managing context and interaction,
testing and validation, and code quality assurance and iterative improvement.
These principles serve to emphasize maintaining human agency in coding
decisions, establishing robust validation procedures, and preserving the domain
expertise essential for methodologically sound research. These rules are
intended to help researchers harness AI's transformative potential for faster
software development while ensuring that their code meets the standards of
reliability, reproducibility, and scientific validity that research integrity
demands.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper examines how large language models (LLMs) can enhance ISTQB certification learning, presenting a dataset, prompt optimization, LLM evaluation, and recommendations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve software testing education by incorporating advancements in generative AI, specifically leveraging LLMs.

Method: The paper created an ISTQB-aligned dataset, developed domain-specific prompts, evaluated LLM performance on tasks, and provided actionable recommendations.

Result: The work demonstrated enhanced precision and explanation quality of LLMs, offering systematic insights and showing promise for integrating LLMs in software testing education.

Conclusion: LLMs can significantly support ISTQB-based learning, providing an innovative way to modernize software testing education in higher education.

Abstract: Software testing is a critical component in the software engineering field
and is important for software engineering education. Thus, it is vital for
academia to continuously improve and update educational methods to reflect the
current state of the field. The International Software Testing Qualifications
Board (ISTQB) certification framework is globally recognized and widely adopted
in industry and academia. However, ISTQB-based learning has been rarely applied
with recent generative artificial intelligence advances. Despite the growing
capabilities of large language models (LLMs), ISTQB-based learning and
instruction with LLMs have not been thoroughly explored. This paper explores
and evaluates how LLMs can complement the ISTQB framework for higher education.
The findings present four key contributions: (i) the creation of a
comprehensive ISTQB-aligned dataset spanning over a decade, consisting of 28
sample exams and 1,145 questions; (ii) the development of a domain-optimized
prompt that enhances LLM precision and explanation quality on ISTQB tasks;
(iii) a systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art LLMs on this dataset; and
(iv) actionable insights and recommendations for integrating LLMs into software
testing education. These findings highlight the promise of LLMs in supporting
ISTQB certification preparation and offer a foundation for their broader use in
software engineering at higher education.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper explores using large language models (LLMs) to generate better comments for novice coders' codebases with the help of design documents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Novice coders often create poorly formatted and unhelpful comments due to a lack of commenting standards, which leads to difficulties in maintaining code.

Method: The study investigates leveraging LLMs to generate improved comments by using design documents as additional context.

Result: The focus is on assessing the practicality and effectiveness of integrating design documents for comment generation by LLMs.

Conclusion: Leveraging LLMs with design documents may enhance the quality and usefulness of comments, aiding in better code maintenance.

Abstract: Comments are very useful to the flow of code development. With the increasing
commonality of code, novice coders have been creating a significant amount of
codebases. Due to lack of commenting standards, their comments are often
useless, and increase the time taken to further maintain codes. This study
intends to find the usefulness of large language models (LLMs) in these cases
to generate potentially better comments. This study focuses on the feasibility
of design documents as a context for the LLMs to generate more useful comments,
as design documents are often used by maintainers to understand code when
comments do not suffice.

*Shahidul Islam,Md Nahidul Islam Opu,Shaowei Wang,Shaiful Chowdhury*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This study investigates self-admitted technical debt in test code, analyzes 50,000 comments from 1,000 Java projects, identifies 15 categories, and highlights limitations in current detection tools.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SATD significantly affects software maintenance but its presence in test code has been overlooked, leaving a gap in understanding its impact.

Method: The study involved manually analyzing comments from Java projects, categorizing SATD into 15 types, and evaluating detection tools like MAT and LLMs.

Result: Researchers identified 615 SATD comments, showed existing tools (e.g., MAT) had moderate recall, and revealed poor performance by both open-source and proprietary LLMs.

Conclusion: Current methods cannot reliably detect SATD in test code, encouraging future studies to improve detection tools and address this software testing challenge.

Abstract: Self-admitted technical debt (SATD) refers to comments in which developers
explicitly acknowledge code issues, workarounds, or suboptimal solutions. SATD
is known to significantly increase software maintenance effort. While extensive
research has examined SATD in source code, its presence and impact in test code
have received no focused attention, leaving a significant gap in our
understanding of how SATD manifests in testing contexts.
  This study, the first of its kind, investigates SATD in test code by manually
analyzing 50,000 comments randomly sampled from 1.6 million comments across
1,000 open-source Java projects. From this sample, after manual analysis and
filtering, we identified 615 SATD comments and classified them into 15 distinct
categories, building a taxonomy of test code SATD. To investigate whether test
code SATD can be detected automatically, we evaluated existing SATD detection
tools, as well as both open-source and proprietary LLMs. Among the existing
tools, MAT performed the best, albeit with moderate recall. To our surprise,
both open-source and proprietary LLMs exhibited poor detection accuracy,
primarily due to low precision. These results indicate that neither existing
approaches nor current LLMs can reliably detect SATD in test code.
  Overall, this work provides the first large-scale analysis of SATD in test
code, a nuanced understanding of its types, and the limitations of current SATD
detection methods. Our findings lay the groundwork for future research on test
code-specific SATD.

*Shalini Chakraborty,Sebastian Baltes*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The research analyzes various forms of discrimination in the software engineering field, highlighting age, gender, political views, and disabilities as key challenges impacting workplace experiences and career progression.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to broaden the focus of diversity and inclusion discussions beyond gender and racial disparities by addressing less-explored identities like age, political views, and disabilities in software engineering.

Method: A secondary analysis was conducted on 800 open-ended responses from the Developer Nation 2025 survey, highlighting patterns of perceived discrimination and workplace challenges.

Result: Findings indicate prevalent age- and gender-related discrimination in the software industry, alongside significant concerns related to political and religious views. Women and non-binary individuals face disproportionately higher rates of workplace discrimination and mental health challenges.

Conclusion: Discrimination in software engineering extends beyond commonly studied facets, urging the research community to consider a more holistic approach to diversity studies, including underrepresented identities and intersectional challenges.

Abstract: Conversations around diversity and inclusion in software engineering often
focus on gender and racial disparities. However, the State of the Developer
Nation 2025 survey with 8,717 participants revealed that other forms of
discrimination are similarly prevalent but receive considerably less attention.
This includes discrimination based on age, political perspective, disabilities,
or cognitive differences such as neurodivergence. We conducted a secondary
analysis of 800 open-ended survey responses to examine patterns of perceived
discrimination, as well as related challenges and negative impacts. Our study
covers multiple identity facets, including age, gender, race, and disability.
We found that age- and gender-related discrimination was the most frequently
reported workplace issue, but discrimination based on political and religious
views emerged as further notable concerns. Most of the participants who
identified as female cited gender as the primary source of discrimination,
often accompanied by intersectional factors such as race, political views, age,
or sexual orientation. Discrimination related to caregiving responsibilities
was reported by all gender identities. Regarding the negative impacts of
workplace issues, many participants described modifying their appearance or
behavior in response to gender biases. Gender also appeared to influence
broader career challenges, as women and non-binary respondents reported
experiencing almost all workplace issues at higher rates, particularly
discrimination (35%) and mental health challenges (62%). Our goal is to raise
awareness in the research community that discrimination in software development
is multifaceted, and to encourage researchers to select and assess relevant
facets beyond age and gender when designing software engineering studies.

*Sungmin Kang,Sumi Yun,Jingun Hong,Shin Yoo,Gabin An*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces AutoCrashFL, an LLM agent for fault localization using crash dumps and source code, demonstrating improved accuracy and practicality in industrial-scale applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of dynamic analyses, such as costly coverage profiling in large software projects, and enable effective fault localization using crash dumps.

Method: The paper proposes AutoCrashFL, leveraging an LLM agent that uses crash dumps and source code for crash localization without requiring expensive dynamic analyses.

Result: AutoCrashFL identified 30% of crashes at the top position, outperforming the baseline method which achieved 17%. It showed better performance for complex bugs and can indicate confidence in results.

Conclusion: AutoCrashFL is effective and practical for industrial-scale fault localization, demonstrating the potential of LLM agents in large-scale software projects.

Abstract: Fault Localization (FL) aims to identify root causes of program failures. FL
typically targets failures observed from test executions, and as such, often
involves dynamic analyses to improve accuracy, such as coverage profiling or
mutation testing. However, for large industrial software, measuring coverage
for every execution is prohibitively expensive, making the use of such
techniques difficult. To address these issues and apply FL in an industrial
setting, this paper proposes AutoCrashFL, an LLM agent for the localization of
crashes that only requires the crashdump from the Program Under Test (PUT) and
access to the repository of the corresponding source code. We evaluate
AutoCrashFL against real-world crashes of SAP HANA, an industrial software
project consisting of more than 35 million lines of code. Experiments reveal
that AutoCrashFL is more effective in localization, as it identified 30%
crashes at the top, compared to 17% achieved by the baseline. Through thorough
analysis, we find that AutoCrashFL has attractive practical properties: it is
relatively more effective for complex bugs, and it can indicate confidence in
its results. Overall, these results show the practicality of LLM agent
deployment on an industrial scale.

TL;DR: This paper presents DynaCausal, a framework for dynamic and causality-aware root cause analysis in distributed microservice systems, achieving superior performance over current methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Microservices create complex and fast-evolving dependencies, complicating reliable root cause analysis due to challenges like fault propagation modeling, noise interference, and reliance on deviation intensity.

Method: The paper proposes DynaCausal, a framework using dynamic causality-aware mechanisms, integrating multi-modal signals, representation learning, contrastive mechanisms, and a causal-prioritized ranking objective to improve fault diagnosis.

Result: DynaCausal outperformed state-of-the-art methods in public benchmarks, achieving an AC@1 score of 0.63 with notable improvements in accuracy and interpretability.

Conclusion: DynaCausal effectively addresses challenges in root cause analysis for dynamic microservice systems, offering accurate and interpretable diagnoses through an innovative approach.

Abstract: Cloud-native microservices enable rapid iteration and scalable deployment but
also create complex, fast-evolving dependencies that challenge reliable
diagnosis. Existing root cause analysis (RCA) approaches, even with multi-modal
fusion of logs, traces, and metrics, remain limited in capturing dynamic
behaviors and shifting service relationships. Three critical challenges
persist: (i) inadequate modeling of cascading fault propagation, (ii)
vulnerability to noise interference and concept drift in normal service
behavior, and (iii) over-reliance on service deviation intensity that obscures
true root causes. To address these challenges, we propose DynaCausal, a dynamic
causality-aware framework for RCA in distributed microservice systems.
DynaCausal unifies multi-modal dynamic signals to capture time-varying
spatio-temporal dependencies through interaction-aware representation learning.
It further introduces a dynamic contrastive mechanism to disentangle true fault
indicators from contextual noise and adopts a causal-prioritized pairwise
ranking objective to explicitly optimize causal attribution. Comprehensive
evaluations on public benchmarks demonstrate that DynaCausal consistently
surpasses state-of-the-art methods, attaining an average AC@1 of 0.63 with
absolute gains from 0.25 to 0.46, and delivering both accurate and
interpretable diagnoses in highly dynamic microservice environments.

### [595] [Does In-IDE Calibration of Large Language Models work at Scale?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22614)
*Roham Koohestani,Agnia Sergeyuk,David Gros,Claudio Spiess,Sergey Titov,Prem Devanbu,Maliheh Izadi*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper investigates the implementation and human-centered design of confidence calibration for AI-generated code models in IDEs, analyzed through user interaction and design studies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenges of ensuring the usefulness and reliability of AI-generated code in IDEs by aligning model confidence with developer acceptance through post-hoc calibration and effective reliability signal communication.

Method: The authors developed a general calibration framework, applied a Platt-scaling calibration model, analyzed over 24 million real developer interactions, and further conducted a multi-phase design study involving expert designers and professional developers.

Result: Findings showed that a general calibration model does not significantly improve model reliability on average, while dynamically personalized calibration depends on user data volume. Developers preferred non-numerical, color-coded reliability signals.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that while calibration methods can enhance the user experience, their effectiveness varies, and proper presentation of reliability signals is key in the software engineering context for AI-generated code.

Abstract: The introduction of large language models into integrated development
environments (IDEs) is revolutionizing software engineering, yet it poses
challenges to the usefulness and reliability of Artificial
Intelligence-generated code. Post-hoc calibration of internal model confidences
aims to align probabilities with an acceptability measure. Prior work suggests
calibration can improve alignment, but at-scale evidence is limited. In this
work, we investigate the feasibility of applying calibration of code models to
an in-IDE context. We study two aspects of the problem: (1) the technical
method for implementing confidence calibration and improving the reliability of
code generation models, and (2) the human-centered design principles for
effectively communicating reliability signal to developers. First, we develop a
scalable and flexible calibration framework which can be used to obtain
calibration weights for open-source models using any dataset, and evaluate
whether calibrators improve the alignment between model confidence and
developer acceptance behavior. Through a large-scale analysis of over 24
million real-world developer interactions across multiple programming
languages, we find that a general, post-hoc calibration model based on
Platt-scaling does not, on average, improve the reliability of model confidence
signals. We also find that while dynamically personalizing calibration to
individual users can be effective, its effectiveness is highly dependent on the
volume of user interaction data. Second, we conduct a multi-phase design study
with 3 expert designers and 153 professional developers, combining
scenario-based design, semi-structured interviews, and survey validation,
revealing a clear preference for presenting reliability signals via
non-numerical, color-coded indicators within the in-editor code generation
workflow.

*Kamil Szczepanik,Jarosław A. Chudziak*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper presents a multi-agent system based on large language models (LLMs) for automating the generation of C4 software architecture models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Designing software architecture models, specifically C4 models, is a vital yet manual and resource-intensive task.

Method: An LLM-driven multi-agent system performs requirement analysis and automatically generates Context, Container, and Component views of C4 models. Its quality is assessed through deterministic checks and an innovative LLM-as-a-Judge scoring method.

Result: Testing on five system briefs showed fast C4 model generation, high compilation success rate, and semantic fidelity. Comparison of four LLMs highlighted their strengths in architectural design.

Conclusion: The study advances the automation of software architecture design and enhances evaluation methods using LLMs, offering promising results for practical implementation.

Abstract: Software architecture design is a fundamental part of creating every software
system. Despite its importance, producing a C4 software architecture model, the
preferred notation for such architecture, remains manual and time-consuming. We
introduce an LLM-based multi-agent system that automates this task by
simulating a dialogue between role-specific experts who analyze requirements
and generate the Context, Container, and Component views of the C4 model.
Quality is assessed with a hybrid evaluation framework: deterministic checks
for structural and syntactic integrity and C4 rule consistency, plus semantic
and qualitative scoring via an LLM-as-a-Judge approach. Tested on five
canonical system briefs, the workflow demonstrates fast C4 model creation,
sustains high compilation success, and delivers semantic fidelity. A comparison
of four state-of-the-art LLMs shows different strengths relevant to
architectural design. This study contributes to automated software architecture
design and its evaluation methods.

### [597] [On the Freshness of Pinned Dependencies in Maven](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22815)
*Vasudev Vikram,Yuvraj Agarwal,Rohan Padhye*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper discusses dependency pinning in software ecosystems, highlighting its risks such as outdated dependencies with vulnerabilities. To address this, the authors define 'stale' and 'fresh' pins, conduct an empirical study, and propose the Pin-Freshener tool to encourage safe upgrades using crowdsourced tests.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dependency pinning ensures reproducible builds and prevents breaking changes. However, it risks using outdated versions with unresolved bugs and security vulnerabilities, impacting software reliability.

Method: The authors defined stale and fresh pins to analyze outdated dependencies and conducted an empirical study on Maven libraries. They demonstrated dependency-related risks and prototyped the Pin-Freshener tool, leveraging crowdsourced tests to improve upgrade safety.

Result: Over 60% of Maven library users have stale pins, some outdated by over a year. 10% of minor or patch upgrades in their dataset reduce security vulnerabilities. Pin-Freshener increases test coverage by 35-100% with 1-5 additional test suites, aiding safer upgrades.

Conclusion: Dependency pinning is widespread and poses security risks. Pin-Freshener validates upgrades using crowdsourced test suites, aiding developers in safely modernizing dependencies and reducing vulnerabilities.

Abstract: Library dependencies in software ecosystems play a crucial role in the
development of software. As newer releases of these libraries are published,
developers may opt to pin their dependencies to a particular version. While
pinning may have benefits in ensuring reproducible builds and avoiding breaking
changes, it bears larger risks in using outdated dependencies that may contain
bugs and security vulnerabilities. To understand the frequency and consequences
of dependency pinning, we first define the concepts of stale and fresh pins,
which are distinguished based on how outdated the dependency is relative to the
release date of the project. We conduct an empirical study to show that over
60% of consumers of popular Maven libraries contain stale pins to their
dependencies, with some outdated versions over a year old. These pinned
versions often miss out on security fixes; we find that 10% of all dependency
upgrades in our dataset to the latest minor or patch version would reduce
security vulnerabilities.
  We prototype an approach called Pin-Freshener that can encourage developers
to freshen their pins by leveraging the insight that crowdsourced tests of peer
projects can provide additional signal for the safety of an upgrade. Running
Pin-Freshener on dependency upgrades shows that just 1-5 additional test suites
can provide 35-100% more coverage of a dependency, compared to that of a single
consumer test suite. Our evaluation on real-world pins to the top 500 popular
libraries in Maven shows that Pin-Freshener can provide an additional signal of
at least 5 passing crowdsourced test suites to over 3,000 consumers to safely
perform an upgrade that reduces security vulnerabilities. Pin-Freshener can
provide practical confidence to developers by offering additional signal beyond
their own test suites, representing an improvement over current practices.

*Ming-Tung Shen,Yuh-Jzer Joung*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces TALM, a dynamic multi-agent framework that uses structured task decomposition and long-term memory for improved code generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in prior multi-agent frameworks, such as rigid workflows and high reasoning recovery costs, while improving context management and multi-step reasoning in code generation.

Method: TALM employs a tree-structured collaboration framework with parent-child relationships for flexible reasoning and error correction, combined with a long-term memory module for self-improvement and efficient performance.

Result: Experimental evaluations show TALM achieves strong reasoning performance and efficient token usage across HumanEval, BigCodeBench, and ClassEval benchmarks.

Conclusion: TALM demonstrates robustness and practical utility, enabling efficient and flexible reasoning for complex code generation tasks.

Abstract: Agentic code generation requires large language models (LLMs) capable of
complex context management and multi-step reasoning. Prior multi-agent
frameworks attempt to address these challenges through collaboration, yet they
often suffer from rigid workflows and high reasoning recovery costs. To
overcome these limitations, we propose TALM (Tree-Structured Multi-Agent
Framework with Long-Term Memory), a dynamic framework that integrates
structured task decomposition, localized re-reasoning, and long-term memory
mechanisms. TALM employs an extensible tree-based collaboration structure. The
parent-child relationships, when combined with a divide-and-conquer strategy,
enhance reasoning flexibility and enable efficient error correction across
diverse task scopes. Furthermore, a long-term memory module enables semantic
querying and integration of prior knowledge, supporting implicit
self-improvement through experience reuse. Experimental results on HumanEval,
BigCodeBench, and ClassEval benchmarks demonstrate that TALM consistently
delivers strong reasoning performance and high token efficiency, highlighting
its robustness and practical utility in complex code generation tasks.

### [599] [From Online User Feedback to Requirements: Evaluating Large Language Models for Classification and Specification Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23055)
*Manjeshwar Aniruddh Mallya,Alessio Ferrari,Mohammad Amin Zadenoori,Jacek Dąbrowski*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper explores lightweight open-source large language models (LLMs) for requirements engineering (RE), evaluating their performance in analyzing online user feedback and generating requirement specifications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite the potential of LLMs for automating the analysis of user feedback in RE, their application remains underexplored with limited evaluation, empirical evidence, and reproducibility.

Method: The study evaluates five lightweight open-source LLMs on three RE tasks: user request classification, NFR classification, and requirements specification generation. Performance was measured using feedback datasets and human evaluation of specification quality.

Result: LLMs achieved moderate-to-high classification accuracy (F1 ranging from 0.47 to 0.68) and moderately high requirements specification quality, averaging about 3/5 as rated by humans.

Conclusion: Lightweight LLMs show promise for feedback-driven requirements engineering but have both notable capabilities and limitations. The study provides insightful findings, an empirical evaluation, and a replication package to support further exploration in this field.

Abstract: [Context and Motivation] Online user feedback provides valuable information
to support requirements engineering (RE). However, analyzing online user
feedback is challenging due to its large volume and noise. Large language
models (LLMs) show strong potential to automate this process and outperform
previous techniques. They can also enable new tasks, such as generating
requirements specifications.
  [Question-Problem] Despite their potential, the use of LLMs to analyze user
feedback for RE remains underexplored. Existing studies offer limited empirical
evidence, lack thorough evaluation, and rarely provide replication packages,
undermining validity and reproducibility.
  [Principal Idea-Results] We evaluate five lightweight open-source LLMs on
three RE tasks: user request classification, NFR classification, and
requirements specification generation. Classification performance was measured
on two feedback datasets, and specification quality via human evaluation. LLMs
achieved moderate-to-high classification accuracy (F1 ~ 0.47-0.68) and
moderately high specification quality (mean ~ 3/5).
  [Contributions] We newly explore lightweight LLMs for feedback-driven
requirements development. Our contributions are: (i) an empirical evaluation of
lightweight LLMs on three RE tasks, (ii) a replication package, and (iii)
insights into their capabilities and limitations for RE.

*Ella Dodor,Cristina V. Lopes*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Checkstyle+ improves code style violation detection by combining a traditional tool with large language model capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of traditional linters in detecting nuanced style violations in programming.

Method: Introducing Checkstyle+, which augments the traditional Checkstyle tool with large language model (LLM) capabilities.

Result: Checkstyle+ outperforms Checkstyle in identifying semantically nuanced style violations in Java code.

Conclusion: Checkstyle+ enhances software quality by combining rule-based mechanisms and LLMs for superior style violation detection.

Abstract: Good code style improves program readability, maintainability, and
collaboration, and is an integral component of software quality. Developers,
however, often cut corners when following style rules, leading to the wide
adoption of tools such as linters in professional software development
projects. Traditional linters like Checkstyle operate using rigid, rule-based
mechanisms that effectively detect many surface-level violations. However, in
most programming languages, there is a subset of style rules that require a
more nuanced understanding of code, and fall outside the scope of such static
analysis. In this paper, we propose Checkstyle+, a hybrid approach that
augments Checkstyle with large language model (LLM) capabilities, to identify
style violations that elude the conventional rule-based analysis. Checkstyle+
is evaluated on a sample of 380 Java code files, drawn from a broader dataset
of 30,800 real-world Java programs sourced from accepted Codeforces
submissions. The results show that Checkstyle+ achieves superior performance
over standard Checkstyle in detecting violations of the semantically nuanced
rules.

### [601] [Validating Formal Specifications with LLM-generated Test Cases](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23350)
*Alcino Cunha,Nuno Macedo*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper explores using GPT-5 and other LLMs to automate test case generation for validating formal specifications, showing promising accuracy in detecting specification errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Validation of formal specifications is often overlooked due to its challenging and error-prone nature. Automating test case generation can alleviate these burdens.

Method: The study evaluates GPT-5 and other LLMs to autonomously generate test cases for natural language requirements in the Alloy specification language.

Result: GPT-5 effectively creates syntactically correct positive and negative test cases, aligns with requirements, and detects errors in human-written specifications.

Conclusion: Large language models, particularly GPT-5, are potent tools for automating validation tasks, displaying high utility and accuracy in generating test cases for formal specifications.

Abstract: Validation is a central activity when developing formal specifications.
Similarly to coding, a possible validation technique is to define upfront test
cases or scenarios that a future specification should satisfy or not.
Unfortunately, specifying such test cases is burdensome and error prone, which
could cause users to skip this validation task. This paper reports the results
of an empirical evaluation of using pre-trained large language models (LLMs) to
automate the generation of test cases from natural language requirements. In
particular, we focus on test cases for structural requirements of simple domain
models formalized in the Alloy specification language. Our evaluation focuses
on the state-of-art GPT-5 model, but results from other closed- and open-source
LLMs are also reported. The results show that, in this context, GPT-5 is
already quite effective at generating positive (and negative) test cases that
are syntactically correct and that satisfy (or not) the given requirement, and
that can detect many wrong specifications written by humans.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper addresses verifying neural networks for safety-critical systems with NeuroCodeBench 2.0, consisting of 912 verification examples. Current tools achieve limited effectiveness in solving the benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural networks must be proven safe before deploying them in safety-critical systems, but existing verification methods fail at the software level.

Method: The authors developed NeuroCodeBench 2.0 with precise specifications in C, enabling evaluation and implementation in verification competitions like SV-COMP.

Result: An evaluation on eight state-of-the-art software verifiers revealed they could solve roughly 11% of benchmarks, often producing 3% incorrect results.

Conclusion: NeuroCodeBench 2.0 enhances the field's ability to study and improve neural network code verification performance.

Abstract: The behaviour of neural network components must be proven correct before
deployment in safety-critical systems. Unfortunately, existing neural network
verification techniques cannot certify the absence of faults at the software
level. In this paper, we show how to specify and verify that neural networks
are safe, by explicitly reasoning about their floating-point implementation. In
doing so, we construct NeuroCodeBench 2.0, a benchmark comprising 912 neural
network verification examples that cover activation functions, common layers,
and full neural networks of up to 170K parameters. Our verification suite is
written in plain C and is compatible with the format of the International
Competition on Software Verification (SV-COMP). Thanks to it, we can conduct
the first rigorous evaluation of eight state-of-the-art software verifiers on
neural network code. The results show that existing automated verification
tools can correctly solve an average of 11% of our benchmark, while producing
around 3% incorrect verdicts. At the same time, a historical analysis reveals
that the release of our benchmark has already had a significantly positive
impact on the latter.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces ML System Maps to systematically attribute causes of distribution shifts in machine learning systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current monitoring practices focus on detecting distribution shifts without systematically identifying their causes, which often requires manual intervention.

Method: The proposed ML System Maps uses layered causal maps to make propagation paths within ML systems explicit, aiding root-cause analysis.

Result: The paper outlines the approach and presents a research agenda for developing and evaluating ML System Maps.

Conclusion: ML System Maps have the potential to improve monitoring and diagnosis of machine learning systems, bridging gaps in systematic root-cause analysis.

Abstract: Monitoring machine learning (ML) systems is hard, with standard practice
focusing on detecting distribution shifts rather than their causes. Root-cause
analysis often relies on manual tracing to determine whether a shift is caused
by software faults, data-quality issues, or natural change. We propose ML
System Maps -- causal maps that, through layered views, make explicit the
propagation paths between the environment and the ML system's internals,
enabling systematic attribution of distribution shifts. We outline the approach
and a research agenda for its development and evaluation.

TL;DR: The paper presents a novel method for synthetically generating diverse and realistic bugs for training language model-based software engineering agents, improving their fine-tuning performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for realistic, high-quality bugs that better reflect human development for improved training of software engineering agents.

Method: The method involves instructing SWE agents to introduce features into codebases that unintentionally generate bugs, focusing on mimicking human-like bug patterns rather than synthetic perturbations.

Result: Synthetic bugs created using the proposed method improved training efficiency, achieving state-of-the-art performance on SWE-bench Verified with significant accuracy gains using less data.

Conclusion: The approach provides a more realistic method to generate training data, outperforming existing datasets in efficiency and performance, and showcasing the potential for advancing SWE agents.

Abstract: High quality bugs are key to training the next generation of language model
based software engineering (SWE) agents. We introduce a novel method for
synthetic generation of difficult and diverse bugs. Our method instructs SWE
Agents to introduce a feature into the codebase whereby they may
unintentionally break tests, resulting in bugs. Prior approaches often induce
an out-of-distribution effect by generating bugs intentionally (e.g. by
introducing local perturbation to existing code), which does not reflect
realistic development processes. We perform qualitative analysis to demonstrate
that our approach for generating bugs more closely reflects the patterns found
in human-authored edits. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our
bugs provide more efficient training data for supervised fine-tuning,
outperforming other bug datasets by 2% with half the training data (1.2k vs. 3k
bugs). We train on our newly generated bugs in addition to existing bug
datasets to get FrogBoss a state-of-the-art 32B parameter model on SWE-bench
Verified with a pass@1 of 54.6% and FrogMini a state-of-the-art 14B model on
SWE-bench Verified with a pass@1 of 45.3% on SWE-bench Verified averaged over

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: This paper analyzes correlations in recurrent neural networks with nonlinear activation, providing exact expressions for statistics and incorporating corrections using a path-integral representation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understand the collective dynamics and correlations in recurrent neural networks to improve theoretical models for neural computation.

Method: Path-integral representation is employed to compute correlations and derive systematic expressions for nonlinear activation functions, extending previous linear models.

Result: Exact correlation statistics derived for nonlinear networks, validated by numerical simulations. Explicit scaling behavior and predictions for specific activation functions are provided.

Conclusion: The introduced method generalizes correlation analysis, revealing scaling and validating nonlinear activation functions for improved stability in recurrent networks.

Abstract: The statistics of correlations are central quantities characterizing the
collective dynamics of recurrent neural networks. We derive exact expressions
for the statistics of correlations of nonlinear recurrent networks in the limit
of a large number N of neurons, including systematic 1/N corrections. Our
approach uses a path-integral representation of the network's stochastic
dynamics, which reduces the description to a few collective variables and
enables efficient computation. This generalizes previous results on linear
networks to include a wide family of nonlinear activation functions, which
enter as interaction terms in the path integral. These interactions can resolve
the instability of the linear theory and yield a strictly positive
participation dimension. We present explicit results for power-law activations,
revealing scaling behavior controlled by the network coupling. In addition, we
introduce a class of activation functions based on Pade approximants and
provide analytic predictions for their correlation statistics. Numerical
simulations confirm our theoretical results with excellent agreement.

*Caitlin Callaghan,David J Reinkensmeyer*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: Transfer of proprioceptive experiences to working memory leads to temporal and structural distortions as well as rapid degradation in accuracy, limiting memory span to four movements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how short-term memory influences the accuracy of recalling previously experienced movements important for various activities.

Method: Two experiments were conducted comparing movement reproduction under simultaneous (SimRep) and memorized (MemRep) conditions, using haptic trajectory tasks with varied duration and complexity.

Result: MemRep showed greater errors, temporal distortions, quicker decay in accuracy, and a memory span limitation of four movements, compared to SimRep.

Conclusion: Proprioceptive working memory exhibits rapid decay in accuracy, introducing distortions and limited capacity for trajectory reproduction with implications for applications in sports, music, and rehabilitation.

Abstract: Recalling previously experienced movements is essential for a range of
activities, including sports, music, and rehabilitation, yet little is known
about the accuracy and decay of proprioceptive working memory. We examined how
introducing a short-term memory component affected movement reproduction
accuracy by comparing movement reproduction under two conditions: simultaneous
reproduction (SimRep) and memorized reproduction (MemRep). In Experiment 1 (N =
191), participants felt a 5-s haptic trajectory with one hand and reproduced it
with the other hand simultaneously or immediately after the template ended.
Errors were greater in MemRep than SimRep (31.1 deg vs. 21.5 deg, p < 0.001).
MemRep trajectories showed systematic temporal distortions: participants lagged
fast movements and led slow ones (R = -0.32, p = 0.01), unlike the ~279 ms lag
in SimRep. In Experiment 2 (N = 33), we varied template durations (2-8 s).
Longer durations increased error for MemRep but not SimRep (p < 0.001). During
MemRep, accuracy declined steadily, with replay-template correlations dropping
from ~0.4 to ~0.1 over ~3 s, while SimRep correlations rose from ~0.25 to ~0.6.
In ~10% of MemRep templates, participants moved in the wrong direction
initially, especially for low-amplitude movements (p < 0.001). Templates with
more than four movements showed element omission; after four movements had been
reproduced participants ceased movement prematurely, affecting up to 40% of 8-s
templates. These findings show that transferring proprioceptive experiences
into working memory introduces systematic temporal and structural distortions.
Accuracy decays within seconds, and memory span for movement trajectories was
limited to four movements.

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: This paper presents a lateral ventricular brain-computer interface (LV-BCI) which leverages a lantern-inspired electrode design for stable, long-term neural signal acquisition and improved prediction accuracy in memory-related tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations of subdural ECoG electrodes in terms of signal stability and immunocompatibility, as well as to enhance neural signal acquisition from deeper brain structures.

Method: A flexible, expandable electrode was implanted into the lateral ventricle via minimally invasive pathways, inspired by Chinese lantern design, ensuring sustained signal quality and immune compatibility.

Result: The LV-BCI demonstrated superior signal stability, higher signal-to-noise ratio for over 112 days, and minimal immune response lasting up to 168 days. It achieved 98% prediction accuracy in memory-related tasks, outperforming subdural ECoG electrodes.

Conclusion: The lateral ventricle offers a robust pathway for neural signal capture, and the lantern-inspired electrode design provides durable and precise neural recordings, advancing BCI and systems neuroscience technologies.

Abstract: We present a lateral ventricular brain-computer interface (LV-BCI) that
deploys an expandable, flexible electrode into the lateral ventricle through a
minimally invasive external ventricular drainage pathway. Inspired by the
framework of traditional Chinese lanterns, the electrode expands uniformly
within the ventricle and conforms to the ependymal wall. Compared with
conventional subdural ECoG electrodes, the LV-BCI shows superior signal
stability and immunocompatibility. Resting-state spectral analyses revealed a
maximum effective bandwidth comparable to subdural ECoG. In evoked potential
tests, the LV-BCI maintained a consistently higher signal-to-noise ratio over
112 days without the decline typically associated with scarring or other immune
responses. Immunohistochemistry showed only a transient, early microglial
activation after implantation, returning to control levels and remaining stable
through 168 days. We further designed an "action-memory T-maze" task and
developed a microstate sequence classifier (MSSC) to predict rats' turn
decisions. The LV-BCI achieved prediction accuracy up to 98%, significantly
outperforming subdural ECoG, indicating enhanced access to decision-related
information from deep structures such as the hippocampus. These results
establish the lateral ventricle as a viable route for neural signal
acquisition. Using a lantern-inspired flexible electrode, we achieve long-term
stable recordings and robust memory decision decoding from within the
ventricular system, opening new directions for BCI technology and systems
neuroscience.

*Samir Damji,Simrut Kurry,Shazia'Ayn Babul,Joydeep Bhattacharya,Naznin Virji-Babul*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: The paper investigates resting-state EEG connectivity patterns to differentiate individuals based on their creativity, finding two distinct neural signatures corresponding to high and low creativity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to uncover how creativity is represented in the brain's intrinsic functional architecture using resting-state EEG, which captures temporally precise neural dynamics.

Method: The study used EEG-based functional connectivity analysis and graph-theoretical clustering on a dataset of 30 adults. Creativity was assessed via four metrics: ICAA, DAT, MAPT, and self-ratings.

Result: Two participant clusters emerged: Cluster 1 (higher creativity) displayed alpha-band hypoconnectivity, greater modularity, and preserved left frontal connectivity; Cluster 0 (lower creativity) showed stronger connectivity, reduced modularity, and higher local clustering.

Conclusion: Resting-state EEG connectivity can serve as a stable indicator of creativity, linking adaptive cognition to efficient and flexible neural network organization.

Abstract: Understanding how creativity is represented in the brain's intrinsic
functional architecture remains a central challenge in cognitive neuroscience.
While resting-state fMRI studies have revealed large-scale network correlates
of creative potential, electroencephalography (EEG) offers a temporally precise
and scalable approach to capture the fast oscillatory dynamics that underlie
spontaneous neural organization. In this study, we used a data-driven network
approach to examine whether resting-state EEG connectivity patterns
differentiate individuals according to their creative abilities. Creativity was
evaluated by: The Inventory of Creative Activities and Achievements (ICAA), The
Divergent Association Task (DAT), The Matchstick Arithmetic Puzzles Task (MAPT)
and Self-rating (SR) of creative ability in 30 healthy young adults.
Graph-theoretical analyses were applied to functional connectivity matrices and
clustered based on graph similarity. Two distinct participant clusters emerged,
differing systematically across multiple dimensions of creativity. Cluster 1,
characterized by consistently higher performance across multiple creativity
variables (ICAA, DAT, MAPT and SR), showed broad alpha-band hypoconnectivity,
relatively preserved left frontal connectivity and greater network modularity.
Cluster 0, associated with lower creativity scores, exhibited stronger overall
connectivity strength, reduced modularity and higher local clustering. These
findings suggest that resting-state EEG connectivity patterns can index stable
cognitive traits such as creativity. More broadly, they point to an intrinsic
neural signature of adaptive brain function marked by efficient yet flexible
network organization that may support creative and adaptive cognition.

### [609] [Neural Recording Power Optimization Through Machine Learning Guided Resolution Reconfiguration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22924)
*Aviral Pandey,Dhruv Vaish,I-Ting Lin,Rikky Muller*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: This paper introduces a method called resolution reconfiguration to optimize power usage in neural recording implants by scaling down the resolution of less important channels, demonstrating significant power savings across various applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Due to the high power consumption of circuits amplifying and digitizing neural signals in neural recording implants, along with limited room for improvement in circuit design, a system-level approach is needed to reduce power further.

Method: The authors propose resolution reconfiguration, which reduces power by lowering the resolution of less important neural recording channels, guided by the variable importance of channels in machine-learning-based decoders.

Result: The proposed resolution reconfiguration method achieved power savings of 8.7x, 12.8x, and 23.0x for tasks such as seizure detection, gesture recognition, and force regression compared to traditional methods, and outperformed the channel selection method with 1.6x, 3.4x, and 5.2x savings respectively.

Conclusion: Resolution reconfigurable front-ends are an effective strategy to significantly reduce power consumption in neural recording implants and are broadly applicable to neural decoding tasks.

Abstract: Neural recording implants are a crucial tool for both neuroscience research
and enabling new clinical applications. The power consumption of high channel
count implants is dominated by the circuits used to amplify and digitize neural
signals. Since circuit designers have pushed the efficiency of these circuits
close to the theoretical physical limits, reducing power further requires
system level optimization. Recent advances use a strategy called channel
selection, in which less important channels are turned off to save power. We
demonstrate resolution reconfiguration, in which the resolution of less
important channels is scaled down to save power. Our approach leverages
variable importance of each channel inside machine-learning-based decoders and
we trial this methodology across three applications: seizure detection, gesture
recognition, and force regression. With linear decoders, resolution
reconfiguration saves 8.7x, 12.8x, and 23.0x power compared to a traditional
recording array for each task respectively. It further saves 1.6x, 3.4x, and
5.2x power compared to channel selection. The results demonstrate the power
benefits of resolution reconfigurable front-ends and their wide applicability
to neural decoding problems.

### [610] [Model-Behavior Alignment under Flexible Evaluation: When the Best-Fitting Model Isn't the Right One](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23321)
*Itamar Avitan,Tal Golan*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: Linearly aligned deep neural network models to behavioral data highlight challenges in identifying genuine representational alignment, with misidentifications occurring due to representational geometry shifts and dimensionality constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate if test accuracy in aligning neural network representations to human behavioral data truly reflects representational alignment.

Method: A model-recovery study was conducted where synthetic data simulated from diverse vision models were tested against the behavior-based alignment process and analyzed for identifiability issues.

Result: Even with large-scale training data, model recovery accuracy plateaued below 80%, influenced by transformed representational geometry and feature dimensionality.

Conclusion: Alignment metrics must balance predictive accuracy with identifiability to ensure models genuinely reflect human-aligned representations.

Abstract: Linearly transforming stimulus representations of deep neural networks yields
high-performing models of behavioral and neural responses to complex stimuli.
But does the test accuracy of such predictions identify genuine
representational alignment? We addressed this question through a large-scale
model-recovery study. Twenty diverse vision models were linearly aligned to 4.5
million behavioral judgments from the THINGS odd-one-out dataset and calibrated
to reproduce human response variability. For each model in turn, we sampled
synthetic responses from its probabilistic predictions, fitted all candidate
models to the synthetic data, and tested whether the data-generating model
would re-emerge as the best predictor of the simulated data. Model recovery
accuracy improved with training-set size but plateaued below 80%, even at
millions of simulated trials. Regression analyses linked misidentification
primarily to shifts in representational geometry induced by the linear
transformation, as well as to the effective dimensionality of the transformed
features. These findings demonstrate that, even with massive behavioral data,
overly flexible alignment metrics may fail to guide us toward artificial
representations that are genuinely more human-aligned. Model comparison
experiments must be designed to balance the trade-off between predictive
accuracy and identifiability-ensuring that the best-fitting model is also the
right one.

*Li Zhaoping*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: This paper investigates how V1 intracortical axons contribute to contextual influences enabling global visual computations, challenging the belief that only feedback from higher visual areas is responsible.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how global scene properties arise from the activity of early visual cortical neurons with small receptive fields, influenced by contextual inputs.

Method: Examines pre-existing data to analyze conduction speed of V1 intracortical axons and evaluate their role in conveying contextual influences.

Result: Finds that V1 intracortical axons have sufficiently high conduction speeds for transmitting contextual information, contrary to previous beliefs.

Conclusion: Acknowledging the significant role of intracortical axons in visual processing can lead to advances in addressing unresolved questions in visual computation research.

Abstract: A critical visual computation is to construct global scene properties from
activities of early visual cortical neurons which have small receptive fields.
Such a computation is enabled by contextual influences, through which a
neuron's response to visual inputs is influenced by contextual inputs outside
its classical receptive fields. Accordingly, neurons can signal global
properties including visual saliencies and figure-ground relationships. Many
believe that intracortical axons conduct signals too slowly to bring the
contextual information from receptive fields of other neurons. A popular
opinion is that much of the contextual influences arise from feedback from
higher visual areas whose neurons have larger receptive fields. This paper
re-examines pre-existing data to reveal these unexpected findings: the
conduction speed of V1 intracortical axons increases approximately linearly
with the conduction distance, and is sufficiently high for conveying the
contextual influences. Recognizing the importance of intracortical contribution
to critical visual computations should enable fresh progress in answering
long-standing questions.

### [612] [Bridging Prediction and Attribution: Identifying Forward and Backward Causal Influence Ranges Using Assimilative Causal Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21889)
*Marios Andreou,Nan Chen*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper integrates observations with dynamical models using Assimilative Causal Inference (ACI) to understand causal influence ranges over time and introduces computations for causality characterization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve causal inference by not only identifying causal relationships but also establishing a framework to quantify when these influences start and how long they persist, especially in complex dynamical systems.

Method: This paper employs ACI, which combines Bayesian data assimilation and mathematical formulations of forward and backward causal influence ranges (CIR) to trace the cause-and-effect dynamics effectively over time.

Result: The study introduces robust metrics, efficient algorithms, and closed-form expressions to compute CIRs, allowing a deeper exploration of nonlinear dynamics. Applications demonstrate advances in understanding phenomena like bifurcations, noise-induced tipping points, and atmospheric mechanisms with scientific and practical implications.

Conclusion: This framework enhances the ability to trace and quantify temporal causal effects in dynamical systems, offering new tools for scientific analysis and decision-making in areas such as Earth systems and policy-making.

Abstract: Causal inference identifies cause-and-effect relationships between variables.
While traditional approaches rely on data to reveal causal links, a recently
developed method, assimilative causal inference (ACI), integrates observations
with dynamical models. It utilizes Bayesian data assimilation to trace causes
back from observed effects by quantifying the reduction in uncertainty. ACI
advances the detection of instantaneous causal relationships and the
intermittent reversal of causal roles over time. Beyond identifying causal
connections, an equally important challenge is determining the associated
causal influence range (CIR), indicating when causal influences emerged and for
how long they persist. In this paper, ACI is employed to develop mathematically
rigorous formulations of both forward and backward CIRs at each time. The
forward CIR quantifies the temporal impact of a cause, while the backward CIR
traces the onset of triggers for an observed effect, thus characterizing causal
predictability and attribution of outcomes at each transient phase,
respectively. Objective and robust metrics for both CIRs are introduced,
eliminating the need for empirical thresholds. Computationally efficient
approximation algorithms to compute CIRs are developed, which facilitate the
use of closed-form expressions for a broad class of nonlinear dynamical
systems. Numerical simulations demonstrate how this forward and backward CIR
framework provides new possibilities for probing complex dynamical systems. It
advances the study of bifurcation-driven and noise-induced tipping points in
Earth systems, investigates the impact from resolving the interfering variables
when determining the influence ranges, and elucidates atmospheric blocking
mechanisms in the equatorial region. These results have direct implications for
science, policy, and decision-making.

*Yuli Slavutsky,Sebastian Salazar,David M. Blei*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces IA-BMA, a Bayesian method to dynamically combine outputs of multiple models based on input, achieving better-calibrated and more accurate predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address challenges in combining predictions from different models, particularly in heterogeneous settings where diverse inputs require distinct model performances.

Method: The method, IA-BMA, assigns weights to models dependent on the input by employing an input adaptive prior. It adapts its posterior distribution using amortized variational inference.

Result: IA-BMA was tested on datasets including cancer treatment, credit card fraud, and others. It outperformed non-adaptive and other adaptive methods in both accuracy and calibration.

Conclusion: IA-BMA effectively leverages input-based adaptation, making it superior over alternative approaches, especially in heterogeneous prediction tasks.

Abstract: This paper studies prediction with multiple candidate models, where the goal
is to combine their outputs. This task is especially challenging in
heterogeneous settings, where different models may be better suited to
different inputs. We propose input adaptive Bayesian Model Averaging (IA-BMA),
a Bayesian method that assigns model weights conditional on the input. IA-BMA
employs an input adaptive prior, and yields a posterior distribution that
adapts to each prediction, which we estimate with amortized variational
inference. We derive formal guarantees for its performance, relative to any
single predictor selected per input. We evaluate IABMA across regression and
classification tasks, studying data from personalized cancer treatment,
credit-card fraud detection, and UCI datasets. IA-BMA consistently delivers
more accurate and better-calibrated predictions than both non-adaptive
baselines and existing adaptive methods.

*Petros Prastakos,Kayhan Behdin,Rahul Mazumder*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper introduces pure differentially private estimators for sparse variable selection using Mixed Integer Programming techniques, achieving state-of-the-art support recovery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of exploration into Differential Privacy in sparse variable selection, enhancing interpretability and generalization in high-dimensional learning.

Method: The authors developed structured sampling procedures inspired by the exponential mechanism to efficiently handle the non-convex objective landscape without exhaustive searches.

Result: Their methods achieved theoretical support recovery guarantees and state-of-the-art empirical performance in sparse regression/classification, consistently outperforming competitors with up to $p=10^4$ variables.

Conclusion: By leveraging modern MIP techniques, this paper bridges the gap between sparse variable selection and Differential Privacy, offering significant advancements in both theoretical guarantees and empirical results.

Abstract: Sparse variable selection improves interpretability and generalization in
high-dimensional learning by selecting a small subset of informative features.
Recent advances in Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) have enabled solving
large-scale non-private sparse regression - known as Best Subset Selection
(BSS) - with millions of variables in minutes. However, extending these
algorithmic advances to the setting of Differential Privacy (DP) has remained
largely unexplored. In this paper, we introduce two new pure differentially
private estimators for sparse variable selection, levering modern MIP
techniques. Our framework is general and applies broadly to problems like
sparse regression or classification, and we provide theoretical support
recovery guarantees in the case of BSS. Inspired by the exponential mechanism,
we develop structured sampling procedures that efficiently explore the
non-convex objective landscape, avoiding the exhaustive combinatorial search in
the exponential mechanism. We complement our theoretical findings with
extensive numerical experiments, using both least squares and hinge loss for
our objective function, and demonstrate that our methods achieve
state-of-the-art empirical support recovery, outperforming competing algorithms
in settings with up to $p=10^4$.

### [615] [Frequentist Validity of Epistemic Uncertainty Estimators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22063)
*Anchit Jain,Stephen Bates*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces a frequentist measure for epistemic uncertainty using bootstrap and establishes its equivalence to Bayesian mutual information under asymptotic conditions, while also connecting it to deep ensemble methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding and decomposing prediction uncertainty into aleatoric and epistemic components is critical for reliable machine learning systems, with epistemic uncertainty being particularly challenging to measure due to the difficulty of accessing posterior distributions.

Method: The authors propose a frequentist measure for epistemic uncertainty based on bootstrap and derive a novel asymptotic expansion showing its equivalence to the mutual information measure in Bayesian inference.

Result: The proposed frequentist measure aligns with Bayesian mutual information asymptotically, offering frequentist interpretations and computational strategies for mutual information, and providing insights into the success of deep ensemble methods.

Conclusion: The frequentist bootstrap-based approach is a practical and theoretically grounded alternative for quantifying epistemic uncertainty, enhancing computational feasibility and providing new insights into established methods like deep ensembles.

Abstract: Decomposing prediction uncertainty into its aleatoric (irreducible) and
epistemic (reducible) components is critical for the development and deployment
of machine learning systems. A popular, principled measure for epistemic
uncertainty is the mutual information between the response variable and model
parameters. However, evaluating this measure requires access to the posterior
distribution of the model parameters, which is challenging to compute. In view
of this, we introduce a frequentist measure of epistemic uncertainty based on
the bootstrap. Our main theoretical contribution is a novel asymptotic
expansion that reveals that our proposed (frequentist) measure and the
(Bayesian) mutual information are asymptotically equivalent. This provides
frequentist interpretations to mutual information and new computational
strategies for approximating it. Moreover, we link our proposed approach to the
widely-used heuristic approach of deep ensembles, giving added perspective on
their practical success.

*Giora Simchoni,Saharon Rosset*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: MMbeddings is a probabilistic embedding method built on variational autoencoders that replaces traditional large embeddings with a more efficient approach, reducing computation and overfitting in high-cardinality tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address overfitting and high computational costs in traditional categorical embeddings, particularly for tasks involving large cardinalities.

Method: The authors reinterpret categorical embeddings as latent random effects within a variational autoencoder framework, which reduces parameters from embedding cardinality to an encoder-architecture-driven number.

Result: Extensive experiments show that MMbeddings outperforms traditional embedding techniques in applications such as collaborative filtering and tabular regression.

Conclusion: MMbeddings combines classical statistical methods with modern deep learning to offer an efficient, scalable solution for high-cardinality machine learning problems, showcasing its broad potential in various applications.

Abstract: We present MMbeddings, a probabilistic embedding approach that reinterprets
categorical embeddings through the lens of nonlinear mixed models, effectively
bridging classical statistical theory with modern deep learning. By treating
embeddings as latent random effects within a variational autoencoder framework,
our method substantially decreases the number of parameters -- from the
conventional embedding approach of cardinality $\times$ embedding dimension,
which quickly becomes infeasible with large cardinalities, to a significantly
smaller, cardinality-independent number determined primarily by the encoder
architecture. This reduction dramatically mitigates overfitting and
computational burden in high-cardinality settings. Extensive experiments on
simulated and real datasets, encompassing collaborative filtering and tabular
regression tasks using varied architectures, demonstrate that MMbeddings
consistently outperforms traditional embeddings, underscoring its potential
across diverse machine learning applications.

*Hans Jarett Ong,Yoichi Chikahara,Tomoharu Iwata*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: MetaCaDI introduces a meta-learning framework for discovering causal graphs and unknown interventions, excelling in few-shot data scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To better uncover causal mechanisms in complex systems with high data collection costs and unknown interventions.

Method: Introduces MetaCaDI, a Bayesian framework leveraging meta-learning and analytical adaptation for causal graph discovery and intervention target prediction.

Result: MetaCaDI outperforms state-of-the-art methods in recovering causal graphs and predicting intervention targets with limited data.

Conclusion: MetaCaDI is a robust approach for discovering causal structures and unknown interventions, reliable even in data-scarce cases.

Abstract: Uncovering the underlying causal mechanisms of complex real-world systems
remains a significant challenge, as these systems often entail high data
collection costs and involve unknown interventions. We introduce MetaCaDI, the
first framework to cast the joint discovery of a causal graph and unknown
interventions as a meta-learning problem. MetaCaDI is a Bayesian framework that
learns a shared causal graph structure across multiple experiments and is
optimized to rapidly adapt to new, few-shot intervention target prediction
tasks. A key innovation is our model's analytical adaptation, which uses a
closed-form solution to bypass expensive and potentially unstable
gradient-based bilevel optimization. Extensive experiments on synthetic and
complex gene expression data demonstrate that MetaCaDI significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art methods. It excels at both causal graph recovery
and identifying intervention targets from as few as 10 data instances, proving
its robustness in data-scarce scenarios.

### [618] [Beyond Isotonization: Scalable Non-Crossing Quantile Estimation via Neural Networks for Student Growth Percentiles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22419)
*Kaihua Chang*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper critiques the current methodology employed in Student Growth Percentiles and introduces neural network-based multi-quantile regression (NNQR) as a computationally efficient and theoretically valid solution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address inherent methodological inconsistencies in the widely used Student Growth Percentiles (SGPs), specifically issues with the isotonic projection method causing quantile crossing violations.

Method: They propose NNQR, utilizing shared hidden layers and stochastic gradient descent optimization for multi-quantile regression, which ensures scalability and reduces quantile crossing.

Result: Empirical analysis shows NNQR effectively maintains monotonicity and scales efficiently compared to constrained joint quantile regression (CJQR) and independent quantile regression methods.

Conclusion: NNQR is a scalable and valid alternative for Student Growth Percentiles, resolving theoretical inconsistencies and operational challenges posed by traditional methods.

Abstract: Student Growth Percentiles (SGPs), widely adopted across U.S. state
assessment systems, employ independent quantile regression followed by post-hoc
correction using an isotonic projection method (\texttt{isotonize=TRUE} in the
\texttt{SGP} R package) to address quantile crossing. We demonstrate this
approach contains a fundamental methodological inconsistency: interpolation
between independently-estimated, potentially crossed quantiles requires
monotonicity, yet the post-hoc correction alters estimates in ways that may
violate the quantile property $P(Y \leq \hat{Q}_{\tau}(Y|X) \mid X) = \tau$. We
term this the \emph{interpolation paradox}. While theoretically sound
constrained joint quantile regression (CJQR) eliminates crossing by enforcing
non-crossing constraints during optimization, we analyze its computational
complexity (often scaling poorly, e.g., $\mathcal{O}((qn)^3)$ for standard LP
solvers) rendering it intractable for large-scale educational data ($n >
100{,}000$). We examine the SGP package's switch to the Frisch-Newton interior
point method (\texttt{rq.method.for.large.n="fn"}) for large $N$, noting that
while efficient for \emph{independent} QR, it doesn't resolve the joint
problem's complexity or the paradox. We propose neural network-based
multi-quantile regression (NNQR) with shared hidden layers as a practical
alternative. Leveraging the convexity of the composite pinball loss, SGD-based
optimization used in NN training can reliably approach the global optimum,
offering scalability ($O(n)$) and implicitly reducing crossing. Our empirical
analysis shows independent QR yields crossing, while both CJQR and NNQR enforce
monotonicity. NNQR emerges as a viable, scalable alternative for operational
SGP systems, aligning theoretical validity with computational feasibility.

### [619] [Statistical Analysis of the Sinkhorn Iterations for Two-Sample Schrödinger Bridge Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22560)
*Ibuki Maeda,Rentian Yao,Atsushi Nitanda*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper studies the statistical performance of the Sinkhorn Bridge method for estimating Schrödinger bridges in finite-sample scenarios with theoretical guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to analyze the statistical performance of Schrödinger bridge estimators under finite-sample conditions and extend existing guarantees in practical two-sample estimation settings.

Method: The authors establish statistical bounds on squared total variation errors for Sinkhorn bridge iterations, considering finite sample sizes from source and target distributions.

Result: The study introduces a theoretical bound: $O(1/m+1/n + r^{4k})$ for squared total variation error, showing how sample sizes and the number of Sinkhorn iterations impact performance.

Conclusion: This research provides theoretical support for finite-sample performance of Schrödinger bridge estimators and highlights connections across multiple estimation methods, aiding in practical implementation of the Sinkhorn Bridge method.

Abstract: The Schr\"odinger bridge problem seeks the optimal stochastic process that
connects two given probability distributions with minimal energy modification.
While the Sinkhorn algorithm is widely used to solve the static optimal
transport problem, a recent work (Pooladian and Niles-Weed, 2024) proposed the
Sinkhorn bridge, which estimates Schr\"odinger bridges by plugging optimal
transport into the time-dependent drifts of SDEs, with statistical guarantees
in the one-sample estimation setting where the true source distribution is
fully accessible. In this work, to further justify this method, we study the
statistical performance of intermediate Sinkhorn iterations in the two-sample
estimation setting, where only finite samples from both source and target
distributions are available. Specifically, we establish a statistical bound on
the squared total variation error of Sinkhorn bridge iterations: $O(1/m+1/n +
r^{4k})~(r \in (0,1))$, where $m$ and $n$ are the sample sizes from the source
and target distributions, respectively, and $k$ is the number of Sinkhorn
iterations. This result provides a theoretical guarantee for the finite-sample
performance of the Schr\"odinger bridge estimator and offers practical guidance
for selecting sample sizes and the number of Sinkhorn iterations. Notably, our
theoretical results apply to several representative methods such as [SF]$^2$M,
DSBM-IMF, BM2, and LightSB(-M) under specific settings, through the previously
unnoticed connection between these estimators.

TL;DR: This paper presents a semi-supervised learning framework that utilizes causal perspective for better predictive modeling, leveraging unlabelled data for synthetic labeled data generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to understand why unlabelled data improves SSL and incorporates causal relations between features and labels to create sophisticated models.

Method: It proposes a SSL framework based on general causal models, focusing on causal graph structures and causal generative models to utilize unlabelled data.

Result: The proposed method effectively generates synthetic labeled data, improving predictive accuracy, as shown through experiments on simulated and real datasets.

Conclusion: Integrating causal models into SSL enables more effective usage of unlabelled data, enhancing the performance of predictive models.

Abstract: Semi-supervised learning (SSL) aims to train a machine learning model using
both labelled and unlabelled data. While the unlabelled data have been used in
various ways to improve the prediction accuracy, the reason why unlabelled data
could help is not fully understood. One interesting and promising direction is
to understand SSL from a causal perspective. In light of the independent causal
mechanisms principle, the unlabelled data can be helpful when the label causes
the features but not vice versa. However, the causal relations between the
features and labels can be complex in real world applications. In this paper,
we propose a SSL framework that works with general causal models in which the
variables have flexible causal relations. More specifically, we explore the
causal graph structures and design corresponding causal generative models which
can be learned with the help of unlabelled data. The learned causal generative
model can generate synthetic labelled data for training a more accurate
predictive model. We verify the effectiveness of our proposed method by
empirical studies on both simulated and real data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in existing Block Coordinate Descent (BCD) methods in deep neural networks, particularly their convergence to global minima and generalization performance.

Method: The paper analyzes BCD under strictly monotonically increasing activations and ReLU activations, proving global minima convergence via theoretical bounds and introducing modifications like skip connections and non-negative projection.

Result: The paper provides strong optimization guarantees, including global minima convergence and generalization bounds. Experimental results validate the theory, showing small losses with monotonic activations and ReLU.

Conclusion: The modified BCD algorithm is theoretically and empirically shown to achieve favorable optimization and generalization performance for deep neural networks under both strictly monotonic and ReLU activations.

Abstract: In this paper, we consider a block coordinate descent (BCD) algorithm for
training deep neural networks and provide a new global convergence guarantee
under strictly monotonically increasing activation functions. While existing
works demonstrate convergence to stationary points for BCD in neural networks,
our contribution is the first to prove convergence to global minima, ensuring
arbitrarily small loss. We show that the loss with respect to the output layer
decreases exponentially while the loss with respect to the hidden layers
remains well-controlled. Additionally, we derive generalization bounds using
the Rademacher complexity framework, demonstrating that BCD not only achieves
strong optimization guarantees but also provides favorable generalization
performance. Moreover, we propose a modified BCD algorithm with skip
connections and non-negative projection, extending our convergence guarantees
to ReLU activation, which are not strictly monotonic. Empirical experiments
confirm our theoretical findings, showing that the BCD algorithm achieves a
small loss for strictly monotonic and ReLU activations.

TL;DR: The paper introduces OEUVRE, an online learning loss estimator which updates recursively with minimal resource usage, ensuring accurate estimates with theoretical guarantees and strong empirical performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the estimation of expected loss in online learning tasks, addressing current limitations around theoretical guarantees and practical hyperparameter tuning.

Method: The OEUVRE estimator is proposed, evaluating samples on current and prior models while leveraging algorithmic stability for efficient, recursive updates. Theoretical proofs and adaptive hyperparameter tuning techniques are provided.

Result: OEUVRE demonstrated strong consistency, optimal convergence, and robust performance across diverse tasks, outperforming other estimators even under oracle conditions.

Conclusion: The new estimator effectively achieves accurate loss estimation in online learning, supported by theoretical guarantees and adaptability, making it practical and reliable for various scenarios.

Abstract: Online learning algorithms continually update their models as data arrive,
making it essential to accurately estimate the expected loss at the current
time step. The prequential method is an effective estimation approach which can
be practically deployed in various ways. However, theoretical guarantees have
previously been established under strong conditions on the algorithm, and
practical algorithms have hyperparameters which require careful tuning. We
introduce OEUVRE, an estimator that evaluates each incoming sample on the
function learned at the current and previous time steps, recursively updating
the loss estimate in constant time and memory. We use algorithmic stability, a
property satisfied by many popular online learners, for optimal updates and
prove consistency, convergence rates, and concentration bounds for our
estimator. We design a method to adaptively tune OEUVRE's hyperparameters and
test it across diverse online and stochastic tasks. We observe that OEUVRE
matches or outperforms other estimators even when their hyperparameters are
tuned with oracle access to ground truth.

### [623] [Coupled Flow Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23015)
*Wenxi Cai,Yuheng Wang,Naichen Shi*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: CPFM proposes a method for dimensionality reduction and high-quality data reconstruction using coupled continuous flows.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional dimensionality reduction often leads to irreversible loss of information during compression.

Method: CPFM employs Gromov-Wasserstein optimal transport and dual-conditional flow-matching networks to retain and recover information.

Result: It produces semantically meaningful embeddings and reconstructs data more accurately than current methods.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates the potential to achieve controllable reduction while maintaining reconstruction fidelity.

Abstract: We introduce Coupled Flow Matching (CPFM), a framework that integrates
controllable dimensionality reduction and high-fidelity reconstruction. CPFM
learns coupled continuous flows for both the high-dimensional data x and the
low-dimensional embedding y, which enables sampling p(y|x) via a latent-space
flow and p(x|y) via a data-space flow. Unlike classical dimension-reduction
methods, where information discarded during compression is often difficult to
recover, CPFM preserves the knowledge of residual information within the
weights of a flow network. This design provides bespoke controllability: users
may decide which semantic factors to retain explicitly in the latent space,
while the complementary information remains recoverable through the flow
network. Coupled flow matching builds on two components: (i) an extended
Gromov-Wasserstein optimal transport objective that establishes a probabilistic
correspondence between data and embeddings, and (ii) a dual-conditional
flow-matching network that extrapolates the correspondence to the underlying
space. Experiments on multiple benchmarks show that CPFM yields semantically
rich embeddings and reconstructs data with higher fidelity than existing
baselines.

*Diego Marcondes*

TL;DR: This paper develops a theoretical framework for evaluating the statistical properties of physics-informed estimators and investigates the trade-offs between soft penalties and hard constraints in physics-informed statistical learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the lack of theoretical understanding on the impact of physics-informed regularization in statistical learning, focusing on its trade-offs and statistical gains compared to purely data-driven methods.

Method: Using the small-ball method, the authors derive complexity-dependent error rates for physics-informed estimators within convex function classes under linear physical constraints.

Result: The paper demonstrates that physics-informed estimators have error rates comparable to hard-constrained methods, differing only by constant terms, and that informed penalization reduces model complexity akin to dimensionality reduction.

Conclusion: This study bridges the gap between statistical theory and practical implementation of physics-informed statistical learning, offering insights into its advantages and providing a framework for further exploration in unexplored applications.

Abstract: Physics-informed statistical learning (PISL) integrates empirical data with
physical knowledge to enhance the statistical performance of estimators. While
PISL methods are widely used in practice, a comprehensive theoretical
understanding of how informed regularization affects statistical properties is
still missing. Specifically, two fundamental questions have yet to be fully
addressed: (1) what is the trade-off between considering soft penalties versus
hard constraints, and (2) what is the statistical gain of incorporating
physical knowledge compared to purely data-driven empirical error minimisation.
In this paper, we address these questions for PISL in convex classes of
functions under physical knowledge expressed as linear equations by developing
appropriate complexity dependent error rates based on the small-ball method. We
show that, under suitable assumptions, (1) the error rates of physics-informed
estimators are comparable to those of hard constrained empirical error
minimisers, differing only by constant terms, and that (2) informed
penalization can effectively reduce model complexity, akin to dimensionality
reduction, thereby improving learning performance. This work establishes a
theoretical framework for evaluating the statistical properties of
physics-informed estimators in convex classes of functions, contributing to
closing the gap between statistical theory and practical PISL, with potential
applications to cases not yet explored in the literature.

### [625] [Rate-optimal Design for Anytime Best Arm Identification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23199)
*Junpei Komiyama,Kyoungseok Jang,Junya Honda*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper addresses the best arm identification problem under limited sampling and proposes a practical, minimax optimal algorithm called "Almost Tracking" that eliminates shortcomings of existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research is motivated by scenarios like A/B testing, requiring effective identification of the highest reward option (best arm) under resource limitations.

Method: The "Almost Tracking" algorithm is introduced, which is designed to perform effectively on risk measure $H_1$, does not need prior budget knowledge, and avoids inefficient data discarding.

Result: Experiments demonstrate superior performance of "Almost Tracking" compared to existing algorithms on synthetic and real-world data.

Conclusion: The proposed algorithm provides a practical and robust solution to the best arm identification problem under various constraints, offering advantages over existing approaches.

Abstract: We consider the best arm identification problem, where the goal is to
identify the arm with the highest mean reward from a set of $K$ arms under a
limited sampling budget. This problem models many practical scenarios such as
A/B testing. We consider a class of algorithms for this problem, which is
provably minimax optimal up to a constant factor. This idea is a generalization
of existing works in fixed-budget best arm identification, which are limited to
a particular choice of risk measures. Based on the framework, we propose Almost
Tracking, a closed-form algorithm that has a provable guarantee on the popular
risk measure $H_1$. Unlike existing algorithms, Almost Tracking does not
require the total budget in advance nor does it need to discard a significant
part of samples, which gives a practical advantage. Through experiments on
synthetic and real-world datasets, we show that our algorithm outperforms
existing anytime algorithms as well as fixed-budget algorithms.

*Tianyi Ma,Tengyao Wang,Richard J. Samworth*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper analyzes Transformers pretrained on mixed difficulty tasks, proving they achieve optimal convergence rates on tasks of fixed difficulty and exhibit robustness to distribution shifts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how pretrained Transformers handle tasks of varying difficulty and distribution shifts during in-context learning.

Method: Mathematically analyze nonparametric regression problems and multi-index models under controlled distributions and divergences.

Result: Pretrained Transformers achieve optimal convergence rates and are robust to test-time distribution shifts.

Conclusion: Pretrained Transformers provide robust and optimal performance within chi-squared divergence bounds, outperforming conventional estimators even with test distribution insights.

Abstract: We study in-context learning problems where a Transformer is pretrained on
tasks drawn from a mixture distribution $\pi=\sum_{\alpha\in\mathcal{A}}
\lambda_{\alpha} \pi_{\alpha}$, called the pretraining prior, in which each
mixture component $\pi_{\alpha}$ is a distribution on tasks of a specific
difficulty level indexed by $\alpha$. Our goal is to understand the performance
of the pretrained Transformer when evaluated on a different test distribution
$\mu$, consisting of tasks of fixed difficulty $\beta\in\mathcal{A}$, and with
potential distribution shift relative to $\pi_\beta$, subject to the
chi-squared divergence $\chi^2(\mu,\pi_{\beta})$ being at most $\kappa$. In
particular, we consider nonparametric regression problems with random
smoothness, and multi-index models with random smoothness as well as random
effective dimension. We prove that a large Transformer pretrained on sufficient
data achieves the optimal rate of convergence corresponding to the difficulty
level $\beta$, uniformly over test distributions $\mu$ in the chi-squared
divergence ball. Thus, the pretrained Transformer is able to achieve faster
rates of convergence on easier tasks and is robust to distribution shift at
test time. Finally, we prove that even if an estimator had access to the test
distribution $\mu$, the convergence rate of its expected risk over $\mu$ could
not be faster than that of our pretrained Transformers, thereby providing a
more appropriate optimality guarantee than minimax lower bounds.

### [627] [Robust Decision Making with Partially Calibrated Forecasts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23471)
*Shayan Kiyani,Hamed Hassani,George Pappas,Aaron Roth*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper addresses the decision-making process with forecasts that lack full calibration, introducing a robust minimax optimal decision rule for weakly calibrated forecasts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations and tractability issues of ensuring full calibration in higher-dimensional prediction problems, and to examine effective decision-making techniques given weaker calibration guarantees.

Method: The authors propose a minimax decision-making framework for forecast calibration, using duality arguments to derive the optimal decision rule under weaker calibration conditions.

Result: The paper demonstrates that 'decision calibration' can achieve minimax optimality, and even with weaker calibration guarantees, the decision rule remains efficiently computable.

Conclusion: Decision calibration offers a practical and robust alternative to full calibration in decision-making contexts, with demonstrated minimax optimality and computational feasibility.

Abstract: Calibration has emerged as a foundational goal in ``trustworthy machine
learning'', in part because of its strong decision theoretic semantics.
Independent of the underlying distribution, and independent of the decision
maker's utility function, calibration promises that amongst all policies
mapping predictions to actions, the uniformly best policy is the one that
``trusts the predictions'' and acts as if they were correct. But this is true
only of \emph{fully calibrated} forecasts, which are tractable to guarantee
only for very low dimensional prediction problems. For higher dimensional
prediction problems (e.g. when outcomes are multiclass), weaker forms of
calibration have been studied that lack these decision theoretic properties. In
this paper we study how a conservative decision maker should map predictions
endowed with these weaker (``partial'') calibration guarantees to actions, in a
way that is robust in a minimax sense: i.e. to maximize their expected utility
in the worst case over distributions consistent with the calibration
guarantees. We characterize their minimax optimal decision rule via a duality
argument, and show that surprisingly, ``trusting the predictions and acting
accordingly'' is recovered in this minimax sense by \emph{decision calibration}
(and any strictly stronger notion of calibration), a substantially weaker and
more tractable condition than full calibration. For calibration guarantees that
fall short of decision calibration, the minimax optimal decision rule is still
efficiently computable, and we provide an empirical evaluation of a natural one
that applies to any regression model solved to optimize squared error.

### [628] [Tighter CMI-Based Generalization Bounds via Stochastic Projection and Quantization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23485)
*Milad Sefidgaran,Kimia Nadjahi,Abdellatif Zaidi*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper introduces new conditional mutual information bounds for generalization error in statistical learning algorithms using stochastic projection and lossy compression, achieving tighter bounds than previous methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address challenges in existing mutual information and conditional mutual information bounds that fail to capture or become vacuous for certain learning problem instances.

Method: The approach involves leveraging stochastic projection and lossy compression to establish improved bounds on generalization error and exploring the connection between memorization and generalization quality.

Result: The new bounds yield suitable generalization guarantees of order $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{n})$ and demonstrate that memorization of training data is not necessary for achieving good generalization across distributions.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that the proposed bounds improve generalization guarantees and resolve contradictions posed by prior works about the necessity of memorization for good generalization.

Abstract: In this paper, we leverage stochastic projection and lossy compression to
establish new conditional mutual information (CMI) bounds on the generalization
error of statistical learning algorithms. It is shown that these bounds are
generally tighter than the existing ones. In particular, we prove that for
certain problem instances for which existing MI and CMI bounds were recently
shown in Attias et al. [2024] and Livni [2023] to become vacuous or fail to
describe the right generalization behavior, our bounds yield suitable
generalization guarantees of the order of $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{n})$, where $n$
is the size of the training dataset. Furthermore, we use our bounds to
investigate the problem of data "memorization" raised in those works, and which
asserts that there are learning problem instances for which any learning
algorithm that has good prediction there exist distributions under which the
algorithm must "memorize" a big fraction of the training dataset. We show that
for every learning algorithm, there exists an auxiliary algorithm that does not
memorize and which yields comparable generalization error for any data
distribution. In part, this shows that memorization is not necessary for good
generalization.

*William Réveillard,Vasileios Saketos,Alexandre Proutiere,Richard Combes*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper explores an online classification problem related to question-answering systems, proposing classifiers optimized for different time horizon and query distribution scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of minimizing regret in classifying queries from unknown distributions in question-answering systems, while balancing expert consultation costs.

Method: Proposed three approaches: Conservative Hull-based Classifier (CHC) for high time horizons, Center-based Classifier (CC) for subgaussian distributions under lower time horizons, and Generalized Hull-based Classifier (GHC) to bridge these regimes.

Result: The CHC achieves optimal regret for large time horizons, CC is effective for subgaussian mixtures, and GHC provides tunable trade-offs. Methods are validated on real-world datasets using embeddings from large language models.

Conclusion: The introduced methods effectively minimize classification regret and demonstrate adaptability to different query distributions and time horizon requirements.

Abstract: We introduce and study an online problem arising in question answering
systems. In this problem, an agent must sequentially classify user-submitted
queries represented by $d$-dimensional embeddings drawn i.i.d. from an unknown
distribution. The agent may consult a costly human expert for the correct
label, or guess on her own without receiving feedback. The goal is to minimize
regret against an oracle with free expert access. When the time horizon $T$ is
at least exponential in the embedding dimension $d$, one can learn the geometry
of the class regions: in this regime, we propose the Conservative Hull-based
Classifier (CHC), which maintains convex hulls of expert-labeled queries and
calls the expert as soon as a query lands outside all known hulls. CHC attains
$\mathcal{O}(\log^d T)$ regret in $T$ and is minimax optimal for $d=1$.
Otherwise, the geometry cannot be reliably learned without additional
distributional assumptions. We show that when the queries are drawn from a
subgaussian mixture, for $T \le e^d$, a Center-based Classifier (CC) achieves
regret proportional to $N\log{N}$ where $N$ is the number of labels. To bridge
these regimes, we introduce the Generalized Hull-based Classifier (GHC), a
practical extension of CHC that allows for more aggressive guessing via a
tunable threshold parameter. Our approach is validated with experiments,
notably on real-world question-answering datasets using embeddings derived from
state-of-the-art large language models.

### [630] [Design Stability in Adaptive Experiments: Implications for Treatment Effect Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22351)
*Saikat Sengupta,Koulik Khamaru,Suvrojit Ghosh,Tirthankar Dasgupta*

Main category: math.ST

TL;DR: The paper studies estimating average treatment effects in adaptive treatment assigning mechanisms, proposing two estimators and analyzing their properties under a design stability criterion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical randomized designs do not capture dynamically adaptive treatment assignments influenced by prior results, necessitating novel methods and analyses.

Method: Proposes and analyzes two estimators (IPW and AIPW) under the framework of design stability, establishing central limit theorems and introducing variance estimators to construct valid confidence intervals.

Result: Central limit theorems for IPW and AIPW estimators, explicit asymptotic variance formulates, and practical variance estimators. Applied results to Wei’s adaptive coin design and Efron’s biased coin design.

Conclusion: IPW and AIPW estimators are effective under design stability for sequential experimentation settings, providing robust ATE estimates and valid confidence intervals.

Abstract: We study the problem of estimating the average treatment effect (ATE) under
sequentially adaptive treatment assignment mechanisms. In contrast to classical
completely randomized designs, we consider a setting in which the probability
of assigning treatment to each experimental unit may depend on prior
assignments and observed outcomes. Within the potential outcomes framework, we
propose and analyze two natural estimators for the ATE: the inverse propensity
weighted (IPW) estimator and an augmented IPW (AIPW) estimator. The cornerstone
of our analysis is the concept of design stability, which requires that as the
number of units grows, either the assignment probabilities converge, or sample
averages of the inverse propensity scores and of the inverse complement
propensity scores converge in probability to fixed, non-random limits. Our main
results establish central limit theorems for both the IPW and AIPW estimators
under design stability and provide explicit expressions for their asymptotic
variances. We further propose estimators for these variances, enabling the
construction of asymptotically valid confidence intervals. Finally, we
illustrate our theoretical results in the context of Wei's adaptive coin design
and Efron's biased coin design, highlighting the applicability of the proposed
methods to sequential experimentation with adaptive randomization.

### [631] [Confidence Sets for Multidimensional Scaling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22452)
*Siddharth Vishwanath,Ery Arias-Castro*

Main category: math.ST

TL;DR: The paper proposes a statistical framework and bootstrap methods for classical multidimensional scaling (CMDS) with noisy data, providing theoretical and empirical validation for constructing confidence sets for latent configurations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the need for a robust statistical framework that deals with noisy dissimilarity data in classical multidimensional scaling (CMDS) and allows for accurate uncertainty quantification in the latent configuration.

Method: The authors establish distributional convergence results for CMDS embeddings under different noise models, enabling the derivation of uniform confidence sets. They design and validate bootstrap procedures to construct these confidence sets, considering heteroscedastic and homoscedastic noise.

Result: Both multiplier bootstrap and empirical bootstrap improve the finite-sample accuracy of the confidence sets. Multiplier bootstrap automatically adapts to heteroscedastic noise, while empirical bootstrap is suited for homoscedasticity.

Conclusion: The proposed statistical framework and bootstrap methods effectively handle noise and provide robust confidence sets for CMDS embeddings, showing both theoretical guarantees and strong empirical performance.

Abstract: We develop a formal statistical framework for classical multidimensional
scaling (CMDS) applied to noisy dissimilarity data. We establish distributional
convergence results for the embeddings produced by CMDS for various noise
models, which enable the construction of \emph{bona~fide} uniform confidence
sets for the latent configuration, up to rigid transformations. We further
propose bootstrap procedures for constructing these confidence sets and provide
theoretical guarantees for their validity. We find that the multiplier
bootstrap adapts automatically to heteroscedastic noise such as multiplicative
noise, while the empirical bootstrap seems to require homoscedasticity. Either
form of bootstrap, when valid, is shown to substantially improve finite-sample
accuracy. The empirical performance of the proposed methods is demonstrated
through numerical experiments.

*Sören Christensen,Jan Kallsen,Claudia Strauch,Lukas Trottner*

Main category: math.ST

TL;DR: The paper addresses recovering a latent signal from its noisy observation using geometric projections onto a sampled low-dimensional submanifold.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks a systematic method for signal recovery, utilizing manifold structures in high-dimensional noisy data.

Method: It introduces a denoising technique using metric projections onto a manifold, combined with score matching in a semiparametric diffusion model.

Result: The Bayesian posterior concentrates near the proposed metric projection in high-dimensional settings.

Conclusion: The proposed approach provides theoretical validation for signal recovery, utilizing manifold geometry and Bayesian methods effectively in high dimensions.

Abstract: We consider the problem of recovering a latent signal $X$ from its noisy
observation $Y$. The unknown law $\mathbb{P}^X$ of $X$, and in particular its
support $\mathscr{M}$, are accessible only through a large sample of i.i.d.\
observations. We further assume $\mathscr{M}$ to be a low-dimensional
submanifold of a high-dimensional Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^d$. As a filter
or denoiser $\widehat X$, we suggest an estimator of the metric projection
$\pi_{\mathscr{M}}(Y)$ of $Y$ onto the manifold $\mathscr{M}$. To compute this
estimator, we study an auxiliary semiparametric model in which $Y$ is obtained
by adding isotropic Laplace noise to $X$. Using score matching within a
corresponding diffusion model, we obtain an estimator of the Bayesian posterior
$\mathbb{P}^{X \mid Y}$ in this setup. Our main theoretical results show that,
in the limit of high dimension $d$, this posterior $\mathbb{P}^{X\mid Y}$ is
concentrated near the desired metric projection $\pi_{\mathscr{M}}(Y)$.

*Christoph Wiederkehr,Christian Heumann,Michael Schomaker*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: The study evaluates the performance of TMLE in estimating average treatment effects with missing data under different scenarios, comparing eight methods. Non-MI methods with TMLE are recommended for bias reduction, while MI CART is favored for better confidence intervals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in estimating average treatment effects with missing data, particularly under varying levels of positivity violations, and advise on optimal methods for bias reduction and robust confidence intervals.

Method: Model- and design-based simulations are employed, including analyses using undersmoothed highly adaptive lasso with real-world epidemiological data, five missing data mechanisms, and comparisons of eight missing data methods with TMLE.

Result: Non-MI methods, especially complete cases with TMLE incorporating outcome-missingness models, showed less bias and higher robustness to positivity violations. MI approaches using CART achieved lower errors while often maintaining nominal coverage rates.

Conclusion: Complete cases with TMLE incorporating outcome-missingness models are recommended for bias reduction. MI CART is suggested for accurate confidence intervals, depending on the research priorities.

Abstract: We evaluate the performance of targeted maximum likelihood estimation (TMLE)
for estimating the average treatment effect in missing data scenarios under
varying levels of positivity violations. We employ model- and design-based
simulations, with the latter using undersmoothed highly adaptive lasso on the
'WASH Benefits Bangladesh' dataset to mimic real-world complexities. Five
missingness-directed acyclic graphs are considered, capturing common missing
data mechanisms in epidemiological research, particularly in one-point exposure
studies. These mechanisms include also not-at-random missingness in the
exposure, outcome, and confounders. We compare eight missing data methods in
conjunction with TMLE as the analysis method, distinguishing between
non-multiple imputation (non-MI) and multiple imputation (MI) approaches. The
MI approaches use both parametric and machine-learning models. Results show
that non-MI methods, particularly complete cases with TMLE incorporating an
outcome-missingness model, exhibit lower bias compared to all other evaluated
missing data methods and greater robustness against positivity violations
across. In Comparison MI with classification and regression trees (CART)
achieve lower root mean squared error, while often maintaining nominal coverage
rates. Our findings highlight the trade-offs between bias and coverage, and we
recommend using complete cases with TMLE incorporating an outcome-missingness
model for bias reduction and MI CART when accurate confidence intervals are the
priority.

*Dimitrios Loukrezis,Dimitris G. Giovanis*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: This paper proposes a method to add predictive uncertainty intervals to polynomial chaos expansion surrogate models using jackknife-based conformal prediction, calculated efficiently through analytical expressions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for predictive uncertainty quantification in data-driven polynomial chaos expansion surrogate models without requiring additional hold-out datasets.

Method: The authors integrated jackknife and jackknife+ conformal prediction techniques into polynomial chaos regression, leveraging the model's linearity for efficient computation of leave-one-out residuals and predictions.

Result: The method successfully computed predictive intervals and was validated on benchmark models, showing efficient use of data and analyzing effects of training data volume on intervals.

Conclusion: Conformalized polynomial chaos expansion is a practical and efficient approach for achieving predictive uncertainty bounds, without requiring extra data for calibration during training.

Abstract: This work introduces a method to equip data-driven polynomial chaos expansion
surrogate models with intervals that quantify the predictive uncertainty of the
surrogate. To that end, we integrate jackknife-based conformal prediction into
regression-based polynomial chaos expansions. The jackknife algorithm uses
leave-one-out residuals to generate predictive intervals around the predictions
of the polynomial chaos surrogate. The jackknife+ extension additionally
requires leave-one-out model predictions. The key to efficient implementation
is to leverage the linearity of the polynomial chaos regression model, so that
leave-one-out residuals and, if necessary, leave-one-out model predictions can
be computed with analytical, closed-form expressions, thus eliminating the need
for repeated model re-training. In addition to the efficient computation of the
predictive intervals, a significant advantage of this approach is its data
efficiency, as it requires no hold-out dataset for prediction interval
calibration, thus allowing the entire dataset to be used for model training.
The conformalized polynomial chaos expansion method is validated on several
benchmark models, where the impact of training data volume on the predictive
intervals is additionally investigated.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address computational challenges and estimation accuracy in high-dimensional settings of the Synthetic Control method with multiple treated units.

Method: Integrates Multivariate Square-root Lasso into Synthetic Control framework, establishes error bounds for weights and ATT estimation in high-dimensional, time-series-dependent contexts.

Result: Enhanced computational efficiency and maintained estimation accuracy demonstrated through simulation studies; successfully applied to analyze COVID-19 Stay-at-Home Orders' impact on U.S. unemployment rates at the county level.

Conclusion: The introduced method improves practical implementation and scalability of Synthetic Control methods for high-dimensional causal analysis scenarios, providing a robust framework for policy impact evaluation.

Abstract: The Synthetic Control method (SC) has become a valuable tool for estimating
causal effects. Originally designed for single-treated unit scenarios, it has
recently found applications in high-dimensional disaggregated settings with
multiple treated units. However, challenges in practical implementation and
computational efficiency arise in such scenarios. To tackle these challenges,
we propose a novel approach that integrates the Multivariate Square-root Lasso
method into the synthetic control framework. We rigorously establish the
estimation error bounds for fitting the Synthetic Control weights using
Multivariate Square-root Lasso, accommodating high-dimensionality and time
series dependencies. Additionally, we quantify the estimation error for the
Average Treatment Effect on the Treated (ATT). Through simulation studies, we
demonstrate that our method offers superior computational efficiency without
compromising estimation accuracy. We apply our method to assess the causal
impact of COVID-19 Stay-at-Home Orders on the monthly unemployment rate in the
United States at the county level.

TL;DR: This paper proposes a Gaussian process collocation method for Bayesian inference to efficiently estimate parameters in nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs), focusing on the Richards equation for agricultural applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to improve the estimation of unknown parameters in nonlinear PDEs, especially for understanding the soil-plant system in agriculture, as conventional methods are computationally intensive and unstable.

Method: Development of a Gaussian process collocation method that constructs an approximate posterior distribution from Gaussian process model samples and uses importance sampling for posterior correction. An additional prior-guided Bayesian optimization algorithm is introduced.

Result: Simulation studies demonstrate robust estimates across settings, and the method is successfully applied to real agricultural data for estimating plant root parameters with uncertainty quantification.

Conclusion: The proposed methods improve the efficiency and stability of parameter estimation in nonlinear PDEs, providing valuable insights for scientific domains, particularly agriculture.

Abstract: The estimation of unknown parameters in nonlinear partial differential
equations (PDEs) offers valuable insights across a wide range of scientific
domains. In this work, we focus on estimating plant root parameters in the
Richards equation, which is essential for understanding the soil-plant system
in agricultural studies. Since conventional methods are computationally
intensive and often yield unstable estimates, we develop a new Gaussian process
collocation method for efficient Bayesian inference. Unlike existing Gaussian
process-based approaches, our method constructs an approximate posterior
distribution using samples drawn from a Gaussian process model fitted to the
observed data, which does not require any structural assumption about the
underlying PDE. Further, we propose to use an importance sampling procedure to
correct for the discrepancy between the approximate and true posterior
distributions. As an alternative, we also devise a prior-guided Bayesian
optimization algorithm leveraging the approximate posterior. Simulation studies
demonstrate that our method yields robust estimates under various settings.
Finally, we apply our method on a real agricultural data set and estimate the
plant root parameters with uncertainty quantification.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The project develops an AI-enhanced assistant for CERN's UNICOS system to mitigate cognitive and operational challenges, enhance situational awareness, and improve response times.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address challenges within the UNICOS control system, such as high cognitive loads, manual root cause analysis, and difficulty in tracing datapoint elements in a complex codebase.

Method: The solution involves a multi-agent system supported by modular architecture consisting of a UNICOS extension (CTRL code), Python-based agents, and a vector database for accessing operator documentation and widget data.

Result: The system effectively reduces operator and maintainer workloads, improves situational awareness, and accelerates responses to alarms and anomalies.

Conclusion: This project validates the potential of AI-enhanced systems for industrial control, showcasing improved diagnostics and operations, while setting a foundation for intelligent operator interfaces at CERN.

Abstract: This project explores the development of an AI-enhanced operator assistant
for UNICOS, CERN's UNified Industrial Control System. While powerful, UNICOS
presents a number of challenges, including the cognitive burden of decoding
widgets, manual effort required for root cause analysis, and difficulties
maintainers face in tracing datapoint elements (DPEs) across a complex
codebase. In situations where timely responses are critical, these challenges
can increase cognitive load and slow down diagnostics. To address these issues,
a multi-agent system was designed and implemented. The solution is supported by
a modular architecture comprising a UNICOS-side extension written in CTRL code,
a Python-based multi-agent system deployed on a virtual machine, and a vector
database storing both operator documentation and widget animation code.
Preliminary evaluations suggest that the system is capable of decoding widgets,
performing root cause analysis by leveraging live device data and
documentation, and tracing DPEs across a complex codebase. Together, these
capabilities reduce the manual workload of operators and maintainers, enhance
situational awareness in operations, and accelerate responses to alarms and
anomalies. Beyond these immediate gains, this work highlights the potential of
introducing multi-modal reasoning and retrieval augmented generation (RAG) into
the domain of industrial control. Ultimately, this work represents more than a
proof of concept: it provides a basis for advancing intelligent operator
interfaces at CERN. By combining modular design, extensibility, and practical
AI integration, this project not only alleviates current operator pain points
but also points toward broader opportunities for assistive AI in accelerator
operations.

*Nicola Webb,Zijun Huang,Sanja Milivojevic,Chris Baber,Edmund R. Hunt*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The paper investigates trust dynamics in human-robot teams during missions, focusing on how providing explanations for trust violations impacts trust recovery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how mobile and autonomous robots in human-robot teams can maintain user trust during high-risk missions like firefighting and search and rescue.

Method: A study was conducted where participants worked with a robot teammate in an interactive firefighting game. The robot declined urgent requests, but in some cases, provided explanations for its behavior, and trust dynamics were observed.

Result: Trust in the robot initially dropped when it failed to respond immediately to requests. However, trust was better restored over time when the robot gave adequate explanations for its actions.

Conclusion: Providing an explanation for declining a request helps restore user trust in robots during high-stakes missions, demonstrating the importance of communication in human-robot teams.

Abstract: Mobile robots with some degree of autonomy could deliver significant
advantages in high-risk missions such as search and rescue and firefighting.
Integrated into a human-robot team (HRT), robots could work effectively to help
search hazardous buildings. User trust is a key enabler for HRT, but during a
mission, trust can be damaged. With distributed situation awareness, such as
when team members are working in different locations, users may be inclined to
doubt a robot's integrity if it declines to immediately change its priorities
on request. In this paper, we present the results of a computer-based study
investigating on-mission trust dynamics in a high-stakes human-robot teaming
scenario. Participants (n = 38) played an interactive firefighting game
alongside a robot teammate, where a trust violation occurs owing to the robot
declining to help the user immediately. We find that when the robot provides an
explanation for declining to help, trust better recovers over time, albeit
following an initial drop that is comparable to a baseline condition where an
explanation for refusal is not provided. Our findings indicate that trust can
vary significantly during a mission, notably when robots do not immediately
respond to user requests, but that this trust violation can be largely
ameliorated over time if adequate explanation is provided.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional IVR systems frustrate users due to rigid touch-tone interactions, creating demand for intuitive language interaction in customer service systems.

Method: The authors synthesized a 23-node IVR structure using three distinct models, generated base and augmented user intents, and evaluated two prompt designs (hierarchical and flattened paths) for routing accuracy.

Result: Flattened paths achieved higher routing accuracy (89.13%) compared to descriptive hierarchical menus (81.30%), with augmented datasets introducing slight linguistic noise that reduces performance.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that LLMs can effectively replace touch-tone IVR systems to enhance customer service, although menu design redundancy and data augmentation noise present challenges.

Abstract: Widespread frustration with rigid touch-tone Interactive Voice Response (IVR)
systems for customer service underscores the need for more direct and intuitive
language interaction. While speech technologies are necessary, the key
challenge lies in routing intents from user phrasings to IVR menu paths, a task
where Large Language Models (LLMs) show strong potential. Progress, however, is
limited by data scarcity, as real IVR structures and interactions are often
proprietary. We present a novel LLM-based methodology to address this gap.
Using three distinct models, we synthesized a realistic 23-node IVR structure,
generated 920 user intents (230 base and 690 augmented), and performed the
routing task. We evaluate two prompt designs: descriptive hierarchical menus
and flattened path representations, across both base and augmented datasets.
Results show that flattened paths consistently yield higher accuracy, reaching
89.13% on the base dataset compared to 81.30% with the descriptive format,
while augmentation introduces linguistic noise that slightly reduces
performance. Confusion matrix analysis further suggests that low-performing
routes may reflect not only model limitations but also redundancies in menu
design. Overall, our findings demonstrate proof-of-concept that LLMs can enable
IVR routing through a smoother, more seamless user experience -- moving
customer service one step ahead of touch-tone menus.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The paper introduces GAMER PAT, an AI chatbot that transforms academic writing into a gamified experience, fostering motivation, creativity, and growth among researchers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To counter potential demotivation and diminishing creativity among novice researchers caused by generative AI outperforming students in academic writing.

Method: The study uses GAMER PAT, an AI chatbot with role-playing mechanics and narrative-driven processes, analyzed through qualitative log analysis using SCAT methodology.

Result: The analysis revealed a four-phase scaffolding pattern that supports structural, reflective, and motivational development in research writing.

Conclusion: GAMER PAT offers a novel approach to academic writing, promoting curiosity, agency, and the interplay between human and AI-driven research, while serving as a foundation for future studies.

Abstract: As generative AI increasingly outperforms students in producing academic
writing, a critical question arises: how can we preserve the motivation,
creativity, and intellectual growth of novice researchers in an age of
automated academic achievement? This paper introduces GAMER PAT (GAme MastER,
Paper Authoring Tutor), a prompt-engineered AI chatbot that reframes research
paper writing as a serious game. Through role-playing mechanics, users interact
with a co-author NPC and anonymous reviewer NPCs, turning feedback into
"missions" and advancing through a narrative-driven writing process.
  Our study reports on 26+ gameplay chat logs, including both autoethnography
and use by graduate students under supervision. Using qualitative log analysis
with SCAT (Steps for Coding and Theorization), we identified an emergent
four-phase scaffolding pattern: (1) question posing, (2) meta-perspective, (3)
structuring, and (4) recursive reflection. These results suggest that GAMER PAT
supports not only the structural development of research writing but also
reflective and motivational aspects.
  We present this work as a descriptive account of concept and process, not a
causal evaluation. We also include a speculative outlook envisioning how humans
may continue to cultivate curiosity and agency alongside AI-driven research.
This arXiv version thus provides both a descriptive report of design and usage,
and a forward-looking provocation for future empirical studies.

*Beitong Tian,Lingzhi Zhao,Bo Chen,Haozhen Zheng,Jingcheng Yang,Mingyuan Wu,Deepak Vasisht,Klara Nahrstedt*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The paper introduces AquaVLM, an innovative underwater communication system leveraging a mobile vision-language model for situational awareness and context-specific messaging.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing underwater communication tools are often bulky, expensive, and offer limited messaging options, leaving room for creating accessible and context-aware systems.

Method: The authors designed AquaVLM using a fine-tuned mobile vision-language model and hierarchical message generation, paired with error-resilient transmission and a VR simulator for user testing.

Result: The system was validated through subjective and objective evaluations, showing its effectiveness in underwater communication, and was prototyped on iOS for real-world use.

Conclusion: AquaVLM demonstrates significant potential in enhancing diver communication and safety using smartphones, with broader applications for mobile VLM systems.

Abstract: Underwater activities like scuba diving enable millions annually to explore
marine environments for recreation and scientific research. Maintaining
situational awareness and effective communication are essential for diver
safety. Traditional underwater communication systems are often bulky and
expensive, limiting their accessibility to divers of all levels. While recent
systems leverage lightweight smartphones and support text messaging, the
messages are predefined and thus restrict context-specific communication.
  In this paper, we present AquaVLM, a tap-and-send underwater communication
system that automatically generates context-aware messages and transmits them
using ubiquitous smartphones. Our system features a mobile vision-language
model (VLM) fine-tuned on an auto-generated underwater conversation dataset and
employs a hierarchical message generation pipeline. We co-design the VLM and
transmission, incorporating error-resilient fine-tuning to improve the system's
robustness to transmission errors. We develop a VR simulator to enable users to
experience AquaVLM in a realistic underwater environment and create a fully
functional prototype on the iOS platform for real-world experiments. Both
subjective and objective evaluations validate the effectiveness of AquaVLM and
highlight its potential for personal underwater communication as well as
broader mobile VLM applications.

### [642] [Adaptive Split-MMD Training for Small-Sample Cross-Dataset P300 EEG Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21969)
*Weiyu Chen,Arnaud Delorme*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel transfer learning approach, Adaptive Split Maximum Mean Discrepancy Training (AS-MMD), to improve single-trial P300 detection in EEG under limited labeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the challenge of detecting single-trial P300 from EEG when labeled data is scarce, and aims to mitigate cross-dataset shift in transfer learning setups.

Method: The AS-MMD approach combines a target-weighted loss with size ratio-dependent warm-up, Split-Batch Normalization for shared affine parameters, and the Radial Basis Function kernel Maximum Mean Discrepancy term for domain adaptation.

Result: AS-MMD implemented on an EEG Conformer beats traditional training methods under strict small-sample regimes, showcasing statistically significant accuracy and AUC improvements between datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed AS-MMD enhances single-trial P300 detection with efficient transfer learning components and reproducible improvements, validated by ablations and corrected paired t-tests.

Abstract: Detecting single-trial P300 from EEG is difficult when only a few labeled
trials are available. When attempting to boost a small target set with a large
source dataset through transfer learning, cross-dataset shift arises. To
address this challenge, we study transfer between two public visual-oddball ERP
datasets using five shared electrodes (Fz, Pz, P3, P4, Oz) under a strict
small-sample regime (target: 10 trials/subject; source: 80 trials/subject). We
introduce Adaptive Split Maximum Mean Discrepancy Training (AS-MMD), which
combines (i) a target-weighted loss with warm-up tied to the square root of the
source/target size ratio, (ii) Split Batch Normalization (Split-BN) with shared
affine parameters and per-domain running statistics, and (iii) a parameter-free
logit-level Radial Basis Function kernel Maximum Mean Discrepancy (RBF-MMD)
term using the median-bandwidth heuristic. Implemented on an EEG Conformer,
AS-MMD is backbone-agnostic and leaves the inference-time model unchanged.
Across both transfer directions, it outperforms target-only and pooled training
(Active Visual Oddball: accuracy/AUC 0.66/0.74; ERP CORE P3: 0.61/0.65), with
gains over pooling significant under corrected paired t-tests. Ablations
attribute improvements to all three components.

### [643] [Genetic Optimization of a Software-Defined GNSS Receiver](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22417)
*Laura Train,Rodrigo Castellanos,Miguel Gómez-López*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: This paper presents a genetic algorithm-based optimization framework for SDR receivers to ensure optimal GNSS tracking in high-dynamic environments like rockets and satellites.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The limitations of COTS GNSS receivers in high-dynamic environments, such as launch vehicles, prompted the need for more robust tracking solutions that can adapt flexibly.

Method: The authors use genetic algorithms to explore and optimize tracking loop parameters in SDR GNSS receivers, validated using simulated GPS L1 signals under three dynamic scenarios.

Result: The evolutionary approach resulted in optimized configurations that achieved robust PVT solutions across scenarios, with low position and velocity errors via GNSS-SDR processing.

Conclusion: Genetic algorithm-driven SDR optimization significantly improves GNSS performance in diverse dynamic conditions, offering reliable navigation solutions for extreme environments.

Abstract: Commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS)
receivers face significant limitations under high-dynamic conditions,
particularly in high-acceleration environments such as those experienced by
launch vehicles. These performance degradations, often observed as
discontinuities in the navigation solution, arise from the inability of
traditional tracking loop bandwidths to cope with rapid variations in
synchronization parameters. Software-Defined Radio (SDR) receivers overcome
these constraints by enabling flexible reconfiguration of tracking loops;
however, manual tuning involves a complex, multidimensional search and seldom
ensures optimal performance. This work introduces a genetic algorithm-based
optimization framework that autonomously explores the receiver configuration
space to determine optimal loop parameters for phase, frequency, and delay
tracking. The approach is validated within an SDR environment using
realistically simulated GPS L1 signals for three representative dynamic regimes
-guided rocket flight, Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite, and static
receiver-processed with the open-source GNSS-SDR architecture. Results
demonstrate that evolutionary optimization enables SDR receivers to maintain
robust and accurate Position, Velocity, and Time (PVT) solutions across diverse
dynamic conditions. The optimized configurations yielded maximum position and
velocity errors of approximately 6 m and 0.08 m/s for the static case, 12 m and
2.5 m/s for the rocket case, and 5 m and 0.2 m/s for the LEO case.

TL;DR: This study used machine learning on EEG and fMRI data to detect neural signatures distinguishing tinnitus patients from healthy controls, achieving high classification accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to address the lack of objective diagnostic biomarkers for tinnitus, a condition affecting 10-15% of the population.

Method: The study applied machine learning techniques to two datasets consisting of EEG (80 participants) and fMRI (38 participants) data. Multiple analysis models, including deep learning and hybrid classifiers, were used to identify distinguishing neural patterns.

Result: EEG analysis revealed alterations in gamma-band and alpha activities in tinnitus. Models achieved up to 98.8% accuracy in classification, with fMRI data analysis showing high-performing slices reaching 99.0% accuracy.

Conclusion: EEG and fMRI are effective tools for identifying tinnitus-related neural biomarkers. Tree-based and hybrid models showed superior performance, underscoring tinnitus as a multi-network disorder requiring multimodal analysis.

Abstract: Objective: Tinnitus affects 10-15% of the population yet lacks objective
diagnostic biomarkers. This study applied machine learning to EEG and fMRI data
to identify neural signatures distinguishing tinnitus patients from healthy
controls. Methods: Two datasets were analyzed: 64-channel EEG recordings from
80 participants (40 tinnitus, 40 controls) and resting-state fMRI data from 38
participants (19 tinnitus, 19 controls). EEG analysis extracted microstate
features across four to seven clustering states and five frequency bands,
producing 440 features per subject. Global Field Power signals were also
transformed into wavelet images for deep learning. fMRI data were analyzed
using slice-wise convolutional neural networks and hybrid models combining
pre-trained architectures (VGG16, ResNet50) with Decision Tree, Random Forest,
and SVM classifiers. Model performance was evaluated using 5-fold
cross-validation based on accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
Results: EEG microstate analysis revealed altered network dynamics in tinnitus,
particularly reduced gamma-band microstate B occurrence (healthy: 56.56 vs
tinnitus: 43.81, p < 0.001) and diminished alpha coverage. Tree-based
classifiers achieved up to 98.8% accuracy, while VGG16 on wavelet-transformed
EEG yielded 95.4% and 94.1% accuracy for delta and alpha bands, respectively.
fMRI analysis identified 12 high-performing axial slices (>=90% accuracy), with
slice 17 reaching 99.0%. The hybrid VGG16-Decision Tree model achieved 98.95%
+/- 2.94% accuracy. Conclusion: EEG and fMRI provided effective neural
biomarkers for tinnitus classification. Tree-based and hybrid models
demonstrated superior performance, highlighting tinnitus as a multi-network
disorder requiring multimodal analysis.

*Thanyanee Srichaisak,Arissa Ieochai,Aueaphum Aueawattthanaphisut*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: The study explores a wearable device that uses sensor fusion and AI to improve upper-limb movements by reducing tremors and increasing task performance, showing promising results for further clinical trials.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Upper-limb weakness and tremors hinder daily activities and rehabilitation adherence, prompting the need for effective assistance devices.

Method: A wearable device integrating surface EMG, IMU, flex/force sensors, and AI inference models like Tiny 1D-CNN/Transformer was tested on healthy adults during ADL-like tasks.

Result: Using the device reduced tremors (-0.092 TI), improved range of motion (+12.65%) and task repetitions (+2.99/min). It showed low latency (8.7 ms) with no adverse events reported.

Conclusion: The wearable device showed technical feasibility and effective improvements in movement quality and throughput, justifying further clinical research and patient studies.

Abstract: Background: Upper-limb weakness and tremor (4--12 Hz) limit activities of
daily living (ADL) and reduce adherence to home rehabilitation. Objective: To
assess technical feasibility and clinician-relevant signals of a sensor-fused
wearable targeting the triceps brachii and extensor pollicis brevis. Methods: A
lightweight node integrates surface EMG (1 kHz), IMU (100--200 Hz), and
flex/force sensors with on-device INT8 inference (Tiny 1D-CNN/Transformer) and
a safety-bounded assist policy (angle/torque/jerk limits; stall/time-out).
Healthy adults (n = 12) performed three ADL-like tasks. Primary outcomes:
Tremor Index (TI), range of motion (ROM), repetitions (Reps min$^{-1}$).
Secondary: EMG median-frequency slope (fatigue trend), closed-loop latency,
session completion, and device-related adverse events. Analyses used
subject-level paired medians with BCa 95\% CIs; exact Wilcoxon $p$-values are
reported in the Results. Results: Assistance was associated with lower tremor
prominence and improved task throughput: TI decreased by $-0.092$ (95\% CI
[$-0.102$, $-0.079$]), ROM increased by $+12.65\%$ (95\% CI [$+8.43$,
$+13.89$]), and Reps rose by $+2.99$ min$^{-1}$ (95\% CI [$+2.61$, $+3.35$]).
Median on-device latency was 8.7 ms at a 100 Hz loop rate; all sessions were
completed with no device-related adverse events. Conclusions: Multimodal
sensing with low-latency, safety-bounded assistance produced improved movement
quality (TI $\downarrow$) and throughput (ROM, Reps $\uparrow$) in a pilot
technical-feasibility setting, supporting progression to IRB-approved patient
studies. Trial registration: Not applicable (pilot non-clinical).

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: The paper introduces planning-oriented ISAC (PISAC), a framework designed to improve autonomous vehicle planning by reducing sensing uncertainty for critical obstacles and increasing safe paths. It shows enhanced safety and efficiency compared to other benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current ISAC designs focus on sensing accuracy and communication but neglect critical obstacles' influence on vehicle motion efficiency.

Method: The authors introduce PISAC, combining ISAC transmit power optimization with motion-level planning. A bilevel optimization model is employed, linking transmit power to sensing uncertainty and using this for safer motion planning.

Result: PISAC leads to up to 40% higher success rates and over 5% shorter traversal times in urban driving simulations compared to benchmarks.

Conclusion: PISAC successfully integrates sensing and planning, improving the safety and efficiency of autonomous vehicles by addressing sensing uncertainties of key obstacles.

Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) enables simultaneous
localization, environment perception, and data exchange for connected
autonomous vehicles. However, most existing ISAC designs prioritize sensing
accuracy and communication throughput, treating all targets uniformly and
overlooking the impact of critical obstacles on motion efficiency. To overcome
this limitation, we propose a planning-oriented ISAC (PISAC) framework that
reduces the sensing uncertainty of planning-bottleneck obstacles and expands
the safe navigable path for the ego-vehicle, thereby bridging the gap between
physical-layer optimization and motion-level planning. The core of PISAC lies
in deriving a closed-form safety bound that explicitly links ISAC transmit
power to sensing uncertainty, based on the Cram\'er-Rao Bound and occupancy
inflation principles. Using this model, we formulate a bilevel power allocation
and motion planning (PAMP) problem, where the inner layer optimizes the ISAC
beam power distribution and the outer layer computes a collision-free
trajectory under uncertainty-aware safety constraints. Comprehensive
simulations in high-fidelity urban driving environments demonstrate that PISAC
achieves up to 40% higher success rates and over 5% shorter traversal times
than existing ISAC-based and communication-oriented benchmarks, validating its
effectiveness in enhancing both safety and efficiency.

*Cyprien Tamekue,ShiNung Ching*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: This paper investigates controlling nonlinear Amari-type neural fields using piecewise constant inputs, with applications in understanding neural dynamics and paradoxical sensory phenomena.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a rigorous framework for controlling Amari-type neural fields to predict and manage complex neural activity such as paradoxical visual illusions.

Method: The authors propose control synthesis methods using the Banach fixed-point theorem, addressing boundary-control objectives and overcoming limitations through drift-based approaches.

Result: They demonstrate their methods’ efficacy through numerical results in one and two dimensions, showing improved control compared to naive linearization inputs.

Conclusion: This study enhances understanding and methods for controlling nonlinear neural population dynamics, opening pathways for applications in neuroscience and neurostimulation.

Abstract: Wilson-Cowan and Amari-type models capture nonlinear neural population
dynamics, providing a fundamental framework for modeling how sensory and other
exogenous inputs shape activity in neural tissue. We study the controllability
properties of Amari-type neural fields subject to piecewise/constant-in-time
inputs. The model describes the time evolution of the polarization of neural
tissue within a spatial continuum, with synaptic interactions represented by a
convolution kernel. We study the synthesis of piecewise/constant-in-time inputs
to achieve two-point boundary-type control objectives, namely, steering neural
activity from an initial state to a prescribed target state. This approach is
particularly relevant for predicting the emergence of paradoxical neural
representations, such as discordant visual illusions that occur in response to
overt sensory stimuli. We first present a control synthesis based on the Banach
fixed-point theorem, which yields an iterative construction of a
constant-in-time input under minimal regularity assumptions on the kernel and
transfer function; however, it exhibits practical limitations, even in the
linear case. To overcome these challenges, we then develop a generic synthesis
framework based on the flow of neural dynamics drift, enabling explicit
piecewise constant and constant-in-time inputs. Extensive numerical results in
one and two spatial dimensions confirm the effectiveness of the proposed
syntheses and demonstrate their superior performance compared to inputs derived
from naive linearization at the initial or target states when these states are
not equilibria of the drift dynamics. By providing a mathematically rigorous
framework for controlling Amari-type neural fields, this work advances our
understanding of nonlinear neural population control with potential
applications in computational neuroscience, psychophysics, and
neurostimulation.

TL;DR: The paper addresses a linear quadratic covariance steering problem with a fixed horizon, proposing a recursive algorithm for a matrix ODE system and demonstrating it with numerical examples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve techniques for solving covariance steering problems in continuous time by introducing a terminal cost based on Hilbert-Schmidt norm error.

Method: The necessary conditions of optimality are modeled as a two-point boundary value problem. A matricial recursive algorithm is designed, leveraging linear fractional transforms parameterized by Hamiltonian matrix's state transition matrix.

Result: The algorithm converges and performs successfully in numerical examples with state spaces of dimensions 2 and 6.

Conclusion: The recursive algorithm offers an effective solution for fixed horizon covariance steering problems, validated through numerical examples.

Abstract: We formulate and solve the fixed horizon linear quadratic covariance steering
problem in continuous time with a terminal cost measured in Hilbert-Schmidt
(i.e., Frobenius) norm error between the desired and the controlled terminal
covariances. For this problem, the necessary conditions of optimality become a
coupled matrix ODE two-point boundary value problem. To solve this system of
equations, we design a matricial recursive algorithm and prove its convergence.
The proposed algorithm and its analysis make use of the linear fractional
transforms parameterized by the state transition matrix of the associated
Hamiltonian matrix. To illustrate the results, we provide two numerical
examples: one with a two dimensional and another with a six dimensional state
space.

### [649] [Derivative-Free Sequential Quadratic Programming for Equality-Constrained Stochastic Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22458)
*Sen Na*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: This paper develops a derivative-free optimization method, DF-SSQP, that solves stochastic nonlinear problems using zero-order information with momentum-based debiasing techniques for improved accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address constraints and stochastic noise in optimization problems when derivatives are unavailable, relying solely on zero-order information.

Method: The DF-SSQP method uses random estimation for gradients and Hessians via SPSA, along with an innovative momentum-based debiasing technique to reduce noise in the estimates.

Result: The proposed method is globally convergent with almost-sure guarantees and locally convergent with asymptotic normality, showing competitive covariance matrices compared to derivative-based methods.

Conclusion: DF-SSQP is globally and locally effective for stochastic nonlinear optimization problems, providing robust statistical inference capabilities and demonstrated efficacy in numerical experiments.

Abstract: We consider solving nonlinear optimization problems with a stochastic
objective and deterministic equality constraints, assuming that only zero-order
information is available for both the objective and constraints, and that the
objective is also subject to random sampling noise. Under this setting, we
propose a Derivative-Free Stochastic Sequential Quadratic Programming (DF-SSQP)
method. Due to the lack of derivative information, we adopt a simultaneous
perturbation stochastic approximation (SPSA) technique to randomly estimate the
gradients and Hessians of both the objective and constraints. This approach
requires only a dimension-independent number of zero-order evaluations -- as
few as eight -- at each iteration step. A key distinction between our
derivative-free and existing derivative-based SSQP methods lies in the
intricate random bias introduced into the gradient and Hessian estimates of the
objective and constraints, brought by stochastic zero-order approximations. To
address this issue, we introduce an online debiasing technique based on
momentum-style estimators that properly aggregate past gradient and Hessian
estimates to reduce stochastic noise, while avoiding excessive memory costs via
a moving averaging scheme. Under standard assumptions, we establish the global
almost-sure convergence of the proposed DF-SSQP method. Notably, we further
complement the global analysis with local convergence guarantees by
demonstrating that the rescaled iterates exhibit asymptotic normality, with a
limiting covariance matrix resembling the minimax optimal covariance achieved
by derivative-based methods, albeit larger due to the absence of derivative
information. Our local analysis enables online statistical inference of model
parameters leveraging DF-SSQP. Numerical experiments on benchmark nonlinear
problems demonstrate both the global and local behavior of DF-SSQP.

*Hai Yu,Zhichao Yang,Wei He,Jianda Han,Yongchun Fang,Xiao Liang*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: The paper introduces a backstepping control strategy for variable-length cable aerial transportation systems, achieving precise payload trajectory tracking and adaptive cable length adjustment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenges in control design for aerial systems with variable-length cables, resulting from increased nonlinearity and dynamic coupling.

Method: A backstepping control strategy combined with a cable length generator for online cable length optimization while ensuring system stability and state constraints.

Result: The system shows effective trajectory tracking and adaptive adjustments in cable length, validated through simulation results.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully improves the functionality of aerial transportation systems with variable-length cables, enabling precise control and dynamic adaptability.

Abstract: Cable-suspended aerial transportation systems are employed extensively across
various industries. The capability to flexibly adjust the relative position
between the multirotor and the payload has spurred growing interest in the
system equipped with variable-length cable, promising broader application
potential. Compared to systems with fixed-length cables, introducing the
variable-length cable adds a new degree of freedom. However, it also results in
increased nonlinearity and more complex dynamic coupling among the multirotor,
the cable and the payload, posing significant challenges in control design.
This paper introduces a backstepping control strategy tailored for aerial
transportation systems with variable-length cable, designed to precisely track
the payload trajectory while dynamically adjusting cable length. Then, a cable
length generator has been developed that achieves online optimization of the
cable length while satisfying state constraints, thus balancing the
multirotor's motion and cable length changes without the need for manual
trajectory planning. The asymptotic stability of the closed-loop system is
guaranteed through Lyapunov techniques and the growth restriction condition.
Finally, simulation results confirm the efficacy of the proposed method in
managing trajectory tracking and cable length adjustments effectively.

*Alban Etiennea,Jean-Jacques Ohana,Eric Benhamou,Béatrice Guez,Ethan Setrouk,Thomas Jacquot*

Main category: q-fin.PR

TL;DR: This paper utilizes Bayesian optimization to dynamically reallocate exposure across multiple trend horizons at the asset level, challenging the convention of equal weighting across horizons.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional approaches assume equal benefit from all trend horizons for all assets, which may be suboptimal theoretically and empirically.

Method: The study applies Bayesian optimization to learn optimal weights for trend horizons on an asset level and uses Bayesian graphical models for dynamic asset allocation.

Result: It shows that the medium-term horizon contributes little incremental performance or diversification, and removing it improves Sharpe ratios and drawdown efficiency without sacrificing benchmark correlation.

Conclusion: Short- and long-term horizons capture the majority of the performance, forming a "barbell" structure that challenges the belief that diversification through multiple horizons inherently improves performance.

Abstract: Recent work has emphasized the diversification benefits of combining trend
signals across multiple horizons, with the medium-term window-typically six
months to one year-long viewed as the "sweet spot" of trend-following. This
paper revisits this conventional view by reallocating exposure dynamically
across horizons using a Bayesian optimization framework designed to learn the
optimal weights assigned to each trend horizon at the asset level. The common
practice of equal weighting implicitly assumes that all assets benefit equally
from all horizons; we show that this assumption is both theoretically and
empirically suboptimal. We first optimize the horizon-level weights at the
asset level to maximize the informativeness of trend signals before applying
Bayesian graphical models-with sparsity and turnover control-to allocate
dynamically across assets. The key finding is that the medium-term band
contributes little incremental performance or diversification once short- and
long-term components are included. Removing the 125-day layer improves Sharpe
ratios and drawdown efficiency while maintaining benchmark correlation. We then
rationalize this outcome through a minimum-variance formulation, showing that
the medium-term horizon largely overlaps with its neighboring horizons. The
resulting "barbell" structure-combining short- and long-term trends-captures
most of the performance while reducing model complexity. This result challenges
the common belief that more horizons always improve diversification and
suggests that some forms of time-scale diversification may conceal unnecessary
redundancy in trend premia.

*Kumbha Nagaswetha*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a deep learning method for generating HDR images by fusing underexposed and overexposed LDR images using a CNN.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional cameras have a limited dynamic range and fail to capture the wide range of brightness in natural scenes that the human visual system can perceive.

Method: The approach uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) to fuse complementary information from multi-exposure LDR images. It is trained unsupervisedly without ground-truth HDR images.

Result: The proposed method outperforms existing fusion methods in visual quality and achieves high performance as evaluated by MEF-SSIM.

Conclusion: This deep learning-based HDR imaging approach effectively generates high-quality HDR images, is practical for real-world applications, and optimizes performance using a custom loss function.

Abstract: High Dynamic Range (HDR) imaging aims to reproduce the wide range of
brightness levels present in natural scenes, which the human visual system can
perceive but conventional digital cameras often fail to capture due to their
limited dynamic range. To address this limitation, we propose a deep
learning-based multi-exposure fusion approach for HDR image generation. The
method takes a set of differently exposed Low Dynamic Range (LDR) images,
typically an underexposed and an overexposed image, and learns to fuse their
complementary information using a convolutional neural network (CNN). The
underexposed image preserves details in bright regions, while the overexposed
image retains information in dark regions; the network effectively combines
these to reconstruct a high-quality HDR output. The model is trained in an
unsupervised manner, without relying on ground-truth HDR images, making it
practical for real-world applications where such data is unavailable. We
evaluate our results using the Multi-Exposure Fusion Structural Similarity
Index Measure (MEF-SSIM) and demonstrate that our approach achieves superior
visual quality compared to existing fusion methods. A customized loss function
is further introduced to improve reconstruction fidelity and optimize model
performance.

### [653] [Architecting Scalable Trapped Ion Quantum Computers using Surface Codes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23519)
*Scott Jones,Prakash Murali*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper explores implementing surface code Quantum Error Correction (QEC) on Quantum Charge-Coupled Device (QCCD)-based trapped ion quantum systems, optimizing parameters with a new compiler.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Trapped ion systems show promise as scalable quantum computing platforms, but achieving practical error rates requires effective Quantum Error Correction (QEC). Current demonstrations are limited in QEC scale and lack clarity in hardware optimization.

Method: The authors developed a topology-aware compiler that enhances logical clock speed by 3.8X compared to existing methods. This approach evaluates hardware trap capacity, connectivity, and electrode wiring for efficient surface code QEC implementation.

Result: Small traps of two ions were identified as optimal for performance and hardware efficiency, challenging prior assumptions favoring larger traps with 20-30 ions.

Conclusion: Designing QCCD systems with smaller traps can improve both efficiency and performance for surface code QEC, providing valuable insights for scaling trapped ion quantum computing platforms.

Abstract: Trapped ion (TI) qubits are a leading quantum computing platform. Current TI
systems have less than 60 qubits, but a modular architecture known as the
Quantum Charge-Coupled Device (QCCD) is a promising path to scale up devices.
There is a large gap between the error rates of near-term systems ($10^{-3}$ to
$10^{-4}$) and the requirements of practical applications (below $10^{-9}$). To
bridge this gap, we require Quantum Error Correction (QEC) to build
\emph{logical qubits} that are composed of multiple physical qubits. While
logical qubits have been demonstrated on TI qubits, these demonstrations are
restricted to small codes and systems. There is no clarity on how QCCD systems
should be designed to implement practical-scale QEC. This paper studies how
surface codes, a standard QEC scheme, can be implemented efficiently on
QCCD-based systems. To examine how architectural parameters of a QCCD system
can be tuned for surface codes, we develop a near-optimal topology-aware
compilation method that outperforms existing QCCD compilers by an average of
3.8X in terms of logical clock speed. We use this compiler to examine how
hardware trap capacity, connectivity and electrode wiring choices can be
optimised for surface code implementation. In particular, we demonstrate that
small traps of two ions are surprisingly ideal from both a performance-optimal
and hardware-efficiency standpoint. This result runs counter to prior intuition
that larger traps (20-30 ions) would be preferable, and has the potential to
inform design choices for upcoming systems.

### [654] [The Cost of Certainty: Shot Budgets in Quantum Program Testing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22418)
*Andriy Miranskyy*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper develops a framework to manage measurement costs for testing and verifying quantum programs, analyzing error metrics and proposing efficient strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantum programs require verification, but hardware limitations make exhaustive measurements costly, necessitating efficient testing methods.

Method: The paper studies theoretical error bounds, applies them to testing methods, and introduces a program-level approach to allocate verification efforts across subroutines.

Result: Inverse test is the most efficient; swap test needs twice the measurements; chi-square test, although simple, requires significantly more. Noise affects measurement requirements.

Conclusion: The framework provides practical tools to optimize verification strategies for quantum programs under resource constraints, balancing rigour and cost.

Abstract: As quantum computing advances toward early fault-tolerant machines, testing
and verification of quantum programs become urgent but costly, since each
execution consumes scarce hardware resources. Unlike in classical software
testing, every measurement must be carefully budgeted.
  This paper develops a unified framework for reasoning about how many
measurements are required to verify quantum programs. The goal is to connect
theoretical error bounds with concrete test strategies and to extend the
analysis from individual tests to full program-level verification.
  We analyze the relationship between error probability, fidelity, trace
distance, and the quantum Chernoff bound to establish fundamental shot count
limits. These foundations are applied to three representative testing methods:
the inverse test, the swap test, and the chi-square test. Both idealized and
noisy devices are considered. We also introduce a program-level budgeting
approach that allocates verification effort across multiple subroutines.
  The inverse test is the most measurement efficient, the swap test requires
about twice as many shots, and the chi-square test is easiest to implement but
often needs orders of magnitude more measurements. In the presence of noise,
calibrated baselines may increase measurement requirements beyond theoretical
estimates. At the program level, distributing a global fidelity target across
many fine-grained functions can cause verification costs to grow rapidly,
whereas coarser decompositions or weighted allocations remain more practical.
  The framework clarifies trade-offs among different testing strategies, noise
handling, and program decomposition. It provides practical guidance for
budgeting measurement shots in quantum program testing, helping practitioners
balance rigour against cost when designing verification strategies.

*Min Chen,Bingzhi Zhang,Quntao Zhuang,Junyu Liu*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper analyzes Quantum Imaginary Time Evolution (QITE), presenting an analytic theory that connects it to Quantum Natural Gradient Descent (QNGD), demonstrating a faster convergence compared to traditional methods and validating findings through simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between practical demonstrations and theoretical understanding of QITE in variational quantum algorithms.

Method: Establishing QITE equivalent to QNGD, utilizing quantum Fisher information metrics for mathematical modeling, and applying quantum neural tangent kernel framework for analysis of dynamics and convergence.

Result: QITE is theoretically proven to converge faster than gradient descent-based variational quantum algorithms, validated through numerical simulations, and its efficiency decreases due to the exponential growth of Hilbert space.

Conclusion: The paper establishes a theoretical foundation for QITE dynamics, offering insights into designing variational quantum algorithms using analytic principles.

Abstract: Quantum imaginary time evolution (QITE) algorithm is one of the most
promising variational quantum algorithms (VQAs), bridging the current era of
Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum devices and the future of fully fault-tolerant
quantum computing. Although practical demonstrations of QITE and its potential
advantages over the general VQA trained with vanilla gradient descent (GD) in
certain tasks have been reported, a first-principle, theoretical understanding
of QITE remains limited. Here, we aim to develop an analytic theory for the
dynamics of QITE. First, we show that QITE can be interpreted as a form of a
general VQA trained with Quantum Natural Gradient Descent (QNGD), where the
inverse quantum Fisher information matrix serves as the learning-rate tensor.
This equivalence is established not only at the level of gradient update rules,
but also through the action principle: the variational principle can be
directly connected to the geometric geodesic distance in the quantum Fisher
information metric, up to an integration constant. Second, for wide quantum
neural networks, we employ the quantum neural tangent kernel framework to
construct an analytic model for QITE. We prove that QITE always converges
faster than GD-based VQA, though this advantage is suppressed by the
exponential growth of Hilbert space dimension. This helps explain certain
experimental results in quantum computational chemistry. Our theory encompasses
linear, quadratic, and more general loss functions. We validate the analytic
results through numerical simulations. Our findings establish a theoretical
foundation for QITE dynamics and provide analytic insights for the
first-principle design of variational quantum algorithms.

### [656] [Drone Carry-on Weight and Wind Flow Assessment via Micro-Doppler Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22846)

Main category: physics.app-ph

TL;DR: This paper investigates the use of micro-Doppler analysis combined with radar to monitor the flight dynamics of drones, specifically separating the impacts of wind and payload effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Remote drone monitoring is crucial for applications in national security and control of aerial delivery traffic, especially for detecting unauthorized transportation of dangerous goods.

Method: The authors conducted experiments in an anechoic chamber (for electromagnetic isolation) and a wind tunnel (for controlled wind scenarios) using surveillance radar for analyzing micro-Doppler effects caused by wind and payload.

Result: The study demonstrates that micro-Doppler analysis is effective in distinguishing the effects of wind and payload on drone flight dynamics using a deterministic algorithm.

Conclusion: Micro-Doppler analysis enables the detection of payload and wind influences on drones, presenting a valuable tool for enhanced remote monitoring and security applications.

Abstract: Remote monitoring of drones has become a global objective due to emerging
applications in national security and managing aerial delivery traffic. Despite
their relatively small size, drones can carry significant payloads, which
require monitoring, especially in cases of unauthorized transportation of
dangerous goods. A drone's flight dynamics heavily depend on outdoor wind
conditions and the carry-on weight, which affect the tilt angle of a drone's
body and the rotation velocity of the blades. A surveillance radar can capture
both effects, provided a sufficient signal-to-noise ratio for the received
echoes and an adjusted postprocessing detection algorithm. Here, we conduct a
systematic study to demonstrate that micro-Doppler analysis enables the
disentanglement of the impacts of wind and weight on a hovering drone. The
physics behind the effect is related to the flight controller, as the way the
drone counteracts weight and wind differs. When the payload is balanced, it
imposes an additional load symmetrically on all four rotors, causing them to
rotate faster, thereby generating a blade-related micro-Doppler shift at a
higher frequency. However, the impact of the wind is different. The wind
attempts to displace the drone, and to counteract this, the drone tilts to the
side. As a result, the forward and rear rotors rotate at different velocities
to maintain the tilt angle of the drone body relative to the airflow direction.
This causes the splitting in the micro-Doppler spectra. By performing a set of
experiments in a controlled environment, specifically, an anechoic chamber for
electromagnetic isolation and a wind tunnel for imposing deterministic wind
conditions, we demonstrate that both wind and payload details can be extracted
using a simple deterministic algorithm based on branching in the micro-Doppler
spectra.

execution stage structures the data into accessible formats, such as CSV,
ensuring the scraped content is organized for easy use. To provide personalized
and secure experiences, the application includes user registration and login
functionalities, supported by MongoDB, which stores user data and scraping
history. Deployed using the Flask framework, the tool offers a scalable, robust
environment for web scraping. Users can easily input website URLs, define data
extraction parameters, and download the data in a simplified format, without
needing technical expertise. This automated tool not only enhances the
efficiency of web scraping but also democratizes access to data extraction by
empowering users of all technical levels to gather and manage data tailored to
their needs. The methodology detailed in this paper represents a significant
advancement in making web scraping tools accessible, efficient, and easy to use

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: DecoupleSearch is a proposed framework for enhancing Agentic RAG systems by decoupling planning and search processes to independently optimize reasoning and search grounding, addressing challenges such as dependency, lack of supervision, and large candidate spaces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the flexibility and performance of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems by addressing challenges in autonomous agents' planning and search processes.

Method: DecoupleSearch employs dual value models to decouple planning and searching tasks, constructs reasoning trees for evaluation, utilizes Monte Carlo Tree Search for assessing step quality, and refines inference using Hierarchical Beam Search.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate that DecoupleSearch is effective across multiple policy models with different sizes.

Conclusion: The framework successfully addresses key challenges faced in RAG systems, enhancing both autonomous reasoning and search capabilities with a scalable methodology.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems have emerged as a pivotal
methodology for enhancing Large Language Models (LLMs) through the dynamic
integration of external knowledge. To further improve RAG's flexibility,
Agentic RAG introduces autonomous agents into the workflow. However, Agentic
RAG faces several challenges: (1) the success of each step depends on both
high-quality planning and accurate search, (2) the lack of supervision for
intermediate reasoning steps, and (3) the exponentially large candidate space
for planning and searching. To address these challenges, we propose
DecoupleSearch, a novel framework that decouples planning and search processes
using dual value models, enabling independent optimization of plan reasoning
and search grounding. Our approach constructs a reasoning tree, where each node
represents planning and search steps. We leverage Monte Carlo Tree Search to
assess the quality of each step. During inference, Hierarchical Beam Search
iteratively refines planning and search candidates with dual value models.
Extensive experiments across policy models of varying parameter sizes,
demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

TL;DR: This paper presents AdaQR, a hybrid query rewriting framework combining dense retrievers and large language models to reduce reasoning costs while enhancing retrieval accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiencies and computational expenses of dense retrievers and LLMs in handling reasoning-intensive queries.

Method: The proposed AdaQR framework uses a Reasoner Router to dynamically switch between dense reasoning and deep LLM reasoning based on query complexity. Dense reasoning involves embedding space reasoning for efficiency.

Result: AdaQR achieves a 28% cost reduction in reasoning and improves retrieval performance by 7% on large-scale benchmarks.

Conclusion: AdaQR successfully balances efficiency and accuracy for complex query reasoning, offering a scalable solution for retrieval systems.

Abstract: Dense retrievers enhance retrieval by encoding queries and documents into
continuous vectors, but they often struggle with reasoning-intensive queries.
Although Large Language Models (LLMs) can reformulate queries to capture
complex reasoning, applying them universally incurs significant computational
cost. In this work, we propose Adaptive Query Reasoning (AdaQR), a hybrid query
rewriting framework. Within this framework, a Reasoner Router dynamically
directs each query to either fast dense reasoning or deep LLM reasoning. The
dense reasoning is achieved by the Dense Reasoner, which performs LLM-style
reasoning directly in the embedding space, enabling a controllable trade-off
between efficiency and accuracy. Experiments on large-scale retrieval
benchmarks BRIGHT show that AdaQR reduces reasoning cost by 28% while
preserving-or even improving-retrieval performance by 7%.

*Mahsa Goodarzi,M. Abdullah Canbaz*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The study examines bias in fashion recommender systems, using system dynamics modeling to analyze bias evolution and its effects, suggesting current strategies are insufficient and need enhancement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address biases in fashion recommender systems that amplify societal stereotypes and distort experiences, aiming to ensure fairness and inclusivity.

Method: The study employs system dynamics modeling with experimental simulations to understand the evolution and impacts of biases in recommender systems.

Result: Findings show inductive biases have a greater impact than user biases, emphasizing the need for improved strategies beyond current debiasing methods.

Conclusion: Advancing debiasing strategies and incorporating broader contextual factors is necessary to mitigate bias propagation and promote fairness in recommender systems.

Abstract: Bias in recommender systems not only distorts user experience but also
perpetuates and amplifies existing societal stereotypes, particularly in
sectors like fashion e-commerce. This study employs a dynamic modeling approach
to scrutinize the mechanisms of bias activation and reinforcement within
Fashion Recommender Systems (FRS). By leveraging system dynamics modeling and
experimental simulations, we dissect the temporal evolution of bias and its
multifaceted impacts on system performance. Our analysis reveals that inductive
biases exert a more substantial influence on system outcomes than user biases,
suggesting critical areas for intervention. We demonstrate that while current
debiasing strategies, including data rebalancing and algorithmic
regularization, are effective to an extent, they require further enhancement to
comprehensively mitigate biases. This research underscores the necessity for
advancing these strategies and extending system boundaries to incorporate
broader contextual factors such as user demographics and item diversity, aiming
to foster inclusivity and fairness in FRS. The findings advocate for a
proactive approach in recommender system design to counteract bias propagation
and ensure equitable user experiences.

TL;DR: CustomIR is a framework using synthetic query-document pairs for unsupervised domain-specific language embedding model adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the performance degradation of dense embedding models on specialized corpora outside their pre-training distribution.

Method: Uses large language models to generate domain-specific queries and hard negatives for unsupervised fine-tuning of language embedding models.

Result: Improved retrieval effectiveness on domain-specific datasets, with small models gaining up to 2.3 points in Recall@10.

Conclusion: CustomIR shows that synthetic fine-tuning is scalable, cost-efficient, and enhances domain-specific retrieval performance without human annotations.

Abstract: Dense embedding models have become critical for modern information retrieval,
particularly in RAG pipelines, but their performance often degrades when
applied to specialized corpora outside their pre-training distribution. To
address thi we introduce \textbf{CustomIR}, a framework for unsupervised
adaptation of pre-trained language embedding models to domain-specific corpora
using synthetically generated query-document pairs. CustomIR leverages large
language models (LLMs) to create diverse queries grounded in a known target
corpus, paired with LLM-verified hard negatives, eliminating the need for
costly human annotation. Experiments on enterprise email and messaging datasets
show that CustomIR consistently improves retrieval effectiveness with small
models gaining up to 2.3 points in Recall@10. This performance increase allows
these small models to rival the performance of much larger alternatives,
allowing for cheaper RAG deployments. These results highlight that targeted
synthetic fine-tuning offers a scalable and cost-efficient strategy for
increasing domain-specific performance.

*Zhao Liu,Yichen Zhu,Yiqing Yang,Guoping Tang,Rui Huang,Qiang Luo,Xiao Lv,Ruiming Tang,Kun Gai,Guorui Zhou*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: This paper addresses challenges in generative recommendation models by introducing DiffGRM, a diffusion-based model, enhancing item prediction and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome limitations of autoregressive models in generative recommendation, namely intra-item consistency and inter-digit heterogeneity.

Method: DiffGRM employs a masked discrete diffusion model with enhancements: Parallel Semantic Encoding (PSE), On-policy Coherent Noising (OCN), and Confidence-guided Parallel Denoising (CPD).

Result: Experiments on multiple datasets show improved recommendation performance, achieving 6.9%-15.5% gains in NDCG@10 versus strong baselines.

Conclusion: DiffGRM effectively addresses structural challenges in generative recommendation and demonstrates superior performance, offering a robust alternative to autoregressive models.

Abstract: Generative recommendation (GR) is an emerging paradigm that represents each
item via a tokenizer as an n-digit semantic ID (SID) and predicts the next item
by autoregressively generating its SID conditioned on the user's history.
However, two structural properties of SIDs make ARMs ill-suited. First,
intra-item consistency: the n digits jointly specify one item, yet the
left-to-right causality trains each digit only under its prefix and blocks
bidirectional cross-digit evidence, collapsing supervision to a single causal
path. Second, inter-digit heterogeneity: digits differ in semantic granularity
and predictability, while the uniform next-token objective assigns equal weight
to all digits, overtraining easy digits and undertraining hard digits. To
address these two issues, we propose DiffGRM, a diffusion-based GR model that
replaces the autoregressive decoder with a masked discrete diffusion model
(MDM), thereby enabling bidirectional context and any-order parallel generation
of SID digits for recommendation. Specifically, we tailor DiffGRM in three
aspects: (1) tokenization with Parallel Semantic Encoding (PSE) to decouple
digits and balance per-digit information; (2) training with On-policy Coherent
Noising (OCN) that prioritizes uncertain digits via coherent masking to
concentrate supervision on high-value signals; and (3) inference with
Confidence-guided Parallel Denoising (CPD) that fills higher-confidence digits
first and generates diverse Top-K candidates. Experiments show consistent gains
over strong generative and discriminative recommendation baselines on multiple
datasets, improving NDCG@10 by 6.9%-15.5%. Code is available at

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper introduces MICRec, a unified framework that incorporates inductive modeling, multimodal guidance, and cross-domain transfer for improved recommender systems, outperforming competitive baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in recommender systems that focus on single aspects and are unable to manage diverse, complex recommendation scenarios effectively.

Method: MICRec uses inductive modeling based on INMO, combines multimodal data aggregation, and employs cross-domain transfer utilizing overlapping users as anchors to combat data sparsity.

Result: MICRec achieves superior performance over 12 existing baselines, particularly in domains with scarce training data.

Conclusion: The proposed framework demonstrates robust and generalizable capabilities in handling diverse recommendation scenarios, overcoming the limitations of previous methods.

Abstract: Recommender systems have long been built upon the modeling of interactions
between users and items, while recent studies have sought to broaden this
paradigm by generalizing to new users and items, incorporating diverse
information sources, and transferring knowledge across domains. Nevertheless,
these efforts have largely focused on individual aspects, hindering their
ability to tackle the complex recommendation scenarios that arise in daily
consumptions across diverse domains. In this paper, we present MICRec, a
unified framework that fuses inductive modeling, multimodal guidance, and
cross-domain transfer to capture user contexts and latent preferences in
heterogeneous and incomplete real-world data. Moving beyond the inductive
backbone of INMO, our model refines expressive representations through
modality-based aggregation and alleviates data sparsity by leveraging
overlapping users as anchors across domains, thereby enabling robust and
generalizable recommendation. Experiments show that MICRec outperforms 12
baselines, with notable gains in domains with limited training data.

### [664] [A Benchmark for Open-Domain Numerical Fact-Checking Enhanced by Claim Decomposition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22055)
*V Venktesh,Deepali Prabhu,Avishek Anand*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper introduces QuanTemp++, a dataset designed to improve numerical claim fact-checking by mimicking human fact-checker approaches in a realistic retrieval setting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Numerical claims can appear deceptively credible and have significant societal impacts when false. Existing systems are insufficient for natural numerical claims due to less realistic evidence retrieval and temporal leakage.

Method: QuanTemp++ involves claim decomposition emulating human fact-checker methods, assembling evidence without temporal leakage, and characterizing key retrieval paradigms for verification pipelines.

Result: The dataset provides natural numerical claims paired with relevant evidence, improves retrieval realism, and enables examination of retrieval paradigms' impacts on verification outcomes.

Conclusion: QuanTemp++ offers a foundation for developing automated methods that better address numerical claim fact-checking with human-like evidence retrieval and accurate verification processes.

Abstract: Fact-checking numerical claims is critical as the presence of numbers provide
mirage of veracity despite being fake potentially causing catastrophic impacts
on society. The prior works in automatic fact verification do not primarily
focus on natural numerical claims. A typical human fact-checker first retrieves
relevant evidence addressing the different numerical aspects of the claim and
then reasons about them to predict the veracity of the claim. Hence, the search
process of a human fact-checker is a crucial skill that forms the foundation of
the verification process. Emulating a real-world setting is essential to aid in
the development of automated methods that encompass such skills. However,
existing benchmarks employ heuristic claim decomposition approaches augmented
with weakly supervised web search to collect evidences for verifying claims.
This sometimes results in less relevant evidences and noisy sources with
temporal leakage rendering a less realistic retrieval setting for claim
verification. Hence, we introduce QuanTemp++: a dataset consisting of natural
numerical claims, an open domain corpus, with the corresponding relevant
evidence for each claim. The evidences are collected through a claim
decomposition process approximately emulating the approach of human
fact-checker and veracity labels ensuring there is no temporal leakage. Given
this dataset, we also characterize the retrieval performance of key claim
decomposition paradigms. Finally, we observe their effect on the outcome of the
verification pipeline and draw insights. The code for data pipeline along with
link to data can be found at https://github.com/VenkteshV/QuanTemp_Plus

TL;DR: The authors utilize AI (PatternBoost) to identify counter-examples to the log-concavity conjecture for tree independence sequences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to challenge and further explore the longstanding conjecture that the independence sequences of trees are log concave, especially given recent findings of exceptions.

Method: The authors use the AI architecture PatternBoost to systematically scan graph data for trees whose independence sequences are not log-concave.

Result: They discovered tens of thousands of new counter-examples to the conjecture for trees with vertex sizes ranging from 27 to 101.

Conclusion: The results significantly expand the set of known counter-examples to the log-concavity conjecture, revealing deeper insights into its limitations and providing opportunities for further study into tree structures.

Abstract: Given a graph $G$, its independence sequence is the integral sequence
$a_1,a_2,...,a_n$, where $a_i$ is the number of independent sets of vertices of
size i. In the late 80's Alavi, Erdos, Malde, Schwenk showed that this sequence
need not be unimodal for general graphs, but conjectured that it is always
unimodal whenever $G$ is a tree. This conjecture was then naturally generalized
to claim that the independence sequence of trees should be log concave, in the
sense that $a_i^2$ is always above $a_{i-1}a_{i+1}$. This conjecture stood for
many years, until in 2023, Kadrawi, Levit, Yosef, and Mizrachi proved that
there were exactly two trees on 26 vertices whose independence sequence was not
log concave. In this paper, we use the AI architecture PatternBoost, developed
by Charton, Ellenberg, Wagner, and Williamson to train a machine to find
counter-examples to the log-concavity conjecture. We will discuss the successes
of this approach - finding tens of thousands of new counter-examples to
log-concavity with vertex set sizes varying from 27 to 101 - and some of its
fascinating failures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To refine and enhance consensus thresholds in network systems and improve their robustness against various real-world factors affecting convergence.

Method: Authors use mechanized proofs in Coq and conduct experiments across different graph types like rings, grids, scale-free, and weighted graphs.

Result: The study establishes tighter bounds, introduces refined thresholds, and validates them through experiments by ensuring convergence across different scenarios and policies.

Conclusion: Enhanced consensus thresholds and mechanisms make network systems more robust, with validated proof structures and experimental support showcasing the model's applicability across diverse settings.

Abstract: We study Heaven-Hell dynamics, a model for network consensus. A known result
establishes an exact one-step convergence threshold for systems with a single
uniform hub: the per-node inbound hub weight W suffices if and only if W >=
maxrest, the maximum non-hub inbound mass. We develop scale laws and
operational refinements that make this threshold robust to tie-breaking
policies, node-specific tolerances, targeted seeding, multiple hubs, and
asynchronous updates. Our contributions include a conservation-law perspective,
parameterized tie policies, tighter pointwise bounds improving on classical
worst-case guarantees, one-pass fairness for asynchronous updates, and
sufficient conditions for seeded convergence. All proofs are mechanized in Coq,
with experiments on rings, grids, scale-free graphs, and heterogeneous weighted
graphs validating tightness and gap closures

They used conditions where participants received real-time message suggestions from an AI, personalized either for the individual or adapted for the group's context.

Result: The study found that AI assistance subtly shifts linguistic styles, influencing collective structures. Individual-focused suggestions led to segregation into like-minded groups, while group-contextual suggestions enhanced social cohesion through more receptive communication.

Conclusion: AI-mediated communication can promote social cohesion in diverse groups, but the design of personalization critically impacts whether it fosters inclusivity or segregation.

Abstract: Social cohesion is difficult to sustain in societies marked by opinion
diversity, particularly in online communication. As large language model
(LLM)-driven messaging assistance becomes increasingly embedded in these
contexts, it raises critical questions about its societal impact. We present an
online experiment with 557 participants who engaged in multi-round discussions
on politically controversial topics while freely reconfiguring their discussion
groups. In some conditions, participants received real-time message suggestions
generated by an LLM, either personalized to the individual or adapted to their
group context. We find that subtle shifts in linguistic style during
communication, mediated by AI assistance, can scale up to reshape collective
structures. While individual-focused assistance leads users to segregate into
like-minded groups, relational assistance that incorporates group members'
stances enhances cohesion through more receptive exchanges. These findings
demonstrate that AI-mediated communication can support social cohesion in
diverse groups, but outcomes critically depend on how personalization is
designed.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces RejSCore, a lightweight hardware accelerator addressing rejection sampling challenges in post-quantum cryptography for resource-constrained devices, offering efficient performance for the QR-UOV scheme.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Post-quantum cryptographic schemes require complex operations like rejection sampling, which pose challenges for deployment in resource-limited environments.

Method: Developed RejSCore, a lightweight hardware accelerator integrating AES-CTR-128-based pseudorandom number generation and iterative rejection sampling, evaluated on Artix-7 FPGA and 65 nm CMOS.

Result: RejSCore demonstrates efficient performance with low area and power consumption, achieving high clock frequencies and suitable metrics using QR-UOV security parameters.

Conclusion: The proposed design is effective for resource-constrained, security-critical scenarios, addressing a specific gap in post-quantum cryptography hardware implementations.

Abstract: Post-quantum multivariate public key cryptography (MPKC) schemes resist
quantum threats but require heavy operations, such as rejection sampling, which
challenge resource-limited devices. Prior hardware designs have addressed
various aspects of MPKC signature generation. However, rejection sampling
remains largely unexplored in such contexts. This paper presents RejSCore, a
lightweight hardware accelerator for rejection sampling in post-quantum
cryptography. It specifically targets the QR-UOV scheme, which is a prominent
candidate under the second-round of the National Institute of Standards and
Technology (NIST) additional digital signature standardization process. The
architecture includes an AES-CTR-128-based pseudorandom number generator.
Moreover, a lightweight iterative method is employed in rejection sampling,
offering reduced resource consumption and area overhead while slightly
increasing latency. The performance of RejSCore is comprehensively evaluated on
Artix-7 FPGAs and 65 nm CMOS technology using the Area-Delay Product (ADP) and
Power-Delay Product (PDP). On Artix-7 and 65 nm CMOS, RejSCore achieves an area
of 2042 slices and 464,866~$\mu m^2$, with operating frequencies of 222 MHz and
565 MHz, respectively. Using the QR-UOV parameters for security level I ($q =
127$, $v = 156$, $m = 54$, $l = 3$), the core completes its operation in 8525
clock cycles. The ADP and PDP evaluations confirm RejSCore's suitability for
deployment in resource-constrained and security-critical environments.

### [669] [Beyond Imprecise Distance Metrics: LLM-Predicted Target Call Stacks for Directed Greybox Fuzzing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23101)
*Yifan Zhang,Xin Zhang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel Directed Greybox Fuzzing (DGF) approach using Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance efficiency and precision in bug targeting, achieving faster vulnerability discovery and identifying 10 new vulnerabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the inefficiency of existing DGF approaches that use static analysis with imprecise distance metrics, leading to reduced fuzzing efficiency due to false positives in execution path prioritization.

Method: The proposed method replaces static distance metrics with precise call stack representations obtained using call graphs from static analysis. It leverages LLMs to predict call stacks likely to trigger vulnerabilities, guiding seed prioritization by overlapping execution paths with predicted call stacks.

Result: The approach outperforms several state-of-the-art fuzzers by triggering vulnerabilities 1.86x to 3.09x faster. It also discovered 10 new vulnerabilities and 2 incomplete fixes, with 10 CVEs assigned.

Conclusion: Integrating LLMs into the seed prioritization mechanism of DGF makes fuzzing significantly faster and more accurate, demonstrating its potential for revealing vulnerabilities and improving software security.

Abstract: Directed greybox fuzzing (DGF) aims to efficiently trigger bugs at specific
target locations by prioritizing seeds whose execution paths are more likely to
mutate into triggering target bugs. However, existing DGF approaches suffer
from imprecise probability calculations due to their reliance on complex
distance metrics derived from static analysis. The over-approximations inherent
in static analysis cause a large number of irrelevant execution paths to be
mistakenly considered to potentially mutate into triggering target bugs,
significantly reducing fuzzing efficiency. We propose to replace static
analysis-based distance metrics with precise call stack representations. Call
stacks represent precise control flows, thereby avoiding false information in
static analysis. We leverage large language models (LLMs) to predict
vulnerability-triggering call stacks for guiding seed prioritization. Our
approach constructs call graphs through static analysis to identify methods
that can potentially reach target locations, then utilizes LLMs to predict the
most likely call stack sequence that triggers the vulnerability. Seeds whose
execution paths have higher overlap with the predicted call stack are
prioritized for mutation. This is the first work to integrate LLMs into the
core seed prioritization mechanism of DGF. We implement our approach and
evaluate it against several state-of-the-art fuzzers. On a suite of real-world
programs, our approach triggers vulnerabilities $1.86\times$ to $3.09\times$
faster compared to baselines. In addition, our approach identifies 10 new
vulnerabilities and 2 incomplete fixes in the latest versions of programs used
in our controlled experiments through directed patch testing, with 10 assigned
CVE IDs.

*Chuan Yan,Zeng Li,Kunlin Cai,Liuhuo Wan,Ruomai Ren,Yiran Shen,Guangdong Bai*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper studies privacy practices in the VR app ecosystem, revealing compliance issues across 6,565 apps from five app stores.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of domain-specific regulations governing privacy-sensitive data handling in VR apps.

Method: Conducted a multi-faceted study using NLP, reverse engineering, and static analysis to analyze declarative and behavioral privacy practices.

Result: Significant privacy compliance issues were found: one-third of apps fail to declare sensitive data use, and 21.5% lack valid privacy policies.

Conclusion: The paper highlights the gaps in privacy protection within VR apps, urging developers, users, and operators to enhance privacy compliance.

Abstract: Virtual Reality (VR) has gained increasing traction among various domains in
recent years, with major companies such as Meta, Pico, and Microsoft launching
their application stores to support third-party developers in releasing their
applications (or simply apps). These apps offer rich functionality but
inherently collect privacy-sensitive data, such as user biometrics, behaviors,
and the surrounding environment. Nevertheless, there is still a lack of
domain-specific regulations to govern the data handling of VR apps, resulting
in significant variations in their privacy practices among app stores.
  In this work, we present the first comprehensive multi-store study of privacy
practices in the current VR app ecosystem, covering a large-scale dataset
involving 6,565 apps collected from five major app stores. We assess both
declarative and behavioral privacy practices of VR apps, using a multi-faceted
approach based on natural language processing, reverse engineering, and static
analysis. Our assessment reveals significant privacy compliance issues across
all stores, underscoring the premature status of privacy protection in this
rapidly growing ecosystem. For instance, one third of apps fail to declare
their use of sensitive data, and 21.5\% of apps neglect to provide valid
privacy policies. Our work sheds light on the status quo of privacy protection
within the VR app ecosystem for the first time. Our findings should raise an
alert to VR app developers and users, and encourage store operators to
implement stringent regulations on privacy compliance among VR apps.

*Pavlos Ntais*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper introduces 'Jailbreak Mimicry', a method to automatically generate adversarial prompts targeting LLM vulnerabilities, significantly improving attack success rate (ASR) and exposing safety limitations in AI systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the vulnerability of large language models to adversarial prompt engineering attacks, especially in cybersecurity applications where such vulnerabilities could be exploited to bypass safety mechanisms.

Method: The authors developed 'Jailbreak Mimicry', a process using parameter-efficient fine-tuning (LoRA), applied to Mistral-7B and trained with a curated dataset derived from AdvBench to create compact attacker models that can generate jailbreak prompts in a systematic manner.

Result: Jailbreak Mimicry achieved an 81% ASR on GPT-OSS-20B, significantly outperforming direct prompting (1.5% ASR). Cross-model testing showed varying success rates: 66.5% ASR against GPT-4, 79.5% ASR on Llama-3, and 33.0% against Gemini 2.5 Flash. Cybersecurity contexts (93% ASR) were most vulnerable, while categories involving physical harm showed more resistance (55.6% ASR).

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the systematic vulnerabilities of current LLM safety mechanisms and underscores the need for robust defenses in AI-driven cybersecurity applications to mitigate susceptibility to adversarial prompt engineering attacks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) remain vulnerable to sophisticated prompt
engineering attacks that exploit contextual framing to bypass safety
mechanisms, posing significant risks in cybersecurity applications. We
introduce Jailbreak Mimicry, a systematic methodology for training compact
attacker models to automatically generate narrative-based jailbreak prompts in
a one-shot manner. Our approach transforms adversarial prompt discovery from
manual craftsmanship into a reproducible scientific process, enabling proactive
vulnerability assessment in AI-driven security systems. Developed for the
OpenAI GPT-OSS-20B Red-Teaming Challenge, we use parameter-efficient
fine-tuning (LoRA) on Mistral-7B with a curated dataset derived from AdvBench,
achieving an 81.0% Attack Success Rate (ASR) against GPT-OSS-20B on a held-out
test set of 200 items. Cross-model evaluation reveals significant variation in
vulnerability patterns: our attacks achieve 66.5% ASR against GPT-4, 79.5% on
Llama-3 and 33.0% against Gemini 2.5 Flash, demonstrating both broad
applicability and model-specific defensive strengths in cybersecurity contexts.
This represents a 54x improvement over direct prompting (1.5% ASR) and
demonstrates systematic vulnerabilities in current safety alignment approaches.
Our analysis reveals that technical domains (Cybersecurity: 93% ASR) and
deception-based attacks (Fraud: 87.8% ASR) are particularly vulnerable,
highlighting threats to AI-integrated threat detection, malware analysis, and
secure systems, while physical harm categories show greater resistance (55.6%
ASR). We employ automated harmfulness evaluation using Claude Sonnet 4,
cross-validated with human expert assessment, ensuring reliable and scalable
evaluation for cybersecurity red-teaming. Finally, we analyze failure
mechanisms and discuss defensive strategies to mitigate these vulnerabilities
in AI for cybersecurity.

*Swagatam Das*

Main category: math.PR

TL;DR: This paper extends classical diffusion models to a framework based on free probability, establishing a mathematical foundation for generative modeling in noncommutative spaces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To build a generative modeling framework compatible with free probability for handling high-dimensional structured or operator-valued data.

Method: The authors developed free diffusion processes and utilized free stochastic analysis tools such as free Malliavin calculus and free Wasserstein gradient flows.

Result: They derived reverse-time SDEs, extended diffusion frameworks to free entropy geometry, and showed convergence to semicircular equilibrium law.

Conclusion: This work advances generative modeling by linking modern diffusion models with free entropy geometry, supporting noncommutative and high-dimensional structured data modeling.

Abstract: This work develops a rigorous framework for diffusion-based generative
modeling in the setting of free probability. We extend classical denoising
diffusion probabilistic models to free diffusion processes -- stochastic
dynamics acting on noncommutative random variables whose spectral measures
evolve by free additive convolution. The forward dynamics satisfy a free
Fokker--Planck equation that increases Voiculescu's free entropy and dissipates
free Fisher information, providing a noncommutative analogue of the classical
de Bruijn identity. Using tools from free stochastic analysis, including a free
Malliavin calculus and a Clark--Ocone representation, we derive the
reverse-time stochastic differential equation driven by the conjugate variable,
the free analogue of the score function. We further develop a variational
formulation of these flows in the free Wasserstein space, showing that the
resulting gradient-flow structure converges to the semicircular equilibrium
law. Together, these results connect modern diffusion models with the
information geometry of free entropy and establish a mathematical foundation
for generative modeling with operator-valued or high-dimensional structured
data.

*Masahiro Kato*

Main category: econ.EM

TL;DR: This paper introduces a unified framework for debiased machine learning by combining Neyman targeted estimation and generalized Riesz regression to address bias issues in causal effects and structural model estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to tackle bias issues inherent in causal effects estimation and structural models when regression functions are used from machine learning methods.

Method: The authors propose a direct debiased framework using Neyman targeted estimation and generalized Riesz regression, employing Bregman divergence as a loss metric for nuisance parameter estimation.

Result: The framework unifies several methods like TMLE, covariate balancing, and density-ratio estimation, and enables automatic debiased learning and efficient nuisance parameter estimation.

Conclusion: This generalized approach improves bias reduction in machine learning-estimated regression functions, achieving automatic debiased learning and other balancing properties without explicit objectives.

Abstract: We develop a direct debiased machine learning framework comprising Neyman
targeted estimation and generalized Riesz regression. Our framework unifies
Riesz regression for automatic debiased machine learning, covariate balancing,
targeted maximum likelihood estimation (TMLE), and density-ratio estimation. In
many problems involving causal effects or structural models, the parameters of
interest depend on regression functions. Plugging regression functions
estimated by machine learning methods into the identifying equations can yield
poor performance because of first-stage bias. To reduce such bias, debiased
machine learning employs Neyman orthogonal estimating equations. Debiased
machine learning typically requires estimation of the Riesz representer and the
regression function. For this problem, we develop a direct debiased machine
learning framework with an end-to-end algorithm. We formulate estimation of the
nuisance parameters, the regression function and the Riesz representer, as
minimizing the discrepancy between Neyman orthogonal scores computed with known
and unknown nuisance parameters, which we refer to as Neyman targeted
estimation. Neyman targeted estimation includes Riesz representer estimation,
and we measure discrepancies using the Bregman divergence. The Bregman
divergence encompasses various loss functions as special cases, where the
squared loss yields Riesz regression and the Kullback-Leibler divergence yields
entropy balancing. We refer to this Riesz representer estimation as generalized
Riesz regression. Neyman targeted estimation also yields TMLE as a special case
for regression function estimation. Furthermore, for specific pairs of models
and Riesz representer estimation methods, we can automatically obtain the
covariate balancing property without explicitly solving the covariate balancing
objective.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation was to overcome the scaling failures in computational astrophysics when simulating the Milky Way with sufficient resolution to resolve individual stars.

Method: The authors developed a novel integration scheme combining $N$-body/hydrodynamics simulations and surrogate models powered by machine learning to bypass short timesteps caused by supernova explosions.

Result: Using the proposed method, a simulation was performed with 300 billion particles, employing 148,900 nodes (7,147,200 CPU cores). This broke past the billion-particle barrier and achieved star-by-star resolution of the Milky Way.

Conclusion: This work establishes a highly scalable simulation approach, enabling unprecedented computational astrophysics capabilities and advancing resolutions beyond current limitations.

Abstract: A major goal of computational astrophysics is to simulate the Milky Way
Galaxy with sufficient resolution down to individual stars. However, the
scaling fails due to some small-scale, short-timescale phenomena, such as
supernova explosions. We have developed a novel integration scheme of
$N$-body/hydrodynamics simulations working with machine learning. This approach
bypasses the short timesteps caused by supernova explosions using a surrogate
model, thereby improving scalability. With this method, we reached 300 billion
particles using 148,900 nodes, equivalent to 7,147,200 CPU cores, breaking
through the billion-particle barrier currently faced by state-of-the-art
simulations. This resolution allows us to perform the first star-by-star galaxy
simulation, which resolves individual stars in the Milky Way Galaxy. The
performance scales over $10^4$ CPU cores, an upper limit in the current
state-of-the-art simulations using both A64FX and X86-64 processors and NVIDIA

TL;DR: The paper addresses the Traveling Salesperson Problem with multi-agent Pathfinding (TSPF) by proposing CBS-TS, an optimal algorithm for collaborative agent task assignment that minimizes flowtime.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create an efficient and optimal solution for solving the TSPF problem, ensuring task location visits by multi-agents are completed without collisions and with minimized flowtime.

Method: The authors introduced Conflict-Based Search with Task Sequencing (CBS-TS), which combines mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) for task sequencing with Conflict-Based Search (CBS) and Multi-Label A* for collision-free path planning.

Result: Experimental evaluations reveal CBS-TS achieves higher success rates and consistently optimal solutions compared to the baseline method CBSS, which occasionally reaches near-optimal solutions.

Conclusion: CBS-TS effectively addresses the TSPF problem by improving computational efficiency and achieving optimal task sequencing and collision-free paths, outperforming existing methods like CBSS.

Abstract: In this article, we address the problem of collaborative task assignment,
sequencing, and multi-agent pathfinding (TSPF), where a team of agents must
visit a set of task locations without collisions while minimizing flowtime.
TSPF incorporates agent-task compatibility constraints and ensures that all
tasks are completed. We propose a Conflict-Based Search with Task Sequencing
(CBS-TS), an optimal and complete algorithm that alternates between finding new
task sequences and resolving conflicts in the paths of current sequences.
CBS-TS uses a mixed-integer linear program (MILP) to optimize task sequencing
and employs Conflict-Based Search (CBS) with Multi-Label A* (MLA*) for
collision-free path planning within a search forest. By invoking MILP for the
next-best sequence only when needed, CBS-TS efficiently limits the search
space, enhancing computational efficiency while maintaining optimality. We
compare the performance of our CBS-TS against Conflict-based Steiner Search
(CBSS), a baseline method that, with minor modifications, can address the TSPF
problem. Experimental results demonstrate that CBS-TS outperforms CBSS in most
testing scenarios, achieving higher success rates and consistently optimal
solutions, whereas CBSS achieves near-optimal solutions in some cases. The
