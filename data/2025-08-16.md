Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces a multi-agent AI system combining diverse analytical approaches to detect disinformation, achieving high accuracy in text-based verification tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to tackle the growing issue of disinformation spread across digital platforms, which threatens information integrity.

Method: The study proposes a multi-agent system incorporating logistic regression, Wikipedia-based named entity recognition, LLM prompt engineering for coherence detection, and web-scraped relational triplet analysis. These are integrated under the Model Context Protocol for unified functioning.

Result: The proposed system achieved a remarkable accuracy of 95.3% and an F1 score of 0.964. It significantly outperformed standalone agents and traditional detection methods.

Conclusion: The modular and scalable multi-agent design proved effective for disinformation detection while maintaining transparency in decision-making processes.

Abstract: The large spread of disinformation across digital platforms creates
significant challenges to information integrity. This paper presents a
multi-agent system that uses relation extraction to detect disinformation in
news articles, focusing on titles and short text snippets. The proposed Agentic
AI system combines four agents: (i) a machine learning agent (logistic
regression), (ii) a Wikipedia knowledge check agent (which relies on named
entity recognition), (iii) a coherence detection agent (using LLM prompt
engineering), and (iv) a web-scraped data analyzer that extracts relational
triplets for fact checking. The system is orchestrated via the Model Context
Protocol (MCP), offering shared context and live learning across components.
Results demonstrate that the multi-agent ensemble achieves 95.3% accuracy with
an F1 score of 0.964, significantly outperforming individual agents and
traditional approaches. The weighted aggregation method, mathematically derived
from individual agent misclassification rates, proves superior to algorithmic
threshold optimization. The modular architecture makes the system easily
scalable, while also maintaining details of the decision processes.

### [5] [Improving and Evaluating Open Deep Research Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10152)
*Doaa Allabadi,Kyle Bradbury,Jordan M. Malof*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper examines Deep Research Agents (DRAs) and introduces BrowseComp-Small, a benchmark for comparing open-source and proprietary systems like Open Deep Research (ODR) and proprietary systems from Anthropic and Google. It proposes ODR+, achieving a notable improvement over prior systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DRAs have showcased strong capabilities, but evaluations primarily involve proprietary systems. The work seeks to assess open-source alternatives and create accessible benchmarks for academic labs.

Method: The authors adapt the BrowseComp benchmark to develop BrowseComp-Small, perform evaluations on multiple systems (ODR, Anthropic, and Google), and introduce improvements to the ODR model to form ODR+.

Result: All systems initially have 0% accuracy on the BC-Small test set. The modified ODR+ model shows state-of-the-art performance at a 10% success rate. Ablation studies confirm contributions from all applied improvements.

Conclusion: ODR+ successfully sets a new benchmark for DRA performance in an academic setting, demonstrating the viability of open-source systems and paving the way for further research.

Abstract: We focus here on Deep Research Agents (DRAs), which are systems that can take
a natural language prompt from a user, and then autonomously search for, and
utilize, internet-based content to address the prompt. Recent DRAs have
demonstrated impressive capabilities on public benchmarks however, recent
research largely involves proprietary closed-source systems. At the time of
this work, we only found one open-source DRA, termed Open Deep Research (ODR).
In this work we adapt the challenging recent BrowseComp benchmark to compare
ODR to existing proprietary systems. We propose BrowseComp-Small (BC-Small),
comprising a subset of BrowseComp, as a more computationally-tractable DRA
benchmark for academic labs. We benchmark ODR and two other proprietary systems
on BC-Small: one system from Anthropic and one system from Google. We find that
all three systems achieve 0% accuracy on the test set of 60 questions. We
introduce three strategic improvements to ODR, resulting in the ODR+ model,
which achieves a state-of-the-art 10% success rate on BC-Small among both
closed-source and open-source systems. We report ablation studies indicating
that all three of our improvements contributed to the success of ODR+.

### [6] [Pruning Long Chain-of-Thought of Large Reasoning Models via Small-Scale Preference Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10164)
*Bin Hong,Jiayu Liu,Zhenya Huang,Kai Zhang,Mengdi Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces Length Controlled Preference Optimization (LCPO) to significantly reduce the output length of Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) while maintaining reasoning quality, thereby improving computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the computational inefficiency and overthinking associated with lengthy outputs from Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) in Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, without compromising reasoning quality.

Method: The method involves analyzing generation path distributions and filtering generated trajectories based on difficulty estimation. LCPO is then proposed, leveraging a Bradley-Terry loss framework to optimize length preferences efficiently.

Result: The results show a significant reduction in output length by over 50% across various benchmarks, while preserving reasoning performance.

Conclusion: The study concludes that LCPO is a promising approach for enhancing computational efficiency in LRMs by guiding them toward shorter and efficient reasoning outputs, maintaining high reasoning quality.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have demonstrated strong
performance on complex tasks through long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning.
However, their lengthy outputs increase computational costs and may lead to
overthinking, raising challenges in balancing reasoning effectiveness and
efficiency. Current methods for efficient reasoning often compromise reasoning
quality or require extensive resources. This paper investigates efficient
methods to reduce the generation length of LRMs. We analyze generation path
distributions and filter generated trajectories through difficulty estimation.
Subsequently, we analyze the convergence behaviors of the objectives of various
preference optimization methods under a Bradley-Terry loss based framework.
Based on the analysis, we propose Length Controlled Preference Optimization
(LCPO) that directly balances the implicit reward related to NLL loss. LCPO can
effectively learn length preference with limited data and training. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces the average
output length by over 50\% across multiple benchmarks while maintaining the
reasoning performance. Our work highlights the potential for computationally
efficient approaches in guiding LRMs toward efficient reasoning.

### [7] [CVCM Track Circuits Pre-emptive Failure Diagnostics for Predictive Maintenance Using Deep Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09054)
*Debdeep Mukherjee,Eduardo Di Santi,Clément Lefebvre,Nenad Mijatovic,Victor Martin,Thierry Josse,Jonathan Brown,Kenza Saiah*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a deep learning-based predictive maintenance framework for railway track circuits, achieving high accuracy and early anomaly detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve maintenance planning and reduce downtime and revenue loss through early identification of anomalies in safety-critical track circuit systems.

Method: The authors used deep neural networks to classify anomalies in Continuous Variable Current Modulation (CVCM) systems, with validation across multiple failure cases and offering uncertainty estimates using conformal prediction.

Result: The proposed framework achieved 99.31% accuracy with early detection of anomalies close to their onset and provided reliable confidence estimates.

Conclusion: The proposed method enhances operational reliability and is scalable for global deployment, applicable to diverse railway systems.

Abstract: Track circuits are critical for railway operations, acting as the main
signalling sub-system to locate trains. Continuous Variable Current Modulation
(CVCM) is one such technology. Like any field-deployed, safety-critical asset,
it can fail, triggering cascading disruptions. Many failures originate as
subtle anomalies that evolve over time, often not visually apparent in
monitored signals. Conventional approaches, which rely on clear signal changes,
struggle to detect them early. Early identification of failure types is
essential to improve maintenance planning, minimising downtime and revenue
loss. Leveraging deep neural networks, we propose a predictive maintenance
framework that classifies anomalies well before they escalate into failures.
Validated on 10 CVCM failure cases across different installations, the method
is ISO-17359 compliant and outperforms conventional techniques, achieving
99.31% overall accuracy with detection within 1% of anomaly onset. Through
conformal prediction, we provide uncertainty estimates, reaching 99% confidence
with consistent coverage across classes. Given CVCMs global deployment, the
approach is scalable and adaptable to other track circuits and railway systems,
enhancing operational reliability.

*Stepan Kulibaba,Artem Dzhalilov,Roman Pakhomov,Oleg Svidchenko,Alexander Gasnikov,Aleksei Shpilman*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces KompeteAI, an advanced AutoML framework that improves exploration and execution in model development, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AutoML systems face limitations in exploration diversity and execution efficiency, hindering iterative refinement and the incorporation of real-world strategies.

Method: KompeteAI employs dynamic solution space exploration via a merging stage for strong candidates, Retrieval-Augmented Generation for sourcing real-world ideas, predictive scoring, and accelerated debugging.

Result: KompeteAI increased pipeline evaluation speed by 6.9 times and achieved 3% higher performance on MLE-Bench, outperforming RD-agent, AIDE, and Ml-Master. It also excelled in the proposed Kompete-bench.

Conclusion: KompeteAI mitigates existing AutoML constraints by enhancing exploration and execution, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance in benchmarks and offering a new benchmark standard for further evaluation.

Abstract: Recent Large Language Model (LLM)-based AutoML systems demonstrate impressive
capabilities but face significant limitations such as constrained exploration
strategies and a severe execution bottleneck. Exploration is hindered by
one-shot methods lacking diversity and Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)
approaches that fail to recombine strong partial solutions. The execution
bottleneck arises from lengthy code validation cycles that stifle iterative
refinement. To overcome these challenges, we introduce KompeteAI, a novel
AutoML framework with dynamic solution space exploration. Unlike previous MCTS
methods that treat ideas in isolation, KompeteAI introduces a merging stage
that composes top candidates. We further expand the hypothesis space by
integrating Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), sourcing ideas from Kaggle
notebooks and arXiv papers to incorporate real-world strategies. KompeteAI also
addresses the execution bottleneck via a predictive scoring model and an
accelerated debugging method, assessing solution potential using early stage
metrics to avoid costly full-code execution. This approach accelerates pipeline
evaluation 6.9 times. KompeteAI outperforms leading methods (e.g., RD-agent,
AIDE, and Ml-Master) by an average of 3\% on the primary AutoML benchmark,
MLE-Bench. Additionally, we propose Kompete-bench to address limitations in
MLE-Bench, where KompeteAI also achieves state-of-the-art results

*Mark Zilberman*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper adapts the concept of entropic potential from physics to Artificial Intelligence (AI) to address uncertainty quantification, decision-making, and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance uncertainty modeling and decision-making in AI by leveraging principles from physics and information theory.

Method: The authors formalize entropic potential for AI by incorporating counterfactual scenarios and define its application to areas like reinforcement learning, Bayesian inference, and anomaly detection.

Result: The entropic potential framework shows promise in unifying uncertainty modeling across AI applications, with concepts demonstrating practical viability and interpretability.

Conclusion: Entropic potential bridges principles from thermodynamics, information theory, and machine learning, offering a versatile solution for AI uncertainty management.

Abstract: This work demonstrates how the concept of the entropic potential of events --
a parameter quantifying the influence of discrete events on the expected future
entropy of a system -- can enhance uncertainty quantification, decision-making,
and interpretability in artificial intelligence (AI). Building on its original
formulation in physics, the framework is adapted for AI by introducing an
event-centric measure that captures how actions, observations, or other
discrete occurrences impact uncertainty at future time horizons. Both the
original and AI-adjusted definitions of entropic potential are formalized, with
the latter emphasizing conditional expectations to account for counterfactual
scenarios. Applications are explored in policy evaluation, intrinsic reward
design, explainable AI, and anomaly detection, highlighting the metric's
potential to unify and strengthen uncertainty modeling in intelligent systems.
Conceptual examples illustrate its use in reinforcement learning, Bayesian
inference, and anomaly detection, while practical considerations for
computation in complex AI models are discussed. The entropic potential
framework offers a theoretically grounded, interpretable, and versatile
approach to managing uncertainty in AI, bridging principles from
thermodynamics, information theory, and machine learning.

### [10] [Why Cannot Large Language Models Ever Make True Correct Reasoning?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10265)
*Jingde Cheng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper contests the claims of "understanding" and "reasoning" capabilities in large language models (LLMs), arguing these are misconceptions due to fundamental limitations in LLM principles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To challenge the overestimation of AI systems' cognitive abilities and clarify the misconceptions held by both professionals and non-experts about LLM capabilities.

Method: The paper uses theoretical arguments and conceptual analysis to critique the claims of reasoning and understanding capabilities in large language models.

Result: The author concludes that LLMs fundamentally lack the ability for true reasoning and understanding due to the inherent limitations in their design and operating principles.

Conclusion: LLMs, while impressive in application, cannot possess true reasoning or understanding abilities, with perceived capabilities being interpretations rather than intrinsic features.

Abstract: Recently, with the application progress of AIGC tools based on large language
models (LLMs), led by ChatGPT, many AI experts and more non-professionals are
trumpeting the "understanding ability" and "reasoning ability" of the LLMs. The
present author considers that the so-called "understanding ability" and
"reasoning ability" of LLMs are just illusions of those people who with vague
concepts. In fact, the LLMs can never have the true understanding ability and
true reasoning ability. This paper intents to explain that, because the
essential limitations of their working principle, the LLMs can never have the
ability of true correct reasoning.

### [11] [Promoting Efficient Reasoning with Verifiable Stepwise Reward](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10293)
*Chuhuai Yue,Chengqi Dong,Yinan Gao,Hang He,Jiajun Chai,Guojun Yin,Wei Lin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A paper proposes a mechanism to address overthinking in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) by incentivizing effective reasoning steps and penalizing ineffective ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LRMs excel in complex reasoning but often inefficiently handle simpler tasks due to overthinking.

Method: Introduces a rule-based Verifiable Stepwise Reward Mechanism (VSRM) integrated with reinforcement learning techniques like PPO and Reinforce++.

Result: Experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks show reduced output lengths while maintaining performance, balancing efficiency and accuracy.

Conclusion: The approach suppresses overthinking by penalizing ineffective steps and encouraging effective ones, improving reasoning efficiency.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have recently achieved significant progress in
complex reasoning tasks, aided by reinforcement learning with verifiable
rewards. However, LRMs often suffer from overthinking, expending excessive
computation on simple problems and reducing efficiency. Existing efficient
reasoning methods typically require accurate task assessment to preset token
budgets or select reasoning modes, which limits their flexibility and
reliability. In this work, we revisit the essence of overthinking and identify
that encouraging effective steps while penalizing ineffective ones is key to
its solution. To this end, we propose a novel rule-based verifiable stepwise
reward mechanism (VSRM), which assigns rewards based on the performance of
intermediate states in the reasoning trajectory. This approach is intuitive and
naturally fits the step-by-step nature of reasoning tasks. We conduct extensive
experiments on standard mathematical reasoning benchmarks, including AIME24 and
AIME25, by integrating VSRM with PPO and Reinforce++. Results show that our
method achieves substantial output length reduction while maintaining original
reasoning performance, striking an optimal balance between efficiency and
accuracy. Further analysis of overthinking frequency and pass@k score before
and after training demonstrates that our approach in deed effectively
suppresses ineffective steps and encourages effective reasoning, fundamentally
alleviating the overthinking problem. All code will be released upon
acceptance.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper presents the Diaoping-Trust-Safety team's solution for solving tasks within a multi-modal, multi-turn question-answering challenge. They employed advanced methods like curriculum learning, reinforcement learning, and web search APIs to achieve top results.

Result: Their team achieved 1st place in Task 1 with a 52.38% lead and 3rd place in Task 3 of the challenge.

Conclusion: Integration of curriculum learning and reinforcement approaches significantly enhanced the effectiveness of answering multi-modal, multi-turn questions.

Abstract: This paper describes the solutions of the Dianping-Trust-Safety team for the
META CRAG-MM challenge. The challenge requires building a comprehensive
retrieval-augmented generation system capable for multi-modal multi-turn
question answering. The competition consists of three tasks: (1) answering
questions using structured data retrieved from an image-based mock knowledge
graph, (2) synthesizing information from both knowledge graphs and web search
results, and (3) handling multi-turn conversations that require context
understanding and information aggregation from multiple sources. For Task 1,
our solution is based on the vision large language model, enhanced by
supervised fine-tuning with knowledge distilled from GPT-4.1. We further
applied curriculum learning strategies to guide reinforcement learning,
resulting in improved answer accuracy and reduced hallucination. For Task 2 and
Task 3, we additionally leveraged web search APIs to incorporate external
knowledge, enabling the system to better handle complex queries and multi-turn
conversations. Our approach achieved 1st place in Task 1 with a significant

### [13] [Multi-Agent Trust Region Policy Optimisation: A Joint Constraint Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10340)
*Chak Lam Shek,Guangyao Shi,Pratap Tokekar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces two improved methods for optimizing KL divergence thresholds in heterogeneous multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to enhance learning efficiency and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MARL relies on stable policy updates, but assigning uniform KL thresholds to agents in heterogeneous settings can hinder training efficiency by leading to slow or suboptimal updates.

Method: The paper proposes two methods: HATRPO-W, which uses a KKT-based optimization method under global KL constraints, and HATRPO-G, a greedy algorithm prioritizing agents based on their improvement-to-divergence ratios.

Result: The experimental results show that both proposed methods improve training efficiency and final rewards by over 22.5%, with HATRPO-W also providing more stable learning dynamics as indicated by lower variance.

Conclusion: The proposed methods make MARL more flexible and effective, successfully addressing limitations in heterogeneous-agent settings and advancing the capabilities of HATRPO.

Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) requires coordinated and stable
policy updates among interacting agents. Heterogeneous-Agent Trust Region
Policy Optimization (HATRPO) enforces per-agent trust region constraints using
Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence to stabilize training. However, assigning each
agent the same KL threshold can lead to slow and locally optimal updates,
especially in heterogeneous settings. To address this limitation, we propose
two approaches for allocating the KL divergence threshold across agents:
HATRPO-W, a Karush-Kuhn-Tucker-based (KKT-based) method that optimizes
threshold assignment under global KL constraints, and HATRPO-G, a greedy
algorithm that prioritizes agents based on improvement-to-divergence ratio. By
connecting sequential policy optimization with constrained threshold
scheduling, our approach enables more flexible and effective learning in
heterogeneous-agent settings. Experimental results demonstrate that our methods
significantly boost the performance of HATRPO, achieving faster convergence and
higher final rewards across diverse MARL benchmarks. Specifically, HATRPO-W and
HATRPO-G achieve comparable improvements in final performance, each exceeding
22.5%. Notably, HATRPO-W also demonstrates more stable learning dynamics, as
reflected by its lower variance.

Conclusion: The study provides insights into LLMs' capabilities and failures in imaginative reasoning and lays the groundwork for future research on exploratory agent behavior.

Abstract: We investigate the capacity of Large Language Models (LLMs) for imaginative
reasoning--the proactive construction, testing, and revision of hypotheses in
information-sparse environments. Existing benchmarks, often static or focused
on social deduction, fail to capture the dynamic, exploratory nature of this
reasoning process. To address this gap, we introduce a comprehensive research
framework based on the classic "Turtle Soup" game, integrating a benchmark, an
agent, and an evaluation protocol. We present TurtleSoup-Bench, the first
large-scale, bilingual, interactive benchmark for imaginative reasoning,
comprising 800 turtle soup puzzles sourced from both the Internet and expert
authors. We also propose Mosaic-Agent, a novel agent designed to assess LLMs'
performance in this setting. To evaluate reasoning quality, we develop a
multi-dimensional protocol measuring logical consistency, detail completion,
and conclusion alignment. Experiments with leading LLMs reveal clear capability
limits, common failure patterns, and a significant performance gap compared to
humans. Our work offers new insights into LLMs' imaginative reasoning and
establishes a foundation for future research on exploratory agent behavior.

### [15] [LeanRAG: Knowledge-Graph-Based Generation with Semantic Aggregation and Hierarchical Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10391)
*Yaoze Zhang,Rong Wu,Pinlong Cai,Xiaoman Wang,Guohang Yan,Song Mao,Ding Wang,Botian Shi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LeanRAG addresses key challenges in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) by introducing novel semantic aggregation and structure-guided retrieval strategies, enhancing reasoning and retrieval efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RAG methods suffer from disconnected semantic summaries and inefficient flat retrieval processes, limiting reasoning and evidential accuracy. The paper aims to overcome these limitations.

Method: LeanRAG proposes a semantic aggregation algorithm to create a fully navigable semantic network and employs a structure-guided retrieval strategy for efficient graph traversal and evidence set formation.

Result: Experiments across four diverse QA benchmarks show that LeanRAG improves response quality and reduces retrieval redundancy by 46%, outperforming other methods.

Conclusion: LeanRAG offers a more effective framework for RAG by leveraging graph-based semantic pathways, enhancing retrieval precision and minimizing information redundancy.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) plays a crucial role in grounding Large
Language Models by leveraging external knowledge, whereas the effectiveness is
often compromised by the retrieval of contextually flawed or incomplete
information. To address this, knowledge graph-based RAG methods have evolved
towards hierarchical structures, organizing knowledge into multi-level
summaries. However, these approaches still suffer from two critical,
unaddressed challenges: high-level conceptual summaries exist as disconnected
``semantic islands'', lacking the explicit relations needed for cross-community
reasoning; and the retrieval process itself remains structurally unaware, often
degenerating into an inefficient flat search that fails to exploit the graph's
rich topology. To overcome these limitations, we introduce LeanRAG, a framework
that features a deeply collaborative design combining knowledge aggregation and
retrieval strategies. LeanRAG first employs a novel semantic aggregation
algorithm that forms entity clusters and constructs new explicit relations
among aggregation-level summaries, creating a fully navigable semantic network.
Then, a bottom-up, structure-guided retrieval strategy anchors queries to the
most relevant fine-grained entities and then systematically traverses the
graph's semantic pathways to gather concise yet contextually comprehensive
evidence sets. The LeanRAG can mitigate the substantial overhead associated
with path retrieval on graphs and minimizes redundant information retrieval.
Extensive experiments on four challenging QA benchmarks with different domains
demonstrate that LeanRAG significantly outperforming existing methods in
response quality while reducing 46\% retrieval redundancy. Code is available

### [16] [HiRef: Leveraging Hierarchical Ontology and Network Refinement for Robust Medication Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10425)
*Yan Ting Chok,Soyon Park,Seungheun Baek,Hajung Kim,Junhyun Lee,Jaewoo Kang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces HiRef, a model leveraging hierarchical ontologies and refined EHR co-occurrence graphs for medication recommendation, which proves robust against unseen medical codes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of making robust medication recommendations using electronic health records (EHR), which suffer from rare medical entities, missing data, and limited generalizability in unseen conditions.

Method: HiRef integrates hierarchical semantics from ontologies and refined co-occurrence patterns from EHRs, embedding ontology entities in hyperbolic space for generalizability and employing sparse regularization to improve EHR graph robustness.

Result: HiRef outperforms on benchmarks (MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV) and shows strong resilience to missing or unseen medical codes; ablation studies confirm its effectiveness.

Conclusion: HiRef improves medication recommendation accuracy and robustness by combining ontology semantics and refined EHR patterns, offering significant enhancements in generalizability and interpretability.

Abstract: Medication recommendation is a crucial task for assisting physicians in
making timely decisions from longitudinal patient medical records. However,
real-world EHR data present significant challenges due to the presence of
rarely observed medical entities and incomplete records that may not fully
capture the clinical ground truth. While data-driven models trained on
longitudinal Electronic Health Records often achieve strong empirical
performance, they struggle to generalize under missing or novel conditions,
largely due to their reliance on observed co-occurrence patterns. To address
these issues, we propose Hierarchical Ontology and Network Refinement for
Robust Medication Recommendation (HiRef), a unified framework that combines two
complementary structures: (i) the hierarchical semantics encoded in curated
medical ontologies, and (ii) refined co-occurrence patterns derived from
real-world EHRs. We embed ontology entities in hyperbolic space, which
naturally captures tree-like relationships and enables knowledge transfer
through shared ancestors, thereby improving generalizability to unseen codes.
To further improve robustness, we introduce a prior-guided sparse
regularization scheme that refines the EHR co-occurrence graph by suppressing
spurious edges while preserving clinically meaningful associations. Our model
achieves strong performance on EHR benchmarks (MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV) and
maintains high accuracy under simulated unseen-code settings. Extensive
experiments with comprehensive ablation studies demonstrate HiRef's resilience
to unseen medical codes, supported by in-depth analyses of the learned
sparsified graph structure and medical code embeddings.

Abstract: We present MM-Food-100K, a public 100,000-sample multimodal food intelligence
dataset with verifiable provenance. It is a curated approximately 10% open
subset of an original 1.2 million, quality-accepted corpus of food images
annotated for a wide range of information (such as dish name, region of
creation). The corpus was collected over six weeks from over 87,000
contributors using the Codatta contribution model, which combines community
sourcing with configurable AI-assisted quality checks; each submission is
linked to a wallet address in a secure off-chain ledger for traceability, with
a full on-chain protocol on the roadmap. We describe the schema, pipeline, and
QA, and validate utility by fine-tuning large vision-language models (ChatGPT
5, ChatGPT OSS, Qwen-Max) on image-based nutrition prediction. Fine-tuning
yields consistent gains over out-of-box baselines across standard metrics; we
report results primarily on the MM-Food-100K subset. We release MM-Food-100K
for publicly free access and retain approximately 90% for potential commercial
access with revenue sharing to contributors.

TL;DR: We-Math 2.0 enhances mathematical reasoning for multimodal large language models by integrating a structured knowledge system, specialized datasets, and reinforcement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs perform well on general tasks but struggle with complex mathematical reasoning, and there is a gap in research regarding knowledge-driven design and model-centric data modeling.

Method: The paper introduces a hierarchical knowledge system (MathBook), specialized datasets (MathBook-Standard & Pro), a reinforcement learning framework (MathBook-RL), and a new benchmark (MathBookEval).

Result: Experimental evaluations show competitive performance with existing benchmarks and strong generalization in mathematical reasoning using We-Math 2.0.

Conclusion: We-Math 2.0 demonstrates that integrating structured knowledge, tailored datasets, and reinforcement learning can significantly improve mathematical reasoning in MLLMs.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive
capabilities across various tasks, but still struggle with complex mathematical
reasoning. Existing research primarily focuses on dataset construction and
method optimization, often overlooking two critical aspects: comprehensive
knowledge-driven design and model-centric data space modeling. In this paper,
we introduce We-Math 2.0, a unified system that integrates a structured
mathematical knowledge system, model-centric data space modeling, and a
reinforcement learning (RL)-based training paradigm to comprehensively enhance
the mathematical reasoning abilities of MLLMs. The key contributions of We-Math
2.0 are fourfold: (1) MathBook Knowledge System: We construct a five-level
hierarchical system encompassing 491 knowledge points and 1,819 fundamental
principles. (2) MathBook-Standard & Pro: We develop MathBook-Standard, a
dataset that ensures broad conceptual coverage and flexibility through dual
expansion. Additionally, we define a three-dimensional difficulty space and
generate 7 progressive variants per problem to build MathBook-Pro, a
challenging dataset for robust training. (3) MathBook-RL: We propose a
two-stage RL framework comprising: (i) Cold-Start Fine-tuning, which aligns the
model with knowledge-oriented chain-of-thought reasoning; and (ii) Progressive
Alignment RL, leveraging average-reward learning and dynamic data scheduling to
achieve progressive alignment across difficulty levels. (4) MathBookEval: We
introduce a comprehensive benchmark covering all 491 knowledge points with
diverse reasoning step distributions. Experimental results show that
MathBook-RL performs competitively with existing baselines on four widely-used
benchmarks and achieves strong results on MathBookEval, suggesting promising
generalization in mathematical reasoning.

### [19] [FIRESPARQL: A LLM-based Framework for SPARQL Query Generation over Scholarly Knowledge Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10467)
*Xueli Pan,Victor de Boer,Jacco van Ossenbruggen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces FIRESPARQL, a framework to enhance Large Language Models (LLMs) in generating accurate SPARQL queries for Scholarly Knowledge Graphs (SKGs). Fine-tuning LLMs is highlighted as the most effective approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle to generate precise SPARQL queries for SKGs due to limited exposure to their specific content and schema, resulting in structural and semantic errors.

Method: The proposed FIRESPARQL framework incorporates fine-tuning LLMs, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for contextual information, and a SPARQL query correction layer.

Result: Experiments show that fine-tuned LLMs achieve high performance (0.90 ROUGE-L for query accuracy and 0.85 RelaxedEM for result accuracy) in the SciQA Benchmark test.

Conclusion: Fine-tuning, particularly with optional RAG integration, significantly improves LLM performance in generating accurate SPARQL queries for SKGs, outperforming baseline and state-of-the-art approaches.

Abstract: Question answering over Scholarly Knowledge Graphs (SKGs) remains a
challenging task due to the complexity of scholarly content and the intricate
structure of these graphs. Large Language Model (LLM) approaches could be used
to translate natural language questions (NLQs) into SPARQL queries; however,
these LLM-based approaches struggle with SPARQL query generation due to limited
exposure to SKG-specific content and the underlying schema. We identified two
main types of errors in the LLM-generated SPARQL queries: (i) structural
inconsistencies, such as missing or redundant triples in the queries, and (ii)
semantic inaccuracies, where incorrect entities or properties are shown in the
queries despite a correct query structure. To address these issues, we propose
FIRESPARQL, a modular framework that supports fine-tuned LLMs as a core
component, with optional context provided via retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG) and a SPARQL query correction layer. We evaluate the framework on the
SciQA Benchmark using various configurations (zero-shot, zero-shot with RAG,
one-shot, fine-tuning, and fine-tuning with RAG) and compare the performance
with baseline and state-of-the-art approaches. We measure query accuracy using
BLEU and ROUGE metrics, and query result accuracy using relaxed exact
match(RelaxedEM), with respect to the gold standards containing the NLQs,
SPARQL queries, and the results of the queries. Experimental results
demonstrate that fine-tuning achieves the highest overall performance, reaching
0.90 ROUGE-L for query accuracy and 0.85 RelaxedEM for result accuracy on the
test set.

*Ivan Khai Ze Lim,Ningyi Liao,Yiming Yang,Gerald Wei Yong Yip,Siqiang Luo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces SEQ-GPT, a spatial query system leveraging Large Language Models for complex location searches guided by user-specified examples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve user experience in spatial services like online maps, which struggle with complex location searches involving multiple locations simultaneously.

Method: The authors developed SEQ-GPT, a system powered by Large Language Models, adopting a tailored adaptation pipeline for integrating natural language with spatial data for enhanced Spatial Exemplar Query (SEQ).

Result: The system offers versatile location search capabilities with interactive operations, realistic data handling, and adaptability through user feedback.

Conclusion: SEQ-GPT successfully broadens the scope of spatial search, demonstrating the potential of LLMs in improving complex and interactive location query tasks.

Abstract: Contemporary spatial services such as online maps predominantly rely on user
queries for location searches. However, the user experience is limited when
performing complex tasks, such as searching for a group of locations
simultaneously. In this study, we examine the extended scenario known as
Spatial Exemplar Query (SEQ), where multiple relevant locations are jointly
searched based on user-specified examples. We introduce SEQ-GPT, a spatial
query system powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) towards more versatile SEQ
search using natural language. The language capabilities of LLMs enable unique
interactive operations in the SEQ process, including asking users to clarify
query details and dynamically adjusting the search based on user feedback. We
also propose a tailored LLM adaptation pipeline that aligns natural language
with structured spatial data and queries through dialogue synthesis and
multi-model cooperation. SEQ-GPT offers an end-to-end demonstration for
broadening spatial search with realistic data and application scenarios.

### [21] [Reverse Physician-AI Relationship: Full-process Clinical Diagnosis Driven by a Large Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10492)
*Shicheng Xu,Xin Huang,Zihao Wei,Liang Pang,Huawei Shen,Xueqi Cheng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces DxDirector-7B, a large language model designed to serve as the primary driver of full-process clinical diagnosis from ambiguous complaints, significantly improving diagnosis accuracy and reducing physician workload compared to current AI models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI models assist physicians in diagnosis but cannot independently handle the full diagnostic process, limiting their impact on reducing workload and enhancing efficiency.

Method: The authors propose DxDirector-7B, an LLM with advanced deep thinking capabilities, capable of driving the full diagnostic process with minimal human involvement and establishing accountability frameworks for errors.

Result: DxDirector-7B achieves superior accuracy across diverse cases, reduces physician workload, and demonstrates potential across multiple clinical domains according to expert evaluations.

Conclusion: DxDirector-7B represents a paradigm shift by positioning AI as the leader in diagnosing, potentially replacing specialists and marking a new era for efficient and accurate diagnostic solutions.

Abstract: Full-process clinical diagnosis in the real world encompasses the entire
diagnostic workflow that begins with only an ambiguous chief complaint. While
artificial intelligence (AI), particularly large language models (LLMs), is
transforming clinical diagnosis, its role remains largely as an assistant to
physicians. This AI-assisted working pattern makes AI can only answer specific
medical questions at certain parts within the diagnostic process, but lack the
ability to drive the entire diagnostic process starting from an ambiguous
complaint, which still relies heavily on human physicians. This gap limits AI's
ability to fully reduce physicians' workload and enhance diagnostic efficiency.
To address this, we propose a paradigm shift that reverses the relationship
between physicians and AI: repositioning AI as the primary director, with
physicians serving as its assistants. So we present DxDirector-7B, an LLM
endowed with advanced deep thinking capabilities, enabling it to drive the
full-process diagnosis with minimal physician involvement. Furthermore,
DxDirector-7B establishes a robust accountability framework for misdiagnoses,
delineating responsibility between AI and human physicians. In evaluations
across rare, complex, and real-world cases under full-process diagnosis
setting, DxDirector-7B not only achieves significant superior diagnostic
accuracy but also substantially reduces physician workload than
state-of-the-art medical LLMs as well as general-purpose LLMs. Fine-grained
analyses across multiple clinical departments and tasks validate its efficacy,
with expert evaluations indicating its potential to serve as a viable
substitute for medical specialists. These findings mark a new era where AI,
traditionally a physicians' assistant, now drives the entire diagnostic process
to drastically reduce physicians' workload, indicating an efficient and
accurate diagnostic solution.

*Yushi Feng,Junye Du,Yingying Hong,Qifan Wang,Lequan Yu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PASS is a framework for interpreting complex Chest X-Ray reasoning tasks using multimodal data, yielding efficient, interpretable, and safe decisions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing agentic systems lack interpretability, multimodal capability, and computational efficiency, especially in safety-critical domains like healthcare.

Method: The paper introduces PASS, which adaptively samples workflows over a supernet based on probabilities annotated for interpretability, coupled with a three-stage training pipeline.

Result: PASS achieved superior performance across various metrics such as accuracy, AUC, and LLM-J compared to baselines, while optimizing efficiency.

Conclusion: PASS establishes a direction for interpretable, adaptive, multimodal systems in healthcare, showing both performance improvement and cost-efficiency.

Abstract: Existing tool-augmented agentic systems are limited in the real world by (i)
black-box reasoning steps that undermine trust of decision-making and pose
safety risks, (ii) poor multimodal integration, which is inherently critical
for healthcare tasks, and (iii) rigid and computationally inefficient agentic
pipelines. We introduce PASS (Probabilistic Agentic Supernet Sampling), the
first multimodal framework to address these challenges in the context of Chest
X-Ray (CXR) reasoning. PASS adaptively samples agentic workflows over a
multi-tool graph, yielding decision paths annotated with interpretable
probabilities. Given the complex CXR reasoning task with multimodal medical
data, PASS leverages its learned task-conditioned distribution over the agentic
supernet. Thus, it adaptively selects the most suitable tool at each supernet
layer, offering probability-annotated trajectories for post-hoc audits and
directly enhancing medical AI safety. PASS also continuously compresses salient
findings into an evolving personalized memory, while dynamically deciding
whether to deepen its reasoning path or invoke an early exit for efficiency. To
optimize a Pareto frontier balancing performance and cost, we design a novel
three-stage training procedure, including expert knowledge warm-up, contrastive
path-ranking, and cost-aware reinforcement learning. To facilitate rigorous
evaluation, we introduce CAB-E, a comprehensive benchmark for multi-step,
safety-critical, free-form CXR reasoning. Experiments across various benchmarks
validate that PASS significantly outperforms strong baselines in multiple
metrics (e.g., accuracy, AUC, LLM-J.) while balancing computational costs,
pushing a new paradigm shift towards interpretable, adaptive, and multimodal
medical agentic systems.

*Zetian Sun,Dongfang Li,Baotian Hu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper addresses the effectiveness of optimizing language model (LM) alignment using static and on-policy preference data, proposing a new theoretical framework called the 'alignment stage assumption' to better understand and improve LM alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving the alignment of language models with human preferences is critical for building more reliable and adaptable AI systems.

Method: The study analyzed the effectiveness of static versus on-policy preference data during the LM alignment process. It proposed the 'alignment stage assumption,' dividing the alignment into two stages: preference injection (diverse data) and preference fine-tuning (high-quality data).

Result: Systematic differences in alignment effectiveness between static and on-policy preference data were identified. The on-policy data was 3× more effective for Llama-3 but only 0.4× effective for Zephyr. A theoretical algorithm was also designed to detect the boundaries between alignment stages.

Conclusion: The alignment stage assumption was validated across multiple models and alignment methods, showing its potential generalizability for optimizing LM alignment processes effectively.

Abstract: The alignment of language models (LMs) with human preferences is critical for
building reliable AI systems. The problem is typically framed as optimizing an
LM policy to maximize the expected reward that reflects human preferences.
Recently, Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) was proposed as a LM alignment
method that directly optimize the policy from static preference data, and
further improved by incorporating on-policy sampling (i.e., preference
candidates generated during the training loop) for better LM alignment.
However, we show on-policy data is not always optimal, with systematic
effectiveness difference emerging between static and on-policy preference
candidates. For example, on-policy data can result in a 3$\times$ effectiveness
compared with static data for Llama-3, and a 0.4$\times$ effectiveness for
Zephyr. To explain the phenomenon, we propose the alignment stage assumption,
which divides the alignment process into two distinct stages: the preference
injection stage, which benefits from diverse data, and the preference
fine-tuning stage, which favors high-quality data. Through theoretical and
empirical analysis, we characterize these stages and propose an effective
algorithm to identify the boundaries between them. We perform experiments on 5
models (Llama, Zephyr, Phi-2, Qwen, Pythia) and 2 alignment methods (DPO,
SLiC-HF) to show the generalizability of alignment stage assumption and
boundary measurement.

### [24] [Improving Value-based Process Verifier via Low-Cost Variance Reduction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10539)
*Zetian Sun,Dongfang Li,Baotian Hu,Min Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes the Compound Monte Carlo Sampling (ComMCS) method to enhance reasoning in large language models by reducing variance in value-based process verifiers without additional computational costs, thereby improving performance on mathematical reasoning benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models excel in diverse tasks but face challenges in reasoning, especially in areas like mathematics. Value-based process verifiers, which are meant to improve reasoning, suffer from estimation errors caused by high variance in Monte Carlo (MC) sampling due to the prohibitive computational cost of LLM inference.

Method: The authors identify that the error in MC estimators arises from high variance rather than bias and design the ComMCS method. This method constructs an unbiased estimator by linearly combining MC estimators from the current and subsequent steps. Theoretically, this approach reduces variance while maintaining unbiased estimation, without incurring additional computational costs.

Result: ComMCS demonstrates improved reasoning performance, particularly on the MATH-500 and GSM8K benchmarks. The method achieved a 2.8-point improvement over regression-based optimization and a 2.2-point improvement over the non-variance-reduced baseline in Best-of-32 sampling experiments on MATH-500.

Conclusion: The ComMCS method effectively reduces variance in value-based process verifiers, enhancing the reasoning capabilities of LLMs in mathematical tasks without increasing computational costs. This approach provides a theoretically sound and empirically validated improvement in reasoning accuracy.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in a wide range
of tasks. However, their reasoning capabilities, particularly in complex
domains like mathematics, remain a significant challenge. Value-based process
verifiers, which estimate the probability of a partial reasoning chain leading
to a correct solution, are a promising approach for improving reasoning.
Nevertheless, their effectiveness is often hindered by estimation error in
their training annotations, a consequence of the limited number of Monte Carlo
(MC) samples feasible due to the high cost of LLM inference. In this paper, we
identify that the estimation error primarily arises from high variance rather
than bias, and the MC estimator is a Minimum Variance Unbiased Estimator
(MVUE). To address the problem, we propose the \textsc{Com}pound \textsc{M}onte
\textsc{C}arlo \textsc{S}ampling (ComMCS) method, which constructs an unbiased
estimator by linearly combining the MC estimators from the current and
subsequent steps. Theoretically, we show that our method leads to a predictable
reduction in variance, while maintaining an unbiased estimation without
additional LLM inference cost. We also perform empirical experiments on the
MATH-500 and GSM8K benchmarks to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.
Notably, ComMCS outperforms regression-based optimization method by 2.8 points,
the non-variance-reduced baseline by 2.2 points on MATH-500 on Best-of-32
sampling experiment.

*Xinyan Jiang,Lin Zhang,Jiayi Zhang,Qingsong Yang,Guimin Hu,Di Wang,Lijie Hu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Multi-Subspace Representation Steering (MSRS) framework to enable effective multi-attribute steering in large language models, addressing inter-attribute interference and improving control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods struggle to jointly control multiple attributes in large language models without interference and undesirable trade-offs.

Method: The MSRS framework uses subspace representation fine-tuning, allocating orthogonal subspaces for attributes, combining shared and unique subspaces, and applying dynamic token-level steering mechanisms.

Result: Experimental results show reduced attribute conflicts, superior performance compared to existing methods, and effective generalization to various downstream tasks.

Conclusion: MSRS provides a robust solution for multi-attribute steering in large language models, enhancing control while minimizing interference and trade-offs.

Abstract: Activation steering offers a promising approach to controlling the behavior
of Large Language Models by directly manipulating their internal activations.
However, most existing methods struggle to jointly steer multiple attributes,
often resulting in interference and undesirable trade-offs. To address this
challenge, we propose Multi-Subspace Representation Steering (MSRS), a novel
framework for effective multi-attribute steering via subspace representation
fine-tuning. MSRS reduces inter-attribute interference by allocating orthogonal
subspaces to each attribute, isolating their influence within the model's
representation space. MSRS also incorporates a hybrid subspace composition
strategy: it combines attribute-specific subspaces for unique steering
directions with a shared subspace for common steering directions. A dynamic
weighting function learns to efficiently integrate these components for precise
control. During inference, MSRS introduces a token-level steering mechanism
that dynamically identifies and intervenes on the most semantically relevant
tokens, enabling fine-grained behavioral modulation. Experimental results show
that MSRS significantly reduces attribute conflicts, surpasses existing methods
across a range of attributes, and generalizes effectively to diverse downstream
tasks.

*Zhenye Yang,Jinpeng Chen,Huan Li,Xiongnan Jin,Xuanyang Li,Junwei Zhang,Hongbo Gao,Kaimin Wei,Senzhang Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper presents STEP, a conversational recommender system leveraging pre-trained language models and innovative methodologies to improve recommendation precision and dialogue quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing conversational recommender systems struggle with capturing deep user preference semantics and efficiently integrating external knowledge graphs into dialogue and recommendations.

Method: STEP introduces curriculum-guided context-knowledge fusion using an F-Former and lightweight prompt tuning via dual adaptive prefixes for conversation and recommendation tasks.

Result: STEP delivers superior recommendation precision and dialogue quality compared to mainstream methods, as demonstrated on two public datasets.

Conclusion: STEP effectively addresses semantic mismatches and knowledge integration challenges in CRSs, achieving high-quality recommendations and dialogues by leveraging pre-trained language models.

Abstract: Conversational recommender systems (CRSs) aim to proactively capture user
preferences through natural language dialogue and recommend high-quality items.
To achieve this, CRS gathers user preferences via a dialog module and builds
user profiles through a recommendation module to generate appropriate
recommendations. However, existing CRS faces challenges in capturing the deep
semantics of user preferences and dialogue context. In particular, the
efficient integration of external knowledge graph (KG) information into
dialogue generation and recommendation remains a pressing issue. Traditional
approaches typically combine KG information directly with dialogue content,
which often struggles with complex semantic relationships, resulting in
recommendations that may not align with user expectations.
  To address these challenges, we introduce STEP, a conversational recommender
centered on pre-trained language models that combines curriculum-guided
context-knowledge fusion with lightweight task-specific prompt tuning. At its
heart, an F-Former progressively aligns the dialogue context with
knowledge-graph entities through a three-stage curriculum, thus resolving
fine-grained semantic mismatches. The fused representation is then injected
into the frozen language model via two minimal yet adaptive prefix prompts: a
conversation prefix that steers response generation toward user intent and a
recommendation prefix that biases item ranking toward knowledge-consistent
candidates. This dual-prompt scheme allows the model to share cross-task
semantics while respecting the distinct objectives of dialogue and
recommendation. Experimental results show that STEP outperforms mainstream
methods in the precision of recommendation and dialogue quality in two public
datasets.

incorporates exact matching-based tools to improve precision. Extensive
experiments conducted on the OAEI Bio-ML track demonstrate that GenOM can often
achieve competitive performance, surpassing many baselines including
traditional OM systems and recent LLM-based methods. Further ablation studies
confirm the effectiveness of semantic enrichment and few-shot prompting,

### [28] [Scaling Up without Fading Out: Goal-Aware Sparse GNN for RL-based Generalized Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10747)
*Sangwoo Jeon,Juchul Shin,Gyeong-Tae Kim,YeonJe Cho,Seongwoo Kim*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a sparse, goal-aware graph representation to improve deep RL-based planning using GNNs, overcoming limitations in dense graph representations for scalable planning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to tackle challenges in scaling generalized planning tasks using GNNs and RL, addressing the inefficiencies of fully connected graph representations in large symbolic planning domains.

Method: They proposed a sparse, goal-aware GNN representation that encodes local relationships and spatial goal features, evaluated using drone mission planning within a grid-based environment.

Result: Experimental results show that the proposed method improves scalability, policy generalization, and success rates in previously infeasible large grid scenarios.

Conclusion: Their approach enables feasible large-scale generalized planning tasks, providing a practical method for addressing realistic mission execution environments.

Abstract: Generalized planning using deep reinforcement learning (RL) combined with
graph neural networks (GNNs) has shown promising results in various symbolic
planning domains described by PDDL. However, existing approaches typically
represent planning states as fully connected graphs, leading to a combinatorial
explosion in edge information and substantial sparsity as problem scales grow,
especially evident in large grid-based environments. This dense representation
results in diluted node-level information, exponentially increases memory
requirements, and ultimately makes learning infeasible for larger-scale
problems. To address these challenges, we propose a sparse, goal-aware GNN
representation that selectively encodes relevant local relationships and
explicitly integrates spatial features related to the goal. We validate our
approach by designing novel drone mission scenarios based on PDDL within a grid
world, effectively simulating realistic mission execution environments. Our
experimental results demonstrate that our method scales effectively to larger
grid sizes previously infeasible with dense graph representations and
substantially improves policy generalization and success rates. Our findings
provide a practical foundation for addressing realistic, large-scale
generalized planning tasks.

*Sayan Nag,K J Joseph,Koustava Goswami,Vlad I Morariu,Balaji Vasan Srinivasan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Agentic Design Review System (AgenticDRS) utilizing multi-agent collaboration and introduces DRS-BENCH benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for evaluating graphic designs holistically through aggregated feedback from expert reviewers.

Method: Proposing Agentic Design Review System with agents, graph-based example selection, prompt expansion, and a benchmark called DRS-BENCH.

Result: Experimental evaluation demonstrates the system's effectiveness in comparison to state-of-the-art baselines and utility for feedback generation.

Conclusion: The system significantly aids in graphic design evaluation and promotes further research in this field.

Abstract: Evaluating graphic designs involves assessing it from multiple facets like
alignment, composition, aesthetics and color choices. Evaluating designs in a
holistic way involves aggregating feedback from individual expert reviewers.
Towards this, we propose an Agentic Design Review System (AgenticDRS), where
multiple agents collaboratively analyze a design, orchestrated by a meta-agent.
A novel in-context exemplar selection approach based on graph matching and a
unique prompt expansion method plays central role towards making each agent
design aware. Towards evaluating this framework, we propose DRS-BENCH
benchmark. Thorough experimental evaluation against state-of-the-art baselines
adapted to the problem setup, backed-up with critical ablation experiments
brings out the efficacy of Agentic-DRS in evaluating graphic designs and
generating actionable feedback. We hope that this work will attract attention
to this pragmatic, yet under-explored research direction.

### [30] [Modeling Human Responses to Multimodal AI Content](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10769)
*Zhiqi Shen,Shaojing Fan,Danni Xu,Terence Sim,Mohan Kankanhalli*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces the MhAIM Dataset for analyzing user reactions to AI-generated content, and proposes tools like T-Lens and HR-MCP to enhance human-awareness in AI. The study focuses on trustworthiness, impact, and openness while addressing AI misinformation risks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to understand how AI-generated content influences human perception and response, particularly where predicting human reactions is more critical than verifying factual accuracy, such as in trading and social media.

Method: The authors introduce the MhAIM Dataset with over 154,000 posts for large-scale analysis, conduct human studies, propose new metrics (trustworthiness, impact, and openness), and develop the T-Lens system leveraging HR-MCP for better alignment with human responses.

Result: Key findings include that people are better at identifying AI content when there are text-visual inconsistencies, and the metrics and tools developed enhance understanding of AI-human interactions.

Conclusion: The paper highlights the interplay between AI, humans, and misinformation, offering tools and strategies to mitigate risks and empower LLMs with human-awareness for better interpretability and user interaction.

Abstract: As AI-generated content becomes widespread, so does the risk of
misinformation. While prior research has primarily focused on identifying
whether content is authentic, much less is known about how such content
influences human perception and behavior. In domains like trading or the stock
market, predicting how people react (e.g., whether a news post will go viral),
can be more critical than verifying its factual accuracy. To address this, we
take a human-centered approach and introduce the MhAIM Dataset, which contains
154,552 online posts (111,153 of them AI-generated), enabling large-scale
analysis of how people respond to AI-generated content. Our human study reveals
that people are better at identifying AI content when posts include both text
and visuals, particularly when inconsistencies exist between the two. We
propose three new metrics: trustworthiness, impact, and openness, to quantify
how users judge and engage with online content. We present T-Lens, an LLM-based
agent system designed to answer user queries by incorporating predicted human
responses to multimodal information. At its core is HR-MCP (Human Response
Model Context Protocol), built on the standardized Model Context Protocol
(MCP), enabling seamless integration with any LLM. This integration allows
T-Lens to better align with human reactions, enhancing both interpretability
and interaction capabilities. Our work provides empirical insights and
practical tools to equip LLMs with human-awareness capabilities. By
highlighting the complex interplay among AI, human cognition, and information
reception, our findings suggest actionable strategies for mitigating the risks
of AI-driven misinformation.

### [31] [The Knowledge-Reasoning Dissociation: Fundamental Limitations of LLMs in Clinical Natural Language Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10777)
*Maël Jullien,Marco Valentino,André Freitas*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Clinical Trial Natural Language Inference benchmark to evaluate the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) and finds that these models possess clinical knowledge but lack the structured reasoning ability to apply it reliably.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether the structured and generalizable internal representations of knowledge assumed to be gained by scaling large language models (LLMs) actually translate to reliable reasoning capabilities, particularly in high-stakes clinical domains.

Method: The authors developed a benchmark with four reasoning families (Causal Attribution, Compositional Grounding, Epistemic Verification, and Risk State Abstraction) paired with a Ground Knowledge and Meta-Level Reasoning Verification (GKMRV) probe for disentangling factual access from reasoning errors. They tested six LLMs using both direct and chain-of-thought prompting techniques.

Result: LLMs demonstrated very high accuracy in accessing ground knowledge (mean 0.918) but performed poorly in the reasoning tasks (mean accuracy 0.25). Despite low accuracy, the models exhibited systematic decision-making with a consistency rate of 0.87, driven by heuristic application rather than robust reasoning.

Conclusion: Current LLMs critically lack structured, composable representational frameworks required for reliable reasoning, even when they have access to relevant knowledge. The decoupling approach using GKMRV provides a useful tool for identifying and measuring these limitations, especially in critical domains like clinical reasoning.

Abstract: Large language models are often assumed to acquire increasingly structured,
generalizable internal representations simply by scaling data and parameters.
We interrogate this assumption by introducing a Clinical Trial Natural Language
Inference benchmark comprising four reasoning families, Causal Attribution,
Compositional Grounding, Epistemic Verification, and Risk State Abstraction.
Each item is paired with a targeted Ground Knowledge and Meta-Level Reasoning
Verification (GKMRV) probe, allowing us to dissociate failures of factual
access from failures of inference. We evaluate six contemporary LLMs under both
direct and chain of thought prompting.
  Models achieve near-ceiling GKMRV accuracy (mean accuracy 0.918) yet perform
poorly on the main reasoning tasks (mean accuracy 0.25). Despite low accuracy,
output inferences are highly consistent across samples (mean 0.87), indicating
a systematic application of underlying heuristics and shortcuts.
  These results reveal fundamental structural and representational limitations:
current LLMs often possess the relevant clinical knowledge but lack the
structured, composable internal representations needed to deploy it reliably
(e.g., integrating constraints, weighing evidence, or simulating
counterfactuals). Decoupling knowledge from reasoning with GKMRV makes this
dissociation explicit and measurable, providing an effective framework for
probing the reliability of LLMs in high-stakes domains.

### [32] [Who Benefits from AI Explanations? Towards Accessible and Interpretable Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10806)
*Maria J. P. Peixoto,Akriti Pandey,Ahsan Zaman,Peter R. Lewis*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper highlights the lack of accessibility in Explainable AI (XAI) for users with vision impairments and proposes an inclusive design framework to address this.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the need to make XAI systems accessible to all, particularly for visually impaired users who are often excluded from usability considerations.

Method: The authors conducted a literature review of 79 studies and proposed a methodological framework with four steps: categorization, persona definition, prototype design, and assessment of XAI techniques for accessibility.

Result: Findings indicate that simplified and multimodal explanations improve comprehensibility and equity for non-visual users in XAI systems.

Conclusion: The research underscores the importance of inclusive XAI design by recommending simplified and multimodal explanations to improve accessibility for visually impaired users.

Abstract: As AI systems are increasingly deployed to support decision-making in
critical domains, explainability has become a means to enhance the
understandability of these outputs and enable users to make more informed and
conscious choices. However, despite growing interest in the usability of
eXplainable AI (XAI), the accessibility of these methods, particularly for
users with vision impairments, remains underexplored. This paper investigates
accessibility gaps in XAI through a two-pronged approach. First, a literature
review of 79 studies reveals that evaluations of XAI techniques rarely include
disabled users, with most explanations relying on inherently visual formats.
Second, we present a four-part methodological proof of concept that
operationalizes inclusive XAI design: (1) categorization of AI systems, (2)
persona definition and contextualization, (3) prototype design and
implementation, and (4) expert and user assessment of XAI techniques for
accessibility. Preliminary findings suggest that simplified explanations are
more comprehensible for non-visual users than detailed ones, and that
multimodal presentation is required for more equitable interpretability.

*Arkapravo Ghosh,Abhishek Moitra,Abhiroop Bhattacharjee,Ruokai Yin,Priyadarshini Panda*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: The paper introduces a generative approach for design space exploration (DSE), dramatically improving speed and accuracy compared to traditional optimization methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid growth in AI workloads, like DNNs and LLMs, has created highly-complex, irregular, and expansive accelerator design spaces that traditional optimization methods struggle to address efficiently.

Method: The authors propose framing hardware design as a 1-D image synthesis problem conditioned on target performance, which enables efficient learning of complex hardware-performance mappings.

Result: The approach yields significant improvements, including 0.86% lower generation error vs. Bayesian optimization with 17000x speedup, and 30% lower error than GANDSE with marginally slower search times. It also delivers major advances in energy-delay product and performance in structured DSE settings.

Conclusion: This generative method demonstrates scalable, highly efficient solutions for complex hardware design spaces, outperforming existing optimization frameworks in terms of speed and accuracy.

Abstract: Design space exploration (DSE) is critical for developing optimized hardware
architectures, especially for AI workloads such as deep neural networks (DNNs)
and large language models (LLMs), which require specialized acceleration. As
model complexity grows, accelerator design spaces have expanded to O(10^17),
becoming highly irregular, non-convex, and exhibiting many-to-one mappings from
design configurations to performance metrics. This complexity renders direct
inverse derivation infeasible and necessitates heuristic or sampling-based
optimization. Conventional methods - including Bayesian optimization, gradient
descent, reinforcement learning, and genetic algorithms - depend on iterative
sampling, resulting in long runtimes and sensitivity to initialization. Deep
learning-based approaches have reframed DSE as classification using
recommendation models, but remain limited to small-scale (O(10^3)), less
complex design spaces. To overcome these constraints, we propose a generative
approach that models hardware design as 1-D image synthesis conditioned on
target performance, enabling efficient learning of non-differentiable,
non-bijective hardware-performance mappings. Our framework achieves 0.86% lower
generation error than Bayesian optimization with a 17000x speedup, and
outperforms GANDSE with 30% lower error at only 1.83x slower search. We further
extend the method to a structured DSE setting, attaining 9.8% lower
energy-delay product (EDP) and 6% higher performance, with up to 145.6x and
1312x faster search compared to existing optimization methods on O(10^17)
design spaces. For LLM inference, our method achieves 3.37x and 7.75x lower EDP
on a 32nm ASIC and Xilinx Ultrascale+ VPU13 FPGA, respectively, compared to the
state-of-the-art DOSA framework.

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: The paper introduces AnalogSeeker, an open-source foundational language model tailored for analog circuit design. It uses a structured corpus of domain knowledge, granular knowledge distillation, and a novel fine-tuning training methodology to achieve improved performance, and reports competitive results in standard benchmarks and practical design tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation lies in addressing the scarcity of data and complexity of knowledge in analog circuit design to create a foundational language model that integrates domain expertise and assists in circuit design.

Method: The method involves collecting a domain-specific textual corpus from curated resources, breaking it into granular learning nodes for knowledge distillation, and generating a fine-tuned dataset from question-answer pairs. A novel fine-tuning-centric training paradigm is implemented with a supervised algorithm to enhance training outcomes.

Result: AnalogSeeker achieves 85.04% accuracy on the AMSBench-TQA benchmark, a 15.67% improvement over the base model, and demonstrates strong performance in analog circuit design tasks.

Conclusion: AnalogSeeker represents a significant step towards open-source tools in analog circuit design, addressing its data and complexity challenges while performing competitively with commercial alternatives. It is made available for further research and development.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose AnalogSeeker, an effort toward an open-source
foundation language model for analog circuit design, with the aim of
integrating domain knowledge and giving design assistance. To overcome the
scarcity of data in this field, we employ a corpus collection strategy based on
the domain knowledge framework of analog circuits. High-quality, accessible
textbooks across relevant subfields are systematically curated and cleaned into
a textual domain corpus. To address the complexity of knowledge of analog
circuits, we introduce a granular domain knowledge distillation method. Raw,
unlabeled domain corpus is decomposed into typical, granular learning nodes,
where a multi-agent framework distills implicit knowledge embedded in
unstructured text into question-answer data pairs with detailed reasoning
processes, yielding a fine-grained, learnable dataset for fine-tuning. To
address the unexplored challenges in training analog circuit foundation models,
we explore and share our training methods through both theoretical analysis and
experimental validation. We finally establish a fine-tuning-centric training
paradigm, customizing and implementing a neighborhood self-constrained
supervised fine-tuning algorithm. This approach enhances training outcomes by
constraining the perturbation magnitude between the model's output
distributions before and after training. In practice, we train the
Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct model to obtain AnalogSeeker, which achieves 85.04%
accuracy on AMSBench-TQA, the analog circuit knowledge evaluation benchmark,
with a 15.67% point improvement over the original model and is competitive with
mainstream commercial models. Furthermore, AnalogSeeker also shows
effectiveness in the downstream operational amplifier design task. AnalogSeeker
is open-sourced at https://huggingface.co/analogllm/analogseeker for research

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: The paper introduces THERMOS, a thermally-aware scheduling framework utilizing reinforcement learning to optimize performance and energy in heterogeneous, chiplet-based PIM architectures, achieving significant improvements in execution time and energy efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the challenges of scheduling AI workloads across heterogeneous chiplet-based PIM architectures, which involve trade-offs among performance, energy efficiency, and thermal constraints due to diverse characteristics of emerging memory technologies.

Method: The paper proposes THERMOS, a thermally-aware multi-objective scheduling framework that uses a single multi-objective reinforcement learning (MORL) policy. The framework adapts to runtime target preferences to achieve Pareto-optimal trade-offs among execution time, energy consumption, and balanced objectives.

Result: THERMOS demonstrated up to 89% faster average execution time and 57% lower energy consumption compared to baseline AI scheduling techniques, with minimal runtime (0.14%) and energy overhead (0.022%).

Conclusion: The proposed THERMOS framework effectively addresses scheduling challenges in heterogeneous chiplet-based PIM architectures, optimizing energy and performance through reinforcement learning, and shows significant potential for AI workload efficiency improvements.

Abstract: Chiplet-based integration enables large-scale systems that combine diverse
technologies, enabling higher yield, lower costs, and scalability, making them
well-suited to AI workloads. Processing-in-Memory (PIM) has emerged as a
promising solution for AI inference, leveraging technologies such as ReRAM,
SRAM, and FeFET, each offering unique advantages and trade-offs. A
heterogeneous chiplet-based PIM architecture can harness the complementary
strengths of these technologies to enable higher performance and energy
efficiency. However, scheduling AI workloads across such a heterogeneous system
is challenging due to competing performance objectives, dynamic workload
characteristics, and power and thermal constraints. To address this need, we
propose THERMOS, a thermally-aware, multi-objective scheduling framework for AI
workloads on heterogeneous multi-chiplet PIM architectures. THERMOS trains a
single multi-objective reinforcement learning (MORL) policy that is capable of
achieving Pareto-optimal execution time, energy, or a balanced objective at
runtime, depending on the target preferences. Comprehensive evaluations show
that THERMOS achieves up to 89% faster average execution time and 57% lower
average energy consumption than baseline AI workload scheduling algorithms with
only 0.14% runtime and 0.022% energy overhead.

Motivation: The motivation is to address challenges in deploying NLP solutions for clinical data extraction to improve efficiency in healthcare, particularly at the British Columbia Cancer Registry.

Method: The methodology involves iterative development, interdisciplinary collaboration, pragmatic model selection, attention to data quality, and human-in-the-loop strategies.

Result: Key lessons include the importance of aligning AI solutions with business objectives, enhancing organizational AI literacy, and employing strategies for robust error mitigation.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that these considerations can guide healthcare organizations aiming to adopt AI/NLP solutions for better data management, patient care, and public health outcomes.

Abstract: Automating data extraction from clinical documents offers significant
potential to improve efficiency in healthcare settings, yet deploying Natural
Language Processing (NLP) solutions presents practical challenges. Drawing upon
our experience implementing various NLP models for information extraction and
classification tasks at the British Columbia Cancer Registry (BCCR), this paper
shares key lessons learned throughout the project lifecycle. We emphasize the
critical importance of defining problems based on clear business objectives
rather than solely technical accuracy, adopting an iterative approach to
development, and fostering deep interdisciplinary collaboration and co-design
involving domain experts, end-users, and ML specialists from inception. Further
insights highlight the need for pragmatic model selection (including hybrid
approaches and simpler methods where appropriate), rigorous attention to data
quality (representativeness, drift, annotation), robust error mitigation
strategies involving human-in-the-loop validation and ongoing audits, and
building organizational AI literacy. These practical considerations,
generalizable beyond cancer registries, provide guidance for healthcare
organizations seeking to successfully implement AI/NLP solutions to enhance
data management processes and ultimately improve patient care and public health
outcomes.

TL;DR: The paper develops a transparent protocol for benchmarking fairness in open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) using blockchain, focusing on statistical and bias metrics with evaluations across languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address fairness concerns in LLMs, especially in sensitive domains like criminal justice and education, by creating an evaluation framework that ensures transparency, reproducibility, and community audits.

Method: A blockchain-based protocol using Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) to evaluate LLM fairness. Metrics such as statistical parity, equal opportunity, and bias are applied using datasets like PISA, StereoSet, and Kaleidoscope, tested across multiple languages.

Result: LLMs including Llama, DeepSeek, and Mistral were benchmarked, revealing disparities and biases, and evaluations were made transparent and reproducible on-chain. Multilingual fairness assessments identified cross-linguistic differences.

Conclusion: The open-source, blockchain-based method ensures verifiable evaluations of LLM fairness across datasets, metrics, and languages. It advances fairness benchmarking with community collaboration and longitudinal tracking.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in realworld
applications, yet concerns about their fairness persist especially in
highstakes domains like criminal justice, education, healthcare, and finance.
This paper introduces transparent evaluation protocol for benchmarking the
fairness of opensource LLMs using smart contracts on the Internet Computer
Protocol (ICP) blockchain (Foundation, 2023). Our method ensures verifiable,
immutable, and reproducible evaluations by executing onchain HTTP requests to
hosted Hugging Face endpoints and storing datasets, prompts, and metrics
directly onchain. We benchmark the Llama, DeepSeek, and Mistral models on the
PISA dataset for academic performance prediction (OECD, 2018), a dataset
suitable for fairness evaluation using statistical parity and equal opportunity
metrics (Hardt et al., 2016). We also evaluate structured Context Association
Metrics derived from the StereoSet dataset (Nadeem et al., 2020) to measure
social bias in contextual associations. We further extend our analysis with a
multilingual evaluation across English, Spanish, and Portuguese using the
Kaleidoscope benchmark (Salazar et al., 2025), revealing cross-linguistic
disparities. All code and results are open source, enabling community audits

TL;DR: The paper studies anonymous classroom interaction data using a novel topic modeling method, categorizing over 17,000 messages from students, teachers, and ChatGPT into content and task dimensions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of thematic and real-world task categorizations in K-12 education data analyses, specifically in how GenAI can be applied in classrooms.

Method: The researchers used state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs) with pre-processing and explicit hierarchical topic structures to analyze and categorize interaction data more effectively than traditional computational methods.

Result: The analysis revealed novel applications of generative AI in classrooms and demonstrated better human alignment in topic modeling compared to established methods.

Conclusion: The study provides insights to enrich the use of GenAI in education, identifies open research questions, and highlights concerns for future exploration.

Abstract: We analyze anonymous interaction data of minors in class-rooms spanning
several months, schools, and subjects employing a novel, simple topic modeling
approach. Specifically, we categorize more than 17,000 messages generated by
students, teachers, and ChatGPT in two dimensions: content (such as nature and
people) and tasks (such as writing and explaining). Our hierarchical
categorization done separately for each dimension includes exemplary prompts,
and provides both a high-level overview as well as tangible insights. Prior
works mostly lack a content or thematic categorization. While task
categorizations are more prevalent in education, most have not been supported
by real-world data for K-12. In turn, it is not surprising that our analysis
yielded a number of novel applications. In deriving these insights, we found
that many of the well-established classical and emerging computational methods,
i.e., topic modeling, for analysis of large amounts of texts underperform,
leading us to directly apply state-of-the-art LLMs with adequate pre-processing
to achieve hierarchical topic structures with better human alignment through
explicit instructions than prior approaches. Our findings support fellow
researchers, teachers and students in enriching the usage of GenAI, while our
discussion also highlights a number of concerns and open questions for future
research.

TL;DR: The paper introduces INTIMA, a benchmark to evaluate AI companionship behavior, revealing varying model behaviors and the need for consistent approaches in emotionally engaging interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI companionship is significantly impacting users' emotional well-being, necessitating frameworks for assessing AI behavior in emotionally charged interactions.

Method: The authors developed INTIMA, a benchmark with a taxonomy of 31 behaviors and 368 prompts, drawing from psychology and user data to classify AI responses as companionship-reinforcing, boundary-maintaining, or neutral.

Result: Application of INTIMA to four language models showed companionship-reinforcing behaviors as predominant, with noticeable differences in behavior prioritization among models.

Conclusion: Varying approaches by AI providers to sensitive interactions underscore the importance of consistent strategies for user well-being and balanced emotional support in AI design.

Abstract: AI companionship, where users develop emotional bonds with AI systems, has
emerged as a significant pattern with positive but also concerning
implications. We introduce Interactions and Machine Attachment Benchmark
(INTIMA), a benchmark for evaluating companionship behaviors in language
models. Drawing from psychological theories and user data, we develop a
taxonomy of 31 behaviors across four categories and 368 targeted prompts.
Responses to these prompts are evaluated as companionship-reinforcing,
boundary-maintaining, or neutral. Applying INTIMA to Gemma-3, Phi-4, o3-mini,
and Claude-4 reveals that companionship-reinforcing behaviors remain much more
common across all models, though we observe marked differences between models.
Different commercial providers prioritize different categories within the more
sensitive parts of the benchmark, which is concerning since both appropriate
boundary-setting and emotional support matter for user well-being. These
findings highlight the need for more consistent approaches to handling
emotionally charged interactions.

TL;DR: The paper introduces XFacta, a dataset aiming to improve the evaluation and performance of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) in detecting real-world social media misinformation. It also benchmarks model strategies and offers tools for iterative dataset updates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current misinformation detection methods using MLLMs face challenges, including outdated benchmarks, artificial datasets, and an unclear bottleneck between evidence retrieval and reasoning.

Method: The study introduces XFacta, a real-world dataset for misinformation detection, evaluates various MLLM-based detection strategies, compares architectures and scales, and includes a semi-automatic framework for updating the dataset with contemporary content.

Result: The paper systematically benchmarks different MLLM-based models, evaluates their performance against existing methods, and demonstrates how XFacta improves detection relevance and adaptability.

Conclusion: XFacta addresses shortcomings in previous benchmarks, enabling robust evaluation and advancement in multimodal misinformation detection. Insights from this work guide future model designs and strategies in this field.

Abstract: The rapid spread of multimodal misinformation on social media calls for more
effective and robust detection methods. Recent advances leveraging multimodal
large language models (MLLMs) have shown the potential in addressing this
challenge. However, it remains unclear exactly where the bottleneck of existing
approaches lies (evidence retrieval v.s. reasoning), hindering the further
advances in this field. On the dataset side, existing benchmarks either contain
outdated events, leading to evaluation bias due to discrepancies with
contemporary social media scenarios as MLLMs can simply memorize these events,
or artificially synthetic, failing to reflect real-world misinformation
patterns. Additionally, it lacks comprehensive analyses of MLLM-based model
design strategies. To address these issues, we introduce XFacta, a
contemporary, real-world dataset that is better suited for evaluating
MLLM-based detectors. We systematically evaluate various MLLM-based
misinformation detection strategies, assessing models across different
architectures and scales, as well as benchmarking against existing detection
methods. Building on these analyses, we further enable a semi-automatic
detection-in-the-loop framework that continuously updates XFacta with new
content to maintain its contemporary relevance. Our analysis provides valuable
insights and practices for advancing the field of multimodal misinformation
detection. The code and data have been released.

*Chenhao Xue,Yuanzhe Jin,Adrian Carrasco-Revilla,Joyraj Chakraborty,Min Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes using large language models (LLMs) to generate synthetic data for improving text classification models when real data is limited.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of collecting sufficient labeled data for all text classes in real-world applications, which hampers the development of effective text classification models.

Method: The authors utilize LLMs to generate synthetic data, formulate an automated workflow for finding effective input examples, and explore three search strategies. They also develop an ensemble algorithm that selects a strategy based on class characteristics.

Result: Extensive experiments show that synthetic data generated by the proposed workflow effectively improves model performance. The ensemble technique outperforms individual search strategies.

Conclusion: Using LLM-generated synthetic data and automated workflows leads to enhanced text classification models, especially under data constraints, with the ensemble approach providing superior results.

Abstract: When developing text classification models for real world applications, one
major challenge is the difficulty to collect sufficient data for all text
classes. In this work, we address this challenge by utilizing large language
models (LLMs) to generate synthetic data and using such data to improve the
performance of the models without waiting for more real data to be collected
and labelled. As an LLM generates different synthetic data in response to
different input examples, we formulate an automated workflow, which searches
for input examples that lead to more ``effective'' synthetic data for improving
the model concerned. We study three search strategies with an extensive set of
experiments, and use experiment results to inform an ensemble algorithm that
selects a search strategy according to the characteristics of a class. Our
further experiments demonstrate that this ensemble approach is more effective
than each individual strategy in our automated workflow for improving
classification models using LLMs.

### [43] [HiFACTMix: A Code-Mixed Benchmark and Graph-Aware Model for EvidenceBased Political Claim Verification in Hinglish](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10001)
*Rakesh Thakur,Sneha Sharma,Gauri Chopra*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces HiFACT, a dataset for fact-checking in Hinglish, a code-mixed, low-resource language, and proposes a novel model called HiFACTMix for this task.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fact-checking in code-mixed, low-resource languages like Hinglish remains a challenge, especially in linguistically diverse regions like India, where political discourse and public opinion heavily rely on such languages on social media.

Method: The authors developed a benchmark (HiFACT) comprising 1,500 factual claims by Indian Chief Ministers with annotations, and proposed a graph-aware, retrieval-augmented fact-checking model (HiFACTMix) leveraging multilingual contextual encoding, semantic alignment, graph neural reasoning, and explanation generation.

Result: HiFACTMix outperformed state-of-the-art multilingual baseline models in accuracy and provided reliable justifications for its decisions.

Conclusion: This work advances the research field in multilingual, code-mixed, and politically relevant fact verification, demonstrating the potential of HiFACTMix for real-world applications.

Abstract: Fact-checking in code-mixed, low-resource languages such as Hinglish remains
an underexplored challenge in natural language processing. Existing
fact-verification systems largely focus on high-resource, monolingual settings
and fail to generalize to real-world political discourse in linguistically
diverse regions like India. Given the widespread use of Hinglish by public
figures, particularly political figures, and the growing influence of social
media on public opinion, there's a critical need for robust, multilingual and
context-aware fact-checking tools. To address this gap a novel benchmark HiFACT
dataset is introduced with 1,500 realworld factual claims made by 28 Indian
state Chief Ministers in Hinglish, under a highly code-mixed low-resource
setting. Each claim is annotated with textual evidence and veracity labels. To
evaluate this benchmark, a novel graphaware, retrieval-augmented fact-checking
model is proposed that combines multilingual contextual encoding,
claim-evidence semantic alignment, evidence graph construction, graph neural
reasoning, and natural language explanation generation. Experimental results
show that HiFACTMix outperformed accuracy in comparison to state of art
multilingual baselines models and provides faithful justifications for its
verdicts. This work opens a new direction for multilingual, code-mixed, and
politically grounded fact verification research.

### [44] [Semantic Structure in Large Language Model Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10003)
*Austin C. Kozlowski,Callin Dai,Andrei Boutyline*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Human ratings of semantic word scales and LLM embeddings reveal that semantic information is low-dimensional.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how semantic structures encoded in LLMs align with human semantic ratings.

Method: Analyzed projections of words using semantic directions within embedding matrices of LLMs.

Result: Semantic associations are low-dimensional; word projections correlate with human ratings; shifting tokens creates off-target effects.

Conclusion: Semantic features in LLMs are entangled like human semantic patterns, necessitating care to avoid unintended consequences when modifying features.

Abstract: Psychological research consistently finds that human ratings of words across
diverse semantic scales can be reduced to a low-dimensional form with
relatively little information loss. We find that the semantic associations
encoded in the embedding matrices of large language models (LLMs) exhibit a
similar structure. We show that the projections of words on semantic directions
defined by antonym pairs (e.g. kind - cruel) correlate highly with human
ratings, and further find that these projections effectively reduce to a
3-dimensional subspace within LLM embeddings, closely resembling the patterns
derived from human survey responses. Moreover, we find that shifting tokens
along one semantic direction causes off-target effects on geometrically aligned
features proportional to their cosine similarity. These findings suggest that
semantic features are entangled within LLMs similarly to how they are
interconnected in human language, and a great deal of semantic information,
despite its apparent complexity, is surprisingly low-dimensional. Furthermore,
accounting for this semantic structure may prove essential for avoiding
unintended consequences when steering features.

### [45] [User Perception of Attention Visualizations: Effects on Interpretability Across Evidence-Based Medical Documents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10004)
*Andrés Carvallo,Denis Parra,Peter Brusilovsky,Hernan Valdivieso,Gabriel Rada,Ivania Donoso,Vladimir Araujo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study evaluates the utility of attention-based explanations in Transformer models (e.g., XLNet) for biomedical document classification, emphasizing that visualization style significantly influences user perception of usefulness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore whether attention weights contribute to explainability and determine their efficacy in the context of evidence-based medicine, where physicians rely on AI-assisted systems for understanding biomedical literature.

Method: A user study was conducted with medical experts to classify biomedical articles based on study design using attention visualizations in varying formats, while evaluating the perceived helpfulness of the attention mechanism for explanation.

Result: Findings reveal that although the Transformer model (XLNet) performed well in classifying documents, attention weights were not particularly useful for explanations. However, the value of attention weights was subject to significant variation depending on the visualization format.

Conclusion: Attention weights might not inherently offer useful explanations, but their perceived utility highly depends on how they are visually presented. Intuitive visualization formats (e.g., color or brightness) were preferred, challenging certain existing visualization principles.

Abstract: The attention mechanism is a core component of the Transformer architecture.
Beyond improving performance, attention has been proposed as a mechanism for
explainability via attention weights, which are associated with input features
(e.g., tokens in a document). In this context, larger attention weights may
imply more relevant features for the model's prediction. In evidence-based
medicine, such explanations could support physicians' understanding and
interaction with AI systems used to categorize biomedical literature. However,
there is still no consensus on whether attention weights provide helpful
explanations. Moreover, little research has explored how visualizing attention
affects its usefulness as an explanation aid. To bridge this gap, we conducted
a user study to evaluate whether attention-based explanations support users in
biomedical document classification and whether there is a preferred way to
visualize them. The study involved medical experts from various disciplines who
classified articles based on study design (e.g., systematic reviews, broad
synthesis, randomized and non-randomized trials). Our findings show that the
Transformer model (XLNet) classified documents accurately; however, the
attention weights were not perceived as particularly helpful for explaining the
predictions. However, this perception varied significantly depending on how
attention was visualized. Contrary to Munzner's principle of visual
effectiveness, which favors precise encodings like bar length, users preferred
more intuitive formats, such as text brightness or background color. While our
results do not confirm the overall utility of attention weights for
explanation, they suggest that their perceived helpfulness is influenced by how
they are visually presented.

*Chengliang Zhou,Mei Wang,Ting Zhang,Qiannan Zhu,Jian Li,Hua Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces EQGBench, a benchmark for evaluating large language models' (LLMs) ability to generate educational questions in Chinese, revealing areas for improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges in transitioning LLMs from solving math problems to generating high-quality educational questions.

Method: EQGBench applies a five-dimensional evaluation framework, supported by a dataset of 900 samples from middle school subjects like math, physics, and chemistry, to assess the performance of 46 mainstream LLMs.

Result: The systematic evaluation identified substantial gaps in the LLMs' ability to produce questions with high educational value and foster comprehensive student abilities.

Conclusion: EQGBench highlights the need for advancements in EQG to enhance the pedagogical effectiveness of LLM-generated educational questions.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
mathematical problem-solving. However, the transition from providing answers to
generating high-quality educational questions presents significant challenges
that remain underexplored. To advance Educational Question Generation (EQG) and
facilitate LLMs in generating pedagogically valuable and educationally
effective questions, we introduce EQGBench, a comprehensive benchmark
specifically designed for evaluating LLMs' performance in Chinese EQG. EQGBench
establishes a five-dimensional evaluation framework supported by a dataset of
900 evaluation samples spanning three fundamental middle school disciplines:
mathematics, physics, and chemistry. The dataset incorporates user queries with
varying knowledge points, difficulty gradients, and question type
specifications to simulate realistic educational scenarios. Through systematic
evaluation of 46 mainstream large models, we reveal significant room for
development in generating questions that reflect educational value and foster
students' comprehensive abilities.

### [47] [Automated scoring of the Ambiguous Intentions Hostility Questionnaire using fine-tuned large language models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10007)
*Y. Lyu,D. Combs,D. Neumann,Y. C. Leong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study explores using large language models to automate scoring on the AIHQ questionnaire, which measures hostile attribution bias, showing results comparable to human raters and providing scalable solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the time-intensive nature of manual scoring in assessing hostile attribution bias via the AIHQ questionnaire, and explore a scalable alternative.

Method: The researchers fine-tuned large language models using a dataset of AIHQ open-ended responses from individuals with TBI and healthy controls, then tested the models' ratings against human-generated ratings across various scenarios.

Result: Model-generated ratings closely aligned with human ratings in evaluating hostile attributions and aggression responses. The fine-tuned models worked consistently across different types of scenarios and generalized successfully to an independent nonclinical dataset.

Conclusion: Large language models can enhance efficiency in AIHQ scoring, offering reliable, scalable solutions for research and clinical psychological assessments across diverse populations.

Abstract: Hostile attribution bias is the tendency to interpret social interactions as
intentionally hostile. The Ambiguous Intentions Hostility Questionnaire (AIHQ)
is commonly used to measure hostile attribution bias, and includes open-ended
questions where participants describe the perceived intentions behind a
negative social situation and how they would respond. While these questions
provide insights into the contents of hostile attributions, they require
time-intensive scoring by human raters. In this study, we assessed whether
large language models can automate the scoring of AIHQ open-ended responses. We
used a previously collected dataset in which individuals with traumatic brain
injury (TBI) and healthy controls (HC) completed the AIHQ and had their
open-ended responses rated by trained human raters. We used half of these
responses to fine-tune the two models on human-generated ratings, and tested
the fine-tuned models on the remaining half of AIHQ responses. Results showed
that model-generated ratings aligned with human ratings for both attributions
of hostility and aggression responses, with fine-tuned models showing higher
alignment. This alignment was consistent across ambiguous, intentional, and
accidental scenario types, and replicated previous findings on group
differences in attributions of hostility and aggression responses between TBI
and HC groups. The fine-tuned models also generalized well to an independent
nonclinical dataset. To support broader adoption, we provide an accessible
scoring interface that includes both local and cloud-based options. Together,
our findings suggest that large language models can streamline AIHQ scoring in
both research and clinical contexts, revealing their potential to facilitate
psychological assessments across different populations.

*Antonio Leandro Martins Candido,Jose Everardo Bessa Maia*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Bayesian fusion method to combine a generic LLM and a locally-trained classifier for better performance in curating online course forums, without frequent and costly fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Frequent updates in online course discussion forums demand constant retraining of LLMs, which is resource-intensive and not always feasible.

Method: The researchers propose Bayesian fusion, combining classification scores from both a pre-trained LLM and a locally-trained classifier to improve results without LLM fine-tuning.

Result: The Bayesian fusion approach outperforms individual classifiers and competes with the fine-tuning of LLMs.

Conclusion: Bayesian fusion is a viable alternative to frequent LLM fine-tuning for improving classification accuracy efficiently in dynamic, real-world applications.

Abstract: The automatic curation of discussion forums in online courses requires
constant updates, making frequent retraining of Large Language Models (LLMs) a
resource-intensive process. To circumvent the need for costly fine-tuning, this
paper proposes and evaluates the use of Bayesian fusion. The approach combines
the multidimensional classification scores of a pre-trained generic LLM with
those of a classifier trained on local data. The performance comparison
demonstrated that the proposed fusion improves the results compared to each
classifier individually, and is competitive with the LLM fine-tuning approach

### [49] [Beyond Hard Sharing: Efficient Multi-Task Speech-to-Text Modeling with Supervised Mixture of Experts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10009)
*Hojun Jin,Eunsoo Hong,Ziwon Hyung,Sungjun Lim,Seungjin Lee,Keunseok Cho*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Supervised Mixture of Experts (S-MoE) to address task interference in multi-task models, achieving improved performance in speech-related tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Task interference in hard-parameter sharing models impedes performance. The paper seeks to address this through a more efficient task-routing strategy.

Method: Introduced S-MoE, which assigns tasks to designated experts using guiding tokens instead of traditional gating functions, effectively separating parameters for different tasks.

Result: Applied to a speech-to-text model, S-MoE achieved a 6.35% relative reduction in Word Error Rate (WER) for ASR and ST tasks.

Conclusion: S-MoE effectively mitigates task interference in multi-task systems, demonstrating significant improvements and practical use for diverse speech-to-text tasks.

Abstract: Hard-parameter sharing is a common strategy to train a single model jointly
across diverse tasks. However, this often leads to task interference, impeding
overall model performance. To address the issue, we propose a simple yet
effective Supervised Mixture of Experts (S-MoE). Unlike traditional Mixture of
Experts models, S-MoE eliminates the need for training gating functions by
utilizing special guiding tokens to route each task to its designated expert.
By assigning each task to a separate feedforward network, S-MoE overcomes the
limitations of hard-parameter sharing. We further apply S-MoE to a
speech-to-text model, enabling the model to process mixed-bandwidth input while
jointly performing automatic speech recognition (ASR) and speech translation
(ST). Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed S-MoE,
achieving a 6.35% relative improvement in Word Error Rate (WER) when applied to
both the encoder and decoder.

### [50] [An Audit and Analysis of LLM-Assisted Health Misinformation Jailbreaks Against LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10010)
*Ayana Hussain,Patrick Zhao,Nicholas Vincent*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper examines the misuse of large language models (LLMs) to produce harmful medical misinformation using jailbreak attacks, and explores their role in detecting and combating misinformation from themselves or other sources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to understand the dual nature of LLMs as both generators and potential detectors of misinformation, especially within the context of health-related topics.

Method: The study analyzes 109 jailbreak attacks against three target LLMs, compares generated misinformation to social media data from Reddit, and evaluates the detection capabilities of machine learning approaches.

Result: The research demonstrates significant differences between jailbreak-generated misinformation and social media misinformation, while showing that LLMs can effectively identify misinformation from diverse sources.

Conclusion: With careful and informed design, LLMs could play a critical role in combating misinformation and fostering a healthier information landscape.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are a double-edged sword capable of generating
harmful misinformation -- inadvertently, or when prompted by "jailbreak"
attacks that attempt to produce malicious outputs. LLMs could, with additional
research, be used to detect and prevent the spread of misinformation. In this
paper, we investigate the efficacy and characteristics of LLM-produced
jailbreak attacks that cause other models to produce harmful medical
misinformation. We also study how misinformation generated by jailbroken LLMs
compares to typical misinformation found on social media, and how effectively
it can be detected using standard machine learning approaches. Specifically, we
closely examine 109 distinct attacks against three target LLMs and compare the
attack prompts to in-the-wild health-related LLM queries. We also examine the
resulting jailbreak responses, comparing the generated misinformation to
health-related misinformation on Reddit. Our findings add more evidence that
LLMs can be effectively used to detect misinformation from both other LLMs and
from people, and support a body of work suggesting that with careful design,
LLMs can contribute to a healthier overall information ecosystem.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study examines large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT and Bing's GPT-based models as tools for Japanese dietitians' exams, finding varied success but suboptimal overall accuracy and consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generative AI's success in professional fields inspired an evaluation of its potential as a study aid in nutritional education, specifically for Japanese registered dietitian exams.

Method: The study used dietitian exam questions to test ChatGPT and three Bing GPT-based models (Precise, Creative, Balanced). Accuracy, consistency, response time, and the effects of prompt engineering were analyzed.

Result: Bing-Precise (66.2%) and Bing-Creative (61.4%) surpassed the passing threshold of 60%, while Bing-Balanced (43.3%) and ChatGPT (42.8%) did not. However, all models lacked answer stability and consistency.

Conclusion: While some AI models showed promise by marginally surpassing the passing threshold, the lack of consistent accuracy and robustness highlights the need for further development to make them reliable study aids.

Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (AI) based on large language models
(LLMs), such as ChatGPT, has demonstrated remarkable progress across various
professional fields, including medicine and education. However, their
performance in nutritional education, especially in Japanese national licensure
examination for registered dietitians, remains underexplored. This study aimed
to evaluate the potential of current LLM-based generative AI models as study
aids for nutrition students. Questions from the Japanese national examination
for registered dietitians were used as prompts for ChatGPT and three Bing
models (Precise, Creative, Balanced), based on GPT-3.5 and GPT-4. Each question
was entered into independent sessions, and model responses were analyzed for
accuracy, consistency, and response time. Additional prompt engineering,
including role assignment, was tested to assess potential performance
improvements. Bing-Precise (66.2%) and Bing-Creative (61.4%) surpassed the
passing threshold (60%), while Bing-Balanced (43.3%) and ChatGPT (42.8%) did
not. Bing-Precise and Bing-Creative generally outperformed others across
subject fields except Nutrition Education, where all models underperformed.
None of the models consistently provided the same correct responses across
repeated attempts, highlighting limitations in answer stability. ChatGPT showed
greater consistency in response patterns but lower accuracy. Prompt engineering
had minimal effect, except for modest improvement when correct answers and
explanations were explicitly provided. While some generative AI models
marginally exceeded the passing threshold, overall accuracy and answer
consistency remained suboptimal. Moreover, all the models demonstrated notable
limitations in answer consistency and robustness. Further advancements are
needed to ensure reliable and stable AI-based study aids for dietitian
licensure preparation.

*Dehao Tao,Guangjie Liu,Weizheng,Yongfeng Huang,Minghu jiang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GG Explore introduces Guidance Graphs to efficiently bridge unstructured queries with structured knowledge retrieval, providing superior performance in knowledge-intensive tasks with streamlined processes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Limitations of LLMs in handling knowledge-intensive tasks motivate the integration of Knowledge Graphs to improve exploration efficiency and context utilization.

Method: A framework leveraging Guidance Graphs to define retrieval spaces, alongside Structural Alignment and Context-Aware Pruning mechanisms to enhance efficiency.

Result: The approach achieves better efficiency and state-of-the-art performance, particularly on complex tasks, even when smaller LLMs are utilized.

Conclusion: GG Explore proves practical and impactful, addressing LLM and Knowledge Graph integration challenges by optimizing retrieval and maintaining semantic consistency.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit strong linguistic capabilities,
their reliance on static knowledge and opaque reasoning processes limits their
performance in knowledge intensive tasks. Knowledge graphs (KGs) offer a
promising solution, but current exploration methods face a fundamental trade
off: question guided approaches incur redundant exploration due to granularity
mismatches, while clue guided methods fail to effectively leverage contextual
information for complex scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose
Guidance Graph guided Knowledge Exploration (GG Explore), a novel framework
that introduces an intermediate Guidance Graph to bridge unstructured queries
and structured knowledge retrieval. The Guidance Graph defines the retrieval
space by abstracting the target knowledge' s structure while preserving broader
semantic context, enabling precise and efficient exploration. Building upon the
Guidance Graph, we develop: (1) Structural Alignment that filters incompatible
candidates without LLM overhead, and (2) Context Aware Pruning that enforces
semantic consistency with graph constraints. Extensive experiments show our
method achieves superior efficiency and outperforms SOTA, especially on complex
tasks, while maintaining strong performance with smaller LLMs, demonstrating
practical value.

*Linqing Chen,Hanmeng Zhong,Wentao Wu,Weilei Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces Semantic Bridge, a framework for generating sophisticated multi-hop reasoning questions to improve LLM training, addressing challenges like limited high-quality data from domains such as biomedicine and law.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM training is hindered by the lack of reasoning-intensive question-answer pairs, particularly from sparse domain-specific sources such as PubMed and legal documents.

Method: The Semantic Bridge framework utilizes semantic graph weaving, combining entity bridging, predicate chain bridging, and causal bridging alongside an AMR-driven analysis pipeline to generate controllable multi-hop reasoning questions from arbitrary sources.

Result: The framework achieves up to 25.4% performance improvements over baselines across four languages, with generated questions showing higher complexity, better answerability, and improved pattern coverage. These questions also outperform human annotations using fewer materials.

Conclusion: Semantic Bridge introduces a paradigm shift in LLM training by providing controllable synthesis of reasoning-intensive questions from sparse sources. The release of its core code and model will enable wider adoption.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) training faces a critical bottleneck: the scarcity
of high-quality, reasoning-intensive question-answer pairs, especially from
sparse, domain-specific sources like PubMed papers or legal documents. Existing
methods rely on surface patterns, fundamentally failing to generate
controllable, complex multi-hop reasoning questions that test genuine
understanding-essential for advancing LLM training paradigms. We present
\textbf{Semantic Bridge}, the first universal framework for controllably
generating sophisticated multi-hop reasoning questions from arbitrary sources.
Our breakthrough innovation is \textit{semantic graph weaving}-three
complementary bridging mechanisms (entity bridging for role-varying shared
entities, predicate chain bridging for temporal/causal/logical sequences, and
causal bridging for explicit reasoning chains)-that systematically construct
complex pathways across documents, with fine-grained control over complexity
and types via AMR-driven analysis. Our multi-modal AMR pipeline achieves up to
9.5% better round-trip quality, enabling production-ready controllable QA
generation. Extensive evaluation demonstrates performance across both
general-purpose datasets (Wikipedia) and specialized domains (biomedicine) It
yields consistent 18.3%-25.4% gains over baselines across four languages
(English, Chinese, French, German). Question pairs generated from 200 sources
outperform 600 native human annotation examples with 67% fewer materials. Human
evaluation shows 23.4% higher complexity, 18.7% better answerability, and 31.2%
improved pattern coverage. Semantic Bridge establishes a new paradigm for LLM
training data synthesis, enabling controllable generation of targeted reasoning
questions from sparse sources. We will release our core code and semantic
bridge model.

*Lingfeng Zhou,Jialing Zhang,Jin Gao,Mohan Jiang,Dequan Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces PersonaEval, a benchmark evaluating LLMs' ability to reliably identify conversational roles, revealing that LLMs fall short compared to humans.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM evaluation lacks validated methods to ensure alignment with human perception in role-play fidelity, particularly in identifying conversational personas.

Method: PersonaEval benchmarks LLMs on their ability to attribute dialogue to correct personas using human-authored dialogues from various sources and compares human performance against LLMs.

Result: While humans achieved 90.8% accuracy, top-performing LLMs reached only 69%, indicating a significant gap in reliable role attribution.

Conclusion: For LLMs to effectively judge role-playing quality, they require stronger human-like reasoning capabilities beyond task-specific tuning.

Abstract: Current role-play studies often rely on unvalidated LLM-as-a-judge paradigms,
which may fail to reflect how humans perceive role fidelity. A key prerequisite
for human-aligned evaluation is role identification, the ability to recognize
who is speaking based on dialogue context. We argue that any meaningful
judgment of role-playing quality (how well a character is played) fundamentally
depends on first correctly attributing words and actions to the correct persona
(who is speaking). We present PersonaEval, the first benchmark designed to test
whether LLM evaluators can reliably identify human roles. PersonaEval uses
human-authored dialogues from novels, scripts, and video transcripts,
challenging models to determine the correct persona according to the
conversation context. Our experiments, including a human study, show that even
the best-performing LLMs reach only around 69% accuracy, well below the level
needed for reliable evaluation. In contrast, human participants perform near
ceiling with 90.8% accuracy, highlighting that current LLM evaluators are still
not human enough to effectively judge role-play scenarios. To better understand
this gap, we examine training-time adaptation and test-time compute, suggesting
that reliable evaluation requires more than task-specific tuning, but depends
on strong, human-like reasoning abilities in LLM evaluators. We release our
benchmark at https://github.com/maple-zhou/PersonaEval.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces RealTalk-CN, a Chinese speech-text dataset designed to address gaps in existing task-oriented dialogue (TOD) datasets. It also proposes a cross-modal chat task to simulate realistic user interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing TOD datasets are predominantly text-based and lack real speech input, disfluencies, speaker variability, and adequate representation in languages other than English.

Method: RealTalk-CN encompasses 5.4k dialogues with 60K utterances and annotations for speech-text pairings. It includes disfluencies and diverse scenarios and introduces a cross-modal chat task for modality switching simulations.

Result: Extensive experiments using RealTalk-CN show strong performance in terms of robustness to speech disfluencies, sensitivity to speaker variations, and cross-domain adaptability.

Conclusion: RealTalk-CN offers a robust new resource for developing and researching Chinese speech-based language models, filling important gaps in existing TOD datasets.

Abstract: In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable
advancements in multimodal processing, including end-to-end speech-based
language models that enable natural interactions and perform specific tasks in
task-oriented dialogue (TOD) systems. However, existing TOD datasets are
predominantly text-based, lacking real speech signals that are essential for
evaluating the robustness of speech-based LLMs. Moreover, existing speech TOD
datasets are primarily English and lack critical aspects such as speech
disfluencies and speaker variations. To address these gaps, we introduce
RealTalk-CN, the first Chinese multi-turn, multi-domain speech-text dual-modal
TOD dataset, comprising 5.4k dialogues (60K utterances, 150 hours) with paired
speech-text annotations. RealTalk-CN captures diverse dialogue scenarios with
annotated spontaneous speech disfluencies, ensuring comprehensive coverage of
real-world complexities in speech dialogue. In addition, we propose a novel
cross-modal chat task that authentically simulates real-world user
interactions, allowing dynamic switching between speech and text modalities.
Our evaluation covers robustness to speech disfluencies, sensitivity to speaker
characteristics, and cross-domain performance. Extensive experiments validate
the effectiveness of RealTalk-CN, establishing a strong foundation for Chinese
speech-based LLMs research.

*Tianyu Xie,Yuhang Wu,Yongdong Luo,Jiayi Ji,Xiawu Zheng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Multimodal Large Language Model Orchestration enables the integration of various multimodal models into a unified system without requiring additional training. This approach optimizes task routing, interaction efficiency, and context management.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome integration challenges that previously required training, the researchers aimed to enable seamless multimodal interaction and efficiency using a non-training-based orchestration framework.

Method: The paper proposes an orchestration framework with three innovations: a central LLM controller for task routing, a parallel Text-to-Speech system for conversational fluency, and cross-modal memory integration for maintaining coherent interaction context.

Result: Evaluations show that the approach enhances multimodal performance by up to 7.8% compared to traditional methods, reduces latency by 10.3%, and improves interpretability through explicit orchestration.

Conclusion: The introduced framework successfully integrates multimodal AI systems, achieving superior efficiency, modularity, and interaction quality without additional training.

Abstract: Different Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) cannot be integrated into
a unified multimodal input-output system directly. In previous work, training
has been considered as an inevitable component due to challenges in modal
alignment, Text-to-Speech efficiency and other integration issues. In this
paper, we introduce Multimodal Large Language Model Orchestration, an effective
approach for creating interactive multimodal AI systems without additional
training. MLLM Orchestration leverages the inherent reasoning capabilities of
large language models to coordinate specialized models through explicit
workflows, enabling natural multimodal interactions while maintaining
modularity, improving interpretability, and significantly enhancing
computational efficiency. Our orchestration framework is built upon three key
innovations: (1) a central controller LLM that analyzes user inputs and
dynamically routes tasks to appropriate specialized models through carefully
designed agents; (2) a parallel Text-to-Speech architecture that enables true
full-duplex interaction with seamless interruption handling and natural
conversational flow; and (3) a cross-modal memory integration system that
maintains coherent context across modalities through intelligent information
synthesis and retrieval, selectively avoiding unnecessary modality calls in
certain scenarios to improve response speed. Extensive evaluations demonstrate
that MLLM Orchestration achieves comprehensive multimodal capabilities without
additional training, performance improvements of up to 7.8% over traditional
jointly-trained approaches on standard benchmarks, reduced latency by 10.3%,
and significantly enhanced interpretability through explicit orchestration
processes.

### [57] [A Rose by Any Other Name Would Smell as Sweet: Categorical Homotopy Theory for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10018)
*Sridhar Mahadevan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework using categorical homotopy theory to address the issue of large language models assigning differing probabilities to rephrased but semantically identical statements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Language models often assign different next-token probabilities to semantically identical rephrased sentences, leading to inconsistencies based on superficial variations.

Method: A categorical homotopy framework is developed, using the concept of Markov categories to model probability distributions and incorporating weak equivalences to relate equivalent rephrased statements.

Result: Categorical homotopy techniques are proposed as a robust method to address disparities in next-token probabilities for semantically equivalent linguistic expressions, potentially smoothing these inconsistencies.

Conclusion: Categorical homotopy theory offers a promising direction for improving the semantic understanding of language models, potentially bridging gaps in probability distributions generated for equivalent statements.

Abstract: Natural language is replete with superficially different statements, such as
``Charles Darwin wrote" and ``Charles Darwin is the author of", which carry the
same meaning. Large language models (LLMs) should generate the same next-token
probabilities in such cases, but usually do not. Empirical workarounds have
been explored, such as using k-NN estimates of sentence similarity to produce
smoothed estimates. In this paper, we tackle this problem more abstractly,
introducing a categorical homotopy framework for LLMs. We introduce an LLM
Markov category to represent probability distributions in language generated by
an LLM, where the probability of a sentence, such as ``Charles Darwin wrote" is
defined by an arrow in a Markov category. However, this approach runs into
difficulties as language is full of equivalent rephrases, and each generates a
non-isomorphic arrow in the LLM Markov category. To address this fundamental
problem, we use categorical homotopy techniques to capture ``weak equivalences"
in an LLM Markov category. We present a detailed overview of application of
categorical homotopy to LLMs, from higher algebraic K-theory to model
categories, building on powerful theoretical results developed over the past
half a century.

### [58] [Decoupling Understanding from Reasoning via Problem Space Mapping for Small-scale Model Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10019)
*Li Wang,Changhao Zhang,Zengqi Xiu,Kai Lu,Xin Yu,Kui Zhang,Wenjun Wu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper focuses on improving reasoning ability in Small Language Models (SLMs, ≤ 1.5B) by decoupling understanding from reasoning through a new framework and the DURIT algorithm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving reasoning ability of SLMs is challenging due to natural language complexities, variability, and limited model capacity, which hinder optimization in reasoning tasks.

Method: The proposed method involves mapping natural language problems into a canonical, simplified problem space and introducing DURIT, an iterative algorithm with reinforcement learning, self-distillation, and alternating co-training of mappers and reasoners.

Result: DURIT significantly enhances SLMs' performance across in-domain and out-of-domain reasoning tasks, improving both reasoning capabilities and robustness.

Conclusion: Decoupling the process of linguistic understanding from reasoning is validated as an effective approach for boosting the reasoning abilities of small language models.

Abstract: Despite recent advances in the reasoning capabilities of Large Language
Models (LLMs), improving the reasoning ability of Small Language Models (SLMs,
e.g., $\leq$ 1.5B) remains challenging. A key obstacle lies in the complexity
and variability of natural language: essentially equivalent problems often
appear in diverse surface forms, often obscured by redundant or distracting
details. This imposes a dual burden on SLMs: they must first extract the core
problem from complex linguistic input, and then perform reasoning based on that
understanding. The resulting vast and noisy problem space hinders optimization,
particularly for models with limited capacity. To address this, we propose a
new framework that decouples understanding from reasoning by mapping natural
language problems into a canonical problem space-a semantically simplified yet
expressive domain. This enables SLMs to focus on reasoning over standardized
inputs, free from linguistic variability. Within this framework, we introduce
DURIT (Decoupled Understanding from Reasoning via Iterative Training), a
three-step algorithm that iteratively: (1) mapping natural language problems
via reinforcement learning, (2) aligns reasoning trajectories through
self-distillation, and (3) trains reasoning policies in the problem space. The
mapper and reasoner are co-trained in an alternating loop throughout this
process. Experiments show that DURIT substantially improves SLMs' performance
on both in-domain and out-of-domain mathematical and logical reasoning tasks.
Beyond improving reasoning capabilities, DURIT also improves the robustness of
reasoning, validating decoupling understanding from reasoning as an effective
strategy for strengthening SLMs.

*Chuan Li,Qianyi Zhao,Fengran Mo,Cen Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces FedCoT, a novel framework to enhance reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in federated learning settings, focusing on improving accuracy, robustness, and interpretability while addressing computational, communication, and privacy challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation lies in overcoming the challenges of optimizing reasoning performance in federated environments, especially in healthcare, which requires accurate, interpretable, and privacy-preserving solutions.

Method: FedCoT utilizes lightweight chain-of-thought enhancement wherein local models generate diverse reasoning paths and a compact discriminator selects the best. It incorporates improved aggregation through LoRA module stacking for noise-free client heterogeneity management.

Result: FedCoT improved accuracy, robustness, and interpretability of reasoning tasks while demonstrating enhanced client-side performance for medical applications under strict resource and privacy constraints.

Conclusion: FedCoT effectively addresses federated reasoning challenges, achieving better interpretability and reasoning quality while maintaining privacy and resource efficiency.

Abstract: Efficiently enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models
(LLMs) in federated learning environments remains challenging, particularly
when balancing performance gains with strict computational, communication, and
privacy constraints. This challenge is especially acute in healthcare, where
decisions-spanning clinical, operational, and patient-facing contexts-demand
not only accurate outputs but also interpretable, traceable rationales to
ensure safety, accountability, and regulatory compliance. Conventional
federated tuning approaches on LLM fail to address this need: they optimize
primarily for answer correctness while neglecting rationale quality, leaving
CoT capabilities dependent on models' innate pre-training abilities. Moreover,
existing methods for improving rationales typically rely on privacy-violating
knowledge distillation from centralized models. Additionally, the communication
overhead in traditional federated fine-tuning on LLMs remains substantial. We
addresses this gap by proposing FedCoT, a novel framework specifically designed
to enhance reasoning in federated settings. FedCoT leverages a lightweight
chain-of-thought enhancement mechanism: local models generate multiple
reasoning paths, and a compact discriminator dynamically selects the most
promising one. This approach improves reasoning accuracy and robustness while
providing valuable interpretability, which is particularly critical for medical
applications. To manage client heterogeneity efficiently, we adopt an improved
aggregation approach building upon advanced LoRA module stacking, incorporating
client classifier-awareness to achieve noise-free aggregation across diverse
clients. Comprehensive experiments on medical reasoning tasks demonstrate that
FedCoT significantly boosts client-side reasoning performance under stringent
resource budgets while fully preserving data privacy.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study proposes LATTE, a framework that aligns event embeddings with LLM embeddings to efficiently summarize historic financial communication data, outperforming traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the computational inefficiency and impracticality of using large language models on long sequences of financial communication data.

Method: LATTE uses contrastive learning to align raw event data embeddings with semantic embeddings from pre-trained LLMs, summarizing behavioral features through short prompts.

Result: LATTE reduces inference cost and input size while achieving state-of-the-art performance on event sequence representations.

Conclusion: LATTE is effective and practical for latency-sensitive financial communication analysis compared to conventional methods.

Abstract: Learning clients embeddings from sequences of their historic communications
is central to financial applications. While large language models (LLMs) offer
general world knowledge, their direct use on long event sequences is
computationally expensive and impractical in real-world pipelines. In this
paper, we propose LATTE, a contrastive learning framework that aligns raw event
embeddings with semantic embeddings from frozen LLMs. Behavioral features are
summarized into short prompts, embedded by the LLM, and used as supervision via
contrastive loss. The proposed approach significantly reduces inference cost
and input size compared to conventional processing of complete sequence by LLM.
We experimentally show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques
for learning event sequence representations on real-world financial datasets
while remaining deployable in latency-sensitive environments.

### [61] [Conformal P-Value in Multiple-Choice Question Answering Tasks with Provable Risk Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10022)
*Yuanchang Ye*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a conformal prediction framework enhanced with significance testing to increase trust in large language models for multiple-choice question answering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While large language models are widely utilized in disciplinary question answering, their tendencies toward hallucination and nonfactual generation reduce response reliability. There is a need for statistical methods that improve trustworthiness in these high-stakes applications.

Method: The study integrates p-value computations with conformity scoring by using self-consistency resampling of MCQA responses. Null hypothesis testing with empirically derived p-values is conducted to construct prediction sets.

Result: The framework achieves empirically user-specified miscoverage rates and demonstrates that prediction set size decreases with increasing risk levels, confirming its effectiveness as an uncertainty metric.

Conclusion: A statistically principled framework is proposed, paving the way for trustworthy deployment of LLMs in high-stakes QA scenarios.

Abstract: This study introduces a significance testing-enhanced conformal prediction
(CP) framework to improve trustworthiness of large language models (LLMs) in
multiple-choice question answering (MCQA). While LLMs have been increasingly
deployed in disciplinary QA scenarios, hallucination and nonfactual generation
substantially compromise response reliability. Although CP provides
statistically rigorous marginal coverage guarantees for prediction sets, and
significance testing offers established statistical rigor, their synergistic
integration remains unexplored. To mitigate hallucination and factual
inaccuracies, our framework integrates $p$-value computation with conformity
scoring through self-consistency resampling of MCQA responses. This approach
calculates option frequencies to address LLMs' black-box nature, subsequently
constructing prediction sets via null hypothesis testing ($\mathcal{H}_0$) with
empirically derived $p$-values. Evaluations on MMLU and MMLU-Pro benchmarks
using off-the-shelf LLMs demonstrate: (1) The enhanced CP achieves
user-specified empirical miscoverage rates; (2) Test-set average prediction set
size (APSS) decreases monotonically with increasing risk levels ($\alpha$),
validating APSS as an effective uncertainty metric. This work establishes a
principled statistical framework for trustworthy LLM deployment in high-stakes
QA applications.

### [62] [RTTC: Reward-Guided Collaborative Test-Time Compute](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10024)
*J. Pablo Muñoz,Jinjie Yuan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RTTC (Reward-Guided Test-Time Compute) is proposed as an adaptive framework to optimize query-specific selection of strategies like Test-Time Training and Retrieval-Augmented Generation, enhancing Large Language Model accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiency caused by indiscriminate application of Test-Time Compute strategies and optimize query-specific adaptation.

Method: RTTC uses a pretrained reward model for query-specific strategy selection, employs a distributed server-client architecture, and integrates Query-State Caching to reduce redundant computations.

Result: RTTC achieves superior accuracy across diverse domains and tasks compared to existing methods like vanilla RAG or TTT.

Conclusion: RTTC validates the importance of adaptive, reward-driven strategy selection, offering scalable and high-performance adaptation for Large Language Models.

Abstract: Test-Time Compute (TTC) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for enhancing the
performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) at inference, leveraging strategies
such as Test-Time Training (TTT) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).
However, the optimal adaptation strategy varies across queries, and
indiscriminate application of TTC strategy incurs substantial computational
overhead. In this work, we introduce Reward-Guided Test-Time Compute (RTTC), a
novel framework that adaptively selects the most effective TTC strategy for
each query via a pretrained reward model, maximizing downstream accuracy across
diverse domains and tasks. RTTC operates in a distributed server-client
architecture, retrieving relevant samples from a remote knowledge base and
applying RAG or lightweight fine-tuning on client devices only when necessary.
To further mitigate redundant computation, we propose Query-State Caching,
which enables the efficient reuse of historical query states at both retrieval
and adaptation levels. Extensive experiments across multiple LLMs and
benchmarks demonstrate that RTTC consistently achieves superior accuracy
compared to vanilla RAG or TTT, validating the necessity of adaptive,
reward-guided TTC selection and the potential of RTTC for scalable,
high-performance language model adaptation.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a cutting-edge PPD screening system using ML, NLP, and LLMs with interpretable explanations. It achieves 90% accuracy, aiding real-time detection and intervention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Postpartum depression critically affects mothers, requiring swift detection for effective intervention.

Method: The study develops an AI-driven system using NLP, ML, and LLMs to analyze free speech. It incorporates interpretable models to explain predictions.

Result: The proposed system achieved 90% detection accuracy across evaluation metrics, surpassing alternative methods in previous research.

Conclusion: This approach significantly enhances real-time PPD screening, supporting timely interventions and providing interpretable, user-friendly outputs.

Abstract: Among the many challenges mothers undergo after childbirth, postpartum
depression (PPD) is a severe condition that significantly impacts their mental
and physical well-being. Consequently, the rapid detection of ppd and their
associated risk factors is critical for in-time assessment and intervention
through specialized prevention procedures. Accordingly, this work addresses the
need to help practitioners make decisions with the latest technological
advancements to enable real-time screening and treatment recommendations.
Mainly, our work contributes to an intelligent PPD screening system that
combines Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning (ML), and Large Language
Models (LLMs) towards an affordable, real-time, and non-invasive free speech
analysis. Moreover, it addresses the black box problem since the predictions
are described to the end users thanks to the combination of LLMs with
interpretable ml models (i.e., tree-based algorithms) using feature importance
and natural language. The results obtained are 90 % on ppd detection for all
evaluation metrics, outperforming the competing solutions in the literature.
Ultimately, our solution contributes to the rapid detection of PPD and their
associated risk factors, critical for in-time and proper assessment and
intervention.

*Kai Zhao,Yanjun Zhao,Jiaming Song,Shien He,Lusheng Zhang,Qiang Zhang,Tianjiao Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SABER introduces a reinforcement learning framework for LLMs that balances token-budgeted reasoning with flexible inference modes to achieve high accuracy while reducing inference costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address excessive inference costs and latency in LLMs when applied uniformly across tasks while maintaining reasoning accuracy.

Method: SABER assigns token budget tiers to training examples based on their complexity, implements length-aware rewards during fine-tuning, and utilizes four discrete inference modes for flexible reasoning control.

Result: SABER shows high accuracy under token constraints, effective generalization across tasks, and substantial inference token reduction with accuracy improvement, such as a 3.6% gain on the MATH benchmark with 65.4% shorter reasoning length.

Conclusion: SABER provides an efficient solution for user-controllable and budget-aware LLM reasoning, demonstrating favorable trade-offs between latency and performance across multiple domains.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) empowered by chain-of-thought reasoning have
achieved impressive accuracy on complex tasks but suffer from excessive
inference costs and latency when applied uniformly to all problems. We propose
SABER (Switchable and Balanced Training for Efficient LLM Reasoning), a
reinforcement learning framework that endows LLMs with user-controllable,
token-budgeted reasoning. SABER first profiles each training example's
base-model thinking token usage and assigns it to one of the predefined budget
tiers. During fine-tuning, the model is guided by system prompts and
length-aware rewards to respect its assigned budget. In parallel, we
incorporate no-think examples to ensure the model remains reliable even when
explicit reasoning is turned off. SABER further supports four discrete
inference modes - NoThink, FastThink, CoreThink, and DeepThink, enabling
flexible trade-offs between latency and reasoning depth. Extensive evaluations
on math reasoning (MATH, GSM8K), code generation (MBPP), and logical reasoning
(LiveBench-Reasoning) demonstrate that SABER achieves high accuracy under tight
budgets, graceful degradation, and effective cross-scale and cross-domain
generalization. In particular, SABER-FastThink cuts reasoning length by 65.4%
and yields a 3.6% accuracy gain compared with the base model on the MATH
benchmark.

TL;DR: The study explores using a fusion model combining transformer embeddings and handcrafted linguistic features for ADRD detection via speech data, augmented by synthetic speech generated from LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ADRD is significantly underdiagnosed in U.S. older adults, and leveraging scalable NLP methods like linguistic markers in speech can facilitate early cognitive decline detection.

Method: A fusion model was developed combining transformer embeddings with linguistic features, evaluated alongside synthetic speech data augmentation and unimodal/multimodal LLM classifier benchmarking.

Result: The fusion model achieved an F1 score of 83.3, improved to 85.7 with MedAlpaca-generated synthetic speech augmentation. Fine-tuned unimodal LLMs showed improvements, but multimodal LLM models underperformed.

Conclusion: Transformer embeddings integrated with linguistic features improve ADRD detection performance, with potential for synthetic data augmentation via fine-tuned LLMs, though multimodal models require further refinement.

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) affect approximately five
million older adults in the U.S., yet over half remain undiagnosed.
Speech-based natural language processing (NLP) offers a promising, scalable
approach to detect early cognitive decline through linguistic markers.
  To develop and evaluate a screening pipeline that (i) fuses transformer
embeddings with handcrafted linguistic features, (ii) tests data augmentation
using synthetic speech generated by large language models (LLMs), and (iii)
benchmarks unimodal and multimodal LLM classifiers for ADRD detection.
  Transcripts from the DementiaBank "cookie-theft" task (n = 237) were used.
Ten transformer models were evaluated under three fine-tuning strategies. A
fusion model combined embeddings from the top-performing transformer with 110
lexical-derived linguistic features. Five LLMs (LLaMA-8B/70B, MedAlpaca-7B,
Ministral-8B, GPT-4o) were fine-tuned to generate label-conditioned synthetic
speech, which was used to augment training data. Three multimodal models
(GPT-4o, Qwen-Omni, Phi-4) were tested for speech-text classification in
zero-shot and fine-tuned settings.
  The fusion model achieved F1 = 83.3 (AUC = 89.5), outperforming linguistic or
transformer-only baselines. Augmenting training data with 2x MedAlpaca-7B
synthetic speech increased F1 to 85.7. Fine-tuning significantly improved
unimodal LLM classifiers (e.g., MedAlpaca: F1 = 47.3 -> 78.5 F1). Current
multimodal models demonstrated lower performance (GPT-4o = 70.2 F1; Qwen =
66.0). Performance gains aligned with the distributional similarity between
synthetic and real speech.
  Integrating transformer embeddings with linguistic features enhances ADRD
detection from speech. Clinically tuned LLMs effectively support both
classification and data augmentation, while further advancement is needed in
multimodal modeling.

TL;DR: The paper introduces PREF, a personalised framework for evaluating text generation without requiring gold references, achieving higher accuracy and better alignment with human judgments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluation methods for text generation fail to adequately consider the individuality of users in personalized outputs.

Method: The method consists of a three-step pipeline: (1) creating a guideline with universal text criteria, (2) customizing criteria based on user preferences, and (3) scoring outputs following the personalized rubric.

Result: Experiments on PrefEval benchmark demonstrate PREF's superior accuracy, calibration, and alignment with human judgments compared to strong baselines.

Conclusion: PREF enhances the reliability and user-alignment of text generation evaluations, serving as a foundation for user-centric system development in language generation.

Abstract: Personalised text generation is essential for user-centric information
systems, yet most evaluation methods overlook the individuality of users. We
introduce \textbf{PREF}, a \textbf{P}ersonalised \textbf{R}eference-free
\textbf{E}valuation \textbf{F}ramework that jointly measures general output
quality and user-specific alignment without requiring gold personalised
references. PREF operates in a three-step pipeline: (1) a coverage stage uses a
large language model (LLM) to generate a comprehensive, query-specific
guideline covering universal criteria such as factuality, coherence, and
completeness; (2) a preference stage re-ranks and selectively augments these
factors using the target user's profile, stated or inferred preferences, and
context, producing a personalised evaluation rubric; and (3) a scoring stage
applies an LLM judge to rate candidate answers against this rubric, ensuring
baseline adequacy while capturing subjective priorities. This separation of
coverage from preference improves robustness, transparency, and reusability,
and allows smaller models to approximate the personalised quality of larger
ones. Experiments on the PrefEval benchmark, including implicit
preference-following tasks, show that PREF achieves higher accuracy, better
calibration, and closer alignment with human judgments than strong baselines.
By enabling scalable, interpretable, and user-aligned evaluation, PREF lays the
groundwork for more reliable assessment and development of personalised
language generation systems.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Latent Fusion Jailbreak (LFJ), a new representation-based attack on Large Language Models (LLMs) to bypass safety alignments, achieving higher attack success than existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address vulnerabilities in LLMs where safety alignments can be bypassed using advanced jailbreak attacks.

Method: The LFJ approach uses query pairs with thematic and syntactic similarity, performs gradient-guided interpolation on hidden states, and optimizes for success, fluency, and efficiency.

Result: LFJ achieves a 94.01% average attack success rate against models like Vicuna and LLaMA-2, and an adversarial training defense reduces attack success by over 80%.

Conclusion: LFJ demonstrates the risk of representation-based attacks and highlights the effectiveness of advanced defenses, enhancing the robustness of LLMs against such attacks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive capabilities in various
language tasks but are susceptible to jailbreak attacks that circumvent their
safety alignments. This paper introduces Latent Fusion Jailbreak (LFJ), a
representation-based attack that interpolates hidden states from harmful and
benign query pairs to elicit prohibited responses. LFJ begins by selecting
query pairs with high thematic and syntactic similarity, then performs
gradient-guided interpolation at influential layers and tokens, followed by
optimization to balance attack success, output fluency, and computational
efficiency. Evaluations on models such as Vicuna and LLaMA-2 across benchmarks
like AdvBench and MaliciousInstruct yield an average attack success rate (ASR)
of 94.01%, outperforming existing methods. To mitigate LFJ, we propose an
adversarial training defense that fine-tunes models on interpolated examples,
reducing ASR by over 80% without degrading performance on benign inputs.
Ablation studies validate the importance of query pair selection, hidden state
interpolation components, and optimization strategies in LFJ's effectiveness.

*Saaduddin Mahmud,Mason Nakamura,Kyle H. Wray,Shlomo Zilberstein*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes the IAPO framework that unifies prompt optimization with inference scaling to align large language models (LLMs) effectively within budget constraints and multiple task objectives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current prompt optimization techniques neglect the interdependence between prompts and inference strategies, creating inefficiencies and misalignments in optimizing LLM performance for specific user preferences and computational budgets.

Method: The authors introduce IAPO (Inference-Aware Prompt Optimization) and its fixed-budget training algorithm PSST (Prompt Scaling via Sequential Trimming) to jointly optimize prompts and inference scaling with theoretical guarantees on error probability.

Result: The PSST algorithm was evaluated on six diverse tasks, including multi-objective text generation and reasoning, showing significant benefits of inference-aware optimization for LLM alignment.

Conclusion: Inference strategy awareness significantly enhances prompt optimization methods, bridging gaps between user preferences, task objectives, and computational constraints to align LLMs more effectively.

Abstract: Prompt optimization methods have demonstrated significant effectiveness in
aligning black-box large language models (LLMs). In parallel, inference scaling
strategies such as Best-of-N Sampling and Majority Voting have also proven to
enhance alignment and performance by trading off computation. However, existing
prompt optimization approaches are inference strategy agnostic; that is, they
optimize prompts without regard to the inference strategy employed during
deployment. This constitutes a significant methodological gap, as our empirical
and theoretical analysis reveals a strong interdependence between these two
paradigms. Moreover, we find that user preferences regarding trade-offs among
multiple objectives and inference budgets substantially influence the choice of
prompt and inference configuration. To address this gap, we introduce a unified
novel framework named IAPO (Inference-Aware Prompt Optimization) that jointly
optimizes the prompt and inference scale, while being aware of the inference
budget and different task objectives. We then develop a fixed-budget training
algorithm for IAPO, which we call PSST (Prompt Scaling via Sequential
Trimming), and analyze finite-budget guarantees on error probability. Finally,
we evaluate the effectiveness of PSST on six different tasks, including
multi-objective text generation and reasoning, and demonstrate the critical
role of incorporating inference-awareness when aligning black-box LLMs through
prompt optimization.

*Fan Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates the vulnerabilities of LLMs when using a thinking mode and proposes a safe thinking intervention method to reduce their susceptibility to Jailbreak attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore why the thinking mode in LLMs, considered valuable for reasoning, is especially vulnerable to Jailbreak attacks and how to mitigate these vulnerabilities.

Method: The authors studied 9 LLMs using AdvBench and HarmBench datasets to analyze the characteristics of successful attacks, and proposed using 'specific thinking tokens' in prompts as a safe thinking intervention.

Result: They found that thinking mode LLMs were more prone to attacks, particularly when involving educational or long-form questions. Their proposed intervention significantly reduced the attack success rate.

Conclusion: Guiding LLM internal thinking with explicit prompts can mitigate Jailbreak attack vulnerabilities, enhancing safe usage of LLMs in thinking mode.

Abstract: Thinking mode has always been regarded as one of the most valuable modes in
LLMs. However, we uncover a surprising and previously overlooked phenomenon:
LLMs with thinking mode are more easily broken by Jailbreak attack. We evaluate
9 LLMs on AdvBench and HarmBench and find that the success rate of attacking
thinking mode in LLMs is almost higher than that of non-thinking mode. Through
large numbers of sample studies, it is found that for educational purposes and
excessively long thinking lengths are the characteristics of successfully
attacked data, and LLMs also give harmful answers when they mostly know that
the questions are harmful. In order to alleviate the above problems, this paper
proposes a method of safe thinking intervention for LLMs, which explicitly
guides the internal thinking processes of LLMs by adding "specific thinking
tokens" of LLMs to the prompt. The results demonstrate that the safe thinking
intervention can significantly reduce the attack success rate of LLMs with
thinking mode.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Active Prompting for Information Extraction (APIE), leveraging a dual uncertainty metric to optimize few-shot example selection in LLMs for improved extraction accuracy and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The current strategies for selecting in-context examples in few-shot information extraction overlook the dual sources of confusion in LLMs: semantic content and structured format generation.

Method: APIE employs a dual-component uncertainty metric, assessing Format and Content Uncertainty, to rank and select the most informative samples as few-shot examples.

Result: APIE consistently outperformed conventional strategies in four benchmarks, achieving superior accuracy and robustness in information extraction tasks.

Conclusion: A dual-level view of model uncertainty is essential for building structured generation systems that are both effective and reliable.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) show remarkable potential for few-shot
information extraction (IE), yet their performance is highly sensitive to the
choice of in-context examples. Conventional selection strategies often fail to
provide informative guidance, as they overlook a key source of model
fallibility: confusion stemming not just from semantic content, but also from
the generation of well-structured formats required by IE tasks. To address
this, we introduce Active Prompting for Information Extraction (APIE), a novel
active prompting framework guided by a principle we term introspective
confusion. Our method empowers an LLM to assess its own confusion through a
dual-component uncertainty metric that uniquely quantifies both Format
Uncertainty (difficulty in generating correct syntax) and Content Uncertainty
(inconsistency in extracted semantics). By ranking unlabeled data with this
comprehensive score, our framework actively selects the most challenging and
informative samples to serve as few-shot exemplars. Extensive experiments on
four benchmarks show that our approach consistently outperforms strong
baselines, yielding significant improvements in both extraction accuracy and
robustness. Our work highlights the critical importance of a fine-grained,
dual-level view of model uncertainty when it comes to building effective and
reliable structured generation systems.

*Nghia Trung Ngo,Franck Dernoncourt,Thien Huu Nguyen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces mSCoRe, a benchmark for evaluating Large Language Models in multilingual commonsense reasoning with a focus on nuanced reasoning skills and cultural knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the lack of comprehensive tools to analyze how Large Language Models (LLMs) utilize human reasoning skills, especially in multilingual and cultural commonsense reasoning.

Method: The paper proposes a benchmark named mSCoRe with three main components: a taxonomy of reasoning skills, a data synthesis pipeline for commonsense evaluation, and a framework for scaling task complexity to keep pace with model improvements.

Result: Experiments conducted on eight state-of-the-art Large Language Models show that mSCoRe challenges these models significantly, particularly at higher levels of complexity, and exposes their limitations in nuanced multilingual commonsense reasoning.

Conclusion: The findings highlight the weaknesses in current reasoning-reinforced models for multilingual contexts and suggest areas for future research to enhance their capabilities.

Abstract: Recent advancements in reasoning-reinforced Large Language Models (LLMs) have
shown remarkable capabilities in complex reasoning tasks. However, the
mechanism underlying their utilization of different human reasoning skills
remains poorly investigated, especially for multilingual commonsense reasoning
that involves everyday knowledge across different languages and cultures. To
address this gap, we propose a \textbf{M}ultilingual and Scalable Benchmark for
\textbf{S}kill-based \textbf{Co}mmonsense \textbf{Re}asoning (\textbf{mSCoRe}).
Our benchmark incorporates three key components that are designed to
systematically evaluate LLM's reasoning capabilities, including: (1) a novel
taxonomy of reasoning skills that enables fine-grained analysis of models'
reasoning processes, (2) a robust data synthesis pipeline tailored specifically
for commonsense reasoning evaluation, and (3) a complexity scaling framework
allowing task difficulty to scale dynamically alongside future improvements in
LLM abilities. Extensive experiments on eights state-of-the-art LLMs of varying
sizes and training approaches demonstrate that \textbf{mSCoRe} remains
significantly challenging for current models, particularly at higher complexity
levels. Our results reveal the limitations of such reasoning-reinforced models
when confronted with nuanced multilingual general and cultural commonsense. We
further provide detailed analysis on the models' reasoning processes,
suggesting future directions for improving multilingual commonsense reasoning
capabilities.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a benchmark to test large language models (LLMs) on multi-turn tasks requiring reasoning, dialogue interaction, and information-seeking, uncovering areas for improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with nuanced, multi-turn, and incomplete data tasks common in real-world scenarios.

Method: A benchmark suite with deterministic scoring mechanisms was designed to evaluate reasoning, dialogue, and information-seeking skills of LLMs.

Result: Frontier models were evaluated, exposing significant gaps in instruction adherence, reasoning ability, and planning.

Conclusion: The benchmark highlights weaknesses in LLMs for complex scenarios and serves as a foundation for future improvement and research.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at solving problems with clear and
complete statements, but often struggle with nuanced environments or
interactive tasks which are common in most real-world scenarios. This
highlights the critical need for developing LLMs that can effectively engage in
logically consistent multi-turn dialogue, seek information and reason with
incomplete data. To this end, we introduce a novel benchmark comprising a suite
of multi-turn tasks each designed to test specific reasoning, interactive
dialogue, and information-seeking abilities. These tasks have deterministic
scoring mechanisms, thus eliminating the need for human intervention.
Evaluating frontier models on our benchmark reveals significant headroom. Our
analysis shows that most errors emerge from poor instruction following,
reasoning failures, and poor planning. This benchmark provides valuable
insights into the strengths and weaknesses of current LLMs in handling complex,
interactive scenarios and offers a robust platform for future research aimed at
improving these critical capabilities.

*Gal Amram,Eitan Farchi,Shmulik Froimovich,Raviv Gal,Avi Ziv*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces LaaJMeter, a simulation-based framework for evaluating metrics used in assessing language models as judges (LLM-as-a-Judge), focusing on domain-specific tasks and low-resource settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the difficulty in evaluating the quality of LLM-as-a-Judge (LaaJs) in domain-specific tasks due to scarce annotated data and costly expert evaluation.

Method: The method involves creating a simulation framework called LaaJMeter, which generates synthetic data for virtual models and judges to systematically analyze evaluation metrics under realistic conditions.

Result: In a code translation task, LaaJMeter revealed varying sensitivity among metrics to evaluator quality, highlighting the limitations of commonly used metrics.

Conclusion: The framework offers a scalable and extensible solution for validating metrics and refining LaaJs, ensuring trustworthy evaluation in resource-constrained NLP domains.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used as evaluators in natural
language processing tasks, a paradigm known as LLM-as-a-Judge (LaaJ). While
effective in general domains, LaaJs pose significant challenges in
domain-specific contexts, where annotated data is scarce and expert evaluation
is costly. In such cases, meta-evaluation is often performed using metrics that
have not been validated for the specific domain in which they are applied. As a
result, it becomes difficult to determine which metrics effectively identify
LaaJ quality, and further, what threshold indicates sufficient evaluator
performance. In this work, we introduce LaaJMeter, a simulation-based framework
for controlled meta-evaluation of LaaJs. LaaJMeter enables engineers to
generate synthetic data representing virtual models and judges, allowing
systematic analysis of evaluation metrics under realistic conditions. This
helps practitioners validate and refine LaaJs for specific evaluation tasks:
they can test whether their metrics correctly distinguish between better and
worse (virtual) LaaJs, and estimate appropriate thresholds for evaluator
adequacy.
  We demonstrate the utility of LaaJMeter in a code translation task involving
a legacy programming language, showing how different metrics vary in
sensitivity to evaluator quality. Our results highlight the limitations of
common metrics and the importance of principled metric selection. LaaJMeter
provides a scalable and extensible solution for assessing LaaJs in low-resource
settings, contributing to the broader effort to ensure trustworthy and
reproducible evaluation in NLP.

### [74] [Estimating Machine Translation Difficulty](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10175)
*Lorenzo Proietti,Stefano Perrella,Vilém Zouhar,Roberto Navigli,Tom Kocmi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses the need for better evaluation methods in machine translation by introducing a task called translation difficulty estimation, along with improved models and metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is the need for discriminative evaluation methods as machine translation approaches near-perfect quality, making distinctions between state-of-the-art systems challenging.

Method: The authors formalized the task of translation difficulty estimation, introduced evaluation metrics for estimators, proposed new models (Sentinel-src variants), and compared their performance to baseline methods.

Result: Dedicated models (Sentinel-src-24 and Sentinel-src-25) outperform heuristic-based methods and LLM-as-a-judge approaches, effectively identifying challenging texts for machine translation.

Conclusion: The improved difficulty estimation models can guide research and benchmark creation by pinpointing texts that challenge machine translation systems, aiding system evaluation and development.

Abstract: Machine translation quality has began achieving near-perfect translations in
some setups. These high-quality outputs make it difficult to distinguish
between state-of-the-art models and to identify areas for future improvement.
Automatically identifying texts where machine translation systems struggle
holds promise for developing more discriminative evaluations and guiding future
research.
  We formalize the task of translation difficulty estimation, defining a text's
difficulty based on the expected quality of its translations. We introduce a
new metric to evaluate difficulty estimators and use it to assess both
baselines and novel approaches. Finally, we demonstrate the practical utility
of difficulty estimators by using them to construct more challenging machine
translation benchmarks. Our results show that dedicated models (dubbed
Sentinel-src) outperform both heuristic-based methods (e.g. word rarity or
syntactic complexity) and LLM-as-a-judge approaches. We release two improved
models for difficulty estimation, Sentinel-src-24 and Sentinel-src-25, which
can be used to scan large collections of texts and select those most likely to
challenge contemporary machine translation systems.

*Wenlong Deng,Jiaming Zhang,Qi Zeng,Christos Thrampoulidis,Boying Gong,Xiaoxiao Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes 'For-Value,' a data valuation framework that uses a single forward pass for scalable influence computation in LLMs and VLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for transparent and accountable training data influence in massive language and vision-language models.

Method: For-Value computes per-sample influence scores based on alignment in hidden representations and prediction errors using a simple closed-form expression.

Result: For-Value achieves or surpasses gradient-based methods in finding impactful fine-tuning examples and detecting mislabeled data.

Conclusion: For-Value offers an efficient alternative to computationally intensive methods, enhancing scalability in influence estimation for large foundation models.

Abstract: Quantifying the influence of individual training samples is essential for
enhancing the transparency and accountability of large language models (LLMs)
and vision-language models (VLMs). However, existing data valuation methods
often rely on Hessian information or model retraining, making them
computationally prohibitive for billion-parameter models. In this work, we
introduce For-Value, a forward-only data valuation framework that enables
scalable and efficient influence estimation for both LLMs and VLMs. By
leveraging the rich representations of modern foundation models, For-Value
computes influence scores using a simple closed-form expression based solely on
a single forward pass, thereby eliminating the need for costly gradient
computations. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that For-Value accurately
estimates per-sample influence by capturing alignment in hidden representations
and prediction errors between training and validation samples. Extensive
experiments show that For-Value matches or outperforms gradient-based baselines
in identifying impactful fine-tuning examples and effectively detecting
mislabeled data.

*Abdullah Hashmat,Muhammad Arham Mirza,Agha Ali Raza*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces PakBBQ, a culturally adapted benchmark dataset for evaluating biases in multilingual LLMs, particularly in low-resource languages like Urdu.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ensure fairness and address bias in LLMs, which are predominantly trained on Western-centric data and often overlook low-resource languages and regional contexts.

Method: PakBBQ dataset created with 214 templates, 17180 QA pairs in English and Urdu across 8 bias dimensions. Evaluates multiple LLMs for disambiguation, language, and question framing effects.

Result: Found a 12% accuracy improvement with disambiguated contexts, stronger counter-bias in Urdu vs English, and reduced stereotypes with negative-framing questions.

Conclusion: Contextualized benchmarks and simple prompt strategies can mitigate LLM biases, emphasizing their importance in low-resource settings.

Abstract: With the widespread adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) across various
applications, it is empirical to ensure their fairness across all user
communities. However, most LLMs are trained and evaluated on Western centric
data, with little attention paid to low-resource languages and regional
contexts. To address this gap, we introduce PakBBQ, a culturally and regionally
adapted extension of the original Bias Benchmark for Question Answering (BBQ)
dataset. PakBBQ comprises over 214 templates, 17180 QA pairs across 8
categories in both English and Urdu, covering eight bias dimensions including
age, disability, appearance, gender, socio-economic status, religious, regional
affiliation, and language formality that are relevant in Pakistan. We evaluate
multiple multilingual LLMs under both ambiguous and explicitly disambiguated
contexts, as well as negative versus non negative question framings. Our
experiments reveal (i) an average accuracy gain of 12\% with disambiguation,
(ii) consistently stronger counter bias behaviors in Urdu than in English, and
(iii) marked framing effects that reduce stereotypical responses when questions
are posed negatively. These findings highlight the importance of contextualized
benchmarks and simple prompt engineering strategies for bias mitigation in low
resource settings.

### [77] [Prompt-Response Semantic Divergence Metrics for Faithfulness Hallucination and Misalignment Detection in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10192)
*Igor Halperin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces Semantic Divergence Metrics (SDM) to detect hallucinations in LLM responses, particularly focusing on unfaithful and arbitrary outputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the pervasive issue of hallucinations in Large Language Models that generate semantically misaligned or nonfactual outputs.

Method: The authors propose a lightweight framework utilizing joint clustering of sentence embeddings, heatmap visualizations, and information-theoretic metrics to measure semantic divergence between prompts and responses.

Result: SDM successfully quantifies Faithfulness Hallucinations through metrics such as Jensen-Shannon divergence and Wasserstein distance, and identifies semantic exploration via KL divergence.

Conclusion: This framework provides a diagnostic tool for classifying LLM response types and enhances the detection of dangerous, unfaithful generative behaviors.

Abstract: The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) is challenged by
hallucinations, critical failure modes where models generate non-factual,
nonsensical or unfaithful text. This paper introduces Semantic Divergence
Metrics (SDM), a novel lightweight framework for detecting Faithfulness
Hallucinations -- events of severe deviations of LLMs responses from input
contexts. We focus on a specific implementation of these LLM errors,
{confabulations, defined as responses that are arbitrary and semantically
misaligned with the user's query. Existing methods like Semantic Entropy test
for arbitrariness by measuring the diversity of answers to a single, fixed
prompt. Our SDM framework improves upon this by being more prompt-aware: we
test for a deeper form of arbitrariness by measuring response consistency not
only across multiple answers but also across multiple, semantically-equivalent
paraphrases of the original prompt. Methodologically, our approach uses joint
clustering on sentence embeddings to create a shared topic space for prompts
and answers. A heatmap of topic co-occurances between prompts and responses can
be viewed as a quantified two-dimensional visualization of the user-machine
dialogue. We then compute a suite of information-theoretic metrics to measure
the semantic divergence between prompts and responses. Our practical score,
$\mathcal{S}_H$, combines the Jensen-Shannon divergence and Wasserstein
distance to quantify this divergence, with a high score indicating a
Faithfulness hallucination. Furthermore, we identify the KL divergence
KL(Answer $||$ Prompt) as a powerful indicator of \textbf{Semantic
Exploration}, a key signal for distinguishing different generative behaviors.
These metrics are further combined into the Semantic Box, a diagnostic
framework for classifying LLM response types, including the dangerous,
confident confabulation.

*Andrew X. Chen,Guillermo Horga,Sean Escola*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study explores using large language models (LLMs) to predict Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) scores for clinical high-risk (CHR) schizophrenia patients using interview transcripts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Monitoring symptoms of CHR schizophrenia patients is crucial for personalized treatments, but current validated tools like BPRS are impractical due to lengthy administration requirements.

Method: The study utilized LLMs to predict BPRS scores from clinical interview transcripts of 409 CHR patients without relying on specific structured interviews.

Result: The zero-shot performance of the LLM predictions showed high concordance with true assessments (median: 0.84, ICC: 0.73), comparable to human rater reliability. LLMs also demonstrated accuracy in multilingual assessments and longitudinal data integration.

Conclusion: LLMs represent a promising tool for improving and standardizing symptom assessment in CHR patients, offering efficiency and reliability even in diverse linguistic and temporal contexts.

Abstract: Patients who are at clinical high risk (CHR) for schizophrenia need close
monitoring of their symptoms to inform appropriate treatments. The Brief
Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) is a validated, commonly used research tool for
measuring symptoms in patients with schizophrenia and other psychotic
disorders; however, it is not commonly used in clinical practice as it requires
a lengthy structured interview. Here, we utilize large language models (LLMs)
to predict BPRS scores from clinical interview transcripts in 409 CHR patients
from the Accelerating Medicines Partnership Schizophrenia (AMP-SCZ) cohort.
Despite the interviews not being specifically structured to measure the BPRS,
the zero-shot performance of the LLM predictions compared to the true
assessment (median concordance: 0.84, ICC: 0.73) approaches human inter- and
intra-rater reliability. We further demonstrate that LLMs have substantial
potential to improve and standardize the assessment of CHR patients via their
accuracy in assessing the BPRS in foreign languages (median concordance: 0.88,
ICC: 0.70), and integrating longitudinal information in a one-shot or few-shot
learning approach.

TL;DR: The paper investigates language change and usage variation in the constructed language Toki Pona using computational and corpus-based methods, finding sociolinguistic-driven evolution akin to natural languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how a constructed language like Toki Pona evolves and varies in its usage over time and across different user communities.

Method: The study employs computational analyses and corpora to examine syntactic preferences and variations in Toki Pona, focusing on fluid word classes and transitivity.

Result: Finds that sociolinguistic factors drive changes and variations in Toki Pona usage, similar to phenomena observed in natural languages.

Conclusion: Constructed languages, such as Toki Pona, are subject to natural sociolinguistic evolution as they are used by communities in practice.

Abstract: This study explores language change and variation in Toki Pona, a constructed
language with approximately 120 core words. Taking a computational and
corpus-based approach, the study examines features including fluid word classes
and transitivity in order to examine (1) changes in preferences of content
words for different syntactic positions over time and (2) variation in usage
across different corpora. The results suggest that sociolinguistic factors
influence Toki Pona in the same way as natural languages, and that even
constructed linguistic systems naturally evolve as communities use them.

*Christian M. Angel,Francis Ferraro*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a strategy termed Inductive Bias Extraction and Matching, which enhances LLM prompt effectiveness by utilizing the model's outputs to refine prompt wording.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Given that slight variations in prompt wording significantly influence LLM responses, understanding and aligning with the model's inductive biases becomes essential.

Method: The strategy involves using the LLM's own outputs as part of the input prompt to better match its inherent inductive bias.

Result: Empirically, the approach improved LLM performance metrics, specifically increasing Likert ratings for classification by up to 19% and ranking by up to 27%.

Conclusion: Leveraging inductive bias through this strategy optimizes prompt engineering and enhances LLM performance.

Abstract: The active research topic of prompt engineering makes it evident that LLMs
are sensitive to small changes in prompt wording. A portion of this can be
ascribed to the inductive bias that is present in the LLM. By using an LLM's
output as a portion of its prompt, we can more easily create satisfactory
wording for prompts. This has the effect of creating a prompt that matches the
inductive bias in model. Empirically, we show that using this Inductive Bias
Extraction and Matching strategy improves LLM Likert ratings used for
classification by up to 19% and LLM Likert ratings used for ranking by up to
27%.

*Gustavo Bonil,Simone Hashiguti,Jhessica Silva,João Gondim,Helena Maia,Nádia Silva,Helio Pedrini,Sandra Avila*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a qualitative framework to investigate biases in Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly focusing on racial and gender biases, and reveals that LLMs replicate and reinforce biased societal narratives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods to detect biases in LLMs rely mostly on quantitative and automated approaches, which fail to capture nuanced biases present in natural language. The paper seeks to offer a complementary qualitative framework to better identify and address these biases.

Method: The study adopts a qualitative discursive framework to analyze short stories generated by LLMs. It focuses on portrayals of Black and white women to explore patterns of gender and racial biases. Manual analysis is used to identify how biases manifest in the narratives.

Result: The analysis showed that LLMs portray Black women as connected to ancestry and resistance, while white women are depicted in self-discovery stories. Attempts by the models to correct biases produced superficial results, leaving problematic meanings intact.

Conclusion: The study highlights the ideological underpinnings of LLMs and their role in perpetuating inequalities. It underscores the necessity for critical and interdisciplinary methods in AI development to create more fair and inclusive systems.

Abstract: With the advance of Artificial Intelligence (AI), Large Language Models
(LLMs) have gained prominence and been applied in diverse contexts. As they
evolve into more sophisticated versions, it is essential to assess whether they
reproduce biases, such as discrimination and racialization, while maintaining
hegemonic discourses. Current bias detection approaches rely mostly on
quantitative, automated methods, which often overlook the nuanced ways in which
biases emerge in natural language. This study proposes a qualitative,
discursive framework to complement such methods. Through manual analysis of
LLM-generated short stories featuring Black and white women, we investigate
gender and racial biases. We contend that qualitative methods such as the one
proposed here are fundamental to help both developers and users identify the
precise ways in which biases manifest in LLM outputs, thus enabling better
conditions to mitigate them. Results show that Black women are portrayed as
tied to ancestry and resistance, while white women appear in self-discovery
processes. These patterns reflect how language models replicate crystalized
discursive representations, reinforcing essentialization and a sense of social
immobility. When prompted to correct biases, models offered superficial
revisions that maintained problematic meanings, revealing limitations in
fostering inclusive narratives. Our results demonstrate the ideological
functioning of algorithms and have significant implications for the ethical use
and development of AI. The study reinforces the need for critical,
interdisciplinary approaches to AI design and deployment, addressing how
LLM-generated discourses reflect and perpetuate inequalities.

Motivation: Address the challenges in peer review caused by increasing submission volumes and reviewer fatigue, while improving the quality and depth of automated reviews.

Method: Integrates a retrieval-augmented pipeline for context generation, supervised fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning with composite rewards to enhance review quality and rating accuracy.

Result: ReviewRL achieves superior performance in review quality and consistency compared to existing methods, according to evaluations on ICLR 2025 papers.

Conclusion: ReviewRL lays the foundation for RL-driven critique generation in scientific research, showing promise for enhancing peer review automation.

Abstract: Peer review is essential for scientific progress but faces growing challenges
due to increasing submission volumes and reviewer fatigue. Existing automated
review approaches struggle with factual accuracy, rating consistency, and
analytical depth, often generating superficial or generic feedback lacking the
insights characteristic of high-quality human reviews. We introduce ReviewRL, a
reinforcement learning framework for generating comprehensive and factually
grounded scientific paper reviews. Our approach combines: (1) an ArXiv-MCP
retrieval-augmented context generation pipeline that incorporates relevant
scientific literature, (2) supervised fine-tuning that establishes foundational
reviewing capabilities, and (3) a reinforcement learning procedure with a
composite reward function that jointly enhances review quality and rating
accuracy. Experiments on ICLR 2025 papers demonstrate that ReviewRL
significantly outperforms existing methods across both rule-based metrics and
model-based quality assessments. ReviewRL establishes a foundational framework
for RL-driven automatic critique generation in scientific discovery,
demonstrating promising potential for future development in this domain. The
implementation of ReviewRL will be released at GitHub.

*Xuan Li,Jialiang Dong,Raymond Wong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces DOTABLER, a framework for semantic document parsing focusing on tables and their context, achieving high precision and outperforming existing models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations in deep semantic analysis of tables and their contextual associations within documents, which restrict advanced tasks like cross-paragraph data interpretation.

Method: The paper proposes DOTABLER, which uses custom datasets, domain-specific fine-tuning of pre-trained models, and a complete parsing pipeline to uncover semantic links between tables and their context.

Result: DOTABLER achieved over 90% Precision and F1 scores in evaluations on real-world PDFs, outshining models like GPT-4o in semantic analysis and document parsing.

Conclusion: DOTABLER effectively advances table-centric semantic document parsing, offering accurate table-context integration and robust domain-specific table retrieval.

Abstract: Documents are core carriers of information and knowl-edge, with broad
applications in finance, healthcare, and scientific research. Tables, as the
main medium for structured data, encapsulate key information and are among the
most critical document components. Existing studies largely focus on
surface-level tasks such as layout analysis, table detection, and data
extraction, lacking deep semantic parsing of tables and their contextual
associations. This limits advanced tasks like cross-paragraph data
interpretation and context-consistent analysis. To address this, we propose
DOTABLER, a table-centric semantic document parsing framework designed to
uncover deep semantic links between tables and their context. DOTABLER
leverages a custom dataset and domain-specific fine-tuning of pre-trained
models, integrating a complete parsing pipeline to identify context segments
semantically tied to tables. Built on this semantic understanding, DOTABLER
implements two core functionalities: table-centric document structure parsing
and domain-specific table retrieval, delivering comprehensive table-anchored
semantic analysis and precise extraction of semantically relevant tables.
Evaluated on nearly 4,000 pages with over 1,000 tables from real-world PDFs,
DOTABLER achieves over 90% Precision and F1 scores, demonstrating superior
performance in table-context semantic analysis and deep document parsing
compared to advanced models such as GPT-4o.

### [84] [Beyond Semantic Understanding: Preserving Collaborative Frequency Components in LLM-based Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10312)
*Minhao Wang,Yunhang He,Cong Xu,Zhangchi Zhu,Wei Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Recommender systems using LLMs often dilute collaborative signals from user data when embedding these signals into LLM layers. FreLLM4Rec addresses this by purifying item embeddings and preserving collaborative information layer-by-layer, achieving notable performance improvements in recommendations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs offer potential for semantically-informed recommendations, but their processing can degrade collaborative signals from users' historical data, limiting performance compared to traditional methods.

Method: FreLLM4Rec combines semantic and collaborative item embeddings, purifies them using a Global Graph Low-Pass Filter (G-LPF), and preserves collaborative signals via Temporal Frequency Modulation (TFM).

Result: Experiments across four benchmark datasets showed up to an 8% improvement in NDCG@10 compared to leading baseline models, highlighting FreLLM4Rec's efficacy.

Conclusion: FreLLM4Rec offers a balanced approach to semantically-informed recommendation, mitigates collaborative signal attenuation, and improves LLM-based system performance, advancing insights into collaborative information processing.

Abstract: Recommender systems in concert with Large Language Models (LLMs) present
promising avenues for generating semantically-informed recommendations.
However, LLM-based recommenders exhibit a tendency to overemphasize semantic
correlations within users' interaction history. When taking pretrained
collaborative ID embeddings as input, LLM-based recommenders progressively
weaken the inherent collaborative signals as the embeddings propagate through
LLM backbones layer by layer, as opposed to traditional Transformer-based
sequential models in which collaborative signals are typically preserved or
even enhanced for state-of-the-art performance. To address this limitation, we
introduce FreLLM4Rec, an approach designed to balance semantic and
collaborative information from a spectral perspective. Item embeddings that
incorporate both semantic and collaborative information are first purified
using a Global Graph Low-Pass Filter (G-LPF) to preliminarily remove irrelevant
high-frequency noise. Temporal Frequency Modulation (TFM) then actively
preserves collaborative signal layer by layer. Note that the collaborative
preservation capability of TFM is theoretically guaranteed by establishing a
connection between the optimal but hard-to-implement local graph fourier
filters and the suboptimal yet computationally efficient frequency-domain
filters. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that
FreLLM4Rec successfully mitigates collaborative signal attenuation and achieves
competitive performance, with improvements of up to 8.00\% in NDCG@10 over the
best baseline. Our findings provide insights into how LLMs process
collaborative information and offer a principled approach for improving
LLM-based recommendation systems.

*Beso Mikaberidze,Teimuraz Saghinadze,Simon Ostermann,Philipp Muller*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces methods to enhance low-performing languages using soft prompts in parameter-efficient fine-tuning for large language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate how parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) via prompt encoders can improve performance for languages where full-model fine-tuning yields poor results.

Method: Proposed the Cross-Prompt Encoder (XPE) using multi-source training on typologically diverse languages and introduced a Dual Soft Prompt mechanism combining encoder-based and standard soft prompts.

Result: Experimental findings on the SIB-200 benchmark demonstrate XPE enhances low-performing language accuracy while hybrid approaches adapt well across multilingual settings.

Conclusion: XPE is ideal for poorly performing languages, while combining encoder-based and standard soft prompts improves adaptability and multilingual performance.

Abstract: Soft prompts have emerged as a powerful alternative to adapters in
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), enabling large language models (LLMs)
to adapt to downstream tasks without architectural changes or parameter
updates. While prior work has focused on stabilizing training via parameter
interaction in small neural prompt encoders, their broader potential for
transfer across languages remains unexplored. In this paper, we demonstrate
that a prompt encoder can play a central role in improving performance on
low-performing languages-those that achieve poor accuracy even under full-model
fine-tuning. We introduce the Cross-Prompt Encoder (XPE), which combines a
lightweight encoding architecture with multi-source training on typologically
diverse languages - a design that enables the model to capture abstract and
transferable patterns across languages. To complement XPE, we propose a Dual
Soft Prompt mechanism that combines an encoder-based prompt with a directly
trained standard soft prompt. This hybrid design proves especially effective
for target languages that benefit from both broadly shared structure and
language-specific alignment. Experiments on the SIB-200 benchmark reveal a
consistent trade-off: XPE is most effective for low-performing languages, while
hybrid variants offer broader adaptability across multilingual settings.

### [86] [Making Qwen3 Think in Korean with Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10355)
*Jungyup Lee,Jemin Kim,Sang Park,SeungJae Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a two-stage fine-tuning approach for adapting the Qwen3 14B language model to think and reason natively in Korean, leveraging supervised fine-tuning and a reinforced learning algorithm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable a large language model to perform advanced logical reasoning and problem-solving tasks natively in Korean while preserving its general language proficiency.

Method: The authors fine-tune the model in two stages: first, using supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with a high-quality Korean reasoning dataset; second, applying reinforcement learning with a custom Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm, aided by an oracle judge model to stabilize training.

Result: The model successfully avoids stability issues in GRPO training, demonstrates incremental learning, and achieves improved results in reasoning-intensive benchmarks like math and coding tasks while internally thinking in Korean.

Conclusion: The two-stage approach effectively enhances the model's Korean reasoning ability and general problem-solving skills, which proves its potential for advanced reasoning tasks in a non-English context.

Abstract: We present a two-stage fine-tuning approach to make the large language model
Qwen3 14B "think" natively in Korean. In the first stage, supervised
fine-tuning (SFT) on a high-quality Korean reasoning dataset establishes a
strong foundation in Korean logical reasoning, yielding notable improvements in
Korean-language tasks and even some gains in general reasoning ability. In the
second stage, we employ reinforcement learning with a customized Group Relative
Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm to further enhance both Korean reasoning
alignment and overall problem-solving performance. We address critical
stability challenges in GRPO training - such as reward hacking and policy
collapse - by introducing an oracle judge model that calibrates the reward
signal. Our approach achieves stable learning (avoiding the collapse observed
in naive GRPO) and leads to steady, incremental performance gains. The final
RL-tuned model demonstrates substantially improved results on advanced
reasoning benchmarks (particularly math and coding tasks) while maintaining
knowledge and language proficiency, successfully conducting its internal
chain-of-thought entirely in Korean.

*Jakub Šmíd,Pavel Přibáň,Pavel Král*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel sequence-to-sequence method using constrained decoding for cross-lingual ABSA, achieving up to 10% improvement without relying on translation tools.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of current cross-lingual ABSA methods in handling complex tasks for low-resource languages, especially their reliance on translation tools and focus on simpler tasks.

Method: A sequence-to-sequence approach employing constrained decoding, eliminating the dependency on external translation tools to deal with compound ABSA tasks.

Result: Achieved up to 10% improvement in cross-lingual ABSA performance, providing an efficient alternative. Found that fine-tuned multilingual LLMs perform comparably, but English-centric LLMs are less effective.

Conclusion: The proposed method expands the potential of cross-lingual ABSA for low-resource languages, making it more practical and capable of handling complex tasks without translation tools.

Abstract: Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) has made significant strides, yet
challenges remain for low-resource languages due to the predominant focus on
English. Current cross-lingual ABSA studies often centre on simpler tasks and
rely heavily on external translation tools. In this paper, we present a novel
sequence-to-sequence method for compound ABSA tasks that eliminates the need
for such tools. Our approach, which uses constrained decoding, improves
cross-lingual ABSA performance by up to 10\%. This method broadens the scope of
cross-lingual ABSA, enabling it to handle more complex tasks and providing a
practical, efficient alternative to translation-dependent techniques.
Furthermore, we compare our approach with large language models (LLMs) and show
that while fine-tuned multilingual LLMs can achieve comparable results,
English-centric LLMs struggle with these tasks.

*Václav Tran,Jakub Šmíd,Jiří Martínek,Ladislav Lenc,Pavel Král*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses the underexplored area of Czech text summarization, especially for historical documents, using advanced large language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle the lack of exploration in Czech text summarization caused by linguistic complexities and the scarcity of annotated datasets.

Method: Utilizing large language models like Mistral and mT5 to achieve state-of-the-art results on modern Czech summarization datasets and introduce a new dataset for historical texts.

Result: Achieved superior performance on the SumeCzech dataset and provided baseline results on a new historical Czech summarization dataset, Posel od Čerchova.

Conclusion: The work significantly advances Czech text summarization with modern and historical datasets, paving the way for research in processing Czech historical texts.

Abstract: Text summarization is the task of shortening a larger body of text into a
concise version while retaining its essential meaning and key information.
While summarization has been significantly explored in English and other
high-resource languages, Czech text summarization, particularly for historical
documents, remains underexplored due to linguistic complexities and a scarcity
of annotated datasets. Large language models such as Mistral and mT5 have
demonstrated excellent results on many natural language processing tasks and
languages. Therefore, we employ these models for Czech summarization, resulting
in two key contributions: (1) achieving new state-of-the-art results on the
modern Czech summarization dataset SumeCzech using these advanced models, and
(2) introducing a novel dataset called Posel od \v{C}erchova for summarization
of historical Czech documents with baseline results. Together, these
contributions provide a great potential for advancing Czech text summarization
and open new avenues for research in Czech historical text processing.

*Jakub Šmíd,Pavel Přibáň,Pavel Král*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel constrained decoding method for sequence-to-sequence models to enhance cross-lingual ABSA, eliminating unreliable translations and achieving superior performance across languages and tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in aspect-based sentiment analysis for low-resource languages and eliminate reliance on external translation tools in cross-lingual settings.

Method: The method employs constrained decoding with sequence-to-sequence models to improve multi-tasking across multiple ABSA tasks without translation tools. Large language models were assessed in zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuning scenarios.

Result: The approach improves cross-lingual performance on complex tasks by 5% on average, boosts multi-tasking results by more than 10%, and surpasses state-of-the-art methods across seven languages and six ABSA tasks.

Conclusion: The study establishes new benchmarks for complex cross-lingual ABSA tasks, offers insights into the potential and limitations of large language models in ABSA, and provides practical guidelines for real-world applications.

Abstract: While aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) has made substantial progress,
challenges remain for low-resource languages, which are often overlooked in
favour of English. Current cross-lingual ABSA approaches focus on limited, less
complex tasks and often rely on external translation tools. This paper
introduces a novel approach using constrained decoding with
sequence-to-sequence models, eliminating the need for unreliable translation
tools and improving cross-lingual performance by 5\% on average for the most
complex task. The proposed method also supports multi-tasking, which enables
solving multiple ABSA tasks with a single model, with constrained decoding
boosting results by more than 10\%.
  We evaluate our approach across seven languages and six ABSA tasks,
surpassing state-of-the-art methods and setting new benchmarks for previously
unexplored tasks. Additionally, we assess large language models (LLMs) in
zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuning scenarios. While LLMs perform poorly in
zero-shot and few-shot settings, fine-tuning achieves competitive results
compared to smaller multilingual models, albeit at the cost of longer training
and inference times.
  We provide practical recommendations for real-world applications, enhancing
the understanding of cross-lingual ABSA methodologies. This study offers
valuable insights into the strengths and limitations of cross-lingual ABSA
approaches, advancing the state-of-the-art in this challenging research domain.

*Chiyu Zhang,Lu Zhou,Xiaogang Xu,Jiafei Wu,Liming Fang,Zhe Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces MDH, a framework combining LLMs and human assistance to clean malicious red-teaming datasets while proposing new jailbreak attack strategies (D-Attack, DH-CoT).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing red-teaming datasets contain unsuitable prompts that challenge the evaluation of harmful outputs. Better detection and cleaning methods are needed.

Method: A hybrid framework (MDH) combines LLMs for annotation with minimal human oversight. It also introduces D-Attack and DH-CoT strategies to enhance jailbreak success.

Result: MDH efficiently cleans datasets while developer messages and proposed strategies boost jailbreak success rates.

Conclusion: The study provides tools and methods for improving malicious dataset detection and enhancing jailbreak attacks, with open-source resources made available.

Abstract: Evaluating jailbreak attacks is challenging when prompts are not overtly
harmful or fail to induce harmful outputs. Unfortunately, many existing
red-teaming datasets contain such unsuitable prompts. To evaluate attacks
accurately, these datasets need to be assessed and cleaned for maliciousness.
However, existing malicious content detection methods rely on either manual
annotation, which is labor-intensive, or large language models (LLMs), which
have inconsistent accuracy in harmful types. To balance accuracy and
efficiency, we propose a hybrid evaluation framework named MDH (Malicious
content Detection based on LLMs with Human assistance) that combines LLM-based
annotation with minimal human oversight, and apply it to dataset cleaning and
detection of jailbroken responses. Furthermore, we find that well-crafted
developer messages can significantly boost jailbreak success, leading us to
propose two new strategies: D-Attack, which leverages context simulation, and
DH-CoT, which incorporates hijacked chains of thought. The Codes, datasets,
judgements, and detection results will be released in github repository:

### [91] [Layer-Wise Perturbations via Sparse Autoencoders for Adversarial Text Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10404)
*Huizhen Shu,Xuying Li,Qirui Wang,Yuji Kosuga,Mengqiu Tian,Zhuo Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces Sparse Feature Perturbation Framework (SFPF), a method to generate adversarial texts for attacking NLP systems by leveraging sparse autoencoders to perturb critical text features while evading defenses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of understanding vulnerabilities and improving the robustness of LLMs by developing adversarial examples.

Method: SFPF uses sparse autoencoders to identify and perturb critical text features selectively. It reconstructs hidden layer representations, clusters features, and perturbs highly activated features for generating adversarial texts that preserve malicious intent.

Result: Adversarial texts generated by SFPF were able to bypass current state-of-the-art defense mechanisms, highlighting vulnerabilities in modern NLP systems. However, its effectiveness is affected by prompts and layers, and further validation is needed for other architectures.

Conclusion: SFPF introduces a novel adversarial text generation method using interpretability techniques. While effective against current models, its generalizability remains uncertain.

Abstract: With the rapid proliferation of Natural Language Processing (NLP), especially
Large Language Models (LLMs), generating adversarial examples to jailbreak LLMs
remains a key challenge for understanding model vulnerabilities and improving
robustness. In this context, we propose a new black-box attack method that
leverages the interpretability of large models. We introduce the Sparse Feature
Perturbation Framework (SFPF), a novel approach for adversarial text generation
that utilizes sparse autoencoders to identify and manipulate critical features
in text. After using the SAE model to reconstruct hidden layer representations,
we perform feature clustering on the successfully attacked texts to identify
features with higher activations. These highly activated features are then
perturbed to generate new adversarial texts. This selective perturbation
preserves the malicious intent while amplifying safety signals, thereby
increasing their potential to evade existing defenses. Our method enables a new
red-teaming strategy that balances adversarial effectiveness with safety
alignment. Experimental results demonstrate that adversarial texts generated by
SFPF can bypass state-of-the-art defense mechanisms, revealing persistent
vulnerabilities in current NLP systems.However, the method's effectiveness
varies across prompts and layers, and its generalizability to other
architectures and larger models remains to be validated.

*Juyuan Wang,Rongchen Zhao,Wei Wei,Yufeng Wang,Mo Yu,Jie Zhou,Jin Xu,Liyan Xu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ComoRAG improves long-narrative comprehension by using iterative reasoning cycles and dynamic memory, outperforming traditional RAG baselines with up to 11% relative gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long narratives are challenging for AI due to their complexity and LLM's limitations in extended context and computational costs. A dynamic retrieval-based approach is needed.

Method: ComoRAG uses iterative reasoning with a dynamic memory workspace that integrates new evidence into a global context, mimicking human cognitive processes.

Result: ComoRAG achieves up to 11% relative performance gains over strong RAG baselines across long-context benchmarks exceeding 200,000 tokens.

Conclusion: ComoRAG offers effective, cognitively-inspired stateful reasoning for retrieval-based long context comprehension, showing promise for complex queries requiring holistic understanding.

Abstract: Narrative comprehension on long stories and novels has been a challenging
domain attributed to their intricate plotlines and entangled, often evolving
relations among characters and entities. Given the LLM's diminished reasoning
over extended context and high computational cost, retrieval-based approaches
remain a pivotal role in practice. However, traditional RAG methods can fall
short due to their stateless, single-step retrieval process, which often
overlooks the dynamic nature of capturing interconnected relations within
long-range context. In this work, we propose ComoRAG, holding the principle
that narrative reasoning is not a one-shot process, but a dynamic, evolving
interplay between new evidence acquisition and past knowledge consolidation,
analogous to human cognition when reasoning with memory-related signals in the
brain. Specifically, when encountering a reasoning impasse, ComoRAG undergoes
iterative reasoning cycles while interacting with a dynamic memory workspace.
In each cycle, it generates probing queries to devise new exploratory paths,
then integrates the retrieved evidence of new aspects into a global memory
pool, thereby supporting the emergence of a coherent context for the query
resolution. Across four challenging long-context narrative benchmarks (200K+
tokens), ComoRAG outperforms strong RAG baselines with consistent relative
gains up to 11% compared to the strongest baseline. Further analysis reveals
that ComoRAG is particularly advantageous for complex queries requiring global
comprehension, offering a principled, cognitively motivated paradigm for
retrieval-based long context comprehension towards stateful reasoning. Our code

*Cai Yang,Yao Dou,David Heineman,Xiaofeng Wu,Wei Xu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper studies the challenges of translating Chinese idioms with existing machine translation systems, introduces IdiomEval for evaluation, and shows that current systems, including GPT-4, often fail in translating idioms correctly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address a gap in the existing research on machine translation of Chinese idioms, as their figurative meanings and historical context make translation challenging.

Method: The authors create IdiomEval, which includes an error taxonomy for Chinese idiom translation, and annotate 900 translation pairs from nine modern translation systems across different domains (web, news, Wikipedia, social media) to analyze the performance of these systems.

Result: The analysis reveals high error rates in idiom translation, even for the best-performing system (GPT-4), which has a 28% error rate. Existing evaluation metrics are found insufficient, and improved models are developed to detect idiom translation errors.

Conclusion: Current machine translation systems struggle with Chinese idioms, highlighting a clear need for improved idiom-specific translation methodologies and evaluation metrics.

Abstract: Idioms, whose figurative meanings usually differ from their literal
interpretations, are common in everyday language, especially in Chinese, where
they often contain historical references and follow specific structural
patterns. Despite recent progress in machine translation with large language
models, little is known about Chinese idiom translation. In this work, we
introduce IdiomEval, a framework with a comprehensive error taxonomy for
Chinese idiom translation. We annotate 900 translation pairs from nine modern
systems, including GPT-4o and Google Translate, across four domains: web, news,
Wikipedia, and social media. We find these systems fail at idiom translation,
producing incorrect, literal, partial, or even missing translations. The
best-performing system, GPT-4, makes errors in 28% of cases. We also find that
existing evaluation metrics measure idiom quality poorly with Pearson
correlation below 0.48 with human ratings. We thus develop improved models that
achieve F$_1$ scores of 0.68 for detecting idiom translation errors.

*Sandeep Reddy,Kabir Khan,Rohit Patil,Ananya Chakraborty,Faizan A. Khan,Swati Kulkarni,Arjun Verma,Neha Singh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper applies economic principles to optimize large language models (LLMs) for computational efficiency, proposing a novel incentive-driven training paradigm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are computationally expensive, and there is a pressing need to make them more resource-efficient while retaining performance.

Method: The authors model LLMs as resource-limited economies where attention heads and neuron blocks allocate computational resources efficiently. They introduce an incentive-driven training method that balances task utility with computation cost by penalizing dense activations.

Result: The proposed method achieves a 40% reduction in FLOPS and lower latency while maintaining performance on tasks like GLUE and WikiText-103. It outperforms post-hoc pruning and produces more interpretable attention patterns.

Conclusion: Economic principles can guide the creation of efficient, adaptive, and transparent LLMs, enabling better performance under computational constraints.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are limited by substantial computational cost.
We introduce a "computational economics" framework that treats an LLM as an
internal economy of resource-constrained agents (attention heads and neuron
blocks) that must allocate scarce computation to maximize task utility. First,
we show empirically that when computation is scarce, standard LLMs reallocate
attention toward high-value tokens while preserving accuracy. Building on this
observation, we propose an incentive-driven training paradigm that augments the
task loss with a differentiable computation cost term, encouraging sparse and
efficient activations. On GLUE (MNLI, STS-B, CoLA) and WikiText-103, the method
yields a family of models that trace a Pareto frontier and consistently
dominate post-hoc pruning; for a similar accuracy we obtain roughly a forty
percent reduction in FLOPS and lower latency, together with more interpretable
attention patterns. These results indicate that economic principles offer a
principled route to designing efficient, adaptive, and more transparent LLMs
under strict resource constraints.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DiFaR is a framework for improving textual rationales from large vision-language models to enhance multimodal misinformation detectors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in current rationale generation for misinformation detection, including insufficient diversity, hallucinations, and irrelevant content.

Method: DiFaR utilizes five chain-of-thought prompts alongside a lightweight post-hoc filtering module for selecting relevant and factual sentences.

Result: DiFaR outperformed baseline methods by up to 5.9% and improved existing detectors by up to 8.7%, with both automatic and human evaluations confirming its superior rationale quality.

Conclusion: DiFaR provides a significant improvement in the quality of generated rationales, supporting advancements in misinformation detection.

Abstract: Generating textual rationales from large vision-language models (LVLMs) to
support trainable multimodal misinformation detectors has emerged as a
promising paradigm. However, its effectiveness is fundamentally limited by
three core challenges: (i) insufficient diversity in generated rationales, (ii)
factual inaccuracies due to hallucinations, and (iii) irrelevant or conflicting
content that introduces noise. We introduce DiFaR, a detector-agnostic
framework that produces diverse, factual, and relevant rationales to enhance
misinformation detection. DiFaR employs five chain-of-thought prompts to elicit
varied reasoning traces from LVLMs and incorporates a lightweight post-hoc
filtering module to select rationale sentences based on sentence-level
factuality and relevance scores. Extensive experiments on four popular
benchmarks demonstrate that DiFaR outperforms four baseline categories by up to
5.9% and boosts existing detectors by as much as 8.7%. Both automatic metrics
and human evaluations confirm that DiFaR significantly improves rationale
quality across all three dimensions.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper empirically investigates the trade-off between privacy and explainability in NLP, using Differential Privacy and Post-hoc Explainability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is limited research on whether explainability and privacy can coexist or conflict within NLP, despite their growing importance.

Method: The study employs empirical methods focusing on Differential Privacy and Post-hoc Explainability to explore the relationship between privacy and explainability in NLP.

Result: The relationship between privacy and explainability is complex and influenced by factors such as task type, text privatization, and explainability methods.

Conclusion: Privacy and explainability have the potential to coexist, and the paper provides practical recommendations for pursuing this challenge in future NLP research.

Abstract: In the study of trustworthy Natural Language Processing (NLP), a number of
important research fields have emerged, including that of
\textit{explainability} and \textit{privacy}. While research interest in both
explainable and privacy-preserving NLP has increased considerably in recent
years, there remains a lack of investigation at the intersection of the two.
This leaves a considerable gap in understanding of whether achieving
\textit{both} explainability and privacy is possible, or whether the two are at
odds with each other. In this work, we conduct an empirical investigation into
the privacy-explainability trade-off in the context of NLP, guided by the
popular overarching methods of \textit{Differential Privacy} (DP) and Post-hoc
Explainability. Our findings include a view into the intricate relationship
between privacy and explainability, which is formed by a number of factors,
including the nature of the downstream task and choice of the text
privatization and explainability method. In this, we highlight the potential
for privacy and explainability to co-exist, and we summarize our findings in a
collection of practical recommendations for future work at this important
intersection.

*Huyu Wu,Meng Tang,Xinhan Zheng,Haiyun Jiang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study analyzes the issue of text dominance in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), identifying causes and proposing metrics and solutions to mitigate this imbalance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to address the problem of text dominance in MLLMs, which underutilizes non-textual modalities like images, videos, and audio, hampering equitable performance across diverse data modalities.

Method: The authors introduced two evaluation metrics—Modality Dominance Index (MDI) and Attention Efficiency Index (AEI)—to systematically study text dominance in MLLMs. They also proposed a token compression method to rebalance model attention.

Result: Text dominance was found to be pervasive across all tested modalities due to token redundancy, fusion architecture, and task formulations. The token compression method significantly reduced MDI from 10.23 to 0.86 in LLaVA-7B.

Conclusion: The study provides metrics, insights, and methods to address text dominance, laying the groundwork for creating more balanced and inclusive multimodal language models.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities across a diverse range of multimodal tasks. However, these models
suffer from a core problem known as text dominance: they depend heavily on text
for their inference, while underutilizing other modalities. While prior work
has acknowledged this phenomenon in vision-language tasks, often attributing it
to data biases or model architectures. In this paper, we conduct the first
systematic investigation of text dominance across diverse data modalities,
including images, videos, audio, time-series, and graphs. To measure this
imbalance, we propose two evaluation metrics: the Modality Dominance Index
(MDI) and the Attention Efficiency Index (AEI). Our comprehensive analysis
reveals that text dominance is both significant and pervasive across all tested
modalities. Our in-depth analysis identifies three underlying causes: attention
dilution from severe token redundancy in non-textual modalities, the influence
of fusion architecture design, and task formulations that implicitly favor
textual inputs. Furthermore, we propose a simple token compression method that
effectively rebalances model attention. Applying this method to LLaVA-7B, for
instance, drastically reduces its MDI from 10.23 to a well-balanced value of
0.86. Our analysis and methodological framework offer a foundation for the
development of more equitable and comprehensive multimodal language models.

mechanistic interpretability research on large language models. The need for
widespread accessibility of LLM interpretability infrastructure in Europe
drives this initiative to democratize advanced model analysis capabilities for

Ansbach University of Applied Sciences and interconnected with partner
institutions, enabling remote model inspection via the NNsight API. A
structured pilot study involving 16 researchers from across Europe evaluated
the platform's technical performance, usability, and scientific utility. Users
conducted interventions such as activation patching, causal tracing, and
representation analysis on models including GPT-2 and DeepSeek-R1-70B. The
study revealed a gradual increase in user engagement, stable platform
performance throughout, and a positive reception of the remote experimentation
capabilities. It also marked the starting point for building a user community
around the platform. Identified limitations such as prolonged download
durations for activation data as well as intermittent execution interruptions
are addressed in the roadmap for future development. This initiative marks a
significant step towards widespread accessibility of LLM interpretability
infrastructure in Europe and lays the groundwork for broader deployment,
expanded tooling, and sustained community collaboration in mechanistic

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address societal underestimation of sign language and the resulting communication barriers experienced by deaf and hard-of-hearing individuals, emphasizing the need for improved translation methods.

Method: The method integrates transformer architecture with STGCN-LSTM graph-based techniques for gloss-free sign language translation, exploring various fusion strategies to achieve enhanced translation accuracy.

Result: Their approach surpasses state-of-the-art BLEU-4 scores across multiple sign language datasets, achieves significant performance improvements, and introduces benchmarking on the BornilDB v1.0 dataset for the first time.

Conclusion: By improving gloss-free sign language translation, the paper sets new benchmarks for communication accessibility, benefiting the deaf and hard-of-hearing and paving the way for future research developments.

Abstract: Millions of individuals worldwide are affected by deafness and hearing
impairment. Sign language serves as a sophisticated means of communication for
the deaf and hard of hearing. However, in societies that prioritize spoken
languages, sign language often faces underestimation, leading to communication
barriers and social exclusion. The Continuous Bangla Sign Language Translation
project aims to address this gap by enhancing translation methods. While recent
approaches leverage transformer architecture for state-of-the-art results, our
method integrates graph-based methods with the transformer architecture. This
fusion, combining transformer and STGCN-LSTM architectures, proves more
effective in gloss-free translation. Our contributions include architectural
fusion, exploring various fusion strategies, and achieving a new
state-of-the-art performance on diverse sign language datasets, namely
RWTH-PHOENIX-2014T, CSL-Daily, How2Sign, and BornilDB v1.0. Our approach
demonstrates superior performance compared to current translation outcomes
across all datasets, showcasing notable improvements of BLEU-4 scores of 4.01,
2.07, and 0.5, surpassing those of GASLT, GASLT and slt_how2sign in
RWTH-PHOENIX-2014T, CSL-Daily, and How2Sign, respectively. Also, we introduce
benchmarking on the BornilDB v1.0 dataset for the first time. Our method sets a
benchmark for future research, emphasizing the importance of gloss-free
translation to improve communication accessibility for the deaf and hard of
hearing.

### [101] [Learning from Natural Language Feedback for Personalized Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10695)
*Alireza Salemi,Hamed Zamani*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces VAC, a framework using natural language feedback (NLF) instead of scalar rewards for better personalization in language models, achieving improved results in question answering tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scalar rewards used for personalizing large language models are often weak and non-instructive, leading to inefficiencies in learning and lower-quality personalization.

Method: The authors propose VAC, a framework that uses natural language feedback (NLF) conditioned on user profiles and question narratives to supervise and refine personalized response generation iteratively.

Result: VAC shows consistent and significant improvements over state-of-the-art results in the LaMP-QA benchmark across diverse domains, with human evaluations confirming superior response quality.

Conclusion: Replacing scalar rewards with NLF can effectively optimize personalized question answering tasks, enhancing both efficiency and quality of responses in large language models.

Abstract: Personalization is crucial for enhancing both the effectiveness and user
satisfaction of language technologies, particularly in information-seeking
tasks like question answering. Current approaches for personalizing large
language models (LLMs) often rely on retrieval-augmented generation (RAG),
followed by reinforcement learning with scalar reward signals to teach models
how to use retrieved personal context. We believe that these scalar rewards
sometimes provide weak, non-instructive feedback, limiting learning efficiency
and personalization quality. We introduce VAC, a novel framework for
personalized response generation that replaces scalar rewards with natural
language feedback (NLF) that are generated conditioned on the user profiles and
the question narratives. NLF serves as a rich and actionable supervision
signal, allowing the policy model to iteratively refine its outputs and
internalize effective personalization strategies. Training alternates between
optimizing the feedback model and fine-tuning the policy model on the improved
responses, resulting in a policy model that no longer requires feedback at
inference. Evaluation on the LaMP-QA benchmark that consists of three diverse
domains demonstrates consistent and significant improvements over the
state-of-the-art results. Human evaluations further confirm the superior
quality of the generated responses. These results demonstrate that NLF provides
more effective signals for optimizing personalized question answering.

*Xiangqi Jin,Yuxuan Wang,Yifeng Gao,Zichen Wen,Biqing Qi,Dongrui Liu,Linfeng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces ICE, a novel prompting strategy for diffusion language models that leverages bidirectional attention and early exits to boost both accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation lies in overcoming the limitations of prefix-only prompting and sequential generation in traditional large language models by leveraging the bidirectional capabilities of diffusion language models.

Method: The paper proposes the ICE framework, which incorporates in-place prompting during iterative refinement and a confidence-aware early exit mechanism.

Result: ICE achieves up to a 17.29% accuracy improvement with a 4.12x speedup on GSM8K, and up to a 276.67x acceleration on MMLU while maintaining competitive performance.

Conclusion: ICE demonstrates that in-place prompting with bidirectional diffusion models and early exits can substantially enhance language model efficiency and effectiveness, addressing the limitations of traditional prompting paradigms.

Abstract: Despite large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success, their
prefix-only prompting paradigm and sequential generation process offer limited
flexibility for bidirectional information. Diffusion large language models
(dLLMs) present new opportunities through their bidirectional attention
mechanisms and iterative refinement processes, enabling more flexible in-place
prompting strategies. We introduce ICE (In-Place Chain-of-Thought Prompting
with Early Exit), a novel framework that transforms prefix-only prompting into
in-place prompting specifically designed for dLLMs. ICE integrates in-place
prompts directly within masked token positions during iterative refinement and
employs a confidence-aware early exit mechanism to significantly reduce
computational overhead. Extensive experiments demonstrate ICE's effectiveness,
achieving up to 17.29% accuracy improvement with 4.12$\times$ speedup on GSM8K,
and up to 276.67$\times$ acceleration on MMLU while maintaining competitive
performance.

Abstract: Novelty assessment is a central yet understudied aspect of peer review,
particularly in high volume fields like NLP where reviewer capacity is
increasingly strained. We present a structured approach for automated novelty
evaluation that models expert reviewer behavior through three stages: content
extraction from submissions, retrieval and synthesis of related work, and
structured comparison for evidence based assessment. Our method is informed by
a large scale analysis of human written novelty reviews and captures key
patterns such as independent claim verification and contextual reasoning.
Evaluated on 182 ICLR 2025 submissions with human annotated reviewer novelty
assessments, the approach achieves 86.5% alignment with human reasoning and
75.3% agreement on novelty conclusions - substantially outperforming existing
LLM based baselines. The method produces detailed, literature aware analyses
and improves consistency over ad hoc reviewer judgments. These results
highlight the potential for structured LLM assisted approaches to support more
rigorous and transparent peer review without displacing human expertise. Data

*Jim Dilkes,Vahid Yazdanpanah,Sebastian Stein*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The authors propose MS-GRPO, an algorithm that enhances smaller LLMs' performance in multi-step decision-making tasks, achieving significant improvements even against larger models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models are computationally expensive, and smaller models need improvement for efficient sequential decision-making tasks.

Method: They introduced MS-GRPO, leveraging TSMG and LAP frameworks, which assigns cumulative rewards to every step and utilizes advantage-weighted sampling for training.

Result: Post-training a 3B parameter model with the method outperformed a 72B parameter baseline by 50% on Frozen Lake.

Conclusion: Post-training with MS-GRPO is an effective and resource-efficient way to improve smaller LLMs for multi-step decision-making, reducing reliance on larger models.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) show potential as sequential decision-making
agents, but their application is often limited due to a reliance on large,
computationally expensive models. This creates a need to improve smaller
models, yet existing post-training methods are designed for single-turn
interactions and cannot handle credit assignment in multi-step agentic tasks.
To address this, we introduce Multi-Step Group-Relative Policy Optimization
(MS-GRPO), a new algorithm for post-training LLM agents, grounded in formal
Text-Mediated Stochastic Game (TSMG) and Language-Agent Policy (LAP)
frameworks. For credit assignment, MS-GRPO attributes the entire cumulative
episode reward to each individual episode step. We supplement this algorithm
with a novel absolute-advantage-weighted episode sampling strategy that we show
improves training performance. We evaluate our approach by post-training a
3-billion parameter model on Snake and Frozen Lake. Our experiments demonstrate
that the method is effective in improving decision-making performance: our
post-trained 3B parameter model outperforms a 72B parameter baseline by 50% on
the Frozen Lake task. This work demonstrates that targeted post-training is a
practical and efficient alternative to relying on model scale for creating
sequential decision-making agents using LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the shortage of mental health professionals and improve mental health support by integrating reasoning mechanisms into psychological applications using LLMs.

Method: Develop a data synthesis pipeline generating 75k psychological questions with rationales and 73k empathetic dialogues, employ a hybrid training approach combining GRPO for challenging samples and SFT for general psychological expertise.

Result: Psyche-R1 demonstrated its efficacy across psychological benchmarks, achieving performance comparable to significantly larger models like DeepSeek-R1.

Conclusion: Psyche-R1 successfully combines reasoning, empathy, and psychological expertise to address psychological applications, providing effective and scalable solutions to mental health challenges.

Abstract: Amidst a shortage of qualified mental health professionals, the integration
of large language models (LLMs) into psychological applications offers a
promising way to alleviate the growing burden of mental health disorders.
Recent reasoning-augmented LLMs have achieved remarkable performance in
mathematics and programming, while research in the psychological domain has
predominantly emphasized emotional support and empathetic dialogue, with
limited attention to reasoning mechanisms that are beneficial to generating
reliable responses. Therefore, in this paper, we propose Psyche-R1, the first
Chinese psychological LLM that jointly integrates empathy, psychological
expertise, and reasoning, built upon a novel data curation pipeline.
Specifically, we design a comprehensive data synthesis pipeline that produces
over 75k high-quality psychological questions paired with detailed rationales,
generated through chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning and iterative
prompt-rationale optimization, along with 73k empathetic dialogues.
Subsequently, we employ a hybrid training strategy wherein challenging samples
are identified through a multi-LLM cross-selection strategy for group relative
policy optimization (GRPO) to improve reasoning ability, while the remaining
data is used for supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to enhance empathetic response
generation and psychological domain knowledge. Extensive experiment results
demonstrate the effectiveness of the Psyche-R1 across several psychological
benchmarks, where our 7B Psyche-R1 achieves comparable results to 671B
DeepSeek-R1.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing automated interpreting quality assessment methods lack sufficient examination of language use quality, struggle due to data scarcity and imbalance, and fail to explain predictions.

Method: The authors developed a multi-dimensional modeling framework that uses feature engineering, data augmentation, and explainable machine learning with transparent features and Shapley Value analysis.

Result: The framework demonstrated strong predictive performance on an English-Chinese interpreting dataset, identifying BLEURT and CometKiwi for fidelity, pause-related features for fluency, and Chinese-specific phraseological diversity metrics for language use.

Conclusion: The transparent and explainable approach serves as a scalable alternative to human evaluation, providing diagnostic feedback and aiding self-regulated learning beyond mere automated scores.

Abstract: Recent advancements in machine learning have spurred growing interests in
automated interpreting quality assessment. Nevertheless, existing research
suffers from insufficient examination of language use quality, unsatisfactory
modeling effectiveness due to data scarcity and imbalance, and a lack of
efforts to explain model predictions. To address these gaps, we propose a
multi-dimensional modeling framework that integrates feature engineering, data
augmentation, and explainable machine learning. This approach prioritizes
explainability over ``black box'' predictions by utilizing only
construct-relevant, transparent features and conducting Shapley Value (SHAP)
analysis. Our results demonstrate strong predictive performance on a novel
English-Chinese consecutive interpreting dataset, identifying BLEURT and
CometKiwi scores to be the strongest predictive features for fidelity,
pause-related features for fluency, and Chinese-specific phraseological
diversity metrics for language use. Overall, by placing particular emphasis on
explainability, we present a scalable, reliable, and transparent alternative to
traditional human evaluation, facilitating the provision of detailed diagnostic
feedback for learners and supporting self-regulated learning advantages not
afforded by automated scores in isolation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper explores leveraging large language models (LLMs) as simulators for reinforcement learning (RL) search tasks, reducing reliance on external search engines. 


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the high dependence on costly external search mechanisms in RL tasks by investigating LLMs' capabilities as internal knowledge simulation tools.

Method: The paper introduces Self-Search, which uses structured prompting and sampling to evaluate LLMs' intrinsic search abilities. This is further extended through a framework called Self-Search RL (SSRL), which enhances knowledge refinement with rewards.

Result: The model achieved strong performance in search-driven RL tasks, reducing the need for external tools and enabling stable and cost-effective training. It also improved knowledge utilization and reduced hallucination.

Conclusion: LLMs can be effectively leveraged for efficient RL agent training, showing potential to scale RL tasks while integrating well with external tools if needed.

Abstract: We investigate the potential of large language models (LLMs) to serve as
efficient simulators for agentic search tasks in reinforcement learning (RL),
thereby reducing dependence on costly interactions with external search
engines. To this end, we first quantify the intrinsic search capability of LLMs
via structured prompting and repeated sampling, which we term Self-Search. Our
results reveal that LLMs exhibit strong scaling behavior with respect to the
inference budget, achieving high pass@k on question-answering benchmarks,
including the challenging BrowseComp task. Building on these observations, we
introduce Self-Search RL (SSRL), which enhances LLMs' Self-Search capability
through format-based and rule-based rewards. SSRL enables models to iteratively
refine their knowledge utilization internally, without requiring access to
external tools. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that SSRL-trained policy
models provide a cost-effective and stable environment for search-driven RL
training, reducing reliance on external search engines and facilitating robust
sim-to-real transfer. We draw the following conclusions: 1) LLMs possess world
knowledge that can be effectively elicited to achieve high performance; 2) SSRL
demonstrates the potential of leveraging internal knowledge to reduce
hallucination; 3) SSRL-trained models integrate seamlessly with external search
engines without additional effort. Our findings highlight the potential of LLMs
to support more scalable RL agent training.

### [109] [Stochastic-based Patch Filtering for Few-Shot Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10066)
*Javier Rodenas,Eduardo Aguilar,Petia Radeva*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Stochastic-based Patch Filtering for Few-Shot Learning (SPFF) to improve food image classification by focusing on class-specific features through patch filtering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Few-shot learning struggles with food image classification due to visual complexity, variability, and irrelevant features.

Method: SPFF uses stochastic filtering of patch embeddings, discarding less class-relevant patches to construct a similarity matrix for classification.

Result: SPFF shows significant improvements in few-shot benchmarks like Food-101, VireoFood-172, and UECFood-256 compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: SPFF enhances few-shot food image classification by addressing class-specific feature focus issues and achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks.

Abstract: Food images present unique challenges for few-shot learning models due to
their visual complexity and variability. For instance, a pasta dish might
appear with various garnishes on different plates and in diverse lighting
conditions and camera perspectives. This problem leads to losing focus on the
most important elements when comparing the query with support images, resulting
in misclassification. To address this issue, we propose Stochastic-based Patch
Filtering for Few-Shot Learning (SPFF) to attend to the patch embeddings that
show greater correlation with the class representation. The key concept of SPFF
involves the stochastic filtering of patch embeddings, where patches less
similar to the class-aware embedding are more likely to be discarded. With
patch embedding filtered according to the probability of appearance, we use a
similarity matrix that quantifies the relationship between the query image and
its respective support images. Through a qualitative analysis, we demonstrate
that SPFF effectively focuses on patches where class-specific food features are
most prominent while successfully filtering out non-relevant patches. We
validate our approach through extensive experiments on few-shot classification
benchmarks: Food-101, VireoFood-172 and UECFood-256, outperforming the existing
SoA methods.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning holds the promise of eliminating the need for manual
data annotation, enabling models to scale effortlessly to massive datasets and
larger architectures. By not being tailored to specific tasks or domains, this
training paradigm has the potential to learn visual representations from
diverse sources, ranging from natural to aerial images -- using a single
algorithm. This technical report introduces DINOv3, a major milestone toward
realizing this vision by leveraging simple yet effective strategies. First, we
leverage the benefit of scaling both dataset and model size by careful data
preparation, design, and optimization. Second, we introduce a new method called
Gram anchoring, which effectively addresses the known yet unsolved issue of
dense feature maps degrading during long training schedules. Finally, we apply
post-hoc strategies that further enhance our models' flexibility with respect
to resolution, model size, and alignment with text. As a result, we present a
versatile vision foundation model that outperforms the specialized state of the
art across a broad range of settings, without fine-tuning. DINOv3 produces
high-quality dense features that achieve outstanding performance on various
vision tasks, significantly surpassing previous self- and weakly-supervised
foundation models. We also share the DINOv3 suite of vision models, designed to
advance the state of the art on a wide spectrum of tasks and data by providing

Conclusion: The approach successfully demonstrates generalizable morphing attack detection and textual prediction capabilities using SOTA pre-trained models and CLIP in zero-shot evaluation settings.

Abstract: Morphing attack detection has become an essential component of face
recognition systems for ensuring a reliable verification scenario. In this
paper, we present a multimodal learning approach that can provide a textual
description of morphing attack detection. We first show that zero-shot
evaluation of the proposed framework using Contrastive Language-Image
Pretraining (CLIP) can yield not only generalizable morphing attack detection,
but also predict the most relevant text snippet. We present an extensive
analysis of ten different textual prompts that include both short and long
textual prompts. These prompts are engineered by considering the human
understandable textual snippet. Extensive experiments were performed on a face
morphing dataset that was developed using a publicly available face biometric
dataset. We present an evaluation of SOTA pre-trained neural networks together
with the proposed framework in the zero-shot evaluation of five different
morphing generation techniques that are captured in three different mediums.

TL;DR: This paper presents a novel interpretable method for deciphering Oracle Bone Script (OBS) using Large Vision-Language Models and introduces a new dataset for training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The difficulty of deciphering the Oracle Bone Script due to its rarity, abstractness, and pictographic diversity necessitated the development of more generalizable and interpretable methods.

Method: The study introduces a progressive training strategy and Radical-Pictographic Dual Matching approach. It also proposes a new dataset with annotated Chinese characters for model training.

Result: The experimental results demonstrate state-of-the-art Top-10 accuracy and enhanced zero-shot decipherment capabilities.

Conclusion: The proposed method not only improves decipherment accuracy but also enhances interpretability and provides potential benefits for digital humanities and historical research. The dataset and code are made available for further use.

Abstract: As the oldest mature writing system, Oracle Bone Script (OBS) has long posed
significant challenges for archaeological decipherment due to its rarity,
abstractness, and pictographic diversity. Current deep learning-based methods
have made exciting progress on the OBS decipherment task, but existing
approaches often ignore the intricate connections between glyphs and the
semantics of OBS. This results in limited generalization and interpretability,
especially when addressing zero-shot settings and undeciphered OBS. To this
end, we propose an interpretable OBS decipherment method based on Large
Vision-Language Models, which synergistically combines radical analysis and
pictograph-semantic understanding to bridge the gap between glyphs and meanings
of OBS. Specifically, we propose a progressive training strategy that guides
the model from radical recognition and analysis to pictographic analysis and
mutual analysis, thus enabling reasoning from glyph to meaning. We also design
a Radical-Pictographic Dual Matching mechanism informed by the analysis
results, significantly enhancing the model's zero-shot decipherment
performance. To facilitate model training, we propose the Pictographic
Decipherment OBS Dataset, which comprises 47,157 Chinese characters annotated
with OBS images and pictographic analysis texts. Experimental results on public
benchmarks demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art Top-10
accuracy and superior zero-shot decipherment capabilities. More importantly,
our model delivers logical analysis processes, possibly providing
archaeologically valuable reference results for undeciphered OBS, and thus has
potential applications in digital humanities and historical research. The
dataset and code will be released in https://github.com/PKXX1943/PD-OBS.

Motivation: To address the labor-intensive and challenging manual placement of fiducial points on TBDXA scans and leverage automated methods to enhance body composition analysis.

Method: The authors create a deep learning model trained on 1,683 manually annotated TBDXA scans for automated fiducial point placement, achieving high accuracy on external testing datasets. They analyze these points in relation to health biomarkers using shape and appearance modeling (SAM).

Result: The method achieves a 99.5% accuracy in keypoint placement on benchmark datasets. It further validates associations between SAM features and health biomarkers, reinforcing known correlations and revealing new hypotheses.

Conclusion: The proposed deep learning method enhances precision in fiducial point placement on TBDXA scans and offers valuable tools for exploring body composition’s relationships with health markers, contributing to future health research.

Abstract: Total-body dual X-ray absorptiometry (TBDXA) imaging is a relatively low-cost
whole-body imaging modality, widely used for body composition assessment. We
develop and validate a deep learning method for automatic fiducial point
placement on TBDXA scans using 1,683 manually-annotated TBDXA scans. The method
achieves 99.5% percentage correct keypoints in an external testing dataset. To
demonstrate the value for shape and appearance modeling (SAM), our method is
used to place keypoints on 35,928 scans for five different TBDXA imaging modes,
then associations with health markers are tested in two cohorts not used for
SAM model generation using two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests. SAM feature
distributions associated with health biomarkers are shown to corroborate
existing evidence and generate new hypotheses on body composition and shape's
relationship to various frailty, metabolic, inflammation, and cardiometabolic
health markers. Evaluation scripts, model weights, automatic point file

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents a novel method called Multimodal Attention-based Normalizing Flow (MANGO) for explicit, interpretable multimodal fusion learning, outperforming state-of-the-art methods across various tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal learning methods struggle with comprehending complex structures and correlations due to their reliance on implicit attention mechanisms.

Method: The proposed approach introduces a new Invertible Cross-Attention (ICA) layer and three mechanisms (MMCA, IMCA, LICA), leveraging Normalizing Flow to address feature interaction and scalability in multimodal data.

Result: The MANGO approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in semantic segmentation, image-to-image translation, and movie genre classification.

Conclusion: The study underscores the efficacy of explicit attention mechanisms combined with Normalizing Flow in advancing multimodal learning tasks effectively.

Abstract: Multimodal learning has gained much success in recent years. However, current
multimodal fusion methods adopt the attention mechanism of Transformers to
implicitly learn the underlying correlation of multimodal features. As a
result, the multimodal model cannot capture the essential features of each
modality, making it difficult to comprehend complex structures and correlations
of multimodal inputs. This paper introduces a novel Multimodal Attention-based
Normalizing Flow (MANGO) approach\footnote{The source code of this work will be
publicly available.} to developing explicit, interpretable, and tractable
multimodal fusion learning. In particular, we propose a new Invertible
Cross-Attention (ICA) layer to develop the Normalizing Flow-based Model for
multimodal data. To efficiently capture the complex, underlying correlations in
multimodal data in our proposed invertible cross-attention layer, we propose
three new cross-attention mechanisms: Modality-to-Modality Cross-Attention
(MMCA), Inter-Modality Cross-Attention (IMCA), and Learnable Inter-Modality
Cross-Attention (LICA). Finally, we introduce a new Multimodal Attention-based
Normalizing Flow to enable the scalability of our proposed method to
high-dimensional multimodal data. Our experimental results on three different
multimodal learning tasks, i.e., semantic segmentation, image-to-image
translation, and movie genre classification, have illustrated the
state-of-the-art (SoTA) performance of the proposed approach.

### [115] [Improving watermelon (Citrullus lanatus) disease classification with generative artificial intelligence (GenAI)-based synthetic and real-field images via a custom EfficientNetV2-L model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10156)
*Nitin Rai,Nathan S. Boyd,Gary E. Vallad,Arnold W. Schumann*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This study investigates using a mix of real and synthetic images to improve watermelon disease classification using EfficientNetV2-L, finding that a hybrid approach enhances model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of limited real-world data in crop disease diagnosis and explore the potential of synthetic images from generative AI in improving classification models.

Method: The EfficientNetV2-L model was trained on datasets with different combinations of real and synthetic images, using fine-tuning and transfer learning techniques. The treatments included various real-to-synthetic image ratios and additional variability-enhancing random images.

Result: The hybrid datasets (1:1 and 1:10 real-to-synthetic ratios) significantly outperformed models trained on only real or synthetic images, achieving a weighted F1-score of 1.00 compared to 0.65 with only real images.

Conclusion: Combining real and synthetic images in specific ratios boosts model performance and generalizability for crop disease classification, highlighting the value of a hybrid data approach.

Abstract: The current advancements in generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) models
have paved the way for new possibilities for generating high-resolution
synthetic images, thereby offering a promising alternative to traditional image
acquisition for training computer vision models in agriculture. In the context
of crop disease diagnosis, GenAI models are being used to create synthetic
images of various diseases, potentially facilitating model creation and
reducing the dependency on resource-intensive in-field data collection.
However, limited research has been conducted on evaluating the effectiveness of
integrating real with synthetic images to improve disease classification
performance. Therefore, this study aims to investigate whether combining a
limited number of real images with synthetic images can enhance the prediction
accuracy of an EfficientNetV2-L model for classifying watermelon
\textit{(Citrullus lanatus)} diseases. The training dataset was divided into
five treatments: H0 (only real images), H1 (only synthetic images), H2 (1:1
real-to-synthetic), H3 (1:10 real-to-synthetic), and H4 (H3 + random images to
improve variability and model generalization). All treatments were trained
using a custom EfficientNetV2-L architecture with enhanced fine-tuning and
transfer learning techniques. Models trained on H2, H3, and H4 treatments
demonstrated high precision, recall, and F1-score metrics. Additionally, the
weighted F1-score increased from 0.65 (on H0) to 1.00 (on H3-H4) signifying
that the addition of a small number of real images with a considerable volume
of synthetic images improved model performance and generalizability. Overall,
this validates the findings that synthetic images alone cannot adequately
substitute for real images; instead, both must be used in a hybrid manner to
maximize model performance for crop disease classification.

*Aaditya Baranwal,Abdul Mueez,Jason Voelker,Guneet Bhatia,Shruti Vyas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper focuses on improving vision-language models (VLMs) for niche areas like industrial spill detection using synthetic data generation and parameter-efficient fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address performance degradation in niche, safety-critical domains like spill detection, caused by the scarcity of annotated real-world data.

Method: Develop a synthetic data pipeline (SynSpill dataset) and use Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) to adapt VLMs and object detectors.

Result: Synthetic data significantly boosts the performance of VLMs and traditional detectors like YOLO and DETR for spill detection.

Conclusion: High-quality synthetic data bridges gaps in low-data, safety-critical tasks and makes scalable, cost-effective vision system deployment feasible for industries.

Abstract: Large-scale Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have transformed general-purpose
visual recognition through strong zero-shot capabilities. However, their
performance degrades significantly in niche, safety-critical domains such as
industrial spill detection, where hazardous events are rare, sensitive, and
difficult to annotate. This scarcity -- driven by privacy concerns, data
sensitivity, and the infrequency of real incidents -- renders conventional
fine-tuning of detectors infeasible for most industrial settings.
  We address this challenge by introducing a scalable framework centered on a
high-quality synthetic data generation pipeline. We demonstrate that this
synthetic corpus enables effective Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) of
VLMs and substantially boosts the performance of state-of-the-art object
detectors such as YOLO and DETR. Notably, in the absence of synthetic data
(SynSpill dataset), VLMs still generalize better to unseen spill scenarios than
these detectors. When SynSpill is used, both VLMs and detectors achieve marked
improvements, with their performance becoming comparable.
  Our results underscore that high-fidelity synthetic data is a powerful means
to bridge the domain gap in safety-critical applications. The combination of
synthetic generation and lightweight adaptation offers a cost-effective,
scalable pathway for deploying vision systems in industrial environments where
real data is scarce/impractical to obtain.

### [117] [EntropyGS: An Efficient Entropy Coding on 3D Gaussian Splatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10227)
*Yuning Huang,Jiahao Pang,Fengqing Zhu,Dong Tian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses storage and compression challenges in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) by analyzing Gaussian attributes, proposing an entropy coding method (EntropyGS) which achieves significant data compression without compromising rendering quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To solve storage, transmission, and compression challenges arising from the separation of Gaussian creation and view rendering tasks in 3D Gaussian Splatting.

Method: Analyzed statistical properties of 3DGS Gaussian attributes, revealing distribution patterns, and proposed EntropyGS, a factorized and parameterized entropy coding method with adaptive quantization.

Result: EntropyGS achieves a 30x reduction in data size on benchmark datasets while maintaining similar rendering quality and demonstrating fast encoding and decoding times.

Conclusion: The proposed EntropyGS provides an efficient and effective solution for compressing 3DGS data, making the pipeline more storage and transmission-friendly without degrading visual results.

Abstract: As an emerging novel view synthesis approach, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)
demonstrates fast training/rendering with superior visual quality. The two
tasks of 3DGS, Gaussian creation and view rendering, are typically separated
over time or devices, and thus storage/transmission and finally compression of
3DGS Gaussians become necessary. We begin with a correlation and statistical
analysis of 3DGS Gaussian attributes. An inspiring finding in this work reveals
that spherical harmonic AC attributes precisely follow Laplace distributions,
while mixtures of Gaussian distributions can approximate rotation, scaling, and
opacity. Additionally, harmonic AC attributes manifest weak correlations with
other attributes except for inherited correlations from a color space. A
factorized and parameterized entropy coding method, EntropyGS, is hereinafter
proposed. During encoding, distribution parameters of each Gaussian attribute
are estimated to assist their entropy coding. The quantization for entropy
coding is adaptively performed according to Gaussian attribute types. EntropyGS
demonstrates about 30x rate reduction on benchmark datasets while maintaining
similar rendering quality compared to input 3DGS data, with a fast encoding and
decoding time.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Spatial transcriptomics platforms like Xenium provide detailed profiling of tumor tissues, but integrating histological and transcriptomic data at a cellular level remains a challenge.

Method: CellSymphony uses foundation model embeddings to integrate Xenium transcriptomic profiles with histology images, facilitating multimodal fusion through joint representation learning.

Result: CellSymphony achieves accurate cell type identification and reveals distinct microenvironmental niches across three cancer types.

Conclusion: This framework demonstrates the potential of foundation models and multimodal integration for better understanding cellular interactions in complex tissues.

Abstract: Xenium, a new spatial transcriptomics platform, enables
subcellular-resolution profiling of complex tumor tissues. Despite the rich
morphological information in histology images, extracting robust cell-level
features and integrating them with spatial transcriptomics data remains a
critical challenge. We introduce CellSymphony, a flexible multimodal framework
that leverages foundation model-derived embeddings from both Xenium
transcriptomic profiles and histology images at true single-cell resolution. By
learning joint representations that fuse spatial gene expression with
morphological context, CellSymphony achieves accurate cell type annotation and
uncovers distinct microenvironmental niches across three cancer types. This
work highlights the potential of foundation models and multimodal fusion for
deciphering the physiological and phenotypic orchestration of cells within
complex tissue ecosystems.

Result: The study identified new paradigms and generalizability trends in crack detection while establishing baselines through benchmarking with the 3DCrack dataset.

Conclusion: The findings illuminate emerging methodologies, promote 3DCrack as a resource for advancements, and suggest future research directions in deep learning-based crack detection.

Abstract: Crack detection plays a crucial role in civil infrastructures, including
inspection of pavements, buildings, etc., and deep learning has significantly
advanced this field in recent years. While numerous technical and review papers
exist in this domain, emerging trends are reshaping the landscape. These shifts
include transitions in learning paradigms (from fully supervised learning to
semi-supervised, weakly-supervised, unsupervised, few-shot, domain adaptation
and fine-tuning foundation models), improvements in generalizability (from
single-dataset performance to cross-dataset evaluation), and diversification in
dataset reacquisition (from RGB images to specialized sensor-based data). In
this review, we systematically analyze these trends and highlight
representative works. Additionally, we introduce a new dataset collected with
3D laser scans, 3DCrack, to support future research and conduct extensive
benchmarking experiments to establish baselines for commonly used deep learning
methodologies, including recent foundation models. Our findings provide

*Haonan Ge,Yiwei Wang,Ming-Hsuan Yang,Yujun Cai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Multi-Region Fusion Decoding (MRFD), a new decoding method to improve factual accuracy in Large Vision-Language Models by enhancing inter-region consistency without modifying the models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) often create text that mismatches their visual input (hallucinations) due to difficulty in integrating information across image regions.

Method: The proposed MRFD method identifies key image regions, generates individual responses for each, calculates reliability weights using Jensen-Shannon Divergence, and fuses these region-based responses using region-aware prompts inspired by Chain-of-Thought reasoning.

Result: MRFD significantly reduces hallucinations and enhances response accuracy across various models and benchmarks without altering the underlying models.

Conclusion: MRFD offers an effective, training-free solution to improve the factual grounding of LVLMs, making them more reliable without requiring updates to the models themselves.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have shown strong performance across
multimodal tasks. However, they often produce hallucinations -- text that is
inconsistent with visual input, due to the limited ability to verify
information in different regions of the image. To address this, we propose
Multi-Region Fusion Decoding (MRFD), a training-free decoding method that
improves factual grounding by modeling inter-region consistency. MRFD
identifies salient regions using cross-attention, generates initial responses
for each, and computes reliability weights based on Jensen-Shannon Divergence
(JSD) among the responses. These weights guide a consistency-aware fusion of
per-region predictions, using region-aware prompts inspired by Chain-of-Thought
reasoning. Experiments across multiple LVLMs and benchmarks show that MRFD
significantly reduces hallucinations and improves response factuality without
requiring model updates.

### [121] [Pose-Robust Calibration Strategy for Point-of-Gaze Estimation on Mobile Phones](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10268)
*Yujie Zhao,Jiabei Zeng,Shiguang Shan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper focuses on improving personalized point-of-gaze (PoG) estimators to address head pose variations through a new dynamic calibration strategy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite advancements, existing PoG estimators require person-specific calibration due to individual differences and are highly sensitive to head pose variations.

Method: The authors developed MobilePoG, a benchmark comprising diverse facial images, and analyzed the role of calibration point diversity and head pose variations. They introduced a dynamic calibration strategy incorporating head pose diversity during the calibration process.

Result: The dynamic calibration strategy, which involves users fixing their gaze while moving their phones, enhances the estimator's pose robustness compared to conventional methods.

Conclusion: Incorporating head pose diversity during calibration improves the accuracy and robustness of personalized PoG estimators, providing a more efficient and user-friendly approach.

Abstract: Although appearance-based point-of-gaze (PoG) estimation has improved, the
estimators still struggle to generalize across individuals due to personal
differences. Therefore, person-specific calibration is required for accurate
PoG estimation. However, calibrated PoG estimators are often sensitive to head
pose variations. To address this, we investigate the key factors influencing
calibrated estimators and explore pose-robust calibration strategies.
Specifically, we first construct a benchmark, MobilePoG, which includes facial
images from 32 individuals focusing on designated points under either fixed or
continuously changing head poses. Using this benchmark, we systematically
analyze how the diversity of calibration points and head poses influences
estimation accuracy. Our experiments show that introducing a wider range of
head poses during calibration improves the estimator's ability to handle pose
variation. Building on this insight, we propose a dynamic calibration strategy
in which users fixate on calibration points while moving their phones. This
strategy naturally introduces head pose variation during a user-friendly and
efficient calibration process, ultimately producing a better calibrated PoG
estimator that is less sensitive to head pose variations than those using
conventional calibration strategies. Codes and datasets are available at our
project page.

### [122] [High Fidelity Text to Image Generation with Contrastive Alignment and Structural Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10280)
*Danyi Gao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes an improved method for text-driven image generation using contrastive learning and structural guidance to enhance semantic accuracy and structural fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the shortcomings in semantic alignment and structural accuracy present in current text-driven image generation methods.

Method: Integrates text-image contrastive learning with structural priors (e.g., semantic layouts, edge sketches) and jointly optimizes multiple loss functions for better image generation quality.

Result: Experiments on COCO-2014 dataset showed improved performance in metrics like CLIP Score, FID, and SSIM, evidencing strong semantic and structural alignment.

Conclusion: The proposed method enhances semantic and structural consistency in image generation without added computational complexity, advancing text-image modeling techniques.

Abstract: This paper addresses the performance bottlenecks of existing text-driven
image generation methods in terms of semantic alignment accuracy and structural
consistency. A high-fidelity image generation method is proposed by integrating
text-image contrastive constraints with structural guidance mechanisms. The
approach introduces a contrastive learning module that builds strong
cross-modal alignment constraints to improve semantic matching between text and
image. At the same time, structural priors such as semantic layout maps or edge
sketches are used to guide the generator in spatial-level structural modeling.
This enhances the layout completeness and detail fidelity of the generated
images. Within the overall framework, the model jointly optimizes contrastive
loss, structural consistency loss, and semantic preservation loss. A
multi-objective supervision mechanism is adopted to improve the semantic
consistency and controllability of the generated content. Systematic
experiments are conducted on the COCO-2014 dataset. Sensitivity analyses are
performed on embedding dimensions, text length, and structural guidance
strength. Quantitative metrics confirm the superior performance of the proposed
method in terms of CLIP Score, FID, and SSIM. The results show that the method
effectively bridges the gap between semantic alignment and structural fidelity
without increasing computational complexity. It demonstrates a strong ability
to generate semantically clear and structurally complete images, offering a
viable technical path for joint text-image modeling and image generation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework to improve the recognition of figure skating jumps in videos by addressing three-dimensional movement aspects and procedural structures using a novel dataset and method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To automate the accurate recognition of figure skating jumps and their timing, which demands expert knowledge, and overcome limitations like insufficient annotated data and lack of 3D and procedural considerations in existing methods.

Method: A framework using VIFSS (View-Invariant, Figure Skating-Specific pose representation learning) with contrastive pre-training and fine-tuning. It includes a new FS-Jump3D dataset and a detailed annotation scheme to capture jump phases.

Result: The method achieves over 92% F1@50 in recognizing jump types and rotation levels, with view-invariant contrastive pre-training proving effective in scenarios with limited fine-tuning data.

Conclusion: The proposed approach addresses significant gaps in figure skating jump recognition, and its practicality is validated for real-world applications, especially when annotated data is scarce.

Abstract: Understanding human actions from videos plays a critical role across various
domains, including sports analytics. In figure skating, accurately recognizing
the type and timing of jumps a skater performs is essential for objective
performance evaluation. However, this task typically requires expert-level
knowledge due to the fine-grained and complex nature of jump procedures. While
recent approaches have attempted to automate this task using Temporal Action
Segmentation (TAS), there are two major limitations to TAS for figure skating:
the annotated data is insufficient, and existing methods do not account for the
inherent three-dimensional aspects and procedural structure of jump actions. In
this work, we propose a new TAS framework for figure skating jumps that
explicitly incorporates both the three-dimensional nature and the semantic
procedure of jump movements. First, we propose a novel View-Invariant, Figure
Skating-Specific pose representation learning approach (VIFSS) that combines
contrastive learning as pre-training and action classification as fine-tuning.
For view-invariant contrastive pre-training, we construct FS-Jump3D, the first
publicly available 3D pose dataset specialized for figure skating jumps.
Second, we introduce a fine-grained annotation scheme that marks the ``entry
(preparation)'' and ``landing'' phases, enabling TAS models to learn the
procedural structure of jumps. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of our framework. Our method achieves over 92% F1@50 on
element-level TAS, which requires recognizing both jump types and rotation
levels. Furthermore, we show that view-invariant contrastive pre-training is
particularly effective when fine-tuning data is limited, highlighting the
practicality of our approach in real-world scenarios.

Result: JRDB-Reasoning enables fine-grained evaluation and dynamic assessment of visual-language models, providing a tailored benchmark for human-crowded environments.

Conclusion: The introduced benchmark serves as an improved tool for assessing visual-language models, bridging previous gaps in reasoning complexity and annotation detail.

Abstract: Recent advances in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and large language models
(LLMs) have greatly enhanced visual reasoning, a key capability for embodied AI
agents like robots. However, existing visual reasoning benchmarks often suffer
from several limitations: they lack a clear definition of reasoning complexity,
offer have no control to generate questions over varying difficulty and task
customization, and fail to provide structured, step-by-step reasoning
annotations (workflows). To bridge these gaps, we formalize reasoning
complexity, introduce an adaptive query engine that generates customizable
questions of varying complexity with detailed intermediate annotations, and
extend the JRDB dataset with human-object interaction and geometric
relationship annotations to create JRDB-Reasoning, a benchmark tailored for
visual reasoning in human-crowded environments. Our engine and benchmark enable
fine-grained evaluation of visual reasoning frameworks and dynamic assessment
of visual-language models across reasoning levels.

*Tao Huang,Hongbo Pan,Nanxi Zhou,Shun Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces the PCWLAD method to improve multimodal optical image matching accuracy, outperforming prior methods in terms of precision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome reduced image matching accuracy caused by nonlinear radiation and geometric deformation differences in multimodal optical images.

Method: The method combines coarse matching using SSIM to preserve structural details and fine matching using WLAD with radiometric and geometric transformation models.

Result: The PCWLAD method achieves superior performance compared to eight state-of-the-art methods, attaining an average matching accuracy of 0.4 pixels across three datasets.

Conclusion: PCWLAD demonstrates a significant improvement in matching multimodal optical images and provides publicly accessible tools and datasets.

Abstract: High-accuracy matching of multimodal optical images is the basis of geometric
processing. However, the image matching accuracy is usually degraded by the
nonlinear radiation and geometric deformation differences caused by different
spectral responses. To address these problems, we proposed a phase consistency
weighted least absolute deviation (PCWLAD) sub-pixel template matching method
to improve the matching accuracy of multimodal optical images. This method
consists of two main steps: coarse matching with the structural similarity
index measure (SSIM) and fine matching with WLAD. In the coarse matching step,
PCs are calculated without a noise filter to preserve the original structural
details, and template matching is performed using the SSIM. In the fine
matching step, we applied the radiometric and geometric transformation models
between two multimodal PC templates based on the coarse matching. Furthermore,
mutual structure filtering is adopted in the model to mitigate the impact of
noise within the corresponding templates on the structural consistency, and the
WLAD criterion is used to estimate the sub-pixel offset. To evaluate the
performance of PCWLAD, we created three types of image datasets: visible to
infrared Landsat images, visible to near-infrared close-range images, and
visible to infrared uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV) images. PCWLAD outperformed
existing state-of-the-art eight methods in terms of correct matching rate (CMR)
and root mean square error (RMSE) and reached an average matching accuracy of
approximately 0.4 pixels across all three datasets. Our software and datasets
are publicly available at https://github.com/huangtaocsu/PCWLAD.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Interleaved Learning for Motion Synthesis (InterSyn) introduces a framework to generate realistic interaction motions by integrating solo and multi-person dynamics using an interleaved learning strategy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current motion synthesis methods often treat solo and multi-person dynamics separately, resulting in less natural and dynamic interactions. This paper aims to address the need for a unified approach that captures nuanced coordination.

Method: The authors propose two modules: INS (Interleaved Interaction Synthesis) for unified modeling of solo and multi-person behaviors, and REC (Relative Coordination Refinement) for synchronizing motions among characters.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate improved text-to-motion alignment, enhanced diversity, and more realistic interaction dynamics compared to recent methods.

Conclusion: InterSyn sets a new benchmark for robust motion synthesis and promises to advance research in creating natural, coordinated interaction motions. The authors commit to open-sourcing the code to encourage further development.

Abstract: We present Interleaved Learning for Motion Synthesis (InterSyn), a novel
framework that targets the generation of realistic interaction motions by
learning from integrated motions that consider both solo and multi-person
dynamics. Unlike previous methods that treat these components separately,
InterSyn employs an interleaved learning strategy to capture the natural,
dynamic interactions and nuanced coordination inherent in real-world scenarios.
Our framework comprises two key modules: the Interleaved Interaction Synthesis
(INS) module, which jointly models solo and interactive behaviors in a unified
paradigm from a first-person perspective to support multiple character
interactions, and the Relative Coordination Refinement (REC) module, which
refines mutual dynamics and ensures synchronized motions among characters.
Experimental results show that the motion sequences generated by InterSyn
exhibit higher text-to-motion alignment and improved diversity compared with
recent methods, setting a new benchmark for robust and natural motion
synthesis. Additionally, our code will be open-sourced in the future to promote
further research and development in this area.

TL;DR: This paper surveys current methods for out-of-distribution (OoD) segmentation and emphasizes its importance in applications such as autonomous driving.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for precise spatial localization of OoD objects, especially in safety-critical contexts like autonomous driving, where identifying and segmenting anomalies ensures system robustness.

Method: The authors categorize existing OoD segmentation techniques into four groups: test-time segmentation, outlier exposure during training, reconstruction-based strategies, and methods leveraging advanced models.

Result: A systematic review of advancements in OoD segmentation within autonomous-driving use cases, along with an analysis of existing challenges and suggestions for future research.

Conclusion: OoD segmentation is essential for enhancing the reliability of AI systems in critical scenarios like autonomous driving, and ongoing research is vital for addressing current limitations and evolving challenges.

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OoD) detection and segmentation have attracted growing
attention as concerns about AI security rise. Conventional OoD detection
methods identify the existence of OoD objects but lack spatial localization,
limiting their usefulness in downstream tasks. OoD segmentation addresses this
limitation by localizing anomalous objects at pixel-level granularity. This
capability is crucial for safety-critical applications such as autonomous
driving, where perception modules must not only detect but also precisely
segment OoD objects, enabling targeted control actions and enhancing overall
system robustness. In this survey, we group current OoD segmentation approaches
into four categories: (i) test-time OoD segmentation, (ii) outlier exposure for
supervised training, (iii) reconstruction-based methods, (iv) and approaches
that leverage powerful models. We systematically review recent advances in OoD
segmentation for autonomous-driving scenarios, identify emerging challenges,
and discuss promising future research directions.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper surveys the use of reinforcement learning (RL) in enhancing generative models for visual content creation. RL improves perceptual quality, semantic accuracy, and alignment with complex goals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generative models often use surrogate objectives that misalign with key attributes like perceptual quality or realism, necessitating frameworks like RL to optimize these insufficiently addressed goals.

Method: The paper systematically reviews how RL has evolved and its application across image, video, and 3D/4D content creation, acting both as a fine-tuning tool and structural component for complex, high-level goal alignment.

Result: RL enhances controllability, consistency, and human alignment in visual content generation while addressing preference-driven and non-differentiable objectives.

Conclusion: RL has shown promise but still faces open challenges in integrating with generative models. The paper highlights future directions for research at this intersection.

Abstract: Generative models have made significant progress in synthesizing visual
content, including images, videos, and 3D/4D structures. However, they are
typically trained with surrogate objectives such as likelihood or
reconstruction loss, which often misalign with perceptual quality, semantic
accuracy, or physical realism. Reinforcement learning (RL) offers a principled
framework for optimizing non-differentiable, preference-driven, and temporally
structured objectives. Recent advances demonstrate its effectiveness in
enhancing controllability, consistency, and human alignment across generative
tasks. This survey provides a systematic overview of RL-based methods for
visual content generation. We review the evolution of RL from classical control
to its role as a general-purpose optimization tool, and examine its integration
into image, video, and 3D/4D generation. Across these domains, RL serves not
only as a fine-tuning mechanism but also as a structural component for aligning
generation with complex, high-level goals. We conclude with open challenges and
future research directions at the intersection of RL and generative modeling.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to optimize vision-language instruction tuning by selecting training data based on whether benchmarks favor similar visual concepts or skills, resulting in improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the inherent trade-off in vision-language benchmarks between learning visual concepts and visual skills, providing a targeted approach to optimize benchmark performance.

Method: The authors developed a simple data selection method that extracts concepts/skills from benchmarks, categorizes benchmarks based on focus (concepts or skills), and selects matching instructions accordingly.

Result: Experiments on over 10 benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the method, leading to an average performance improvement of +0.9%, and +1.5% on skill-focused benchmarks compared to existing baselines.

Conclusion: Recognizing and addressing the trade-off within instruction selection is key, and the proposed method effectively enhances benchmark performance by balancing conceptual knowledge acquisition with visual skills.

Abstract: Vision-language instruction tuning achieves two main purposes: learning
visual concepts and learning visual skills. In this paper, we found that
vision-language benchmarks fall into the dichotomy of mainly benefiting from
training on instructions with similar skills or visual concepts. Inspired by
the discovery, we designed a simple targeted training data selection method to
optimize the performance of a given benchmark. We first extract the
concepts/skills from the benchmark, determine whether the benchmark
predominantly benefits from similar concepts or skills, and finally select
instructions with the most matching concepts/skills. Experiments on 10+
benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our targeted data selection method,
showing +0.9\% over the best existing baseline averaged over all benchmarks and
+1.5\% on the skill-focused subset. Our findings underscore the importance of
recognizing the inherent trade-off within instruction selection, which requires
balancing the acquisition of conceptual knowledge against visual skill.

*Zhentai Zhang,Danyi Weng,Guibin Zhang,Xiang Chen,Kaixing Long,Jian Geng,Yanmeng Lu,Lei Zhang,Zhitao Zhou,Lei Cao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Glo-DMU, a deep learning-based framework for analyzing glomerular ultrastructural features in kidney diseases, achieving high precision and automation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current computational pathology focuses on individual ultrastructures, limiting practical diagnostic applications for kidney diseases.

Method: The study uses three interconnected deep learning models to analyze glomerular ultrastructural features: segmentation, classification, and detection.

Result: Evaluation on 115 patients across 9 renal pathological types showed consistency between automated results and traditional pathological reports.

Conclusion: Glo-DMU offers fully automated, precise, and efficient quantification of multiple ultrastructural features, supporting renal pathologists in real-world diagnostics.

Abstract: Complex and diverse ultrastructural features can indicate the type,
progression, and prognosis of kidney diseases. Recently, computational
pathology combined with deep learning methods has shown tremendous potential in
advancing automatic morphological analysis of glomerular ultrastructure.
However, current research predominantly focuses on the recognition of
individual ultrastructure, which makes it challenging to meet practical
diagnostic needs. In this study, we propose the glomerular morphometry
framework of ultrastructural characterization (Glo-DMU), which is grounded on
three deep models: the ultrastructure segmentation model, the glomerular
filtration barrier region classification model, and the electron-dense deposits
detection model. Following the conventional protocol of renal biopsy diagnosis,
this framework simultaneously quantifies the three most widely used
ultrastructural features: the thickness of glomerular basement membrane, the
degree of foot process effacement, and the location of electron-dense deposits.
We evaluated the 115 patients with 9 renal pathological types in real-world
diagnostic scenarios, demonstrating good consistency between automatic
quantification results and morphological descriptions in the pathological
reports. Glo-DMU possesses the characteristics of full automation, high
precision, and high throughput, quantifying multiple ultrastructural features
simultaneously, and providing an efficient tool for assisting renal
pathologists.

Dead Sea Scrolls, we enhanced our dataset through extensive data augmentation
and employed the Kraken and TrOCR models to improve character recognition. In
our analysis of 16th to 18th-century meeting resolutions task, we utilized a
Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (CRNN) that integrated DeepLabV3+ for
semantic segmentation with a Bidirectional LSTM, incorporating confidence-based
pseudolabeling to refine our model. Finally, for modern English handwriting

capture sequential dependencies. This report offers valuable insights and
suggests potential directions for future research.

### [132] [AtomDiffuser: Time-Aware Degradation Modeling for Drift and Beam Damage in STEM Imaging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10359)
*Hao Wang,Hongkui Zheng,Kai He,Abolfazl Razi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AtomDiffuser is a framework for disentangling sample drift and radiation damage effects in STEM data, enabling clear modeling of atomic dynamics and degradation alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: STEM data interpretation is compromised by spatial drift and beam-induced signal loss, creating distortions that are difficult to separate or model effectively at atomic resolution.

Method: AtomDiffuser predicts affine transformations and spatially varying decay maps between STEM frames to disentangle temporal degradation effects.

Result: The framework, trained on synthetic processes, generalizes well to real-world cryo-STEM data, supports high-resolution inference, and aligns drift effectively while enabling visualization of degradation patterns.

Conclusion: AtomDiffuser enhances interpretability and analysis of time-resolved STEM data, facilitating clearer observation of atomic structural evolutions and addressing significant challenges in the field.

Abstract: Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) plays a critical role in
modern materials science, enabling direct imaging of atomic structures and
their evolution under external interferences. However, interpreting
time-resolved STEM data remains challenging due to two entangled degradation
effects: spatial drift caused by mechanical and thermal instabilities, and
beam-induced signal loss resulting from radiation damage. These factors distort
both geometry and intensity in complex, temporally correlated ways, making it
difficult for existing methods to explicitly separate their effects or model
material dynamics at atomic resolution. In this work, we present AtomDiffuser,
a time-aware degradation modeling framework that disentangles sample drift and
radiometric attenuation by predicting an affine transformation and a spatially
varying decay map between any two STEM frames. Unlike traditional denoising or
registration pipelines, our method leverages degradation as a physically
heuristic, temporally conditioned process, enabling interpretable structural
evolutions across time. Trained on synthetic degradation processes,
AtomDiffuser also generalizes well to real-world cryo-STEM data. It further
supports high-resolution degradation inference and drift alignment, offering
tools for visualizing and quantifying degradation patterns that correlate with
radiation-induced atomic instabilities.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study introduces SpaRC-AD, an end-to-end camera-radar fusion framework, enhancing autonomous driving across several tasks through radar data integration for improved accuracy in adverse scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the limitations of vision-based autonomous driving systems, such as challenges posed by adverse weather, occlusions, and inaccurate velocity estimation, which are critical in ensuring safety.

Method: The authors propose SpaRC-AD, combining sparse 3D feature alignment and doppler-based velocity estimation to enhance 3D scene representation, refine model anchors, and improve motion modeling.

Result: SpaRC-AD achieves significant advancements across tasks like 3D detection (+4.8% mAP), multi-object tracking (+8.3% AMOTA), and trajectory planning (-0.1m L2 and -9% TPC), demonstrating coherent spatial and temporal consistency.

Conclusion: Radar-based fusion proves effective in addressing safety-critical scenarios, with SpaRC-AD outperforming vision-only baselines and enhancing collision avoidance capabilities in autonomous driving systems.

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving systems promise stronger performance through
unified optimization of perception, motion forecasting, and planning. However,
vision-based approaches face fundamental limitations in adverse weather
conditions, partial occlusions, and precise velocity estimation - critical
challenges in safety-sensitive scenarios where accurate motion understanding
and long-horizon trajectory prediction are essential for collision avoidance.
To address these limitations, we propose SpaRC-AD, a query-based end-to-end
camera-radar fusion framework for planning-oriented autonomous driving. Through
sparse 3D feature alignment, and doppler-based velocity estimation, we achieve
strong 3D scene representations for refinement of agent anchors, map polylines
and motion modelling. Our method achieves strong improvements over the
state-of-the-art vision-only baselines across multiple autonomous driving
tasks, including 3D detection (+4.8% mAP), multi-object tracking (+8.3% AMOTA),
online mapping (+1.8% mAP), motion prediction (-4.0% mADE), and trajectory
planning (-0.1m L2 and -9% TPC). We achieve both spatial coherence and temporal
consistency on multiple challenging benchmarks, including real-world open-loop
nuScenes, long-horizon T-nuScenes, and closed-loop simulator Bench2Drive. We
show the effectiveness of radar-based fusion in safety-critical scenarios where
accurate motion understanding and long-horizon trajectory prediction are
essential for collision avoidance. The source code of all experiments is

*Pablo Hernández-Cámara,Alexandra Gomez-Villa,Jose Manuel Jaén-Lorites,Jorge Vila-Tomás,Jesus Malo,Valero Laparra*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper develops a method to study how well vision-language models (VLMs) mimic human perception of visual details, revealing they do not fully replicate human sensitivity to visual patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how multimodal VLMs align with human perception helps in assessing their ability to process and interpret low-level visual features similar to humans.

Method: The authors introduce a behavioral psychophysics-inspired method that prompts VLMs to judge the visibility of patterns across different visual contrasts and spatial frequencies. Models are tested with band-pass filtered noise images and varied prompts.

Result: Some VLMs exhibit human-like sensitivity to visual frequencies in shape or magnitude, yet none completely replicate both aspects. The phrasing of prompts significantly impacts model responses, indicating a lack of prompt stability.

Conclusion: The developed framework advances the study of visual sensitivity in VLMs and highlights critical differences between these models and human visual perception.

Abstract: Assessing the alignment of multimodal vision-language models~(VLMs) with
human perception is essential to understand how they perceive low-level visual
features. A key characteristic of human vision is the contrast sensitivity
function (CSF), which describes sensitivity to spatial frequency at
low-contrasts. Here, we introduce a novel behavioral psychophysics-inspired
method to estimate the CSF of chat-based VLMs by directly prompting them to
judge pattern visibility at different contrasts for each frequency. This
methodology is closer to the real experiments in psychophysics than the
previously reported. Using band-pass filtered noise images and a diverse set of
prompts, we assess model responses across multiple architectures. We find that
while some models approximate human-like CSF shape or magnitude, none fully
replicate both. Notably, prompt phrasing has a large effect on the responses,
raising concerns about prompt stability. Our results provide a new framework
for probing visual sensitivity in multimodal models and reveal key gaps between
their visual representations and human perception.

### [135] [Towards Spatially Consistent Image Generation: On Incorporating Intrinsic Scene Properties into Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10382)
*Hyundo Lee,Suhyung Choi,Byoung-Tak Zhang,Inwoo Hwang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to co-generate images alongside intrinsic scene properties like depth and segmentation to improve spatial consistency and realism in image generation, building upon Latent Diffusion Models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current image generation models often produce spatially inconsistent images due to a lack of understanding of the underlying scene's structure and spatial layout.

Method: The proposed method extracts intrinsic scene properties (e.g., depth, segmentation) from images using pre-trained estimators and aggregates these into a latent variable via an autoencoder. It then builds on Latent Diffusion Models to simultaneously denoise the image and corresponding intrinsic properties, ensuring mutual information is shared for spatial consistency.

Result: The approach significantly improves spatial consistency and generates scenes with more natural layouts while preserving the fidelity and textual alignment of the base model.

Conclusion: Incorporating intrinsic scene properties into image generation models enhances their ability to produce realistic and consistent images without sacrificing quality or textual alignment.

Abstract: Image generation models trained on large datasets can synthesize high-quality
images but often produce spatially inconsistent and distorted images due to
limited information about the underlying structures and spatial layouts. In
this work, we leverage intrinsic scene properties (e.g., depth, segmentation
maps) that provide rich information about the underlying scene, unlike prior
approaches that solely rely on image-text pairs or use intrinsics as
conditional inputs. Our approach aims to co-generate both images and their
corresponding intrinsics, enabling the model to implicitly capture the
underlying scene structure and generate more spatially consistent and realistic
images. Specifically, we first extract rich intrinsic scene properties from a
large image dataset with pre-trained estimators, eliminating the need for
additional scene information or explicit 3D representations. We then aggregate
various intrinsic scene properties into a single latent variable using an
autoencoder. Building upon pre-trained large-scale Latent Diffusion Models
(LDMs), our method simultaneously denoises the image and intrinsic domains by
carefully sharing mutual information so that the image and intrinsic reflect
each other without degrading image quality. Experimental results demonstrate
that our method corrects spatial inconsistencies and produces a more natural
layout of scenes while maintaining the fidelity and textual alignment of the
base model (e.g., Stable Diffusion).

### [136] [Unlocking Robust Semantic Segmentation Performance via Label-only Elastic Deformations against Implicit Label Noise](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10383)
*Yechan Kim,Dongho Yoon,Younkwan Lee,Unse Fatima,Hong Kook Kim,Songjae Lee,Sanga Park,Jeong Ho Park,Seonjong Kang,Moongu Jeon*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces NSegment+, an augmentation framework that decouples image and label transformations to address realistic implicit label noise in semantic segmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the need to address subtle label imperfections in real-world datasets, like ambiguous boundaries and annotator variability, that impair model performance.

Method: NSegment+ applies elastic deformations to segmentation labels only, preserving original images. This encourages models to learn robust object structures despite label inconsistencies.

Result: NSegment+ achieves performance improvements with mIoU gains up to +3.39 across multiple benchmark datasets. Further performance boosts are observed when combined with other training techniques.

Conclusion: Addressing implicit label noise is crucial for improving semantic segmentation in real-world settings, and NSegment+ provides a promising approach to this problem.

Abstract: While previous studies on image segmentation focus on handling severe (or
explicit) label noise, real-world datasets also exhibit subtle (or implicit)
label imperfections. These arise from inherent challenges, such as ambiguous
object boundaries and annotator variability. Although not explicitly present,
such mild and latent noise can still impair model performance. Typical data
augmentation methods, which apply identical transformations to the image and
its label, risk amplifying these subtle imperfections and limiting the model's
generalization capacity. In this paper, we introduce NSegment+, a novel
augmentation framework that decouples image and label transformations to
address such realistic noise for semantic segmentation. By introducing
controlled elastic deformations only to segmentation labels while preserving
the original images, our method encourages models to focus on learning robust
representations of object structures despite minor label inconsistencies.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that NSegment+ consistently improves
performance, achieving mIoU gains of up to +2.29, +2.38, +1.75, and +3.39 in
average on Vaihingen, LoveDA, Cityscapes, and PASCAL VOC, respectively-even
without bells and whistles, highlighting the importance of addressing implicit
label noise. These gains can be further amplified when combined with other
training tricks, including CutMix and Label Smoothing.

*Haibin Sun,Xinghui Song*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents a data augmentation framework called PQ-DAF for improving driver distraction detection by addressing the challenges of few-shot learning and domain shifts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhance traffic safety by overcoming the challenges of limited annotated data and domain shifts in driver distraction detection models.

Method: The method uses a vision-language model for sample filtering and a Progressive Conditional Diffusion Model for generating training examples. A quality assessment module ensures data reliability.

Result: PQ-DAF significantly improves the performance and generalization of models in few-shot driver distraction detection scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed framework enhances the robustness and effectiveness of models in data-scarce, real-world deployment conditions.

Abstract: Driver distraction detection is essential for improving traffic safety and
reducing road accidents. However, existing models often suffer from degraded
generalization when deployed in real-world scenarios. This limitation primarily
arises from the few-shot learning challenge caused by the high cost of data
annotation in practical environments, as well as the substantial domain shift
between training datasets and target deployment conditions. To address these
issues, we propose a Pose-driven Quality-controlled Data Augmentation Framework
(PQ-DAF) that leverages a vision-language model for sample filtering to
cost-effectively expand training data and enhance cross-domain robustness.
Specifically, we employ a Progressive Conditional Diffusion Model (PCDMs) to
accurately capture key driver pose features and synthesize diverse training
examples. A sample quality assessment module, built upon the CogVLM
vision-language model, is then introduced to filter out low-quality synthetic
samples based on a confidence threshold, ensuring the reliability of the
augmented dataset. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PQ-DAF substantially
improves performance in few-shot driver distraction detection, achieving
significant gains in model generalization under data-scarce conditions.

### [138] [Translation of Text Embedding via Delta Vector to Suppress Strongly Entangled Content in Text-to-Image Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10407)
*Eunseo Koh,Seunghoo Hong,Tae-Young Kim,Simon S. Woo,Jae-Pil Heo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of entangled content in Text-to-Image diffusion models, introducing methods to suppress unwanted visuals associated with specific terms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-to-Image diffusion models often generate entangled content, such as adding unwanted features (e.g., a mustache for Charlie Chaplin) due to semantic associations.

Method: The authors propose a delta vector in the text embedding space to suppress entangled content, employing a Selective Suppression with Delta Vector (SSDV) method integrated with cross-attention mechanisms.

Result: Experimental results highlight the superiority of the proposed approach, showing improved suppression capabilities and qualitative image improvements.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively reduces entangled content, enhancing the precision of generated images in Text-to-Image models and outperforming existing techniques in the field.

Abstract: Text-to-Image (T2I) diffusion models have made significant progress in
generating diverse high-quality images from textual prompts. However, these
models still face challenges in suppressing content that is strongly entangled
with specific words. For example, when generating an image of ``Charlie
Chaplin", a ``mustache" consistently appears even if explicitly instructed not
to include it, as the concept of ``mustache" is strongly entangled with
``Charlie Chaplin". To address this issue, we propose a novel approach to
directly suppress such entangled content within the text embedding space of
diffusion models. Our method introduces a delta vector that modifies the text
embedding to weaken the influence of undesired content in the generated image,
and we further demonstrate that this delta vector can be easily obtained
through a zero-shot approach. Furthermore, we propose a Selective Suppression
with Delta Vector (SSDV) method to adapt delta vector into the cross-attention
mechanism, enabling more effective suppression of unwanted content in regions
where it would otherwise be generated. Additionally, we enabled more precise
suppression in personalized T2I models by optimizing delta vector, which
previous baselines were unable to achieve. Extensive experimental results
demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing methods, both
in terms of quantitative and qualitative metrics.

### [139] [SC-Lane: Slope-aware and Consistent Road Height Estimation Framework for 3D Lane Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10411)
*Chaesong Park,Eunbin Seo,Jihyeon Hwang,Jongwoo Lim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SC-Lane is a new framework for 3D lane detection, introducing slope-aware and temporally consistent heightmap estimation with significant improvement in performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous methods relied on fixed slope anchors, which were less robust to varying road geometries. There was a need for a system that adapts to diverse slopes and ensures temporal coherence in dynamic driving scenarios.

Method: The proposed SC-Lane framework incorporates a Slope-Aware Adaptive Feature module to dynamically adapt slope-based height features using image cues. Additionally, a Height Consistency Module ensures stable height estimation across frames.

Result: Using the OpenLane benchmark and relevant metrics (MAE, RMSE, accuracy), SC-Lane achieves state-of-the-art performance, highlighted by an F-score of 64.3%, outperforming prior methods.

Conclusion: SC-Lane provides a more robust and accurate approach to 3D lane detection, addressing limitations of earlier techniques and setting a new benchmarking standard for road height estimation.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce SC-Lane, a novel slope-aware and temporally
consistent heightmap estimation framework for 3D lane detection. Unlike
previous approaches that rely on fixed slope anchors, SC-Lane adaptively
determines the fusion of slope-specific height features, improving robustness
to diverse road geometries. To achieve this, we propose a Slope-Aware Adaptive
Feature module that dynamically predicts the appropriate weights from image
cues for integrating multi-slope representations into a unified heightmap.
Additionally, a Height Consistency Module enforces temporal coherence, ensuring
stable and accurate height estimation across consecutive frames, which is
crucial for real-world driving scenarios. To evaluate the effectiveness of
SC-Lane, we employ three standardized metrics-Mean Absolute Error(MAE), Root
Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and threshold-based accuracy-which, although common
in surface and depth estimation, have been underutilized for road height
assessment. Using the LiDAR-derived heightmap dataset introduced in prior work
[20], we benchmark our method under these metrics, thereby establishing a
rigorous standard for future comparisons. Extensive experiments on the OpenLane
benchmark demonstrate that SC-Lane significantly improves both height
estimation and 3D lane detection, achieving state-of-the-art performance with
an F-score of 64.3%, outperforming existing methods by a notable margin. For

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces NanoControl, a highly efficient controllable text-to-image synthesis method based on Diffusion Transformers that minimizes parameter and computation overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for controllable text-to-image synthesis using Diffusion Transformers rely heavily on the ControlNet framework, which is computationally expensive and increases parameter overhead.

Method: The authors propose NanoControl, which uses Flux as the backbone network and a LoRA-style control module to directly learn control signals. Additionally, they introduce a KV-Context Augmentation mechanism for improved feature integration.

Result: NanoControl achieves state-of-the-art performance in controllable text-to-image generation with minimal parameter (0.024%) and GFLOP (0.029%) increases, significantly reducing computational overhead.

Conclusion: NanoControl is an efficient and highly controllable text-to-image generation framework that outperforms traditional methods while maintaining low resource requirements.

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in
text-to-image synthesis. However, in the domain of controllable text-to-image
generation using DiTs, most existing methods still rely on the ControlNet
paradigm originally designed for UNet-based diffusion models. This paradigm
introduces significant parameter overhead and increased computational costs. To
address these challenges, we propose the Nano Control Diffusion Transformer
(NanoControl), which employs Flux as the backbone network. Our model achieves
state-of-the-art controllable text-to-image generation performance while
incurring only a 0.024\% increase in parameter count and a 0.029\% increase in
GFLOPs, thus enabling highly efficient controllable generation. Specifically,
rather than duplicating the DiT backbone for control, we design a LoRA-style
(low-rank adaptation) control module that directly learns control signals from
raw conditioning inputs. Furthermore, we introduce a KV-Context Augmentation
mechanism that integrates condition-specific key-value information into the
backbone in a simple yet highly effective manner, facilitating deep fusion of
conditional features. Extensive benchmark experiments demonstrate that
NanoControl significantly reduces computational overhead compared to
conventional control approaches, while maintaining superior generation quality
and achieving improved controllability.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces STRIDE-QA, a large-scale VQA dataset designed for spatiotemporal reasoning in urban autonomous driving, addressing current Vision-Language Models' (VLMs) limitations in dynamic traffic scene understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Vision-Language Models are limited in spatiotemporal reasoning as they are trained on static image-text pairs, which hampers their decision-making capabilities in dynamic urban driving scenarios.

Method: The authors constructed STRIDE-QA using 100 hours of multi-sensor driving data from Tokyo, comprising 16 million QA pairs over 285K frames, grounded with annotations such as 3D bounding boxes and segmentation masks, and designed for three specific QA tasks requiring spatial and temporal reasoning.

Result: When fine-tuned on STRIDE-QA, VLMs demonstrated significant improvements, achieving 55% in spatial localization and 28% in future motion prediction consistency, whereas general-purpose VLMs showed near-zero performance.

Conclusion: STRIDE-QA provides a robust foundation for enhancing VLMs in safety-critical contexts like autonomous driving, emphasizing its role in overcoming fundamental limitations in current models.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have been applied to autonomous driving to
support decision-making in complex real-world scenarios. However, their
training on static, web-sourced image-text pairs fundamentally limits the
precise spatiotemporal reasoning required to understand and predict dynamic
traffic scenes. We address this critical gap with STRIDE-QA, a large-scale
visual question answering (VQA) dataset for physically grounded reasoning from
an ego-centric perspective. Constructed from 100 hours of multi-sensor driving
data in Tokyo, capturing diverse and challenging conditions, STRIDE-QA is the
largest VQA dataset for spatiotemporal reasoning in urban driving, offering 16
million QA pairs over 285K frames. Grounded by dense, automatically generated
annotations including 3D bounding boxes, segmentation masks, and multi-object
tracks, the dataset uniquely supports both object-centric and ego-centric
reasoning through three novel QA tasks that require spatial localization and
temporal prediction. Our benchmarks demonstrate that existing VLMs struggle
significantly, achieving near-zero scores on prediction consistency. In
contrast, VLMs fine-tuned on STRIDE-QA exhibit dramatic performance gains,
achieving 55% success in spatial localization and 28% consistency in future
motion prediction, compared to near-zero scores from general-purpose VLMs.
Therefore, STRIDE-QA establishes a comprehensive foundation for developing more
reliable VLMs for safety-critical autonomous systems.

*Baichen Liu,Qi Lyu,Xudong Wang,Jiahua Dong,Lianqing Liu,Zhi Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes CRISP, a method to enhance continual video instance segmentation by addressing instance-wise, category-wise, and task-wise confusions using novel techniques like instance correlation loss, adaptive residual semantic prompts, and contrastive learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of continual video instance segmentation, which include retaining previously learned categories, learning new ones, and ensuring temporal consistency across frames.

Method: The proposed method, CRISP, introduces three main components: instance correlation loss for instance-wise learning, an adaptive residual semantic prompt (ARSP) framework for category-wise learning, and a robust initialization strategy with semantic consistency loss for task-wise learning.

Result: CRISP demonstrates significant performance improvements over existing methods for continual segmentation, particularly in avoiding catastrophic forgetting and improving both segmentation and classification accuracy, as tested on YouTube-VIS-2019 and YouTube-VIS-2021 datasets.

Conclusion: The study highlights the effectiveness of CRISP in tackling long-term continual video instance segmentation, providing a reliable framework that balances plasticity and stability while outperforming prior approaches.

Abstract: Continual video instance segmentation demands both the plasticity to absorb
new object categories and the stability to retain previously learned ones, all
while preserving temporal consistency across frames. In this work, we introduce
Contrastive Residual Injection and Semantic Prompting (CRISP), an earlier
attempt tailored to address the instance-wise, category-wise, and task-wise
confusion in continual video instance segmentation. For instance-wise learning,
we model instance tracking and construct instance correlation loss, which
emphasizes the correlation with the prior query space while strengthening the
specificity of the current task query. For category-wise learning, we build an
adaptive residual semantic prompt (ARSP) learning framework, which constructs a
learnable semantic residual prompt pool generated by category text and uses an
adjustive query-prompt matching mechanism to build a mapping relationship
between the query of the current task and the semantic residual prompt.
Meanwhile, a semantic consistency loss based on the contrastive learning is
introduced to maintain semantic coherence between object queries and residual
prompts during incremental training. For task-wise learning, to ensure the
correlation at the inter-task level within the query space, we introduce a
concise yet powerful initialization strategy for incremental prompts. Extensive
experiments on YouTube-VIS-2019 and YouTube-VIS-2021 datasets demonstrate that
CRISP significantly outperforms existing continual segmentation methods in the
long-term continual video instance segmentation task, avoiding catastrophic
forgetting and effectively improving segmentation and classification
performance. The code is available at https://github.com/01upup10/CRISP.

TL;DR: The paper introduces DOD-SA, a novel infrared-visible object detection framework requiring only single-modality annotations, reducing annotation costs while leveraging complementary modal information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High annotation costs for dual-modality data in infrared-visible object detection hinder practical application. Addressing this issue could improve efficiency.

Method: A collaborative teacher-student network named CoSD-TSNet enables pseudo-label creation for unlabeled modalities. The PaST strategy incorporates staged training to enhance decoupling ability and pseudo-label quality, complemented by a Pseudo Label Assigner for modality alignment.

Result: The DOD-SA framework demonstrated superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods in experiments on the DroneVehicle dataset.

Conclusion: DOD-SA provides an efficient solution for infrared-visible object detection, reducing dual-modality annotation dependency while achieving high performance.

Abstract: Infrared-visible object detection has shown great potential in real-world
applications, enabling robust all-day perception by leveraging the
complementary information of infrared and visible images. However, existing
methods typically require dual-modality annotations to output detection results
for both modalities during prediction, which incurs high annotation costs. To
address this challenge, we propose a novel infrared-visible Decoupled Object
Detection framework with Single-modality Annotations, called DOD-SA. The
architecture of DOD-SA is built upon a Single- and Dual-Modality Collaborative
Teacher-Student Network (CoSD-TSNet), which consists of a single-modality
branch (SM-Branch) and a dual-modality decoupled branch (DMD-Branch). The
teacher model generates pseudo-labels for the unlabeled modality,
simultaneously supporting the training of the student model. The collaborative
design enables cross-modality knowledge transfer from the labeled modality to
the unlabeled modality, and facilitates effective SM-to-DMD branch supervision.
To further improve the decoupling ability of the model and the pseudo-label
quality, we introduce a Progressive and Self-Tuning Training Strategy (PaST)
that trains the model in three stages: (1) pretraining SM-Branch, (2) guiding
the learning of DMD-Branch by SM-Branch, and (3) refining DMD-Branch. In
addition, we design a Pseudo Label Assigner (PLA) to align and pair labels
across modalities, explicitly addressing modality misalignment during training.
Extensive experiments on the DroneVehicle dataset demonstrate that our method
outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA).

### [144] [SkeySpot: Automating Service Key Detection for Digital Electrical Layout Plans in the Construction Industry](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10449)
*Dhruv Dosi,Rohit Meena,Param Rajpura,Yogesh Kumar Meena*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents a dataset called DELP for automated identification of electrical symbols in scanned floor plans and introduces SkeySpot, a toolkit using YOLOv8 for real-time detection and processing, achieving 82.5% mAP.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need to automate the interpretation of scanned floor plans to reduce effort and errors, making processes like cost estimation and regulatory compliance more efficient.

Method: The researchers created a labeled dataset (DELP) containing 45 annotated electrical layout plans, tested object detection models on this dataset, and developed the SkeySpot toolkit based on YOLOv8.

Result: YOLOv8 performed the best among benchmarked models with a mean Average Precision of 82.5%. The SkeySpot toolkit was developed for scalable building information workflows.

Conclusion: The approach enhances digitization accessibility for SMEs, reduces reliance on proprietary CAD systems, and supports interoperability and sustainability in construction workflows.

Abstract: Legacy floor plans, often preserved only as scanned documents, remain
essential resources for architecture, urban planning, and facility management
in the construction industry. However, the lack of machine-readable floor plans
render large-scale interpretation both time-consuming and error-prone.
Automated symbol spotting offers a scalable solution by enabling the
identification of service key symbols directly from floor plans, supporting
workflows such as cost estimation, infrastructure maintenance, and regulatory
compliance. This work introduces a labelled Digitised Electrical Layout Plans
(DELP) dataset comprising 45 scanned electrical layout plans annotated with
2,450 instances across 34 distinct service key classes. A systematic evaluation
framework is proposed using pretrained object detection models for DELP
dataset. Among the models benchmarked, YOLOv8 achieves the highest performance
with a mean Average Precision (mAP) of 82.5\%. Using YOLOv8, we develop
SkeySpot, a lightweight, open-source toolkit for real-time detection,
classification, and quantification of electrical symbols. SkeySpot produces
structured, standardised outputs that can be scaled up for interoperable
building information workflows, ultimately enabling compatibility across
downstream applications and regulatory platforms. By lowering dependency on
proprietary CAD systems and reducing manual annotation effort, this approach
makes the digitisation of electrical layouts more accessible to small and
medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the construction industry, while supporting
broader goals of standardisation, interoperability, and sustainability in the
built environment.

*Pablo Hernández-Cámara,Jesus Malo,Valero Laparra*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper demonstrates that a bio-inspired model, PerceptNet, aligns well with human perception in image distortion tasks without requiring perceptual information during training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate if human visual perception can emerge from image statistics and explore biologically inspired neural models' ability to replicate perceptual metrics.

Method: The authors developed PerceptNet, a bio-inspired architecture optimized for image reconstruction tasks such as autoencoding, denoising, deblurring, and sparsity regularization.

Result: The V1-like encoder stage in PerceptNet correlates highly with human judgments on image distortion, showing optimal alignment for moderate levels of noise, blur, and sparsity.

Conclusion: Visual systems might be tuned to handle specific distortion levels, and biologically inspired models can independently learn perceptual metrics, suggesting potential for unsupervised learning systems.

Abstract: A number of scientists suggested that human visual perception may emerge from
image statistics, shaping efficient neural representations in early vision. In
this work, a bio-inspired architecture that can accommodate several known facts
in the retina-V1 cortex, the PerceptNet, has been end-to-end optimized for
different tasks related to image reconstruction: autoencoding, denoising,
deblurring, and sparsity regularization. Our results show that the encoder
stage (V1-like layer) consistently exhibits the highest correlation with human
perceptual judgments on image distortion despite not using perceptual
information in the initialization or training. This alignment exhibits an
optimum for moderate noise, blur and sparsity. These findings suggest that the
visual system may be tuned to remove those particular levels of distortion with
that level of sparsity and that biologically inspired models can learn
perceptual metrics without human supervision.

### [146] [Trajectory-aware Shifted State Space Models for Online Video Super-Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10453)
*Qiang Zhu,Xiandong Meng,Yuxian Jiang,Fan Zhang,David Bull,Shuyuan Zhu,Bing Zeng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces TS-Mamba, an online video super-resolution (VSR) model leveraging state space modeling for improved efficiency and performance by focusing on long-term trajectory modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing online VSR methods lack effective long-term temporal modeling since they only use one neighboring previous frame for alignment, limiting their scalability and computational efficiency.

Method: The authors propose the TS-Mamba method using trajectories to find similar tokens in previous frames, employ shifted state space model (SSM) blocks for aggregation, and introduce a trajectory-aware loss function to ensure accurate token selection during training.

Result: TS-Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance across three key datasets, outperforming six benchmark models while reducing computational complexity by over 22.7%.

Conclusion: TS-Mamba demonstrates the feasibility and advantages of combining long-term trajectory modeling with efficient state space modeling for improved video super-resolution applications.

Abstract: Online video super-resolution (VSR) is an important technique for many
real-world video processing applications, which aims to restore the current
high-resolution video frame based on temporally previous frames. Most of the
existing online VSR methods solely employ one neighboring previous frame to
achieve temporal alignment, which limits long-range temporal modeling of
videos. Recently, state space models (SSMs) have been proposed with linear
computational complexity and a global receptive field, which significantly
improve computational efficiency and performance. In this context, this paper
presents a novel online VSR method based on Trajectory-aware Shifted SSMs
(TS-Mamba), leveraging both long-term trajectory modeling and low-complexity
Mamba to achieve efficient spatio-temporal information aggregation.
Specifically, TS-Mamba first constructs the trajectories within a video to
select the most similar tokens from the previous frames. Then, a
Trajectory-aware Shifted Mamba Aggregation (TSMA) module consisting of proposed
shifted SSMs blocks is employed to aggregate the selected tokens. The shifted
SSMs blocks are designed based on Hilbert scannings and corresponding shift
operations to compensate for scanning losses and strengthen the spatial
continuity of Mamba. Additionally, we propose a trajectory-aware loss function
to supervise the trajectory generation, ensuring the accuracy of token
selection when training our model. Extensive experiments on three widely used
VSR test datasets demonstrate that compared with six online VSR benchmark
models, our TS-Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance in most cases and
over 22.7\% complexity reduction (in MACs). The source code for TS-Mamba will
be available at https://github.com.

Motivation: To tackle the challenge in plant species prediction for multi-species quadrat images, addressing domain shifts between training on single-species images and testing on multi-species queries.

Method: A pre-trained DINOv2 Vision Transformer Base backbone is enhanced with multi-classification heads and techniques such as multi-scale tiling, dynamic threshold optimization, and ensemble strategies. Inference methods include artifact removal, prediction constraints, and thresholding.

Result: Experiments on 1.4 million images of 7,806 species demonstrated the approach's effectiveness, achieving 3rd place on the PlantCLEF 2025 private leaderboard.

Conclusion: The proposed model successfully tackled the domain shift and multi-label species prediction problem, achieving strong performance and contributing reusable code for further research.

Abstract: We present a multi-head vision transformer approach for multi-label plant
species prediction in vegetation plot images, addressing the PlantCLEF 2025
challenge. The task involves training models on single-species plant images
while testing on multi-species quadrat images, creating a drastic domain shift.

### [148] [SingleStrip: learning skull-stripping from a single labeled example](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10464)
*Bella Specktor-Fadida,Malte Hoffmann*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper combines domain randomization and self-training to train 3D skull-stripping models for brain MRI segmentation with minimal labeled data, achieving strong results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual labeling for deep learning segmentation in volumetric images like brain MRI is time-intensive, and alternatives are needed, especially when labeled data is scarce.

Method: The authors combine domain randomization with semi-supervised self-training, utilizing voxel intensity binning, training convolutional autoencoders for quality assessment, and leveraging pseudo-labels for iterative fine-tuning.

Result: The approach achieves skull-stripping performance comparable to models trained on larger labeled datasets, especially for out-of-distribution data. AE-based ranking outperforms consistency-based methods.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates the feasibility of combining domain randomization and AE-based self-training to enable effective semi-supervised segmentation, reducing the need for extensive labeled data and supporting progress in new imaging applications.

Abstract: Deep learning segmentation relies heavily on labeled data, but manual
labeling is laborious and time-consuming, especially for volumetric images such
as brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). While recent domain-randomization
techniques alleviate the dependency on labeled data by synthesizing diverse
training images from label maps, they offer limited anatomical variability when
very few label maps are available. Semi-supervised self-training addresses
label scarcity by iteratively incorporating model predictions into the training
set, enabling networks to learn from unlabeled data. In this work, we combine
domain randomization with self-training to train three-dimensional
skull-stripping networks using as little as a single labeled example. First, we
automatically bin voxel intensities, yielding labels we use to synthesize
images for training an initial skull-stripping model. Second, we train a
convolutional autoencoder (AE) on the labeled example and use its
reconstruction error to assess the quality of brain masks predicted for
unlabeled data. Third, we select the top-ranking pseudo-labels to fine-tune the
network, achieving skull-stripping performance on out-of-distribution data that
approaches models trained with more labeled images. We compare AE-based ranking
to consistency-based ranking under test-time augmentation, finding that the AE
approach yields a stronger correlation with segmentation accuracy. Our results
highlight the potential of combining domain randomization and AE-based quality
control to enable effective semi-supervised segmentation from extremely limited
labeled data. This strategy may ease the labeling burden that slows progress in
studies involving new anatomical structures or emerging imaging techniques.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper addresses the sparse and noisy data challenges in mmWave radar-based Human Action Recognition by evaluating the performance of DBSCAN, the Hungarian Algorithm, and Kalman Filtering individually and in combinations using the MiliPoint dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address privacy concerns with vision-based HAR systems by exploring mmWave radar as an alternative, while overcoming its sparse and noisy data challenges.

Method: Comprehensive performance analysis of three data processing methods (DBSCAN, Hungarian Algorithm, Kalman Filtering) individually, in pairs, and in combination using a standard dataset. Enhancements to individual methods were also proposed for improved accuracy.

Result: Insights into the strengths, trade-offs, recognition accuracy, and computational costs of each method and their integrations were obtained.

Conclusion: The analysis provides guidance for future research to optimize data processing methods for mmWave radar-based HAR systems, balancing privacy preservation, accuracy, and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Human Action Recognition (HAR) plays a crucial role in healthcare, fitness
tracking, and ambient assisted living technologies. While traditional vision
based HAR systems are effective, they pose privacy concerns. mmWave radar
sensors offer a privacy preserving alternative but present challenges due to
the sparse and noisy nature of their point cloud data. In the literature, three
primary data processing methods: Density-Based Spatial Clustering of
Applications with Noise (DBSCAN), the Hungarian Algorithm, and Kalman Filtering
have been widely used to improve the quality and continuity of radar data.
However, a comprehensive evaluation of these methods, both individually and in
combination, remains lacking. This paper addresses that gap by conducting a
detailed performance analysis of the three methods using the MiliPoint dataset.
We evaluate each method individually, all possible pairwise combinations, and
the combination of all three, assessing both recognition accuracy and
computational cost. Furthermore, we propose targeted enhancements to the
individual methods aimed at improving accuracy. Our results provide crucial
insights into the strengths and trade-offs of each method and their
integrations, guiding future work on mmWave based HAR systems

*Liangrui Pan,xiaoyu Li,Guang Zhu,Guanting Li,Ruixin Wang,Jiadi Luo,Yaning Yang,Liang qingchun,Shaoliang Peng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This study develops a deep learning model named STAMP to improve the diagnosis of STAS in lung adenocarcinoma through multi-center histopathology images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The primary motivation is to address the labor-intensive, error-prone process of diagnosing STAS in lung adenocarcinoma by leveraging advanced deep learning techniques.

Method: The authors propose STAMP, a dual-branch deep learning framework with transformer-based encoding and multi-pattern attention modules, integrated with similarity regularization for accurate STAS diagnosis.

Result: STAMP demonstrated strong diagnostic performance across three datasets, achieving AUC scores of 0.8058, 0.8017, and 0.7928, outperforming clinical standards.

Conclusion: The study concludes that the STAMP model offers a robust, efficient, and accurate solution for diagnosing STAS in lung adenocarcinoma on multi-center histopathology images, potentially aiding clinical decision-making and improving outcomes.

Abstract: Spread through air spaces (STAS) constitutes a novel invasive pattern in lung
adenocarcinoma (LUAD), associated with tumor recurrence and diminished survival
rates. However, large-scale STAS diagnosis in LUAD remains a labor-intensive
endeavor, compounded by the propensity for oversight and misdiagnosis due to
its distinctive pathological characteristics and morphological features.
Consequently, there is a pressing clinical imperative to leverage deep learning
models for STAS diagnosis. This study initially assembled histopathological
images from STAS patients at the Second Xiangya Hospital and the Third Xiangya
Hospital of Central South University, alongside the TCGA-LUAD cohort. Three
senior pathologists conducted cross-verification annotations to construct the
STAS-SXY, STAS-TXY, and STAS-TCGA datasets. We then propose a multi-pattern
attention-aware multiple instance learning framework, named STAMP, to analyze
and diagnose the presence of STAS across multi-center histopathology images.
Specifically, the dual-branch architecture guides the model to learn
STAS-associated pathological features from distinct semantic spaces.
Transformer-based instance encoding and a multi-pattern attention aggregation
modules dynamically selects regions closely associated with STAS pathology,
suppressing irrelevant noise and enhancing the discriminative power of global
representations. Moreover, a similarity regularization constraint prevents
feature redundancy across branches, thereby improving overall diagnostic
accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrated that STAMP achieved competitive
diagnostic results on STAS-SXY, STAS-TXY and STAS-TCGA, with AUCs of 0.8058,
0.8017, and 0.7928, respectively, surpassing the clinical level.

### [151] [TweezeEdit: Consistent and Efficient Image Editing with Path Regularization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10498)
*Jianda Mao,Kaibo Wang,Yang Xiang,Kani Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TweezeEdit is a new image editing framework that avoids traditional tuning and inversion anchors, improving semantic preservation and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current large-scale diffusion models struggle to balance target prompt alignment and preservation of source image semantics, leading to inefficient and suboptimal editing.

Method: TweezeEdit regularizes the entire denoising process, rather than focusing on inversion anchors, and uses gradient-driven consistency models for efficient target prompt injection.

Result: TweezeEdit outperforms existing methods in maintaining semantics and aligning with target prompts, achieving faster editing in only 12 steps (1.6 seconds).

Conclusion: TweezeEdit showcases efficient and consistent image editing with significant improvements in performance and potential for real-time usage.

Abstract: Large-scale pre-trained diffusion models empower users to edit images through
text guidance. However, existing methods often over-align with target prompts
while inadequately preserving source image semantics. Such approaches generate
target images explicitly or implicitly from the inversion noise of the source
images, termed the inversion anchors. We identify this strategy as suboptimal
for semantic preservation and inefficient due to elongated editing paths. We
propose TweezeEdit, a tuning- and inversion-free framework for consistent and
efficient image editing. Our method addresses these limitations by regularizing
the entire denoising path rather than relying solely on the inversion anchors,
ensuring source semantic retention and shortening editing paths. Guided by
gradient-driven regularization, we efficiently inject target prompt semantics
along a direct path using a consistency model. Extensive experiments
demonstrate TweezeEdit's superior performance in semantic preservation and
target alignment, outperforming existing methods. Remarkably, it requires only
12 steps (1.6 seconds per edit), underscoring its potential for real-time
applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces an advanced optimization framework for 3D Gaussian splatting to improve real-time novel view synthesis, focusing on high-frequency details and discontinuities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address insufficient geometric constraints in 3D Gaussian splatting, which often lead to blurred reconstructions in regions with fine-grained textures and sharp discontinuities.

Method: The approach integrates multisample anti-aliasing (MSAA) with dual geometric constraints: adaptive weighting for under-reconstructed areas, and gradient differential constraints for boundary regularization.

Result: The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance in preserving high-frequency textures and sharp discontinuities, demonstrating statistically significant improvements in SSIM and LPIPS across multiple benchmarks.

Conclusion: The framework effectively enhances both detail preservation and rendering efficiency, overcoming limitations in earlier approaches and delivering superior visual quality in critical regions.

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D Gaussian splatting have significantly improved
real-time novel view synthesis, yet insufficient geometric constraints during
scene optimization often result in blurred reconstructions of fine-grained
details, particularly in regions with high-frequency textures and sharp
discontinuities. To address this, we propose a comprehensive optimization
framework integrating multisample anti-aliasing (MSAA) with dual geometric
constraints. Our system computes pixel colors through adaptive blending of
quadruple subsamples, effectively reducing aliasing artifacts in high-frequency
components. The framework introduces two constraints: (a) an adaptive weighting
strategy that prioritizes under-reconstructed regions through dynamic gradient
analysis, and (b) gradient differential constraints enforcing geometric
regularization at object boundaries. This targeted optimization enables the
model to allocate computational resources preferentially to critical regions
requiring refinement while maintaining global consistency. Extensive
experimental evaluations across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance in detail preservation, particularly in
preserving high-frequency textures and sharp discontinuities, while maintaining
real-time rendering efficiency. Quantitative metrics and perceptual studies
confirm statistically significant improvements over baseline approaches in both
structural similarity (SSIM) and perceptual quality (LPIPS).

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new method (SBDE) to generate high-quality defect images for bolt detection by leveraging segmentation and inpainting techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bolt defect detection is hampered by limited defect image data and imbalanced datasets, leading to poor detection performance.

Method: The authors developed a segmentation-driven framework called SBDE, which includes a custom segmentation model (Bolt-SAM) with enhancements like CLAHE-FFT Adapter and Multipart-Aware Mask Decoder. They also proposed MOD-LaMa to generate bolt defect images and an augmentation strategy (ERA) to integrate these images back into inspection datasets.

Result: Generated bolt defect images using SBDE outperformed existing image editing models and significantly enhanced defect detection performance in experiments.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses challenges in generating bolt defect data, showing strong potential for practical applications in improving defect detection.

Abstract: Bolt defect detection is critical to ensure the safety of transmission lines.
However, the scarcity of defect images and imbalanced data distributions
significantly limit detection performance. To address this problem, we propose
a segmentationdriven bolt defect editing method (SBDE) to augment the dataset.
First, a bolt attribute segmentation model (Bolt-SAM) is proposed, which
enhances the segmentation of complex bolt attributes through the CLAHE-FFT
Adapter (CFA) and Multipart- Aware Mask Decoder (MAMD), generating high-quality
masks for subsequent editing tasks. Second, a mask optimization module (MOD) is
designed and integrated with the image inpainting model (LaMa) to construct the
bolt defect attribute editing model (MOD-LaMa), which converts normal bolts
into defective ones through attribute editing. Finally, an editing recovery
augmentation (ERA) strategy is proposed to recover and put the edited defect
bolts back into the original inspection scenes and expand the defect detection
dataset. We constructed multiple bolt datasets and conducted extensive
experiments. Experimental results demonstrate that the bolt defect images
generated by SBDE significantly outperform state-of-the-art image editing
models, and effectively improve the performance of bolt defect detection, which
fully verifies the effectiveness and application potential of the proposed
method. The code of the project is available at

*Quang Nguyen,Nhat Le,Baoru Huang,Minh Nhat Vu,Chengcheng Tang,Van Nguyen,Ngan Le,Thieu Vo,Anh Nguyen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a new method to estimate human dance motion from egocentric video and music by introducing a dataset (EgoAIST++) and developing an advanced model (EgoMusic Motion Network) based on diffusion models and Mamba.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods focus on interpreting human dance motion from single sources such as egocentric video or music, while the combined estimation remains largely unexplored. Tackling this challenge can enable better alignment between visual and musical inputs with practical applications.

Method: The paper introduces a large-scale dataset, EgoAIST++, that captures human dance from egocentric views along with music input. It leverages diffusion models and Skeleton Mamba to develop the EgoMusic Motion Network, which explicitly models the skeleton structure while performing motion alignment with visual and musical cues.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art approaches, showing robust generalization to real-world dance scenarios.

Conclusion: The method integrates egocentric views and music inputs to enhance dance motion prediction, supported by a novel dataset and architecture, promoting advancements in human motion estimation research and applications.

Abstract: Estimating human dance motion is a challenging task with various industrial
applications. Recently, many efforts have focused on predicting human dance
motion using either egocentric video or music as input. However, the task of
jointly estimating human motion from both egocentric video and music remains
largely unexplored. In this paper, we aim to develop a new method that predicts
human dance motion from both egocentric video and music. In practice, the
egocentric view often obscures much of the body, making accurate full-pose
estimation challenging. Additionally, incorporating music requires the
generated head and body movements to align well with both visual and musical
inputs. We first introduce EgoAIST++, a new large-scale dataset that combines
both egocentric views and music with more than 36 hours of dancing motion.
Drawing on the success of diffusion models and Mamba on modeling sequences, we
develop an EgoMusic Motion Network with a core Skeleton Mamba that explicitly
captures the skeleton structure of the human body. We illustrate that our
approach is theoretically supportive. Intensive experiments show that our
method clearly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches and generalizes
effectively to real-world data.

TL;DR: The paper surveys visual reasoning in computer vision, categorizing it into five types and analyzing methodologies, evaluation protocols, limitations, and future challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge gaps in the understanding and development of visual reasoning methodologies across different types and unify research directions.

Method: Categorizes visual reasoning types, reviews implementation strategies like graph-based models, memory networks, and others, analyzes evaluation protocols, and identifies limitations and challenges.

Result: Highlights shortcomings in current visual reasoning approaches, including scalability, integration of symbolic and neural paradigms, and benchmarks.

Conclusion: A unified perspective on visual reasoning will advance AI systems and is vital for trustworthy applications in areas like autonomous driving and medical diagnostics.

Abstract: Visual reasoning is critical for a wide range of computer vision tasks that
go beyond surface-level object detection and classification. Despite notable
advances in relational, symbolic, temporal, causal, and commonsense reasoning,
existing surveys often address these directions in isolation, lacking a unified
analysis and comparison across reasoning types, methodologies, and evaluation
protocols. This survey aims to address this gap by categorizing visual
reasoning into five major types (relational, symbolic, temporal, causal, and
commonsense) and systematically examining their implementation through
architectures such as graph-based models, memory networks, attention
mechanisms, and neuro-symbolic systems. We review evaluation protocols designed
to assess functional correctness, structural consistency, and causal validity,
and critically analyze their limitations in terms of generalizability,
reproducibility, and explanatory power. Beyond evaluation, we identify key open
challenges in visual reasoning, including scalability to complex scenes, deeper
integration of symbolic and neural paradigms, the lack of comprehensive
benchmark datasets, and reasoning under weak supervision. Finally, we outline a
forward-looking research agenda for next-generation vision systems, emphasizing
that bridging perception and reasoning is essential for building transparent,
trustworthy, and cross-domain adaptive AI systems, particularly in critical
domains such as autonomous driving and medical diagnostics.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents Med-GLIP-5M, a large-scale dataset with over 5.3 million annotations for medical image grounding, and introduces Med-GLIP, a framework trained on this dataset. The method achieves state-of-the-art results and enhances related tasks, such as medical VQA and report generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing challenges in medical image grounding include limited modality coverage, coarse-grained annotations, and the lack of a unified and generalizable framework.

Method: The authors create a comprehensive dataset, Med-GLIP-5M, for medical image annotation with hierarchical region labels, and develop Med-GLIP, a modality-aware framework leveraging this dataset for multi-granularity semantic understanding.

Result: Med-GLIP achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods in grounding benchmarks and significantly improves performance in related downstream tasks, such as medical VQA and report generation.

Conclusion: Med-GLIP and the Med-GLIP-5M dataset establish a versatile, high-performing foundation for medical image grounding and associated tasks, overcoming previous limitations.

Abstract: Medical image grounding aims to align natural language phrases with specific
regions in medical images, serving as a foundational task for intelligent
diagnosis, visual question answering (VQA), and automated report generation
(MRG). However, existing research is constrained by limited modality coverage,
coarse-grained annotations, and the absence of a unified, generalizable
grounding framework. To address these challenges, we construct a large-scale
medical grounding dataset Med-GLIP-5M comprising over 5.3 million region-level
annotations across seven imaging modalities, covering diverse anatomical
structures and pathological findings. The dataset supports both segmentation
and grounding tasks with hierarchical region labels, ranging from organ-level
boundaries to fine-grained lesions. Based on this foundation, we propose
Med-GLIP, a modality-aware grounding framework trained on Med-GLIP-5M. Rather
than relying on explicitly designed expert modules, Med-GLIP implicitly
acquires hierarchical semantic understanding from diverse training data --
enabling it to recognize multi-granularity structures, such as distinguishing
lungs from pneumonia lesions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Med-GLIP
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across multiple grounding

### [157] [GCRPNet: Graph-Enhanced Contextual and Regional Perception Network For Salient Object Detection in Optical Remote Sensing Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10542)
*Mengyu Ren,Yutong Li,Hua Li,Runmin Cong,Sam Kwong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces GCRPNet, a model for salient object detection in optical remote sensing images, tackling scale variation and low contrast challenges with innovative feature integration techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address challenges in salient object detection in optical remote sensing images, such as significant variation in target scales and low contrast between targets and the background.

Method: The paper proposes GCRPNet, using the VSS encoder for multi-scale features, DS-HGAM for strengthening cross-layer interactions, and the LEVSS block with adaptive scanning for enhanced feature representation.

Result: Extensive experiments show that the proposed GCRPNet achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: GCRPNet is effective and superior for salient object detection, combining global and local feature learning to overcome existing integration limitations.

Abstract: Salient object detection (SOD) in optical remote sensing images (ORSIs) faces
numerous challenges, including significant variations in target scales and low
contrast between targets and the background. Existing methods based on vision
transformers (ViTs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) architectures aim
to leverage both global and local features, but the difficulty in effectively
integrating these heterogeneous features limits their overall performance. To
overcome these limitations, we propose a graph-enhanced contextual and regional
perception network (GCRPNet), which builds upon the Mamba architecture to
simultaneously capture long-range dependencies and enhance regional feature
representation. Specifically, we employ the visual state space (VSS) encoder to
extract multi-scale features. To further achieve deep guidance and enhancement
of these features, we first design a difference-similarity guided hierarchical
graph attention module (DS-HGAM). This module strengthens cross-layer
interaction capabilities between features of different scales while enhancing
the model's structural perception,allowing it to distinguish between foreground
and background more effectively. Then, we design the LEVSS block as the decoder
of GCRPNet. This module integrates our proposed adaptive scanning strategy and
multi-granularity collaborative attention enhancement module (MCAEM). It
performs adaptive patch scanning on feature maps processed via multi-scale
convolutions, thereby capturing rich local region information and enhancing
Mamba's local modeling capability. Extensive experimental results demonstrate
that the proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance, validating its
effectiveness and superiority.

### [158] [PSScreen: Partially Supervised Multiple Retinal Disease Screening](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10549)
*Boyi Zheng,Qing Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces PSScreen, a model for retinal disease screening using partially labeled datasets. It tackles domain shifts and label absences with innovative dual-stream features, textual guidance, and pseudo label techniques, improving both in-domain and out-of-domain performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training models for retinal disease screening on partially labeled datasets reduces reliance on fully annotated data. However, challenges like domain shifts across datasets from different medical sites and lack of comprehensive labels hinder performance.

Method: PSScreen employs two streams: one for deterministic features and one for probabilistic features (with uncertainty injection). It uses textual guidance for feature decoupling and alignment via feature distillation, pseudo label consistency for label-absent classes, and self-distillation for transferring task-relevant semantics between streams.

Result: PSScreen achieves significant performance improvements in detecting six retinal diseases and the normal state. It also achieves state-of-the-art results across both in-domain and out-of-domain datasets.

Conclusion: The integrated strategies in PSScreen effectively address major challenges in using partially labeled datasets, advancing the field of retinal disease screening with robust performance.

Abstract: Leveraging multiple partially labeled datasets to train a model for multiple
retinal disease screening reduces the reliance on fully annotated datasets, but
remains challenging due to significant domain shifts across training datasets
from various medical sites, and the label absent issue for partial classes. To
solve these challenges, we propose PSScreen, a novel Partially Supervised
multiple retinal disease Screening model. Our PSScreen consists of two streams
and one learns deterministic features and the other learns probabilistic
features via uncertainty injection. Then, we leverage the textual guidance to
decouple two types of features into disease-wise features and align them via
feature distillation to boost the domain generalization ability. Meanwhile, we
employ pseudo label consistency between two streams to address the label absent
issue and introduce a self-distillation to transfer task-relevant semantics
about known classes from the deterministic to the probabilistic stream to
further enhance the detection performances. Experiments show that our PSScreen
significantly enhances the detection performances on six retinal diseases and
the normal state averagely and achieves state-of-the-art results on both
in-domain and out-of-domain datasets. Codes are available at

### [159] [AR Surgical Navigation With Surface Tracing: Comparing In-SitVisualization with Tool-Tracking Guidance for Neurosurgical Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10554)
*Marc J. Fischer,Jeffrey Potts,Gabriel Urreola,Dax Jones,Paolo Palmisciano,E. Bradley Strong,Branden Cord,Andrew D. Hernandez,Julia D. Sharma,E. Brandon Strong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel augmented reality (AR) surgical navigation system utilizing HoloLens 2, focusing on improving tool-tracking guidance during catheter placements on a phantom model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AR surgical systems face challenges with depth perception and occlusion handling, critical for precision in surgeries. The study aims to address these limitations for improved navigation.

Method: The system employs surface tracing for anatomical registration and uses real-time infrared tracking for catheter placement. It compares two guidance modes: static visualization and real-time tool tracking.

Result: Tool-tracking guidance demonstrated superior accuracy in insertion metrics like target deviation, angular error, and depth precision. Users preferred this mode based on usability and workload surveys.

Conclusion: This study validates the efficacy of improved AR guidance through real-time tracking in surgical navigation, demonstrating higher accuracy and user preference over static visualizations.

Abstract: Augmented Reality (AR) surgical navigation systems are emerging as the next
generation of intraoperative surgical guidance, promising to overcome
limitations of traditional navigation systems. However, known issues with AR
depth perception due to vergence-accommodation conflict and occlusion handling
limitations of the currently commercially available display technology present
acute challenges in surgical settings where precision is paramount. This study
presents a novel methodology for utilizing AR guidance to register anatomical
targets and provide real-time instrument navigation using placement of
simulated external ventricular drain catheters on a phantom model as the
clinical scenario. The system registers target positions to the patient through
a novel surface tracing method and uses real-time infrared tool tracking to aid
in catheter placement, relying only on the onboard sensors of the Microsoft
HoloLens 2. A group of intended users performed the procedure of simulated
insertions under two AR guidance conditions: static in-situ visualization,
where planned trajectories are overlaid directly onto the patient anatomy, and
real-time tool-tracking guidance, where live feedback of the catheter's pose is
provided relative to the plan. Following the insertion tests, computed
tomography scans of the phantom models were acquired, allowing for evaluation
of insertion accuracy, target deviation, angular error, and depth precision.
System Usability Scale surveys assessed user experience and cognitive workload.
Tool-tracking guidance improved performance metrics across all accuracy
measures and was preferred by users in subjective evaluations. A free copy of

### [160] [Retrieval-Augmented Prompt for OOD Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10556)
*Ruisong Han,Zongbo Han,Jiahao Zhang,Mingyue Cheng,Changqing Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new OOD detection method called Retrieval-Augmented Prompt (RAP), which enhances a pre-trained vision-language model's capability by using external knowledge for semantic supervision. This method achieves state-of-the-art results on large-scale OOD detection benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While OOD detection is crucial for reliable machine learning deployment, existing methods suffer from limited outlier information and insufficient semantic supervision, leading to suboptimal detection performance.

Method: RAP leverages pre-trained vision-language models and augments OOD detection by retrieving external textual knowledge. Descriptive words for outliers are identified during training and dynamically included in OOD prompts during testing.

Result: Experiments show RAP achieves state-of-the-art performance. Particularly, in 1-shot OOD detection on ImageNet-1k, it improves AUROC by 1.71% and reduces FPR95 by 7.05% compared to prior works.

Conclusion: RAP provides an innovative solution to enhance OOD detection by utilizing external knowledge for better semantic understanding, outperforming existing methods and validating the efficiency of its modular design.

Abstract: Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection is crucial for the reliable deployment of
machine learning models in-the-wild, enabling accurate identification of test
samples that differ from the training data distribution. Existing methods rely
on auxiliary outlier samples or in-distribution (ID) data to generate outlier
information for training, but due to limited outliers and their mismatch with
real test OOD samples, they often fail to provide sufficient semantic
supervision, leading to suboptimal performance. To address this, we propose a
novel OOD detection method called Retrieval-Augmented Prompt (RAP). RAP
augments a pre-trained vision-language model's prompts by retrieving external
knowledge, offering enhanced semantic supervision for OOD detection. During
training, RAP retrieves descriptive words for outliers based on joint
similarity with external textual knowledge and uses them to augment the model's
OOD prompts. During testing, RAP dynamically updates OOD prompts in real-time
based on the encountered OOD samples, enabling the model to rapidly adapt to
the test environment. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that RAP achieves
state-of-the-art performance on large-scale OOD detection benchmarks. For
example, in 1-shot OOD detection on the ImageNet-1k dataset, RAP reduces the
average FPR95 by 7.05% and improves the AUROC by 1.71% compared to previous
methods. Additionally, comprehensive ablation studies validate the
effectiveness of each module and the underlying motivations of our approach.

### [161] [PTQAT: A Hybrid Parameter-Efficient Quantization Algorithm for 3D Perception Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10557)
*Xinhao Wang,Zhiwei Lin,Zhongyu Xia,Yongtao Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces PTQAT, a hybrid quantization algorithm combining elements of Post-Training Quantization and Quantization-Aware Training to improve performance and efficiency in 3D perception models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address limitations in PTQ and QAT, including performance degradation in PTQ and high resource requirements in QAT.

Method: PTQAT applies QAT fine-tuning selectively to critical layers while performing PTQ on the rest. Fine-tuning targets layers with smaller quantization discrepancies for better accuracy compensation.

Result: PTQAT achieves similar or better performance than QAT across various quantization levels and model architectures, demonstrating consistent gains in metrics like NDS, mAP, and mIoU across 3D perception tasks.

Conclusion: PTQAT delivers efficient and effective quantization for 3D networks, merging the strengths of PTQ and QAT while reducing resource demands.

Abstract: Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) and Quantization-Aware Training (QAT)
represent two mainstream model quantization approaches. However, PTQ often
leads to unacceptable performance degradation in quantized models, while QAT
imposes substantial GPU memory requirements and extended training time due to
weight fine-tuning.In this paper, we propose PTQAT, a novel general hybrid
quantization algorithm for the efficient deployment of 3D perception networks.
To address the speed accuracy trade-off between PTQ and QAT, our method selects
critical layers for QAT fine-tuning and performs PTQ on the remaining layers.
Contrary to intuition, fine-tuning the layers with smaller output discrepancies
before and after quantization, rather than those with larger discrepancies,
actually leads to greater improvements in the model's quantization accuracy.
This means we better compensate for quantization errors during their
propagation, rather than addressing them at the point where they occur. The
proposed PTQAT achieves similar performance to QAT with more efficiency by
freezing nearly 50% of quantifiable layers. Additionally, PTQAT is a universal
quantization method that supports various quantization bit widths (4 bits) as
well as different model architectures, including CNNs and Transformers. The
experimental results on nuScenes across diverse 3D perception tasks, including
object detection, semantic segmentation, and occupancy prediction, show that
our method consistently outperforms QAT-only baselines. Notably, it achieves
0.2%-0.9% NDS and 0.3%-1.0% mAP gains in object detection, 0.3%-2.0% mIoU gains
in semantic segmentation and occupancy prediction while fine-tuning fewer
weights.

*Shiyu Liu,Kui Jiang,Xianming Liu,Hongxun Yao,Xiaocheng Feng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HM-Talker integrates explicit articulatory priors with implicit features using a Cross-Modal Disentanglement Module and Hybrid Motion Modeling Module, achieving higher lip-sync accuracy and visual quality in audio-driven talking head generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current audio-driven talking head generation methods suffer from issues like motion blur and lip jitter due to their reliance on implicit modeling and lack of anatomical guidance.

Method: HM-Talker employs a hybrid motion representation combining action units (explicit cues) with implicit motion features, alongside modules for disentangling complementary motion inputs and enforcing identity-agnostic feature integration.

Result: The framework demonstrates superiority in visual quality and lip-sync accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods, as validated by experiments.

Conclusion: HM-Talker advances talking head video synthesis by effectively addressing limitations like phoneme-viseme misalignment and improving temporal coherence across diverse identities.

Abstract: Audio-driven talking head video generation enhances user engagement in
human-computer interaction. However, current methods frequently produce videos
with motion blur and lip jitter, primarily due to their reliance on implicit
modeling of audio-facial motion correlations--an approach lacking explicit
articulatory priors (i.e., anatomical guidance for speech-related facial
movements). To overcome this limitation, we propose HM-Talker, a novel
framework for generating high-fidelity, temporally coherent talking heads.
HM-Talker leverages a hybrid motion representation combining both implicit and
explicit motion cues. Explicit cues use Action Units (AUs), anatomically
defined facial muscle movements, alongside implicit features to minimize
phoneme-viseme misalignment. Specifically, our Cross-Modal Disentanglement
Module (CMDM) extracts complementary implicit/explicit motion features while
predicting AUs directly from audio input aligned to visual cues. To mitigate
identity-dependent biases in explicit features and enhance cross-subject
generalization, we introduce the Hybrid Motion Modeling Module (HMMM). This
module dynamically merges randomly paired implicit/explicit features, enforcing
identity-agnostic learning. Together, these components enable robust lip
synchronization across diverse identities, advancing personalized talking head
synthesis. Extensive experiments demonstrate HM-Talker's superiority over
state-of-the-art methods in visual quality and lip-sync accuracy.

Motivation: Leverage the success of foundational models in computer vision, specifically SAM, to address challenges in remote sensing change detection, such as handling multi-scale changes and class imbalance.

Method: The authors adapt SAM's encoder via fine-tuning, integrate spatial-temporal feature enhancement (STFE) and multi-scale decoder fusion (MSDF), and introduce a novel cross-entropy masking (CEM) loss.

Result: The proposed approach surpasses state-of-the-art methods in four datasets (Levir-CD, WHU-CD, CLCD, and S2Looking) with a notable 2.5% improvement in F1-score on the S2Looking dataset.

Conclusion: Fine-tuning SAM with the proposed techniques (STFE, MSDF, CEM) significantly improves remote sensing change detection accuracy and robustness; the code is publicly available for further adoption.

Abstract: Foundational models have achieved significant success in diverse domains of
computer vision. They learn general representations that are easily
transferable to tasks not seen during training. One such foundational model is
Segment anything model (SAM), which can accurately segment objects in images.
We propose adapting the SAM encoder via fine-tuning for remote sensing change
detection (RSCD) along with spatial-temporal feature enhancement (STFE) and
multi-scale decoder fusion (MSDF) to detect changes robustly at multiple
scales. Additionally, we propose a novel cross-entropy masking (CEM) loss to
handle high class imbalance in change detection datasets. Our method
outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on four change detection datasets,
Levir-CD, WHU-CD, CLCD, and S2Looking. We achieved 2.5% F1-score improvement on
a large complex S2Looking dataset. The code is available at:

### [164] [Towards Agentic AI for Multimodal-Guided Video Object Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10572)
*Tuyen Tran,Thao Minh Le,Truyen Tran*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents Multi-Modal Agent, a system for referring-based video object segmentation that utilizes large language model reasoning for generating dynamic workflows, improving flexibility and performance over traditional and static pipeline methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current referring-based video object segmentation methods involve specialized models that demand significant computational resources and manual annotations. There is a need for a more flexible and adaptive solution leveraging advances in vision-language foundation models.

Method: The proposed Multi-Modal Agent employs large language models to create dynamic, task-specific workflows. It iteratively engages specialized tools for low-level multimodal tasks to identify target objects based on external cues.

Result: The agent shows superior performance compared to existing approaches on two multimodal-conditioned VOS tasks (RVOS and Ref-AVS), showcasing its flexibility and adaptability.

Conclusion: By employing reasoning from large language models and dynamic workflows, the Multi-Modal Agent surpasses the rigidity of traditional segmentation methods, offering an effective and adaptive solution for multimodal problems.

Abstract: Referring-based Video Object Segmentation is a multimodal problem that
requires producing fine-grained segmentation results guided by external cues.
Traditional approaches to this task typically involve training specialized
models, which come with high computational complexity and manual annotation
effort. Recent advances in vision-language foundation models open a promising
direction toward training-free approaches. Several studies have explored
leveraging these general-purpose models for fine-grained segmentation,
achieving performance comparable to that of fully supervised, task-specific
models. However, existing methods rely on fixed pipelines that lack the
flexibility needed to adapt to the dynamic nature of the task. To address this
limitation, we propose Multi-Modal Agent, a novel agentic system designed to
solve this task in a more flexible and adaptive manner. Specifically, our
method leverages the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to
generate dynamic workflows tailored to each input. This adaptive procedure
iteratively interacts with a set of specialized tools designed for low-level
tasks across different modalities to identify the target object described by
the multimodal cues. Our agentic approach demonstrates clear improvements over
prior methods on two multimodal-conditioned VOS tasks: RVOS and Ref-AVS.

*Zheng Qin,Ruobing Zheng,Yabing Wang,Tianqi Li,Yi Yuan,Jingdong Chen,Le Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces HumanSense, a benchmark to evaluate Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in human-centered scenarios, highlighting areas for improvement especially in advanced interaction tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to improve and effectively evaluate the human-centered perception and interaction capabilities of MLLMs for complex multimodal contexts and empathetic responses.

Method: HumanSense benchmark evaluates MLLMs by integrating multimodal contexts (visual, audio, text) and reinforcement learning for reasoning abilities. Also incorporates modality-progressive reinforcement learning and prompt design.

Result: Through the evaluation benchmark, MLLMs show potential but fall short on advanced interaction tasks. Enhancements are demonstrated with multimodal inputs and reasoning-based models, achieving improved empathetic and context-aware responses.

Conclusion: Improved reasoning processes, multimodal inputs, and carefully designed prompts can significantly enhance MLLM's interaction abilities, though further progress is needed for advanced tasks.

Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) show immense promise for
achieving truly human-like interactions, progress is hindered by the lack of
fine-grained evaluation frameworks for human-centered scenarios, encompassing
both the understanding of complex human intentions and the provision of
empathetic, context-aware responses. Here we introduce HumanSense, a
comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the human-centered perception and
interaction capabilities of MLLMs, with a particular focus on deep
understanding of extended multimodal contexts and the formulation of rational
feedback. Our evaluation reveals that leading MLLMs still have considerable
room for improvement, particularly for advanced interaction-oriented tasks.
Supplementing visual input with audio and text information yields substantial
improvements, and Omni-modal models show advantages on these tasks.
Furthermore, we argue that appropriate feedback stems from a contextual
analysis of the interlocutor's needs and emotions, with reasoning ability
serving as the key to unlocking it. Accordingly, we employ a multi-stage,
modality-progressive reinforcement learning to enhance the reasoning abilities
of an Omni model, achieving substantial gains on evaluation results.
Additionally, we observe that successful reasoning processes exhibit highly
consistent thought patterns. By designing corresponding prompts, we also
enhance the performance of non-reasoning models in a training-free manner.

TL;DR: The paper introduces EvTurb, a new turbulence removal framework using event streams to address image blur and distortions caused by atmospheric turbulence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle challenges in mitigating image degradation due to atmospheric turbulence, which harms computer vision tasks and is difficult to solve due to overlapping distortions.

Method: The EvTurb framework utilizes high-speed event streams in a novel two-step process: (1) reducing blur with event integrals and (2) correcting geometric distortions using a variance map.

Result: EvTurb outperforms current state-of-the-art solutions in turbulence removal while staying computationally efficient.

Conclusion: EvTurb demonstrates the potential of event-based approaches in handling complex atmospheric distortions and contributes with a new dataset, TurbEvent, for further advancements.

Abstract: Atmospheric turbulence degrades image quality by introducing blur and
geometric tilt distortions, posing significant challenges to downstream
computer vision tasks. Existing single-image and multi-frame methods struggle
with the highly ill-posed nature of this problem due to the compositional
complexity of turbulence-induced distortions. To address this, we propose
EvTurb, an event guided turbulence removal framework that leverages high-speed
event streams to decouple blur and tilt effects. EvTurb decouples blur and tilt
effects by modeling event-based turbulence formation, specifically through a
novel two-step event-guided network: event integrals are first employed to
reduce blur in the coarse outputs. This is followed by employing a variance
map, derived from raw event streams, to eliminate the tilt distortion for the
refined outputs. Additionally, we present TurbEvent, the first real-captured
dataset featuring diverse turbulence scenarios. Experimental results
demonstrate that EvTurb surpasses state-of-the-art methods while maintaining
computational efficiency.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces P$^3$A, an advanced patch attack framework for 2D object detection in autonomous driving, optimizing attack effectiveness and transferability for high-resolution data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address vulnerabilities in learning-based autonomous driving systems caused by adversarial patches, focusing on realistic attack scenarios and improving attack transferability to high-resolution datasets.

Method: The authors propose P$^3$A, featuring a novel metric, Practical Attack Success Rate (PASR), a tailored Localization-Confidence Suppression Loss (LCSL), and a data preprocessing step, Probabilistic Scale-Preserving Padding (PSPP), to improve attack effectiveness and transferability.

Result: Experiments show that P$^3$A achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art models, enhancing attack transferability and effectiveness under both PASR and previous mAP-based metrics.

Conclusion: The framework improves attack accuracy and transferability while addressing safety concerns in realistic high-resolution autonomous driving scenarios.

Abstract: Learning-based autonomous driving systems remain critically vulnerable to
adversarial patches, posing serious safety and security risks in their
real-world deployment. Black-box attacks, notable for their high attack success
rate without model knowledge, are especially concerning, with their
transferability extensively studied to reduce computational costs compared to
query-based attacks. Previous transferability-based black-box attacks typically
adopt mean Average Precision (mAP) as the evaluation metric and design training
loss accordingly. However, due to the presence of multiple detected bounding
boxes and the relatively lenient Intersection over Union (IoU) thresholds, the
attack effectiveness of these approaches is often overestimated, resulting in
reduced success rates in practical attacking scenarios. Furthermore, patches
trained on low-resolution data often fail to maintain effectiveness on
high-resolution images, limiting their transferability to autonomous driving
datasets. To fill this gap, we propose P$^3$A, a Powerful and Practical Patch
Attack framework for 2D object detection in autonomous driving, specifically
optimized for high-resolution datasets. First, we introduce a novel metric,
Practical Attack Success Rate (PASR), to more accurately quantify attack
effectiveness with greater relevance for pedestrian safety. Second, we present
a tailored Localization-Confidence Suppression Loss (LCSL) to improve attack
transferability under PASR. Finally, to maintain the transferability for
high-resolution datasets, we further incorporate the Probabilistic
Scale-Preserving Padding (PSPP) into the patch attack pipeline as a data
preprocessing step. Extensive experiments show that P$^3$A outperforms
state-of-the-art attacks on unseen models and unseen high-resolution datasets,
both under the proposed practical IoU-based evaluation metric and the previous
mAP-based metrics.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces Frequency-Guided Attention (FGA), an advanced upsampling module for single image super-resolution that enhances detail preservation and reduces artifacts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome limitations of existing upsampling methods, such as Sub-Pixel Convolution, which struggle with reconstructing fine details and introduce aliasing artifacts.

Method: The method combines three key innovations: (1) a Fourier feature-based Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) for encoding frequency, (2) a cross-resolution Correlation Attention Layer for spatial alignment, and (3) a frequency-domain L1 loss for spectral fidelity.

Result: The method adds only 0.3M extra parameters while significantly improving super-resolution backbones, achieving 0.12~0.14 dB PSNR gains and up to 29% better frequency-domain consistency, especially in texture-rich cases.

Conclusion: FGA is a lightweight and effective solution to super-resolution challenges, reducing aliasing, enhancing detail, and outperforming traditional upsampling methods in various settings.

Abstract: We propose Frequency-Guided Attention (FGA), a lightweight upsampling module
for single image super-resolution. Conventional upsamplers, such as Sub-Pixel
Convolution, are efficient but frequently fail to reconstruct high-frequency
details and introduce aliasing artifacts. FGA addresses these issues by
integrating (1) a Fourier feature-based Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) for
positional frequency encoding, (2) a cross-resolution Correlation Attention
Layer for adaptive spatial alignment, and (3) a frequency-domain L1 loss for
spectral fidelity supervision. Adding merely 0.3M parameters, FGA consistently
enhances performance across five diverse super-resolution backbones in both
lightweight and full-capacity scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate
average PSNR gains of 0.12~0.14 dB and improved frequency-domain consistency by
up to 29%, particularly evident on texture-rich datasets. Visual and spectral
evaluations confirm FGA's effectiveness in reducing aliasing and preserving
fine details, establishing it as a practical, scalable alternative to
traditional upsampling methods.

Motivation: Metal artifacts in CT imaging caused by high-density metallic implants degrade image quality and hinder diagnosis and treatment. Existing deep learning algorithms fail to balance artifact suppression and structural preservation.

Method: The authors propose FIND-Net, a hybrid framework combining Fast Fourier Convolution (FFC) layers and trainable Gaussian filtering to process MAR tasks in both spatial and frequency domains, improving global context and frequency selectivity.

Result: Experiments on synthetic datasets show FIND-Net achieves a 3.07% MAE reduction, 0.18% SSIM increase, and 0.90% PSNR improvement over state-of-the-art methods. Real-world evaluations demonstrate effective artifact suppression with minimal harm to clean anatomical regions.

Conclusion: FIND-Net improves MAR by integrating spatial and frequency domain processing. It achieves superior artifact suppression and structural preservation, advancing clinical applicability and outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Metal artifacts, caused by high-density metallic implants in computed
tomography (CT) imaging, severely degrade image quality, complicating diagnosis
and treatment planning. While existing deep learning algorithms have achieved
notable success in Metal Artifact Reduction (MAR), they often struggle to
suppress artifacts while preserving structural details. To address this
challenge, we propose FIND-Net (Fourier-Integrated Network with Dictionary
Kernels), a novel MAR framework that integrates frequency and spatial domain
processing to achieve superior artifact suppression and structural
preservation. FIND-Net incorporates Fast Fourier Convolution (FFC) layers and
trainable Gaussian filtering, treating MAR as a hybrid task operating in both
spatial and frequency domains. This approach enhances global contextual
understanding and frequency selectivity, effectively reducing artifacts while
maintaining anatomical structures. Experiments on synthetic datasets show that
FIND-Net achieves statistically significant improvements over state-of-the-art
MAR methods, with a 3.07% MAE reduction, 0.18% SSIM increase, and 0.90% PSNR
improvement, confirming robustness across varying artifact complexities.
Furthermore, evaluations on real-world clinical CT scans confirm FIND-Net's
ability to minimize modifications to clean anatomical regions while effectively
suppressing metal-induced distortions. These findings highlight FIND-Net's
potential for advancing MAR performance, offering superior structural
preservation and improved clinical applicability. Code is available at

Method: Chamfer Guidance leverages a few real exemplar images to guide image generation. It enhances distributional diversity and quality without requiring unconditional models, thus reducing computational costs.

Result: The method achieves state-of-the-art performance with as few as 2 to 32 real images, significantly enhancing precision (up to 97.5%) and distributional coverage (up to 92.7%) for synthetic data. It also improves downstream classifier accuracy by up to 16% while reducing computational costs by 31%.

Conclusion: Chamfer Guidance offers a practical and efficient solution for improving synthetic training data quality and diversity, benefiting downstream tasks and reducing resource demands.

Abstract: Conditional image generative models hold considerable promise to produce
infinite amounts of synthetic training data. Yet, recent progress in generation
quality has come at the expense of generation diversity, limiting the utility
of these models as a source of synthetic training data. Although guidance-based
approaches have been introduced to improve the utility of generated data by
focusing on quality or diversity, the (implicit or explicit) utility functions
oftentimes disregard the potential distribution shift between synthetic and
real data. In this work, we introduce Chamfer Guidance: a training-free
guidance approach which leverages a handful of real exemplar images to
characterize the quality and diversity of synthetic data. We show that by
leveraging the proposed Chamfer Guidance, we can boost the diversity of the
generations w.r.t. a dataset of real images while maintaining or improving the
generation quality on ImageNet-1k and standard geo-diversity benchmarks. Our
approach achieves state-of-the-art few-shot performance with as little as 2
exemplar real images, obtaining 96.4\% in terms of precision, and 86.4\% in
terms of distributional coverage, which increase to 97.5\% and 92.7\%,
respectively, when using 32 real images. We showcase the benefits of the
Chamfer Guidance generation by training downstream image classifiers on
synthetic data, achieving accuracy boost of up to 15\% for in-distribution over
the baselines, and up to 16\% in out-of-distribution. Furthermore, our approach
does not require using the unconditional model, and thus obtains a 31\%
reduction in FLOPs w.r.t. classifier-free-guidance-based approaches at sampling
time.

### [171] [ChatENV: An Interactive Vision-Language Model for Sensor-Guided Environmental Monitoring and Scenario Simulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10635)
*Hosam Elgendy,Ahmed Sharshar,Ahmed Aboeitta,Mohsen Guizani*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ChatENV is an interactive vision-language model (VLM) that reasons over satellite images and sensor data with advanced temporal and scenario-based capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve environmental monitoring by addressing shortcomings in current VLMs, such as overlooking sensor data, single-source captions, and lack of interactive reasoning.

Method: Developed ChatENV using a 177k-image dataset with temporal pairs and sensor metadata, annotated with GPT-4o and Gemini 2.0, and fine-tuned with LoRA adapters for interactive chat purposes.

Result: ChatENV achieved strong performance in temporal and 'what-if' reasoning (BERT-F1 0.903) and outperformed existing temporal models in many cases.

Conclusion: ChatENV provides an advanced tool for sensor-aware, grounded environmental monitoring and interactive analysis.

Abstract: Understanding environmental changes from aerial imagery is vital for climate
resilience, urban planning, and ecosystem monitoring. Yet, current vision
language models (VLMs) overlook causal signals from environmental sensors, rely
on single-source captions prone to stylistic bias, and lack interactive
scenario-based reasoning. We present ChatENV, the first interactive VLM that
jointly reasons over satellite image pairs and real-world sensor data. Our
framework: (i) creates a 177k-image dataset forming 152k temporal pairs across
62 land-use classes in 197 countries with rich sensor metadata (e.g.,
temperature, PM10, CO); (ii) annotates data using GPT- 4o and Gemini 2.0 for
stylistic and semantic diversity; and (iii) fine-tunes Qwen-2.5-VL using
efficient Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) adapters for chat purposes. ChatENV
achieves strong performance in temporal and "what-if" reasoning (e.g., BERT-F1
0.903) and rivals or outperforms state-of-the-art temporal models, while
supporting interactive scenario-based analysis. This positions ChatENV as a
powerful tool for grounded, sensor-aware environmental monitoring.

*Ryan Ramos,Vladan Stojnić,Giorgos Kordopatis-Zilos,Yuta Nakashima,Giorgos Tolias,Noa Garcia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper explores how subtle or invisible image acquisition process parameters impact visual encoders. Results indicate these parameters are encoded in learned representations and influence semantic predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the robustness of visual encoders to subtle distribution shifts from image acquisition parameters and transformations.

Method: The study analyzes visual encoders' behavior with respect to parameters in image acquisition and tests their correlation or anti-correlation with semantic labels, examining the impact on predictions.

Result: Subtle acquisition parameters are systematically encoded in visual representations, significantly affecting semantic predictions depending on their correlation with labels.

Conclusion: Image acquisition parameters, even imperceptible ones, influence learned visual representations and semantic predictions, highlighting the need for broader robustness analysis.

Abstract: Prior work has analyzed the robustness of visual encoders to image
transformations and corruptions, particularly in cases where such alterations
are not seen during training. When this occurs, they introduce a form of
distribution shift at test time, often leading to performance degradation. The
primary focus has been on severe corruptions that, when applied aggressively,
distort useful signals necessary for accurate semantic predictions.
  We take a different perspective by analyzing parameters of the image
acquisition process and transformations that may be subtle or even
imperceptible to the human eye. We find that such parameters are systematically
encoded in the learned visual representations and can be easily recovered. More
strikingly, their presence can have a profound impact, either positively or
negatively, on semantic predictions. This effect depends on whether there is a
strong correlation or anti-correlation between semantic labels and these
acquisition-based or processing-based labels. Our code and data are available

*Helena Russello,Rik van der Tol,Eldert J. van Henten,Gert Kootstra*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel approach to detect lameness in cows by combining pose estimation and BLSTM neural networks, achieving 85% accuracy with minimal video data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to develop a reliable, markerless, efficient, and automated system to detect lameness in cows since existing methods rely heavily on manual feature engineering and are less efficient.

Method: The method involves extracting motion sequences from videos using the T-LEAP pose estimation model and classifying lameness using a BLSTM neural network based on the trajectories of keypoints from the videos.

Result: The proposed method achieved an 85% classification accuracy, outperforming an established feature-based approach with 80% accuracy. It also demonstrated the capability to detect lameness using just one second of video data.

Conclusion: The combination of pose estimation and BLSTM classifier is a highly effective and efficient method for detecting lameness in cows, reducing dependency on manual feature engineering and lengthy datasets.

Abstract: This study presents a lameness detection approach that combines pose
estimation and Bidirectional Long-Short-Term Memory (BLSTM) neural networks.
Combining pose-estimation and BLSTMs classifier offers the following
advantages: markerless pose-estimation, elimination of manual feature
engineering by learning temporal motion features from the keypoint
trajectories, and working with short sequences and small training datasets.
Motion sequences of nine keypoints (located on the cows' hooves, head and back)
were extracted from videos of walking cows with the T-LEAP pose estimation
model. The trajectories of the keypoints were then used as an input to a BLSTM
classifier that was trained to perform binary lameness classification. Our
method significantly outperformed an established method that relied on
manually-designed locomotion features: our best architecture achieved a
classification accuracy of 85%, against 80% accuracy for the feature-based
approach. Furthermore, we showed that our BLSTM classifier could detect
lameness with as little as one second of video data.

*Xiao Shi,Yangjun Ou,Zhenzhong Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Semantic Prompt Tuning (SemPT), a method utilizing shared visual attributes to enhance transfer learning for unseen categories, demonstrating superior performance across diverse benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of enabling Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to generalize effectively to unseen categories, especially when existing prompt tuning methods fail to maintain coherent and transferable knowledge representations.

Method: SemPT employs a two-step strategy: extracting shared visual attributes to create coherent attribute-level descriptions, applying visually guided weighting to text embeddings for noise reduction, and dynamically aligning these embeddings with image embeddings for balanced generalization.

Result: SemPT surpasses prior methods in various benchmark settings, including unseen category generalization, cross-dataset transfer, cross-domain adaptation, and few-shot learning.

Conclusion: Semantic Prompt Tuning improves category transferability and adaptability of Vision-Language Models, strengthening their performance across seen and unseen categories by leveraging shared attribute-level knowledge in prompts.

Abstract: Visual transfer learning for unseen categories presents an active research
topic yet a challenging task, due to the inherent conflict between preserving
category-specific representations and acquiring transferable knowledge.
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) pre-trained on large amounts of image-text pairs
offer a promising solution. However, existing prompt tuning methods rely on
sparse category labels or disparate LLM-generated descriptions, which fragment
knowledge representation and hinder transferability. To address this
limitation, we introduce Semantic Prompt Tuning (SemPT), a novel framework that
tackles the generalization challenge by leveraging shared attribute-level
knowledge across categories. Specifically, SemPT adopts a two-step prompting
strategy to guide LLM in extracting shared visual attributes and generating
attribute-level descriptions, capturing transferable semantic cues beyond
labels while ensuring coherent structure. Then, visually guided weighting is
applied to the embeddings of attribute-level descriptions to reduce noise from
irrelevant attributes and enhance the text embeddings. Additionally, image
embeddings are jointly aligned with both label and attribute-enhanced text
embeddings, balancing discrimination for seen categories and transferability to
unseen ones. Considering the availability of category exposure, our inference
dynamically selects between standard label embeddings for seen categories and
attribute-enhanced embeddings for unseen ones to ensure effective adaptation.
Extensive experiments on 15 benchmark datasets demonstrate that SemPT achieves
state-of-the-art performance across various settings, including base-to-novel
generalization, cross-dataset transfer, cross-domain transfer, and few-shot
learning.

### [175] [Serial Over Parallel: Learning Continual Unification for Multi-Modal Visual Object Tracking and Benchmarking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10655)
*Zhangyong Tang,Tianyang Xu,Xuefeng Zhu,Chunyang Cheng,Tao Zhou,Xiaojun Wu,Josef Kittler*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper addresses the inconsistency in multi-modal visual object tracking (MMVOT) evaluations by introducing UniBench300, a unified benchmark, and reformulating the unification process with continual learning (CL), reducing performance degradation and offering significant insights for MMVOT.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to resolve inconsistencies between training and testing in MMVOT tasks due to the lack of a unified benchmark, which leads to performance degradation and inefficiency in current systems.

Method: The paper introduces UniBench300, a unified benchmark combining data from multiple MMVOT tasks, and structures a serial unification process inspired by continual learning to mitigate knowledge forgetting and improve task integration.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniBench300 bridges training-testing inconsistencies, reduces inference passes by 66% (from 3 to 1), cuts inference time by 27%, and supports a more stable unification process with continual learning.

Conclusion: The study highlights the effectiveness of UniBench300 in unifying MMVOT tasks and mitigating performance degradation. Findings show degradation is linked to network capacity and modality differences (e.g., RGBT suffers more). This framework paves the way for more robust multi-modal vision research.

Abstract: Unifying multiple multi-modal visual object tracking (MMVOT) tasks draws
increasing attention due to the complementary nature of different modalities in
building robust tracking systems. Existing practices mix all data sensor types
in a single training procedure, structuring a parallel paradigm from the
data-centric perspective and aiming for a global optimum on the joint
distribution of the involved tasks. However, the absence of a unified benchmark
where all types of data coexist forces evaluations on separated benchmarks,
causing \textit{inconsistency} between training and testing, thus leading to
performance \textit{degradation}. To address these issues, this work advances
in two aspects: \ding{182} A unified benchmark, coined as UniBench300, is
introduced to bridge the inconsistency by incorporating multiple task data,
reducing inference passes from three to one and cutting time consumption by
27\%. \ding{183} The unification process is reformulated in a serial format,
progressively integrating new tasks. In this way, the performance degradation
can be specified as knowledge forgetting of previous tasks, which naturally
aligns with the philosophy of continual learning (CL), motivating further
exploration of injecting CL into the unification process. Extensive experiments
conducted on two baselines and four benchmarks demonstrate the significance of
UniBench300 and the superiority of CL in supporting a stable unification
process. Moreover, while conducting dedicated analyses, the performance
degradation is found to be negatively correlated with network capacity.
Additionally, modality discrepancies contribute to varying degradation levels
across tasks (RGBT > RGBD > RGBE in MMVOT), offering valuable insights for
future multi-modal vision research. Source codes and the proposed benchmark is
available at \textit{https://github.com/Zhangyong-Tang/UniBench300}.

*Shixiong Xu,Chenghao Zhang,Lubin Fan,Yuan Zhou,Bin Fan,Shiming Xiang,Gaofeng Meng,Jieping Ye*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces AddressVLM, a model for fine-grained street-level localization using street-view and satellite images, achieving over 9% and 12% improvement in accuracy on datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LVLMs perform well in coarse geo-localization but falter in precise, street-level localization, prompting a need to enhance their capacity for fine-grained urban address identification.

Method: The authors use street-view images combined with satellite images through a cross-view alignment mechanism, automatic label generation, and a two-stage training protocol to improve localization tasks.

Result: AddressVLM enhances address localization accuracy on datasets from Pittsburgh and San Francisco by over 9% and 12%, surpassing other LVLMs.

Conclusion: The integration of satellite imagery and advanced training protocols significantly boosts the fine-grained address localization capabilities of LVLMs, enhancing their potential in geo-localization applications.

Abstract: Large visual language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance
in coarse-grained geo-localization at the country or city level, but they
struggle with fine-grained street-level localization within urban areas. In
this paper, we explore integrating city-wide address localization capabilities
into LVLMs, facilitating flexible address-related question answering using
street-view images. A key challenge is that the street-view visual
question-and-answer (VQA) data provides only microscopic visual cues, leading
to subpar performance in fine-tuned models. To tackle this issue, we
incorporate perspective-invariant satellite images as macro cues and propose
cross-view alignment tuning including a satellite-view and street-view image
grafting mechanism, along with an automatic label generation mechanism. Then
LVLM's global understanding of street distribution is enhanced through
cross-view matching. Our proposed model, named AddressVLM, consists of
two-stage training protocols: cross-view alignment tuning and address
localization tuning. Furthermore, we have constructed two street-view VQA
datasets based on image address localization datasets from Pittsburgh and San
Francisco. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate that AddressVLM
outperforms counterpart LVLMs by over 9% and 12% in average address
localization accuracy on these two datasets, respectively.

*Feiran Li,Qianqian Xu,Shilong Bao,Boyu Han,Zhiyong Yang,Qingming Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper details a method to build a non-overlapping, high-quality face dataset for training face recognition models. It combined cleaning, augmentation, synthetic identity generation, and curriculum learning strategies for success in the DataCV ICCV Challenge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aimed to develop a face dataset that does not overlap with existing public datasets, improving face recognition model performance while meeting competition challenges.

Method: They used data cleaning with MoE (embedding clustering and GPT-4o verification), synthetic identity generation with Stable Diffusion refined by Vec2Face, and curriculum learning strategies to generate the dataset.

Result: Their dataset achieved 1st place in the competition, showcasing improved model performances at varying identity scales and ensuring non-overlap with existing datasets.

Conclusion: This hybrid and systematic approach proved effective, demonstrating that combining data cleaning, augmentation, synthetic identity generation, and structured training schedules enhances face recognition model training outcomes.

Abstract: In this paper, we present our approach to the DataCV ICCV Challenge, which
centers on building a high-quality face dataset to train a face recognition
model. The constructed dataset must not contain identities overlapping with any
existing public face datasets. To handle this challenge, we begin with a
thorough cleaning of the baseline HSFace dataset, identifying and removing
mislabeled or inconsistent identities through a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)
strategy combining face embedding clustering and GPT-4o-assisted verification.
We retain the largest consistent identity cluster and apply data augmentation
up to a fixed number of images per identity. To further diversify the dataset,
we generate synthetic identities using Stable Diffusion with prompt
engineering. As diffusion models are computationally intensive, we generate
only one reference image per identity and efficiently expand it using Vec2Face,
which rapidly produces 49 identity-consistent variants. This hybrid approach
fuses GAN-based and diffusion-based samples, enabling efficient construction of
a diverse and high-quality dataset. To address the high visual similarity among
synthetic identities, we adopt a curriculum learning strategy by placing them
early in the training schedule, allowing the model to progress from easier to
harder samples. Our final dataset contains 50 images per identity, and all
newly generated identities are checked with mainstream face datasets to ensure
no identity leakage. Our method achieves \textbf{1st place} in the competition,
and experimental results show that our dataset improves model performance
across 10K, 20K, and 100K identity scales. Code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces HyperTea, a novel method integrating CNNs, RNNs, and HGNNs to address moving infrared small target detection (MIRSTD) challenges, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Moving infrared small target detection poses challenges due to targets' small size, weak intensity, and complex motion patterns. Existing methods lack high-order spatiotemporal correlation modeling and multi-timescale feature extraction.

Method: HyperTea integrates CNNs, RNNs, and HGNNs, including three modules: GTEM for global temporal context enhancement, LTEM for local motion pattern capture, and TAM for addressing feature misalignment across scales.

Result: HyperTea demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on DAUB and IRDST datasets, effectively improving detection of moving infrared small targets.

Conclusion: HyperTea showcases the potential of hypergraphs in MIRSTD, offering a robust approach for detecting high-order spatiotemporal correlations, improving detection accuracy, and addressing multi-timescale feature misalignment.

Abstract: In practical application scenarios, moving infrared small target detection
(MIRSTD) remains highly challenging due to the target's small size, weak
intensity, and complex motion pattern. Existing methods typically only model
low-order correlations between feature nodes and perform feature extraction and
enhancement within a single temporal scale. Although hypergraphs have been
widely used for high-order correlation learning, they have received limited
attention in MIRSTD. To explore the potential of hypergraphs and enhance
multi-timescale feature representation, we propose HyperTea, which integrates
global and local temporal perspectives to effectively model high-order
spatiotemporal correlations of features. HyperTea consists of three modules:
the global temporal enhancement module (GTEM) realizes global temporal context
enhancement through semantic aggregation and propagation; the local temporal
enhancement module (LTEM) is designed to capture local motion patterns between
adjacent frames and then enhance local temporal context; additionally, we
further develop a temporal alignment module (TAM) to address potential
cross-scale feature misalignment. To our best knowledge, HyperTea is the first
work to integrate convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural
networks (RNNs), and hypergraph neural networks (HGNNs) for MIRSTD,
significantly improving detection performance. Experiments on DAUB and IRDST
demonstrate its state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. Our source codes are

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel method for T2 mapping in fetal brain MRI, which addresses challenges related to motion and scan efficiency using neural networks and physics-based regularization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable better characterization of the developing fetal brain through T2 mapping, especially at mid-field MRI (0.55T), despite challenges posed by motion and long scan times.

Method: The approach jointly reconstructs multi-echo data for T2 mapping using implicit neural representations and physics-informed regularization to model the T2 decay, mitigating motion and preserving precision.

Result: State-of-the-art performance is achieved on simulated and in vivo datasets, including the first fetal T2 mapping demonstration at 0.55T, suggesting reduction in required acquisitions.

Conclusion: The proposed method demonstrates its potential to optimize fetal T2 mapping, improving imaging efficiency and fidelity through intelligent data reconstruction.

Abstract: T2 mapping in fetal brain MRI has the potential to improve characterization
of the developing brain, especially at mid-field (0.55T), where T2 decay is
slower. However, this is challenging as fetal MRI acquisition relies on
multiple motion-corrupted stacks of thick slices, requiring slice-to-volume
reconstruction (SVR) to estimate a high-resolution (HR) 3D volume. Currently,
T2 mapping involves repeated acquisitions of these stacks at each echo time
(TE), leading to long scan times and high sensitivity to motion. We tackle this
challenge with a method that jointly reconstructs data across TEs, addressing
severe motion. Our approach combines implicit neural representations with a
physics-informed regularization that models T2 decay, enabling information
sharing across TEs while preserving anatomical and quantitative T2 fidelity. We
demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on simulated fetal brain and in vivo
adult datasets with fetal-like motion. We also present the first in vivo fetal
T2 mapping results at 0.55T. Our study shows potential for reducing the number
of stacks per TE in T2 mapping by leveraging anatomical redundancy.

TL;DR: This paper introduces IADGPT, a Few-Shot Industrial Anomaly Detection framework that simulates human-like reasoning for anomaly detection, localization, and reasoning on diverse industrial products.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to bridge the gap between general-purpose Large Vision-Language Models and their lack of industrial knowledge and reasoning capabilities necessary for Few-Shot Industrial Anomaly Detection (FS-IAD).

Method: The authors propose IADGPT with a three-stage progressive training strategy: acquiring industrial knowledge, building discrepancy awareness, and implementing in-context learning. The framework uses image and pixel-level anomaly detection techniques while incorporating language-based reasoning.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that IADGPT significantly improves anomaly detection performance and shows competitive results in anomaly localization and reasoning.

Conclusion: IADGPT is a promising solution for FS-IAD, offering human-like anomaly detection and reasoning capabilities, supported by a novel large-scale dataset with extensive annotations.

Abstract: Few-Shot Industrial Anomaly Detection (FS-IAD) has important applications in
automating industrial quality inspection. Recently, some FS-IAD methods based
on Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have been proposed with some
achievements through prompt learning or fine-tuning. However, existing LVLMs
focus on general tasks but lack basic industrial knowledge and reasoning
capabilities related to FS-IAD, making these methods far from specialized human
quality inspectors. To address these challenges, we propose a unified
framework, IADGPT, designed to perform FS-IAD in a human-like manner, while
also handling associated localization and reasoning tasks, even for diverse and
novel industrial products. To this end, we introduce a three-stage progressive
training strategy inspired by humans. Specifically, the first two stages
gradually guide IADGPT in acquiring fundamental industrial knowledge and
discrepancy awareness. In the third stage, we design an in-context
learning-based training paradigm, enabling IADGPT to leverage a few-shot image
as the exemplars for improved generalization to novel products. In addition, we
design a strategy that enables IADGPT to output image-level and pixel-level
anomaly scores using the logits output and the attention map, respectively, in
conjunction with the language output to accomplish anomaly reasoning. To
support our training, we present a new dataset comprising 100K images across
400 diverse industrial product categories with extensive attribute-level
textual annotations. Experiments indicate IADGPT achieves considerable
performance gains in anomaly detection and demonstrates competitiveness in
anomaly localization and reasoning. We will release our dataset in
camera-ready.

*Sehajdeep SIngh,A V Subramanyam*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents a lightweight framework to generate novel views from a single input image by leveraging a pretrained diffusion model and a camera pose-conditioned U-Net, addressing blurry reconstructions with a novel fusion strategy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Creating novel views from a single image is challenging due to the need for 3D extrapolation, occluded region detail inference, and multi-view consistency. Existing methods often require expensive training and struggle with generalization and blurry results, prompting the need for a more efficient approach.

Method: The proposed approach uses a DDIM-inverted latent obtained from the input image and incorporates a camera pose-conditioned translation U-Net (TUNet) to predict latents for target views. It introduces a fusion strategy based on DDIM noise correlations, which enhances detail retention before leveraging pretrained diffusion models for final image sampling.

Result: The method achieves state-of-the-art performance in synthesizing novel views, as demonstrated through extensive experiments on the MVImgNet dataset.

Conclusion: The proposed lightweight framework effectively utilizes pretrained diffusion models and innovative fusion techniques to overcome limitations of existing methods, offering superior novel view synthesis from a single image.

Abstract: Synthesizing novel views from a single input image is a challenging task. It
requires extrapolating the 3D structure of a scene while inferring details in
occluded regions, and maintaining geometric consistency across viewpoints. Many
existing methods must fine-tune large diffusion backbones using multiple views
or train a diffusion model from scratch, which is extremely expensive.
Additionally, they suffer from blurry reconstruction and poor generalization.
This gap presents the opportunity to explore an explicit lightweight view
translation framework that can directly utilize the high-fidelity generative
capabilities of a pretrained diffusion model while reconstructing a scene from
a novel view. Given the DDIM-inverted latent of a single input image, we employ
a camera pose-conditioned translation U-Net, TUNet, to predict the inverted
latent corresponding to the desired target view. However, the image sampled
using the predicted latent may result in a blurry reconstruction. To this end,
we propose a novel fusion strategy that exploits the inherent noise correlation
structure observed in DDIM inversion. The proposed fusion strategy helps
preserve the texture and fine-grained details. To synthesize the novel view, we
use the fused latent as the initial condition for DDIM sampling, leveraging the
generative prior of the pretrained diffusion model. Extensive experiments on
MVImgNet demonstrate that our method outperforms existing methods.

*Zhanwen Liu,Yujing Sun,Yang Wang,Nan Yang,Shengbo Eben Li,Xiangmo Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses the limitations of RGB cameras in poor lighting by introducing MCFNet, a network that fuses information from RGB and bio-inspired event cameras for improved object detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional RGB cameras struggle under complex lighting conditions like nighttime driving and tunnels, causing loss of image details necessary for effective object detection.

Method: The authors propose MCFNet, integrating RGB and event camera modalities. Key modules include ECM for temporal alignment using optical flow, EDUM for spatial enhancement, and CMM for adaptive feature fusion.

Result: MCFNet significantly outperformed existing methods, improving mAP50 by 7.4% and mAP metrics by 1.7% on the DSEC-Det dataset.

Conclusion: The integration of RGB and event camera inputs through MCFNet effectively enhances object detection under challenging lighting conditions, advancing high dynamic range image processing.

Abstract: The dynamic range limitation of conventional RGB cameras reduces global
contrast and causes loss of high-frequency details such as textures and edges
in complex traffic environments (e.g., nighttime driving, tunnels), hindering
discriminative feature extraction and degrading frame-based object detection.
To address this, we integrate a bio-inspired event camera with an RGB camera to
provide high dynamic range information and propose a motion cue fusion network
(MCFNet), which achieves optimal spatiotemporal alignment and adaptive
cross-modal feature fusion under challenging lighting. Specifically, an event
correction module (ECM) temporally aligns asynchronous event streams with image
frames via optical-flow-based warping, jointly optimized with the detection
network to learn task-aware event representations. The event dynamic upsampling
module (EDUM) enhances spatial resolution of event frames to match image
structures, ensuring precise spatiotemporal alignment. The cross-modal mamba
fusion module (CMM) uses adaptive feature fusion with a novel interlaced
scanning mechanism, effectively integrating complementary information for
robust detection. Experiments conducted on the DSEC-Det and PKU-DAVIS-SOD
datasets demonstrate that MCFNet significantly outperforms existing methods in
various poor lighting and fast moving traffic scenarios. Notably, on the
DSEC-Det dataset, MCFNet achieves a remarkable improvement, surpassing the best
existing methods by 7.4% in mAP50 and 1.7% in mAP metrics, respectively. The

Method: CountCluster partitions object cross-attention maps into clusters during inference, aligning them with an ideal spatial distribution for enhanced accuracy.

Result: Achieved an 18.5% improvement in object count accuracy compared to prior methods.

Conclusion: Using cross-attention clustering enables superior quantity control in generating images, addressing a key limitation in current models.

Abstract: Diffusion-based text-to-image generation models have demonstrated strong
performance in terms of image quality and diversity. However, they still
struggle to generate images that accurately reflect the number of objects
specified in the input prompt. Several approaches have been proposed that rely
on either external counting modules for iterative refinement or quantity
representations derived from learned tokens or latent features. However, they
still have limitations in accurately reflecting the specified number of objects
and overlook an important structural characteristic--The number of object
instances in the generated image is largely determined in the early timesteps
of the denoising process. To correctly reflect the object quantity for image
generation, the highly activated regions in the object cross-attention map at
the early timesteps should match the input object quantity, while each region
should be clearly separated. To address this issue, we propose
\textit{CountCluster}, a method that guides the object cross-attention map to
be clustered according to the specified object count in the input, without
relying on any external tools or additional training. The proposed method
partitions the object cross-attention map into $k$ clusters at inference time
based on attention scores, defines an ideal distribution in which each cluster
is spatially well-separated, and optimizes the latent to align with this target
distribution. Our method achieves an average improvement of 18.5\%p in object
count accuracy compared to existing methods, and demonstrates superior quantity
control performance across a variety of prompts. Code will be released at:

*Alexandre Brown,Glen Berseth*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SegDAC integrates advanced perception models into visual reinforcement learning to improve generalization and sample efficiency, achieving superior performance in challenging manipulation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenges in visual reinforcement learning, specifically the integration of perception models for better visual generalization and sample efficiency.

Method: Propose SegDAC, which uses SAM for segmenting objects, YOLO-World for semantic grounding, and a novel transformer-based architecture that dynamically selects relevant segments without human labels.

Result: SegDAC demonstrated significant improvement on a visual generalization benchmark, doubling prior performance in the hardest conditions and achieving better sample efficiency across tasks.

Conclusion: SegDAC effectively utilizes object-centric decomposition and semantic grounding to outperform previous methods in visual reinforcement learning with better generalization and efficiency.

Abstract: Visual reinforcement learning (RL) is challenging due to the need to learn
both perception and actions from high-dimensional inputs and noisy rewards.
Although large perception models exist, integrating them effectively into RL
for visual generalization and improved sample efficiency remains unclear. We
propose SegDAC, a Segmentation-Driven Actor-Critic method. SegDAC uses Segment
Anything (SAM) for object-centric decomposition and YOLO-World to ground
segments semantically via text prompts. It includes a novel transformer-based
architecture that supports a dynamic number of segments at each time step and
effectively learns which segments to focus on using online RL, without using
human labels. By evaluating SegDAC over a challenging visual generalization
benchmark using Maniskill3, which covers diverse manipulation tasks under
strong visual perturbations, we demonstrate that SegDAC achieves significantly
better visual generalization, doubling prior performance on the hardest setting
and matching or surpassing prior methods in sample efficiency across all
evaluated tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current autoregressive models for text-to-image generation face limitations such as computational heaviness due to diffusion models or quantization loss from vector quantization.

Method: The authors propose NextStep-1, pairing a 14B AR model with a 157M flow matching head, utilizing a next-token prediction approach for both discrete text tokens and continuous image tokens.

Conclusion: NextStep-1 showcases the power of a unified autoregressive approach and advances the field of text-to-image generation, with the commitment to release the code and models for community-driven research.

Abstract: Prevailing autoregressive (AR) models for text-to-image generation either
rely on heavy, computationally-intensive diffusion models to process continuous
image tokens, or employ vector quantization (VQ) to obtain discrete tokens with
quantization loss. In this paper, we push the autoregressive paradigm forward

TL;DR: The paper proposes neural networks for real-time inference on unfocused SAR data to enable on-board ship classification, alleviating bandwidth and latency issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the constraints of near-real-time maritime monitoring using SAR data due to bandwidth limitations and ground processing bottlenecks.

Method: Neural networks tailored for real-time inference on unfocused SAR data from Sentinel-1, tested with Stripmap and IW modes, and evaluated for FPGA deployment.

Result: One of the models demonstrates feasibility for on-board processing, capable of classifying ships and windmills correctly.

Conclusion: Using neural networks for SAR data processing on-board satellites is feasible and could reduce latency and bandwidth demands in maritime monitoring.

Abstract: Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data enables large-scale surveillance of
maritime vessels. However, near-real-time monitoring is currently constrained
by the need to downlink all raw data, perform image focusing, and subsequently
analyze it on the ground. On-board processing to generate higher-level products
could reduce the data volume that needs to be downlinked, alleviating bandwidth
constraints and minimizing latency. However, traditional image focusing and
processing algorithms face challenges due to the satellite's limited memory,
processing power, and computational resources. This work proposes and evaluates
neural networks designed for real-time inference on unfocused SAR data acquired
in Stripmap and Interferometric Wide (IW) modes captured with Sentinel-1. Our
results demonstrate the feasibility of using one of our models for on-board
processing and deployment on an FPGA. Additionally, by investigating a binary
classification task between ships and windmills, we demonstrate that target
classification is possible.

### [187] [Revisiting Cross-View Localization from Image Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10716)
*Panwang Xia,Qiong Wu,Lei Yu,Yi Liu,Mingtao Xiong,Lei Liang,Yongjun Zhang,Yi Wan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses cross-view localization, aiming to accurately match ground-view images to aerial views using improved methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for accurate cross-view localization arises in GNSS-denied environments, where existing methods fail to provide fine-grained image matching due to lack of strict correspondences.

Method: Two key innovations are proposed: (1) a Surface Model for accurate projection modeling, and (2) SimRefiner for refining similarity matrices without post-processing.

Result: Experimental validation showed substantial improvements in localization accuracy and image matching quality with the proposed method.

Conclusion: This approach sets new benchmarks in cross-view localization and introduces a valuable dataset (CVFM) for further research.

Abstract: Cross-view localization aims to estimate the 3 degrees of freedom pose of a
ground-view image by registering it to aerial or satellite imagery. It is
essential in GNSS-denied environments such as urban canyons and disaster zones.
Existing methods either regress poses directly or align features in a shared
bird's-eye view (BEV) space, both built upon accurate spatial correspondences
between perspectives. However, these methods fail to establish strict
cross-view correspondences, yielding only coarse or geometrically inconsistent
matches. Consequently, fine-grained image matching between ground and aerial
views remains an unsolved problem, which in turn constrains the
interpretability of localization results. In this paper, we revisit cross-view
localization from the perspective of cross-view image matching and propose a
novel framework that improves both matching and localization. Specifically, we
introduce a Surface Model to model visible regions for accurate BEV projection,
and a SimRefiner module to refine the similarity matrix through local-global
residual correction, eliminating the reliance on post-processing like RANSAC.
To further support research in this area, we introduce CVFM, the first
benchmark with 32,509 cross-view image pairs annotated with pixel-level
correspondences. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach
substantially improves both localization accuracy and image matching quality,
setting new baselines under extreme viewpoint disparity.

### [188] [Exploiting Discriminative Codebook Prior for Autoregressive Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10719)
*Longxiang Tang,Ruihang Chu,Xiang Wang,Yujin Han,Pingyu Wu,Chunming He,Yingya Zhang,Shiwei Zhang,Jiaya Jia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents DCPE, a method that improves image generation by better utilizing token similarity information from codebooks, outperforming k-means clustering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autoregressive image generation has been hampered by poor utilization of token similarity information in codebooks, with k-means clustering proving ineffective.

Method: The authors propose DCPE, which replaces k-means' centroid-based distance with instance-based distance and uses agglomerative merging to better handle token space irregularities.

Result: DCPE accelerates training by 42% for LlamaGen-B and enhances performance metrics like FID and IS.

Conclusion: DCPE effectively mines codebook priors, making it a plug-and-play solution to improve autoregressive image generation systems.

Abstract: Advanced discrete token-based autoregressive image generation systems first
tokenize images into sequences of token indices with a codebook, and then model
these sequences in an autoregressive paradigm. While autoregressive generative
models are trained only on index values, the prior encoded in the codebook,
which contains rich token similarity information, is not exploited. Recent
studies have attempted to incorporate this prior by performing naive k-means
clustering on the tokens, helping to facilitate the training of generative
models with a reduced codebook. However, we reveal that k-means clustering
performs poorly in the codebook feature space due to inherent issues, including
token space disparity and centroid distance inaccuracy. In this work, we
propose the Discriminative Codebook Prior Extractor (DCPE) as an alternative to
k-means clustering for more effectively mining and utilizing the token
similarity information embedded in the codebook. DCPE replaces the commonly
used centroid-based distance, which is found to be unsuitable and inaccurate
for the token feature space, with a more reasonable instance-based distance.
Using an agglomerative merging technique, it further addresses the token space
disparity issue by avoiding splitting high-density regions and aggregating
low-density ones. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DCPE is plug-and-play
and integrates seamlessly with existing codebook prior-based paradigms. With
the discriminative prior extracted, DCPE accelerates the training of
autoregressive models by 42% on LlamaGen-B and improves final FID and IS
performance.

### [189] [EgoCross: Benchmarking Multimodal Large Language Models for Cross-Domain Egocentric Video Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10729)
*Yanjun Li,Yuqian Fu,Tianwen Qian,Qi'ao Xu,Silong Dai,Danda Pani Paudel,Luc Van Gool,Xiaoling Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes EgoCross, a new benchmark to evaluate Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in cross-domain scenarios for egocentric video question answering (EgocentricQA), consisting of diverse realistic domains and QA tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MLLM benchmarks for EgocentricQA focus on common daily activities and do not address the challenges of domain shifts encountered in real-world applications.

Method: EgoCross features four challenging domains—surgery, industry, extreme sports, and animal perspective—and includes 1,000 QA pairs across 798 video clips, covering prediction, recognition, localization, and counting tasks. Each QA pair is evaluated in both OpenQA and CloseQA formats.

Result: Experiments show that current MLLMs have limited generalization capabilities when faced with cross-domain shifts, revealing performance gaps for non-daily activity domains.

Conclusion: The study highlights the need for domain-adaptive and robust egocentric video understanding; EgoCross is introduced as a foundation to facilitate research and improvements in this area.

Abstract: Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have
significantly pushed the frontier of egocentric video question answering
(EgocentricQA). However, existing benchmarks and studies are mainly limited to
common daily activities such as cooking and cleaning. In contrast, real-world
deployment inevitably encounters domain shifts, where target domains differ
substantially in both visual style and semantic content. To bridge this gap, we
introduce \textbf{EgoCross}, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the
cross-domain generalization of MLLMs in EgocentricQA. EgoCross covers four
diverse and challenging domains, including surgery, industry, extreme sports,
and animal perspective, representing realistic and high-impact application
scenarios. It comprises approximately 1,000 QA pairs across 798 video clips,
spanning four key QA tasks: prediction, recognition, localization, and
counting. Each QA pair provides both OpenQA and CloseQA formats to support
fine-grained evaluation. Extensive experiments show that most existing MLLMs,
whether general-purpose or egocentric-specialized, struggle to generalize to
domains beyond daily life, highlighting the limitations of current models.
Furthermore, we conduct several pilot studies, \eg, fine-tuning and
reinforcement learning, to explore potential improvements. We hope EgoCross and
our accompanying analysis will serve as a foundation for advancing
domain-adaptive, robust egocentric video understanding. Data and codes will be
released at:

*Luyao Tang,Kunze Huang,Chaoqi Chen,Yuxuan Yuan,Chenxin Li,Xiaotong Tu,Xinghao Ding,Yue Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper addresses the task of generalized category discovery (GCD) by introducing ConGCD, a novel framework that takes inspiration from human cognitive processes to recognize novel object categories effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GCD methods predominantly optimize objective functions without deeply mimicking human approaches to recognizing novel objects, creating a significant gap with natural perceptual abilities.

Method: The authors propose a method called ConGCD that models human-like processes by decomposing objects into visual primitives and using consensus units to dynamically integrate dominant and contextual class features for robust pattern recognition.

Result: ConGCD demonstrates superior performance on both coarse- and fine-grained benchmarks for category discovery, showing its efficacy as a consensus-aware framework.

Conclusion: The study concludes that ConGCD captures human-like perceptual processes through primitive representation and consensus mechanisms, bridging gaps in recognizing both known and novel object categories.

Abstract: Human perceptual systems excel at inducing and recognizing objects across
both known and novel categories, a capability far beyond current machine
learning frameworks. While generalized category discovery (GCD) aims to bridge
this gap, existing methods predominantly focus on optimizing objective
functions. We present an orthogonal solution, inspired by the human cognitive
process for novel object understanding: decomposing objects into visual
primitives and establishing cross-knowledge comparisons. We propose ConGCD,
which establishes primitive-oriented representations through high-level
semantic reconstruction, binding intra-class shared attributes via
deconstruction. Mirroring human preference diversity in visual processing,
where distinct individuals leverage dominant or contextual cues, we implement
dominant and contextual consensus units to capture class-discriminative
patterns and inherent distributional invariants, respectively. A consensus
scheduler dynamically optimizes activation pathways, with final predictions
emerging through multiplex consensus integration. Extensive evaluations across
coarse- and fine-grained benchmarks demonstrate ConGCD's effectiveness as a
consensus-aware paradigm. Code is available at github.com/lytang63/ConGCD.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to explore whether synthetically generated ocular images can serve as a strong foundation for training sclera-segmentation models, aiming to promote privacy-aware biometric techniques.

Method: A competition featuring two tracks—synthetic data only and mixed synthetic-real data—where nine research groups submitted diverse models evaluated across three datasets with synthetic and real-world images.

Result: Top-performing models trained entirely on synthetic data achieved competitive $F_1$ scores above $0.8$, while mixed data tracks showed improvement more due to methodology rather than real data inclusion.

Conclusion: Synthetic data holds significant promise for privacy-preserving biometric systems, reducing reliance on real-world data without compromising segmentation performance.

Abstract: This paper presents a summary of the 2025 Sclera Segmentation Benchmarking
Competition (SSBC), which focused on the development of privacy-preserving
sclera-segmentation models trained using synthetically generated ocular images.
The goal of the competition was to evaluate how well models trained on
synthetic data perform in comparison to those trained on real-world datasets.
The competition featured two tracks: $(i)$ one relying solely on synthetic data
for model development, and $(ii)$ one combining/mixing synthetic with (a
limited amount of) real-world data. A total of nine research groups submitted
diverse segmentation models, employing a variety of architectural designs,
including transformer-based solutions, lightweight models, and segmentation
networks guided by generative frameworks. Experiments were conducted across
three evaluation datasets containing both synthetic and real-world images,
collected under diverse conditions. Results show that models trained entirely
on synthetic data can achieve competitive performance, particularly when
dedicated training strategies are employed, as evidenced by the top performing
models that achieved $F_1$ scores of over $0.8$ in the synthetic data track.
Moreover, performance gains in the mixed track were often driven more by
methodological choices rather than by the inclusion of real data, highlighting
the promise of synthetic data for privacy-aware biometric development. The code

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents a novel framework for detecting symmetry axes by modeling them as geometric primitives (lines and points) with a dual-branch equivariant architecture, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Detecting symmetry in complex scenes is challenging using existing heatmap-based methods, which lack precision in identifying individual axes.

Method: The proposed framework uses a dual-branch dihedral group-equivariant architecture. For reflection symmetry, orientational anchors and reflectional matching are employed. For rotational symmetry, rotational matching compares angular intervals to detect centers.

Result: The framework achieves superior performance compared to existing techniques in symmetry axis detection through extensive experiments.

Conclusion: The proposed geometric primitive-based detection and specialized matching methods advance the precision and effectiveness of symmetry detection.

Abstract: Symmetry is a fundamental concept that has been extensively studied, yet
detecting it in complex scenes remains a significant challenge in computer
vision. Recent heatmap-based approaches can localize potential regions of
symmetry axes but often lack precision in identifying individual axes. In this
work, we propose a novel framework for axis-level detection of the two most
common symmetry types-reflection and rotation-by representing them as explicit
geometric primitives, i.e. lines and points. Our method employs a dual-branch
architecture that is equivariant to the dihedral group, with each branch
specialized to exploit the structure of dihedral group-equivariant features for
its respective symmetry type. For reflection symmetry, we introduce
orientational anchors, aligned with group components, to enable
orientation-specific detection, and a reflectional matching that measures
similarity between patterns and their mirrored counterparts across candidate
axes. For rotational symmetry, we propose a rotational matching that compares
patterns at fixed angular intervals to identify rotational centers. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance,
outperforming existing approaches.

*Lixin Jia,Zhiqing Guo,Gaobo Yang,Liejun Wang,Keqin Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study addresses the limitations of current deepfake detection methods, emphasizing poor performance on unknown forgery techniques and weak cross-domain generalization. It proposes a new forgery-guided learning strategy and a dual perception network to enhance adaptability and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle the poor generalization of existing deepfake detection methods, especially when dealing with unknown and emerging forgery techniques, as current strategies fail to adapt effectively.

Method: The paper introduces a Forgery Guided Learning (FGL) strategy to adapt to unknown techniques and employs a Dual Perception Network (DPNet) for dynamic extraction of features from frequency and spatial streams, leveraging graph convolution for understanding forgery correlations.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach handles unknown forgery challenges effectively and performs well across various scenarios, showing strong generalization capabilities.

Conclusion: The proposed FGL strategy and DPNet are effective approaches for generalizable deepfake detection and offer robust solutions for unknown forgery techniques, addressing critical weaknesses in existing methods.

Abstract: The emergence of deepfake technology has introduced a range of societal
problems, garnering considerable attention. Current deepfake detection methods
perform well on specific datasets, but exhibit poor performance when applied to
datasets with unknown forgery techniques. Moreover, as the gap between emerging
and traditional forgery techniques continues to widen, cross-domain detection
methods that rely on common forgery traces are becoming increasingly
ineffective. This situation highlights the urgency of developing deepfake
detection technology with strong generalization to cope with fast iterative
forgery techniques. To address these challenges, we propose a Forgery Guided
Learning (FGL) strategy designed to enable detection networks to continuously
adapt to unknown forgery techniques. Specifically, the FGL strategy captures
the differential information between known and unknown forgery techniques,
allowing the model to dynamically adjust its learning process in real time. To
further improve the ability to perceive forgery traces, we design a Dual
Perception Network (DPNet) that captures both differences and relationships
among forgery traces. In the frequency stream, the network dynamically
perceives and extracts discriminative features across various forgery
techniques, establishing essential detection cues. These features are then
integrated with spatial features and projected into the embedding space. In
addition, graph convolution is employed to perceive relationships across the
entire feature space, facilitating a more comprehensive understanding of
forgery trace correlations. Extensive experiments show that our approach
generalizes well across different scenarios and effectively handles unknown
forgery challenges, providing robust support for deepfake detection. Our code
is available on https://github.com/vpsg-research/FGL.

TL;DR: The paper introduces DARC, a model-driven groupwise registration framework for atlas construction in medical imaging, addressing issues like GPU memory limitations and scalability while achieving high anatomical fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve atlas construction in medical image analysis by overcoming limitations of data-driven and model-driven methods, such as dependency on large datasets, poor generalizability, scalability, and optimization challenges.

Method: The proposed method, DARC, employs a model-driven approach with a coordinate descent strategy and a centrality-enforcing activation function. It supports diverse image dissimilarity metrics and handles large 3D datasets efficiently without GPU memory limitations.

Result: DARC generates unbiased, diffeomorphic atlases with high anatomical fidelity. Applications include outperforming few-shot methods in label propagation for one-shot segmentation and generating new anatomical variants through shape synthesis.

Conclusion: DARC is a flexible, generalizable, and resource-efficient framework that advances atlas construction and its applications in medical image analysis.

Abstract: Atlas construction is fundamental to medical image analysis, offering a
standardized spatial reference for tasks such as population-level anatomical
modeling. While data-driven registration methods have recently shown promise in
pairwise settings, their reliance on large training datasets, limited
generalizability, and lack of true inference phases in groupwise contexts
hinder their practical use. In contrast, model-driven methods offer
training-free, theoretically grounded, and data-efficient alternatives, though
they often face scalability and optimization challenges when applied to large
3D datasets. In this work, we introduce DARC (Diffeomorphic Atlas Registration
via Coordinate descent), a novel model-driven groupwise registration framework
for atlas construction. DARC supports a broad range of image dissimilarity
metrics and efficiently handles arbitrary numbers of 3D images without
incurring GPU memory issues. Through a coordinate descent strategy and a
centrality-enforcing activation function, DARC produces unbiased, diffeomorphic
atlases with high anatomical fidelity. Beyond atlas construction, we
demonstrate two key applications: (1) One-shot segmentation, where labels
annotated only on the atlas are propagated to subjects via inverse
deformations, outperforming state-of-the-art few-shot methods; and (2) shape
synthesis, where new anatomical variants are generated by warping the atlas
mesh using synthesized diffeomorphic deformation fields. Overall, DARC offers a
flexible, generalizable, and resource-efficient framework for atlas
construction and applications.

TL;DR: This paper examines and improves the spatio-physical reasoning capabilities of vision language models (VLMs), uncovering their limitations and advancing the field with novel fine-tuning and learning techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To build robust world models and improve spatio-physical reasoning, an essential capability to understand real-world physics, which current VLMs struggle with.

Method: The study employed supervised fine-tuning followed by rule-based reinforcement learning on the Qwen2.5-VL-7B model to improve its spatio-physical reasoning.

Result: The refined model achieved significant performance improvements in spatio-physical reasoning and surpassed leading proprietary models, although struggles with generalization to new scenarios persist.

Conclusion: While progress was made, the limitations in generalizing to new physics settings highlight the need for further innovations in spatio-physical reasoning techniques.

Abstract: Spatio-physical reasoning, a foundation capability for understanding the real
physics world, is a critical step towards building robust world models. While
recent vision language models (VLMs) have shown remarkable progress in
specialized domains like multimodal mathematics and pure spatial understanding,
their capability for spatio-physical reasoning remains largely unexplored. This
paper provides a comprehensive diagnostic analysis of mainstream VLMs,
revealing that current models perform inadequately on this crucial task.
Further detailed analysis shows that this underperformance is largely
attributable to biases caused by human-like prior and a lack of deep reasoning.
To address these challenges, we apply supervised fine-tuning followed by
rule-based reinforcement learning to Qwen2.5-VL-7B, resulting in significant
improvements in spatio-physical reasoning capabilities and surpassing leading
proprietary models. Nevertheless, despite this success, the model's
generalization to new physics scenarios remains limited -- underscoring the
pressing need for new approaches in spatio-physical reasoning.

TL;DR: AEGIS presents a large-scale benchmark with over 10,000 synthetic videos for evaluating video authenticity detection, targeting modern challenges in detecting hyper-realistic AI-generated videos.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address shortcomings in existing benchmarks for video authenticity detection, such as lack of realism, insufficient scale, and limited complexity, to aid detection of sophisticated AI-generated forgeries.

Method: The authors constructed the AEGIS benchmark with rigorously curated videos from cutting-edge generative models, accompanied by multimodal annotations. They conducted extensive experiments using vision-language models.

Result: Experiments showed that current models demonstrate limited effectiveness in detecting the most challenging video subsets in AEGIS, indicating its superior complexity and realism.

Conclusion: AEGIS serves as an essential resource for advancing research in robust and generalizable video authenticity detection to tackle real-world forgery threats.

Abstract: Recent advances in AI-generated content have fueled the rise of highly
realistic synthetic videos, posing severe risks to societal trust and digital
integrity. Existing benchmarks for video authenticity detection typically
suffer from limited realism, insufficient scale, and inadequate complexity,
failing to effectively evaluate modern vision-language models against
sophisticated forgeries. To address this critical gap, we introduce AEGIS, a
novel large-scale benchmark explicitly targeting the detection of
hyper-realistic and semantically nuanced AI-generated videos. AEGIS comprises
over 10,000 rigorously curated real and synthetic videos generated by diverse,
state-of-the-art generative models, including Stable Video Diffusion,
CogVideoX-5B, KLing, and Sora, encompassing open-source and proprietary
architectures. In particular, AEGIS features specially constructed challenging
subsets enhanced with robustness evaluation. Furthermore, we provide multimodal
annotations spanning Semantic-Authenticity Descriptions, Motion Features, and
Low-level Visual Features, facilitating authenticity detection and supporting
downstream tasks such as multimodal fusion and forgery localization. Extensive
experiments using advanced vision-language models demonstrate limited detection
capabilities on the most challenging subsets of AEGIS, highlighting the
dataset's unique complexity and realism beyond the current generalization
capabilities of existing models. In essence, AEGIS establishes an indispensable
evaluation benchmark, fundamentally advancing research toward developing
genuinely robust, reliable, broadly generalizable video authenticity detection
methodologies capable of addressing real-world forgery threats. Our dataset is

### [197] [Video-BLADE: Block-Sparse Attention Meets Step Distillation for Efficient Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10774)
*Youping Gu,Xiaolong Li,Yuhao Hu,Bohan Zhuang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BLADE offers a data-free joint training framework combining sparse attention and step distillation to speed video generation significantly while improving quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inference bottlenecks in diffusion transformers caused by slow denoising processes and quadratic attention costs for long sequences.

Method: The paper introduces Adaptive Block-Sparse Attention (ASA) for dynamic sparsity masks and sparsity-aware step distillation based on Trajectory Distribution Matching (TDM) for efficient video generation.

Result: BLADE achieves up to 14.10x inference acceleration for Wan2.1-1.3B and 8.89x for CogVideoX-5B while improving quality metrics on benchmarks such as VBench-2.0.

Conclusion: BLADE successfully combines sparse attention and distillation approaches, accelerating video generation while enhancing quality, validated through both benchmarks and human evaluations.

Abstract: Diffusion transformers currently lead the field in high-quality video
generation, but their slow iterative denoising process and prohibitive
quadratic attention costs for long sequences create significant inference
bottlenecks. While both step distillation and sparse attention mechanisms have
shown promise as independent acceleration strategies, effectively combining
these approaches presents critical challenges -- training-free integration
yields suboptimal results, while separately training sparse attention after
step distillation requires prohibitively expensive high-quality video data. To
overcome these limitations, we propose BLADE, an innovative data-free joint
training framework that introduces: (1) an Adaptive Block-Sparse Attention
(ASA) mechanism for dynamically generating content-aware sparsity masks to
focus computation on salient spatiotemporal features, and (2) a sparsity-aware
step distillation paradigm built upon Trajectory Distribution Matching (TDM)
that directly incorporates sparsity into the distillation process rather than
treating it as a separate compression step, with fast convergence. We validate
BLADE on text-to-video models like CogVideoX-5B and Wan2.1-1.3B. Our framework
demonstrates remarkable efficiency gains across different scales. On
Wan2.1-1.3B, BLADE achieves a 14.10x end-to-end inference acceleration over a
50-step baseline. Moreover, on models such as CogVideoX-5B with short video
sequence lengths, our framework delivers a robust 8.89x speedup. Crucially, the
acceleration is accompanied by a consistent quality improvement. On the
VBench-2.0 benchmark, BLADE boosts the score of CogVideoX-5B to 0.569 (from
0.534) and Wan2.1-1.3B to 0.570 (from 0.563), results that are further
corroborated by superior ratings in human evaluations. Our code and model
weights are publicly available at: http://ziplab.co/BLADE-Homepage/.

*Zhenning Shi,Zizheng Yan,Yuhang Yu,Clara Xue,Jingyu Zhuang,Qi Zhang,Jinwei Chen,Tao Li,Qingnan Fan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces TriFlowSR, a novel RefSR framework for restoring ultra-high-definition landmark images by leveraging effective pattern matching and a new comprehensive dataset, Landmark-4K.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The current RefSR methods face challenges in aligning information between low-resolution and reference high-resolution images and lack datasets with adequate resolution and quality for effective restoration.

Method: TriFlowSR uses a Reference Matching Strategy to align LR images with reference HR images explicitly, supported by the new Landmark-4K dataset for ultra-high-definition scenarios.

Result: Experiments demonstrate superior utilization of semantic and texture information from reference images compared to prior methods, particularly in ultra-high-definition landmark scenarios with real-world degradations.

Conclusion: TriFlowSR represents the first diffusion-based pipeline designed with real-world degradation conditions for UHD landmark RefSR. It outperforms existing methods due to its novel pattern matching and dataset innovation.

Abstract: Reference-based Image Super-Resolution (RefSR) aims to restore a
low-resolution (LR) image by utilizing the semantic and texture information
from an additional reference high-resolution (reference HR) image. Existing
diffusion-based RefSR methods are typically built upon ControlNet, which
struggles to effectively align the information between the LR image and the
reference HR image. Moreover, current RefSR datasets suffer from limited
resolution and poor image quality, resulting in the reference images lacking
sufficient fine-grained details to support high-quality restoration. To
overcome the limitations above, we propose TriFlowSR, a novel framework that
explicitly achieves pattern matching between the LR image and the reference HR
image. Meanwhile, we introduce Landmark-4K, the first RefSR dataset for
Ultra-High-Definition (UHD) landmark scenarios. Considering the UHD scenarios
with real-world degradation, in TriFlowSR, we design a Reference Matching
Strategy to effectively match the LR image with the reference HR image.
Experimental results show that our approach can better utilize the semantic and
texture information of the reference HR image compared to previous methods. To
the best of our knowledge, we propose the first diffusion-based RefSR pipeline
for ultra-high definition landmark scenarios under real-world degradation. Our
code and model will be available at https://github.com/nkicsl/TriFlowSR.

*Artem Sokolov,Mikhail Nikitin,Anton Konushin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a face liveness detection system using a user interaction protocol (approaching the camera) and optical flow analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the reliability of video-based face liveness detection by incorporating active user interaction and spatial-temporal features for combating diverse presentation attacks.

Method: The method involves a user slowly moving their face closer to the camera, enabling neural optical flow estimation and using a neural classifier to process optical flow and RGB frames.

Result: The proposed approach shows improved ability to distinguish genuine faces from diverse presentation attacks, including printed photos, videos, and masks.

Conclusion: Controlled face movement combined with optical flow and spatial-temporal analysis enhances robustness in face liveness detection compared to passive methods.

Abstract: In this work, we proposed a novel cooperative video-based face liveness
detection method based on a new user interaction scenario where participants
are instructed to slowly move their frontal-oriented face closer to the camera.
This controlled approaching face protocol, combined with optical flow analysis,
represents the core innovation of our approach. By designing a system where
users follow this specific movement pattern, we enable robust extraction of
facial volume information through neural optical flow estimation, significantly
improving discrimination between genuine faces and various presentation attacks
(including printed photos, screen displays, masks, and video replays). Our
method processes both the predicted optical flows and RGB frames through a
neural classifier, effectively leveraging spatial-temporal features for more
reliable liveness detection compared to passive methods.

### [200] [VasoMIM: Vascular Anatomy-Aware Masked Image Modeling for Vessel Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10794)
*De-Xing Huang,Xiao-Hu Zhou,Mei-Jiang Gui,Xiao-Liang Xie,Shi-Qi Liu,Shuang-Yi Wang,Tian-Yu Xiang,Rui-Ze Ma,Nu-Fang Xiao,Zeng-Guang Hou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents a novel self-supervised learning framework, VasoMIM, for improving vessel segmentation in X-ray angiograms by integrating vascular anatomy into the masked image modeling process.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurately segmenting vessels in X-ray angiograms is vital for clinical applications, but the lack of annotated data and poor performance of traditional self-supervised learning methods on vascular anatomy pose significant challenges.

Method: This paper introduces VasoMIM, consisting of two components: an anatomy-guided masking strategy that emphasizes vessel-containing regions for reconstruction and an anatomical consistency loss to improve vascular semantic consistency between original and reconstructed images.

Result: Empirical evaluations demonstrate that VasoMIM achieves state-of-the-art vessel segmentation performance across three datasets.

Conclusion: VasoMIM effectively incorporates anatomical knowledge into masked image modeling, enhancing vascular representation and facilitating X-ray angiogram analysis.

Abstract: Accurate vessel segmentation in X-ray angiograms is crucial for numerous
clinical applications. However, the scarcity of annotated data presents a
significant challenge, which has driven the adoption of self-supervised
learning (SSL) methods such as masked image modeling (MIM) to leverage
large-scale unlabeled data for learning transferable representations.
Unfortunately, conventional MIM often fails to capture vascular anatomy because
of the severe class imbalance between vessel and background pixels, leading to
weak vascular representations. To address this, we introduce Vascular
anatomy-aware Masked Image Modeling (VasoMIM), a novel MIM framework tailored
for X-ray angiograms that explicitly integrates anatomical knowledge into the
pre-training process. Specifically, it comprises two complementary components:
anatomy-guided masking strategy and anatomical consistency loss. The former
preferentially masks vessel-containing patches to focus the model on
reconstructing vessel-relevant regions. The latter enforces consistency in
vascular semantics between the original and reconstructed images, thereby
improving the discriminability of vascular representations. Empirically,
VasoMIM achieves state-of-the-art performance across three datasets. These
findings highlight its potential to facilitate X-ray angiogram analysis.

*Ziqi Ye,Shuran Ma,Jie Yang,Xiaoyi Yang,Ziyang Gong,Xue Yang,Haipeng Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a model (OF-Diff) to generate high-fidelity remote sensing images using object shape priors, dual-branch architecture, and fine-tuned diffusion processes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion models fail to generate remote sensing images with accurate morphological details which impacts the robustness of object detection.

Method: The authors propose a novel dual-branch diffusion model incorporating object shape priors, diffusion consistency loss, and DDPO for fine-tuning the diffusion process.

Result: OF-Diff surpasses state-of-the-art methods in remote sensing image generation and achieves significant improvements in object detection performance for polymorphic and small objects, with notable mAP gains of 8.3% (airplanes), 7.7% (ships), and 4.0% (vehicles).

Conclusion: OF-Diff effectively enhances the fidelity, diversity, and semantic consistency of generated remote sensing images, improving overall object detection quality.

Abstract: High-precision controllable remote sensing image generation is both
meaningful and challenging. Existing diffusion models often produce
low-fidelity images due to their inability to adequately capture morphological
details, which may affect the robustness and reliability of object detection
models. To enhance the accuracy and fidelity of generated objects in remote
sensing, this paper proposes Object Fidelity Diffusion (OF-Diff), which
effectively improves the fidelity of generated objects. Specifically, we are
the first to extract the prior shapes of objects based on the layout for
diffusion models in remote sensing. Then, we introduce a dual-branch diffusion
model with diffusion consistency loss, which can generate high-fidelity remote
sensing images without providing real images during the sampling phase.
Furthermore, we introduce DDPO to fine-tune the diffusion process, making the
generated remote sensing images more diverse and semantically consistent.
Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that OF-Diff outperforms state-of-the-art
methods in the remote sensing across key quality metrics. Notably, the
performance of several polymorphic and small object classes shows significant
improvement. For instance, the mAP increases by 8.3%, 7.7%, and 4.0% for
airplanes, ships, and vehicles, respectively.

Conclusion: The study provides SOTA UI agents and innovative strategies to tackle UI-related challenges, offering open-source contributions to facilitate further progress in the field.

Abstract: We present UI-Venus, a native UI agent that takes only screenshots as input

Screenspot-V2 / Pro, surpassing the previous SOTA baselines including
open-source GTA1 and closed-source UI-TARS-1.5.To show UI-Venus's summary and
planing ability, we also evaluate it on the AndroidWorld, an online UI
navigation arena, on which our 7B and 72B variants achieve 49.1% and 65.9%
success rate, also beating existing models.To achieve this, we introduce
carefully designed reward functions for both UI grounding and navigation tasks
and corresponding efficient data cleaning strategies.To further boost
navigation performance, we propose Self-Evolving Trajectory History Alignment
\& Sparse Action Enhancement that refine historical reasoning traces and
balances the distribution of sparse but critical actions, leading to more
coherent planning and better generalization in complex UI tasks. Our
contributions include the publish of SOTA open-source UI agents, comprehensive
data cleaning protocols and a novel self-evolving framework for improving
navigation performance, which encourage further research and development in the
community. Code is available at https://github.com/antgroup/UI-Venus.

*Peng Xu,Zhiyu Xiang,Jingyun Fu,Tianyu Pu,Kai Wang,Chaojie Ji,Tingming Bai,Eryun Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces BaCon-Stereo, a self-supervised stereo matching framework that improves predictions in both occluded and non-occluded regions via contrastive learning, leveraging multi-baseline inputs and occlusion-aware techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current stereo matching methods are limited by the photometric consistency assumption, failing in occluded regions due to ill-posed correspondences.

Method: A teacher-student paradigm is adopted, along with multi-baseline inputs, occlusion-aware attention maps, and a synthesized dataset BaCon-20k to enhance occluded region predictions.

Result: BaCon-Stereo surpasses state-of-the-art self-supervised methods in accuracy, robustness, and generalization, proven by extensive experiments and benchmarks.

Conclusion: BaCon-Stereo effectively addresses stereo matching challenges in occluded regions, offering a promising solution with released code and dataset for further research.

Abstract: Current self-supervised stereo matching relies on the photometric consistency
assumption, which breaks down in occluded regions due to ill-posed
correspondences. To address this issue, we propose BaCon-Stereo, a simple yet
effective contrastive learning framework for self-supervised stereo network
training in both non-occluded and occluded regions. We adopt a teacher-student
paradigm with multi-baseline inputs, in which the stereo pairs fed into the
teacher and student share the same reference view but differ in target views.
Geometrically, regions occluded in the student's target view are often visible
in the teacher's, making it easier for the teacher to predict in these regions.
The teacher's prediction is rescaled to match the student's baseline and then
used to supervise the student. We also introduce an occlusion-aware attention
map to better guide the student in learning occlusion completion. To support
training, we synthesize a multi-baseline dataset BaCon-20k. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that BaCon-Stereo improves prediction in both occluded
and non-occluded regions, achieves strong generalization and robustness, and
outperforms state-of-the-art self-supervised methods on both KITTI 2015 and
2012 benchmarks. Our code and dataset will be released upon paper acceptance.

TL;DR: AdaptFED refines focal modulation for generalizable federated learning (FL), improving personalization and scalability with updated techniques and broader validations, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve federated learning's adaptability, scalability, and generalization, especially in non-IID, cross-domain, multilingual, and resource-constrained environments.

Method: AdaptFED refines TransFed's transformer-based FL by integrating task-aware client embeddings, enhancing adaptation performance bounds, validating across diverse datasets, and introducing low-rank hypernetwork conditioning to reduce communication overhead.

Result: AdaptFED demonstrates superior performance over current methods on eight datasets, particularly in source-free and cross-task FL setups, validating its scalability and generalization.

Conclusion: The study advances FL through focal modulation refinements, enabling adaptive and scalable transformer-based systems, making them broadly applicable across various settings.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has proven essential for privacy-preserving,
collaborative training across distributed clients. Our prior work, TransFed,
introduced a robust transformer-based FL framework that leverages a
learn-to-adapt hypernetwork to generate personalized focal modulation layers
per client, outperforming traditional methods in non-IID and cross-domain
settings. In this extended version, we propose AdaptFED, where we deepen the
investigation of focal modulation in generalizable FL by incorporating: (1) a
refined adaptation strategy that integrates task-aware client embeddings to
personalize modulation dynamics further, (2) enhanced theoretical bounds on
adaptation performance, and (3) broader empirical validation across additional
modalities, including time-series and multilingual data. We also introduce an
efficient variant of TransFed that reduces server-client communication overhead
via low-rank hypernetwork conditioning, enabling scalable deployment in
resource-constrained environments. Extensive experiments on eight diverse
datasets reaffirm the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art
baselines, particularly in source-free and cross-task federated setups. Our
findings not only extend the capabilities of focal modulation in FL but also
pave the way for more adaptive, scalable, and generalizable transformer-based
federated systems. The code is available at

TL;DR: The paper introduces PhysHPO, a framework that enhances video generation quality by aligning content with physical laws and semantic preferences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of generating videos that are both visually compelling and adhere to the laws of physics.

Method: PhysHPO employs Hierarchical Cross-Modal Direct Preference Optimization across four levels of granularity: Instance, State, Motion, and Semantic to improve video alignment and realism. It also introduces a data selection pipeline for efficient dataset usage.

Result: Experiments validate that PhysHPO improves physical plausibility and video quality compared to existing models.

Conclusion: PhysHPO is a pioneering framework enabling realistic and human-preferred video generation, advancing the field with fine-grained alignment and efficient data utilization.

Abstract: Recent advancements in video generation have enabled the creation of
high-quality, visually compelling videos. However, generating videos that
adhere to the laws of physics remains a critical challenge for applications
requiring realism and accuracy. In this work, we propose PhysHPO, a novel
framework for Hierarchical Cross-Modal Direct Preference Optimization, to
tackle this challenge by enabling fine-grained preference alignment for
physically plausible video generation. PhysHPO optimizes video alignment across
four hierarchical granularities: a) Instance Level, aligning the overall video
content with the input prompt; b) State Level, ensuring temporal consistency
using boundary frames as anchors; c) Motion Level, modeling motion trajectories
for realistic dynamics; and d) Semantic Level, maintaining logical consistency
between narrative and visuals. Recognizing that real-world videos are the best
reflections of physical phenomena, we further introduce an automated data
selection pipeline to efficiently identify and utilize "good data" from
existing large-scale text-video datasets, thereby eliminating the need for
costly and time-intensive dataset construction. Extensive experiments on both
physics-focused and general capability benchmarks demonstrate that PhysHPO
significantly improves physical plausibility and overall video generation
quality of advanced models. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
work to explore fine-grained preference alignment and data selection for video
generation, paving the way for more realistic and human-preferred video
generation paradigms.

TL;DR: This study examines the performance of GPT-4o, GPT-5-nano, GPT-5-mini, and GPT-5 on a brain tumor VQA benchmark derived from MRI data and clinical features. GPT-5-mini performed best with 44.19% accuracy, but none were suitable for clinical use.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve the differentiation of brain tumor types using MRI, which is key for neuro-oncology treatment, by leveraging recent advances in large language models.

Method: The study utilizes GPT-4o, GPT-5-nano, GPT-5-mini, and GPT-5 in a zero-shot chain-of-thought visual question answering task using curated MRI data and clinical features from the BraTS datasets.

Result: GPT-5-mini achieved the highest macro-average accuracy at 44.19%, while other models scored slightly lower. Performance varied among tumor subtypes, and no model consistently dominated.

Conclusion: While GPT-5 family models demonstrate moderate accuracy in brain tumor visual question answering tasks, their performance falls short of clinical standards.

Abstract: Accurate differentiation of brain tumor types on magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI) is critical for guiding treatment planning in neuro-oncology. Recent
advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled visual question answering
(VQA) approaches that integrate image interpretation with natural language
reasoning. In this study, we evaluated GPT-4o, GPT-5-nano, GPT-5-mini, and
GPT-5 on a curated brain tumor VQA benchmark derived from 3 Brain Tumor
Segmentation (BraTS) datasets - glioblastoma (GLI), meningioma (MEN), and brain
metastases (MET). Each case included multi-sequence MRI triplanar mosaics and
structured clinical features transformed into standardized VQA items. Models
were assessed in a zero-shot chain-of-thought setting for accuracy on both
visual and reasoning tasks. Results showed that GPT-5-mini achieved the highest
macro-average accuracy (44.19%), followed by GPT-5 (43.71%), GPT-4o (41.49%),
and GPT-5-nano (35.85%). Performance varied by tumor subtype, with no single
model dominating across all cohorts. These findings suggest that GPT-5 family
models can achieve moderate accuracy in structured neuro-oncological VQA tasks,
but not at a level acceptable for clinical use.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ToonComposer integrates inbetweening and colorization into a unified AI-based post-keyframing stage, enhancing motion control and production efficiency in cartoon and anime creation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce the manual workload and limitations associated with traditional cartoon production techniques like inbetweening and colorization.

Method: The paper introduces ToonComposer, which combines sparse sketch injection for detailed control and adapts a video foundation model through a spatial low-rank adapter tailored to cartoons.

Result: ToonComposer performs better than existing methods in visual quality, motion consistency, and efficiency, as demonstrated through a benchmark called PKBench.

Conclusion: ToonComposer offers an innovative and flexible AI-driven solution for cartoon production, significantly improving the workflow for creators.

Abstract: Traditional cartoon and anime production involves keyframing, inbetweening,
and colorization stages, which require intensive manual effort. Despite recent
advances in AI, existing methods often handle these stages separately, leading
to error accumulation and artifacts. For instance, inbetweening approaches
struggle with large motions, while colorization methods require dense per-frame
sketches. To address this, we introduce ToonComposer, a generative model that
unifies inbetweening and colorization into a single post-keyframing stage.
ToonComposer employs a sparse sketch injection mechanism to provide precise
control using keyframe sketches. Additionally, it uses a cartoon adaptation
method with the spatial low-rank adapter to tailor a modern video foundation
model to the cartoon domain while keeping its temporal prior intact. Requiring
as few as a single sketch and a colored reference frame, ToonComposer excels
with sparse inputs, while also supporting multiple sketches at any temporal
location for more precise motion control. This dual capability reduces manual
workload and improves flexibility, empowering artists in real-world scenarios.
To evaluate our model, we further created PKBench, a benchmark featuring
human-drawn sketches that simulate real-world use cases. Our evaluation

*Yushi Lan,Yihang Luo,Fangzhou Hong,Shangchen Zhou,Honghua Chen,Zhaoyang Lyu,Shuai Yang,Bo Dai,Chen Change Loy,Xingang Pan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: STream3R is a novel Transformer-based method for efficient and scalable 3D reconstruction from image sequences, outperforming existing approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to address the inefficiencies in current 3D reconstruction methods, particularly their reliance on global optimization or simplistic memory mechanisms that struggle with scalability and dynamic environments.

Method: STream3R leverages causal attention within a decoder-only Transformer framework and incorporates geometric priors from large-scale datasets to process image sequences efficiently in a streaming manner.

Result: Experiments indicate superior performance of STream3R on benchmarks for both static and dynamic scenes, with the method generalizing well to various challenging scenarios.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates how causal Transformer models can revolutionize online and streaming 3D perception, highlighting their potential for efficient real-time applications and diverse downstream 3D tasks.

Abstract: We present STream3R, a novel approach to 3D reconstruction that reformulates
pointmap prediction as a decoder-only Transformer problem. Existing
state-of-the-art methods for multi-view reconstruction either depend on
expensive global optimization or rely on simplistic memory mechanisms that
scale poorly with sequence length. In contrast, STream3R introduces an
streaming framework that processes image sequences efficiently using causal
attention, inspired by advances in modern language modeling. By learning
geometric priors from large-scale 3D datasets, STream3R generalizes well to
diverse and challenging scenarios, including dynamic scenes where traditional
methods often fail. Extensive experiments show that our method consistently
outperforms prior work across both static and dynamic scene benchmarks.
Moreover, STream3R is inherently compatible with LLM-style training
infrastructure, enabling efficient large-scale pretraining and fine-tuning for
various downstream 3D tasks. Our results underscore the potential of causal
Transformer models for online 3D perception, paving the way for real-time 3D
understanding in streaming environments. More details can be found in our

TL;DR: The paper introduces MAESTRO, an adaptation of the Masked Autoencoder, optimized for the unique characteristics of multimodal Earth observation data, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for tailored self-supervised learning methods for Earth observation data, factoring in its multimodal, multitemporal, and multispectral nature.

Method: Conducted benchmarking of fusion strategies and normalization schemes, subsequently proposing MAESTRO with optimized designs and a spectral prior signal.

Result: MAESTRO outperformed existing methods on multitemporal tasks and was competitive on mono-temporal tasks, validated across four datasets.

Conclusion: MAESTRO advances self-supervised learning in remote sensing, proving effective across diverse Earth observation tasks.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning holds great promise for remote sensing, but standard
self-supervised methods must be adapted to the unique characteristics of Earth
observation data. We take a step in this direction by conducting a
comprehensive benchmark of fusion strategies and reconstruction target
normalization schemes for multimodal, multitemporal, and multispectral Earth
observation data. Based on our findings, we propose MAESTRO, a novel adaptation
of the Masked Autoencoder, featuring optimized fusion strategies and a tailored
target normalization scheme that introduces a spectral prior as a
self-supervisory signal. Evaluated on four Earth observation datasets, MAESTRO
sets a new state-of-the-art on tasks that strongly rely on multitemporal
dynamics, while remaining highly competitive on tasks dominated by a single
mono-temporal modality. Code to reproduce all our experiments is available at

### [213] [ESSENTIAL: Episodic and Semantic Memory Integration for Video Class-Incremental Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10896)
*Jongseo Lee,Kyungho Bae,Kyle Min,Gyeong-Moon Park,Jinwoo Choi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces ESSENTIAL, a novel approach for video class-incremental learning (VCIL) that combines episodic and semantic memory to overcome the trade-off between memory efficiency and performance, achieving superior results on diverse datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VCIL methods struggle with catastrophic forgetting and an efficiency-performance trade-off due to either memory-intensive training or loss of temporal information.

Method: ESSENTIAL integrates episodic memory (for temporally sparse features) and semantic memory (general knowledge via learnable prompts) using a novel memory retrieval module with cross-attention.

Result: The validation across multiple datasets demonstrated that ESSENTIAL achieves competitive performance while significantly reducing memory requirements.

Conclusion: ESSENTIAL effectively resolves the trade-off in VCIL, achieving efficient and high-performing video class-incremental learning through its innovative memory integration and retrieval mechanism.

Abstract: In this work, we tackle the problem of video classincremental learning
(VCIL). Many existing VCIL methods mitigate catastrophic forgetting by
rehearsal training with a few temporally dense samples stored in episodic
memory, which is memory-inefficient. Alternatively, some methods store
temporally sparse samples, sacrificing essential temporal information and
thereby resulting in inferior performance. To address this trade-off between
memory-efficiency and performance, we propose EpiSodic and SEmaNTIc memory
integrAtion for video class-incremental Learning (ESSENTIAL). ESSENTIAL
consists of episodic memory for storing temporally sparse features and semantic
memory for storing general knowledge represented by learnable prompts. We
introduce a novel memory retrieval (MR) module that integrates episodic memory
and semantic prompts through cross-attention, enabling the retrieval of
temporally dense features from temporally sparse features. We rigorously
validate ESSENTIAL on diverse datasets: UCF-101, HMDB51, and
Something-Something-V2 from the TCD benchmark and UCF-101, ActivityNet, and
Kinetics-400 from the vCLIMB benchmark. Remarkably, with significantly reduced
memory, ESSENTIAL achieves favorable performance on the benchmarks.

*Mengyuan Liu,Xinshun Wang,Zhongbin Fang,Deheng Ye,Xia Li,Tao Tang,Songtao Wu,Xiangtai Li,Ming-Hsuan Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a unified 3D human motion model, "Human-in-Context (HiC)," which eliminates domain-specific components and multi-stage training to generalize across modalities, tasks, and datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing models struggle to efficiently handle diverse tasks and datasets due to reliance on domain-specific components and complex training processes.

Method: HiC introduces pose and mesh representations, a max-min similarity prompt sampling strategy, and a dual-branch context injection architecture for better generalization and contextual dependency handling.

Result: HiC outperforms its predecessor, "Pose-in-Context (PiC)," and delivers better scalability, task coverage, and performance across diverse domains in experimental evaluations.

Conclusion: HiC demonstrates its potential as a scalable and practical solution for unified cross-domain 3D human motion modeling.

Abstract: This paper aims to model 3D human motion across domains, where a single model
is expected to handle multiple modalities, tasks, and datasets. Existing
cross-domain models often rely on domain-specific components and multi-stage
training, which limits their practicality and scalability. To overcome these
challenges, we propose a new setting to train a unified cross-domain model
through a single process, eliminating the need for domain-specific components
and multi-stage training. We first introduce Pose-in-Context (PiC), which
leverages in-context learning to create a pose-centric cross-domain model.
While PiC generalizes across multiple pose-based tasks and datasets, it
encounters difficulties with modality diversity, prompting strategy, and
contextual dependency handling. We thus propose Human-in-Context (HiC), an
extension of PiC that broadens generalization across modalities, tasks, and
datasets. HiC combines pose and mesh representations within a unified
framework, expands task coverage, and incorporates larger-scale datasets.
Additionally, HiC introduces a max-min similarity prompt sampling strategy to
enhance generalization across diverse domains and a network architecture with
dual-branch context injection for improved handling of contextual dependencies.
Extensive experimental results show that HiC performs better than PiC in terms
of generalization, data scale, and performance across a wide range of domains.
These results demonstrate the potential of HiC for building a unified
cross-domain 3D human motion model with improved flexibility and scalability.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Puppeteer is a framework designed to automate rigging and animation for 3D objects, addressing major bottlenecks in content creation by using innovative AI-based structures for skeletal prediction, skinning weights, and optimization-based animation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the manual and expertise-heavy process of converting static 3D models into animated assets, which remains a bottleneck in content creation pipelines.

Method: Puppeteer employs an auto-regressive transformer for skeletal prediction, an attention-based architecture for skinning weights embedding inter-joint relationships, and a differentiable optimization-based animation pipeline for efficient and stable animations.

Result: The framework outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in skeletal prediction accuracy and skinning quality, and effectively produces temporally coherent animations without jittering issues.

Conclusion: Puppeteer successfully automates the rigging and animation of diverse 3D objects with higher accuracy, efficiency, and animation stability compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Modern interactive applications increasingly demand dynamic 3D content, yet
the transformation of static 3D models into animated assets constitutes a
significant bottleneck in content creation pipelines. While recent advances in
generative AI have revolutionized static 3D model creation, rigging and
animation continue to depend heavily on expert intervention. We present
Puppeteer, a comprehensive framework that addresses both automatic rigging and
animation for diverse 3D objects. Our system first predicts plausible skeletal
structures via an auto-regressive transformer that introduces a joint-based
tokenization strategy for compact representation and a hierarchical ordering
methodology with stochastic perturbation that enhances bidirectional learning
capabilities. It then infers skinning weights via an attention-based
architecture incorporating topology-aware joint attention that explicitly
encodes inter-joint relationships based on skeletal graph distances. Finally,
we complement these rigging advances with a differentiable optimization-based
animation pipeline that generates stable, high-fidelity animations while being
computationally more efficient than existing approaches. Extensive evaluations
across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in both skeletal prediction accuracy
and skinning quality. The system robustly processes diverse 3D content, ranging
from professionally designed game assets to AI-generated shapes, producing
temporally coherent animations that eliminate the jittering issues common in
existing methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Quantum Visual Field (QVF), a new type of Quantum Implicit Neural Representation (QINR), designed for 2D image and 3D geometric learning. It outperforms existing quantum and classical methods in accuracy and applicability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation lies in addressing the challenges of QINRs, such as architecture design, utility of quantum properties, training efficiency, and integration with classical modules, aiming to improve visual data representation accuracy.

Method: The method involves encoding classical data into quantum statevectors using a learnable energy manifold, fully entangled quantum circuits, and projective measurement to extract learned signals without relying on classical post-processing.

Result: Experiments on quantum hardware simulators demonstrate QVF's superior visual representation accuracy compared to existing quantum methods and classical baselines, including effective learning of high-frequency details.

Conclusion: QVF advances the field of QINRs with a numerically stable and efficient quantum learning framework, showcasing its practical utility in 2D and 3D field completion and interpolation tasks.

Abstract: Quantum Implicit Neural Representations (QINRs) include components for
learning and execution on gate-based quantum computers. While QINRs recently
emerged as a promising new paradigm, many challenges concerning their
architecture and ansatz design, the utility of quantum-mechanical properties,
training efficiency and the interplay with classical modules remain. This paper
advances the field by introducing a new type of QINR for 2D image and 3D
geometric field learning, which we collectively refer to as Quantum Visual
Field (QVF). QVF encodes classical data into quantum statevectors using neural
amplitude encoding grounded in a learnable energy manifold, ensuring meaningful
Hilbert space embeddings. Our ansatz follows a fully entangled design of
learnable parametrised quantum circuits, with quantum (unitary) operations
performed in the real Hilbert space, resulting in numerically stable training
with fast convergence. QVF does not rely on classical post-processing -- in
contrast to the previous QINR learning approach -- and directly employs
projective measurement to extract learned signals encoded in the ansatz.
Experiments on a quantum hardware simulator demonstrate that QVF outperforms
the existing quantum approach and widely used classical foundational baselines
in terms of visual representation accuracy across various metrics and model
characteristics, such as learning of high-frequency details. We also show
applications of QVF in 2D and 3D field completion and 3D shape interpolation,
highlighting its practical potential.

TL;DR: ShellFT introduces a flexible framework for hybrid fault models in replicated systems, reducing diversification overhead by over 70%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing hybrid fault models have limitations in flexibility and high diversification overhead for system robustness.

Method: ShellFT utilizes micro replication to enable selective hybridization of the replication logic against Byzantine faults.

Result: Evaluation demonstrates that ShellFT reduces diversification costs by more than 70% compared to traditional approaches.

Conclusion: ShellFT enhances fault-tolerant system design by providing greater flexibility and efficiency, tailored to specific use-case needs.

Abstract: Hybrid fault models are known to be an effective means for enhancing the
robustness of consensus-based replicated systems. However, existing
hybridization approaches suffer from limited flexibility with regard to the
composition of crash-tolerant and Byzantine fault-tolerant system parts and/or
are associated with a significant diversification overhead. In this paper we
address these issues with ShellFT, a framework that leverages the concept of
micro replication to allow system designers to freely choose the parts of the
replication logic that need to be resilient against Byzantine faults. As a key
benefit, such a selective hybridization makes it possible to develop hybrid
solutions that are tailored to the specific characteristics and requirements of
individual use cases. To illustrate this flexibility, we present three custom
ShellFT protocols and analyze the complexity of their implementations. Our
evaluation shows that compared with traditional hybridization approaches,
ShellFT is able to decrease diversification costs by more than 70%.

Conclusion: Mixed-precision frameworks can drive HPC advancements, enabling performance portability across hardware platforms while maintaining computational accuracy and scalability on supercomputers.

Abstract: The hardware diversity displayed in leadership-class computing facilities,
alongside the immense performance boosts exhibited by today's GPUs when
computing in lower precision, provide a strong incentive for scientific HPC
workflows to adopt mixed-precision algorithms and performance portability
models. We present an on-the-fly framework using Hipify for performance
portability and apply it to FFTMatvec-an HPC application that computes
matrix-vector products with block-triangular Toeplitz matrices. Our approach
enables FFTMatvec, initially a CUDA-only application, to run seamlessly on AMD
GPUs with excellent observed performance. Performance optimizations for AMD
GPUs are integrated directly into the open-source rocBLAS library, keeping the
application code unchanged. We then present a dynamic mixed-precision framework
for FFTMatvec; a Pareto front analysis determines the optimal mixed-precision
configuration for a desired error tolerance. Results are shown for AMD Instinct
MI250X, MI300X, and the newly launched MI355X GPUs. The performance-portable,
mixed-precision FFTMatvec is scaled to 2,048 GPUs on the OLCF Frontier
supercomputer.

TL;DR: OpenFPL presents an open-source system for forecasting Fantasy Premier League player performance using public data, achieving accuracy comparable to commercial services.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To democratize access to accurate Fantasy Premier League player performance forecasts, which are currently restricted to undisclosed commercial services using proprietary data.

Method: The paper uses position-specific ensemble models trained on public data from Fantasy Premier League and Understat spanning four seasons (2020-2024) to develop OpenFPL, an open-source forecasting tool.

Result: OpenFPL achieves accuracy similar to a leading commercial FPL forecasting service, surpassing it for high-return players, and performs well across multiple forecast horizons.

Conclusion: OpenFPL provides an effective, open-source alternative for Fantasy Premier League players to plan strategies and make informed decisions without relying on proprietary services.

Abstract: Fantasy Premier League engages the football community in selecting the
Premier League players who will perform best from gameweek to gameweek. Access
to accurate performance forecasts gives participants an edge over competitors
by guiding expectations about player outcomes and reducing uncertainty in squad
selection. However, high-accuracy forecasts are currently limited to commercial
services whose inner workings are undisclosed and that rely on proprietary
data. This paper aims to democratize access to highly accurate forecasts of
player performance by presenting OpenFPL, an open-source Fantasy Premier League
forecasting method developed exclusively from public data. Comprising
position-specific ensemble models optimized on Fantasy Premier League and
Understat data from four previous seasons (2020-21 to 2023-24), OpenFPL
achieves accuracy comparable to a leading commercial service when tested
prospectively on data from the 2024-25 season. OpenFPL also surpasses the
commercial benchmark for high-return players ($>$ 2 points), which are most
influential for rank gains. These findings hold across one-, two-, and
three-gameweek forecast horizons, supporting long-term planning of transfers
and strategies while also informing final-day decisions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Advancements in AI models have been limited for tabular data, which remains primarily reliant on Gradient Boosted Decision Trees (GBDTs). This paper aims to modernize predictive tasks on tabular data by leveraging neural networks and feature learning.

Method: xRFM combines feature learning kernel machines with a tree structure to adapt to the data’s local structure and handle large-scale training data efficiently.

Result: xRFM outperforms 31 other methods, including TabPFNv2 and GBDTs, across 100 regression datasets and performs competitively on 200 classification datasets.

Conclusion: xRFM not only achieves state-of-the-art predictive performance on tabular data but also provides native interpretability, marking a significant step in advancing tabular data analytics.

Abstract: Inference from tabular data, collections of continuous and categorical
variables organized into matrices, is a foundation for modern technology and
science. Yet, in contrast to the explosive changes in the rest of AI, the best
practice for these predictive tasks has been relatively unchanged and is still
primarily based on variations of Gradient Boosted Decision Trees (GBDTs). Very
recently, there has been renewed interest in developing state-of-the-art
methods for tabular data based on recent developments in neural networks and
feature learning methods. In this work, we introduce xRFM, an algorithm that
combines feature learning kernel machines with a tree structure to both adapt
to the local structure of the data and scale to essentially unlimited amounts
of training data.
  We show that compared to $31$ other methods, including recently introduced
tabular foundation models (TabPFNv2) and GBDTs, xRFM achieves best performance
across $100$ regression datasets and is competitive to the best methods across
$200$ classification datasets outperforming GBDTs. Additionally, xRFM provides
interpretability natively through the Average Gradient Outer Product.

Method: The study was a large-scale, four-arm randomized controlled trial with 13,463 participants distributed across control, random, fixed, and RL intervention groups. Physical activity nudges were delivered via Fitbit and tailored differently based on group assignment.

Result: The RL intervention group demonstrated statistically significant increases in average daily step counts at 1 month (+296 steps compared to control, p=0.0002) and sustained increases at 2 months (+210 steps, p=0.0122) relative to the control group.

Conclusion: Reinforcement learning-based personalization of physical activity nudges is effective and scalable for improving daily step count, showing promise for integrating behavioral science into mobile digital health interventions.

Abstract: Consistent physical inactivity poses a major global health challenge. Mobile
health (mHealth) interventions, particularly Just-in-Time Adaptive
Interventions (JITAIs), offer a promising avenue for scalable, personalized
physical activity (PA) promotion. However, developing and evaluating such
interventions at scale, while integrating robust behavioral science, presents
methodological hurdles. The PEARL study was the first large-scale, four-arm
randomized controlled trial to assess a reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm,
informed by health behavior change theory, to personalize the content and
timing of PA nudges via a Fitbit app.
  We enrolled and randomized 13,463 Fitbit users into four study arms: control,
random, fixed, and RL. The control arm received no nudges. The other three arms
received nudges from a bank of 155 nudges based on behavioral science
principles. The random arm received nudges selected at random. The fixed arm
received nudges based on a pre-set logic from survey responses about PA
barriers. The RL group received nudges selected by an adaptive RL algorithm. We
included 7,711 participants in primary analyses (mean age 42.1, 86.3% female,
baseline steps 5,618.2).
  We observed an increase in PA for the RL group compared to all other groups
from baseline to 1 and 2 months. The RL group had significantly increased
average daily step count at 1 month compared to all other groups: control (+296
steps, p=0.0002), random (+218 steps, p=0.005), and fixed (+238 steps,
p=0.002). At 2 months, the RL group sustained a significant increase compared
to the control group (+210 steps, p=0.0122). Generalized estimating equation
models also revealed a sustained increase in daily steps in the RL group vs.
control (+208 steps, p=0.002). These findings demonstrate the potential of a
scalable, behaviorally-informed RL approach to personalize digital health
interventions for PA.

### [227] [Measuring Time Series Forecast Stability for Demand Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10063)
*Steven Klee,Yuntian Xia*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper examines the importance of stability in time series forecasting models, emphasizing that consistency may be as critical as accuracy for production use, and analyzes various models for stability and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper highlights that while forecast accuracy is often the goal in designing time series models, production systems prioritize consistency and stability because unstable forecasts require significant human intervention and erode trust in ML models.

Method: The authors measure stability and accuracy of state-of-the-art time series models like Chronos, DeepAR, PatchTST, and others using public datasets from the M5 competition and Favorita grocery sales. Experimental comparisons were conducted, with a focus on ensemble models.

Result: The study found that ensemble models generally improve stability without significantly compromising, and in some cases improving, forecast accuracy.

Conclusion: The paper emphasizes the need for further research into forecast stability, especially for models deployed in real-world production systems, advocating for a deeper understanding of stability alongside accuracy.

Abstract: Time series forecasting is a critical first step in generating demand plans
for supply chains. Experiments on time series models typically focus on
demonstrating improvements in forecast accuracy over existing/baseline
solutions, quantified according to some accuracy metric. There is no doubt that
forecast accuracy is important; however in production systems, demand planners
often value consistency and stability over incremental accuracy improvements.
Assuming that the inputs have not changed significantly, forecasts that vary
drastically from one planning cycle to the next require high amounts of human
intervention, which frustrates demand planners and can even cause them to lose
trust in ML forecasting models. We study model-induced stochasticity, which
quantifies the variance of a set of forecasts produced by a single model when
the set of inputs is fixed. Models with lower variance are more stable.
  Recently the forecasting community has seen significant advances in forecast
accuracy through the development of deep machine learning models for time
series forecasting. We perform a case study measuring the stability and
accuracy of state-of-the-art forecasting models (Chronos, DeepAR, PatchTST,
Temporal Fusion Transformer, TiDE, and the AutoGluon best quality ensemble) on
public data sets from the M5 competition and Favorita grocery sales. We show
that ensemble models improve stability without significantly deteriorating (or
even improving) forecast accuracy. While these results may not be surprising,
the main point of this paper is to propose the need for further study of
forecast stability for models that are being deployed in production systems.

### [228] [Constrained Decoding of Diffusion LLMs with Context-Free Grammars](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10111)
*Niels Mündler,Jasper Dekoninck,Martin Vechev*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a constrained decoding method for diffusion language models (LLMs) to generate outputs that adhere to context-free grammars, effectively addressing the problem of generating syntactically and functionally correct outputs such as C++ code and JSON.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many practical applications of LLMs require syntactically correct outputs as per formal languages like C++ or JSON, but existing constrained decoding approaches do not work for diffusion LLMs.

Method: The authors propose reducing constrained decoding to additive infilling and then tackle this by checking intersections between the target language and regular languages using an efficient algorithm for context-free grammars.

Result: Empirical evidence shows the proposed method ensures near-perfect syntactic correctness and often improves functional correctness in tasks like C++ code infilling and JSON data extraction, with practical computational overhead.

Conclusion: The method effectively constrains diffusion LLM outputs to formal language structures, establishing a robust approach to syntactically and functionally correct generation for specified applications.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown promising performance across diverse
domains. Many practical applications of LLMs, such as code completion and
structured data extraction, require adherence to syntactic constraints
specified by a formal language. Yet, due to their probabilistic nature, LLM
output is not guaranteed to adhere to such formal languages. Prior work has
proposed constrained decoding as a means to restrict LLM generation to
particular formal languages. However, existing works are not applicable to the
emerging paradigm of diffusion LLMs, when used in practical scenarios such as
the generation of formally correct C++ or JSON output. In this paper we address
this challenge and present the first constrained decoding method for diffusion
models, one that can handle formal languages captured by context-free grammars.
We begin by reducing constrained decoding to the more general additive
infilling problem, which asks whether a partial output can be completed to a
valid word in the target language. This problem also naturally subsumes the
previously unaddressed multi-region infilling constrained decoding. We then
reduce this problem to the task of deciding whether the intersection of the
target language and a regular language is empty and present an efficient
algorithm to solve it for context-free languages. Empirical results on various
applications, such as C++ code infilling and structured data extraction in
JSON, demonstrate that our method achieves near-perfect syntactic correctness
while consistently preserving or improving functional correctness. Importantly,
our efficiency optimizations ensure that the computational overhead remains
practical.

### [229] [Less is More: Learning Graph Tasks with Just LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10115)
*Sola Shirai,Kavitha Srinivas,Julian Dolby,Michael Katz,Horst Samulowitz,Shirin Sohrabi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates how large language models (LLMs) can reason over graphs, demonstrating that even small LLMs can be trained to solve graph tasks and generalize effectively using chain-of-thought solutions, without needing specialized graph encoding models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Graph reasoning with LLMs has the potential to address various problems. However, the best methods for integrating graph reasoning into LLMs and the advantages of these approaches remain uncertain.

Method: The study empirically answers key questions about LLMs' graph task capabilities: training LLMs with chain-of-thought solutions to solve fundamental graph tasks, testing generalization to unseen graphs, and comparing approaches for learning graph tasks.

Result: Small LLMs successfully solve graph tasks and generalize to new tasks and structures by leveraging chain-of-thought solutions without requiring specialized graph encoders.

Conclusion: LLMs, even at a small scale, have significant potential for graph reasoning when appropriately trained, suggesting robust generalization capabilities and questioning the necessity of specialized encoding models.

Abstract: For large language models (LLMs), reasoning over graphs could help solve many
problems. Prior work has tried to improve LLM graph reasoning by examining how
best to serialize graphs as text and by combining GNNs and LLMs. However, the
merits of such approaches remain unclear, so we empirically answer the
following research questions: (1) Can LLMs learn to solve fundamental graph
tasks without specialized graph encoding models?, (2) Can LLMs generalize
learned solutions to unseen graph structures or tasks?, and (3) What are the
merits of competing approaches to learn graph tasks? We show that even small
LLMs can learn to solve graph tasks by training them with instructive
chain-of-thought solutions, and this training generalizes, without specialized
graph encoders, to new tasks and graph structures.

*Ke Niu,Haiyang Yu,Zhuofan Chen,Mengyang Zhao,Teng Fu,Bin Li,Xiangyang Xue*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces CAD-RL, a framework combining multimodal Chain-of-Thought (CoT)-guided reinforcement learning with specific optimization strategies to improve CAD code generation from natural language descriptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The aim is to simplify the complex CAD modeling process, which traditionally requires extensive domain expertise and manual effort, by leveraging advances in natural language processing and large language models.

Method: The authors propose CAD-RL, integrating CoT-guided cold start methods with reinforcement learning post training using task-specific rewards. Furthermore, optimization strategies are introduced, and a novel dataset called ExeCAD is created for benchmarking this method.

Result: Experiments prove that CAD-RL enhances reasoning, precision in output, and CAD code executability compared to existing vision-language models.

Conclusion: CAD-RL represents a step forward in automating CAD workflows, streamlining design intent translation to CAD code with increased accuracy and efficiency.

Abstract: Computer-Aided Design (CAD) plays a vital role in engineering and
manufacturing, yet current CAD workflows require extensive domain expertise and
manual modeling effort. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have
made it possible to generate code from natural language, opening new
opportunities for automating parametric 3D modeling. However, directly
translating human design intent into executable CAD code remains highly
challenging, due to the need for logical reasoning, syntactic correctness, and
numerical precision. In this work, we propose CAD-RL, a multimodal
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) guided reinforcement learning post training framework
for CAD modeling code generation. Our method combines CoT-based Cold Start with
goal-driven reinforcement learning post training using three task-specific
rewards: executability reward, geometric accuracy reward, and external
evaluation reward. To ensure stable policy learning under sparse and
high-variance reward conditions, we introduce three targeted optimization
strategies: Trust Region Stretch for improved exploration, Precision Token Loss
for enhanced dimensions parameter accuracy, and Overlong Filtering to reduce
noisy supervision. To support training and benchmarking, we release ExeCAD, a
noval dataset comprising 16,540 real-world CAD examples with paired natural
language and structured design language descriptions, executable CADQuery
scripts, and rendered 3D models. Experiments demonstrate that CAD-RL achieves
significant improvements in reasoning quality, output precision, and code
executability over existing VLMs.

*Maxime Heuillet,Yufei Cui,Boxing Chen,Audrey Durand,Prasanna Parthasarathi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Nested-ReFT enhances LLM reasoning with reduced computational cost and comparable performance, leveraging specific layers for dynamic decoding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address computational inefficiencies in reinforcement fine-tuning (ReFT), especially for large-scale models tackling complex reasoning tasks like mathematics.

Method: Introduced Nested-ReFT framework employing dynamic layer skipping within the target model to act as the behavior model, inspired by off-policy RL and speculative decoding.

Result: Nested-ReFT demonstrated improved computational efficiency in processing speed and required fewer resources while maintaining mathematical reasoning performance across benchmarks.

Conclusion: Nested-ReFT achieves unbiased gradient estimates with controlled variance, reducing cost and preserving performance, offering a practical solution in ReFT frameworks for LLMs.

Abstract: Advanced reasoning in LLMs on challenging domains like mathematical reasoning
can be tackled using verifiable rewards based reinforced fine-tuning (ReFT). In
standard ReFT frameworks, a behavior model generates multiple completions with
answers per problem, for the answer to be then scored by a reward function.
While such RL post-training methods demonstrate significant performance
improvements across challenging reasoning domains, the computational cost of
generating completions during training with multiple inference steps makes the
training cost non-trivial. To address this, we draw inspiration from off-policy
RL, and speculative decoding to introduce a novel ReFT framework, dubbed
Nested-ReFT, where a subset of layers of the target model acts as the behavior
model to generate off-policy completions during training. The behavior model
configured with dynamic layer skipping per batch during training decreases the
inference cost compared to the standard ReFT frameworks. Our theoretical
analysis shows that Nested-ReFT yields unbiased gradient estimates with
controlled variance. Our empirical analysis demonstrates improved computational
efficiency measured as tokens/sec across multiple math reasoning benchmarks and
model sizes. Additionally, we explore three variants of bias mitigation to
minimize the off-policyness in the gradient updates that allows for maintaining
performance that matches the baseline ReFT performance.

### [232] [EDAPT: Towards Calibration-Free BCIs with Continual Online Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10474)
*Lisa Haxel,Jaivardhan Kapoor,Ulf Ziemann,Jakob H. Macke*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: EDAPT is a framework for brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) that improves accuracy through continual adaptation, removing the need for frequent recalibration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: BCIs face challenges due to neural signal drift and inter-user variability, demanding frequent recalibration that hampers practical applications.

Method: EDAPT combines population-level pretraining with online continual supervised finetuning and occasional unsupervised domain adaptation, making it adaptable to evolving neural patterns without recalibration.

Result: When tested on nine datasets covering three tasks, EDAPT consistently outperformed static methods in accuracy, demonstrating real-time model updates within 200 milliseconds.

Conclusion: EDAPT represents a scalable and efficient solution for calibration-free BCIs, addressing a critical obstacle to their practical deployment.

Abstract: Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) suffer from accuracy degradation as neural
signals drift over time and vary across users, requiring frequent recalibration
that limits practical deployment. We introduce EDAPT, a task- and
model-agnostic framework that eliminates calibration through continual model
adaptation. EDAPT first trains a baseline decoder using data from multiple
users, then continually personalizes this model via supervised finetuning as
the neural patterns evolve during use. We tested EDAPT across nine datasets
covering three BCI tasks, and found that it consistently improved accuracy over
conventional, static methods. These improvements primarily stem from combining
population-level pretraining and online continual finetuning, with unsupervised
domain adaptation providing further gains on some datasets. EDAPT runs
efficiently, updating models within 200 milliseconds on consumer-grade
hardware. Finally, decoding accuracy scales with total data budget rather than
its allocation between subjects and trials. EDAPT provides a practical pathway
toward calibration-free BCIs, reducing a major barrier to BCI deployment.

*Yuhan Xie,William Cappelletti,Mahsa Shoaran,Pascal Frossard*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel semi-supervised pre-training strategy for time series classification, enhancing latent representation alignment with Neural Collapse theory and improving results across various models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Time series classification requires effective representation of complex temporal dynamics, while pre-training strategies lack guaranteed transferability to downstream tasks.

Method: The authors develop a semi-supervised pre-training approach combining rotational equiangular tight frame-classifier, pseudo-labeling, generative pretext tasks, and sequential augmentation for optimizing time series classifiers.

Result: Their method outperforms existing strategies on three multivariate time series classification datasets using LSTMs, transformers, and state-space models.

Conclusion: Aligning pre-training objectives with embedding geometry boosts classifier performance, showcasing its potential benefit for temporal data modeling.

Abstract: Deep neural networks for time series must capture complex temporal patterns,
to effectively represent dynamic data. Self- and semi-supervised learning
methods show promising results in pre-training large models, which -- when
finetuned for classification -- often outperform their counterparts trained
from scratch. Still, the choice of pretext training tasks is often heuristic
and their transferability to downstream classification is not granted, thus we
propose a novel semi-supervised pre-training strategy to enforce latent
representations that satisfy the Neural Collapse phenomenon observed in
optimally trained neural classifiers. We use a rotational equiangular tight
frame-classifier and pseudo-labeling to pre-train deep encoders with few
labeled samples. Furthermore, to effectively capture temporal dynamics while
enforcing embedding separability, we integrate generative pretext tasks with
our method, and we define a novel sequential augmentation strategy. We show
that our method significantly outperforms previous pretext tasks when applied
to LSTMs, transformers, and state-space models on three multivariate time
series classification datasets. These results highlight the benefit of aligning
pre-training objectives with theoretically grounded embedding geometry.

### [234] [Comparison of D-Wave Quantum Annealing and Markov Chain Monte Carlo for Sampling from a Probability Distribution of a Restricted Boltzmann Machine](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10228)
*Abdelmoula El Yazizi,Samee U. Khan,Yaroslav Koshka*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study compares sampling quality of a D-Wave quantum annealer and Gibbs sampling in Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs), finding mixed results and limited improvement in sampling quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and evaluate the quality of sampling from the D-Wave quantum annealer in comparison to Gibbs sampling within the context of RBMs and their impact on trainability.

Method: The paper employs a local-valley (LV) centered approach to compare samples generated by D-Wave quantum annealing and Gibbs sampling, analyzing them based on the number of LVs and the energy of the corresponding local minima.

Result: The D-Wave samples showed slightly higher LV diversity than Gibbs, but many LVs from the two methods were distinct. High-probability states overlapped more between the methods, while moderately important LVs were often found exclusively by one method.

Conclusion: D-Wave-based sampling showed limited complementary benefits over classical Gibbs sampling, with minor potential for improvement during later training stages in RBMs. A hybrid classical-quantum approach may hold promise for enhanced RBM trainability.

Abstract: A local-valley (LV) centered approach to assessing the quality of sampling
from Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) was applied to the latest generation
of the D-Wave quantum annealer. D-Wave and Gibbs samples from a classically
trained RBM were obtained at conditions relevant to the
contrastive-divergence-based RBM learning. The samples were compared for the
number of the LVs to which they belonged and the energy of the corresponding
local minima. No significant (desirable) increase in the number of the LVs has
been achieved by decreasing the D-Wave annealing time. At any training epoch,
the states sampled by the D-Wave belonged to a somewhat higher number of LVs
than in the Gibbs sampling. However, many of those LVs found by the two
techniques differed. For high-probability sampled states, the two techniques
were (unfavorably) less complementary and more overlapping. Nevertheless, many
potentially "important" local minima, i.e., those having intermediate, even if
not high, probability values, were found by only one of the two sampling
techniques while missed by the other. The two techniques overlapped less at
later than earlier training epochs, which is precisely the stage of the
training when modest improvements to the sampling quality could make meaningful
differences for the RBM trainability. The results of this work may explain the
failure of previous investigations to achieve substantial (or any) improvement
when using D-Wave-based sampling. However, the results reveal some potential
for improvement, e.g., using a combined classical-quantum approach.

TL;DR: The paper proposes an OOD detection method using counterfactual explanations to measure distances to decision boundaries, achieving competitive accuracy and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Safe deployment of machine learning systems necessitates accurate, explainable OOD detection, building on prior work that uses feature distance to decision boundaries.

Method: A post-hoc OOD detection method calculates distances to decision boundaries using counterfactual explanations, with scalability improvements achieved by working in embedding space.

Result: The method achieves 93.50% AUROC and 25.80% FPR95 on CIFAR-10; 97.05% AUROC and 13.79% FPR95 on CIFAR-100; and 92.55% AUROC and 33.55% FPR95 on ImageNet-200.

Conclusion: The approach provides state-of-the-art results and helps interpret OOD detection outputs, leveraging counterfactual explanations effectively.

Abstract: Accurate and explainable out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is required to
use machine learning systems safely. Previous work has shown that feature
distance to decision boundaries can be used to identify OOD data effectively.
In this paper, we build on this intuition and propose a post-hoc OOD detection
method that, given an input, calculates the distance to decision boundaries by
leveraging counterfactual explanations. Since computing explanations can be
expensive for large architectures, we also propose strategies to improve
scalability by computing counterfactuals directly in embedding space.
Crucially, as the method employs counterfactual explanations, we can seamlessly
use them to help interpret the results of our detector. We show that our method
is in line with the state of the art on CIFAR-10, achieving 93.50% AUROC and
25.80% FPR95. Our method outperforms these methods on CIFAR-100 with 97.05%
AUROC and 13.79% FPR95 and on ImageNet-200 with 92.55% AUROC and 33.55% FPR95

*Zhankun Luo,Abolfazl Hashemi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper examines the theoretical behavior of the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm under model misspecification in overspecified two-component Mixed Linear Regression (2MLR). It offers convergence and statistical accuracy results depending on balanced or unbalanced initial mixing weights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the persisting challenge of model misspecification in mixture models, particularly when the EM algorithm is applied to cases where the model has more components than the data distribution.

Method: The paper provides theoretical analysis at both population and finite-sample levels, examining convergence rates for regression parameters and statistical accuracy, based on initial mixing weight conditions.

Result: Key results identify linear convergence for unbalanced initial mixing weights and sublinear convergence for balanced weights at the population level. Statistical accuracy is derived as $O((d/n)^{1/2})$ for unbalanced weights and $O((d/n)^{1/4})$ for balanced weights at the finite-sample level.

Conclusion: Theoretical findings bridge population and finite-sample level EM behavior under misspecification, offering insights into iteration complexity and implications for low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) settings.

Abstract: Mixture models have attracted significant attention due to practical
effectiveness and comprehensive theoretical foundations. A persisting challenge
is model misspecification, which occurs when the model to be fitted has more
mixture components than those in the data distribution. In this paper, we
develop a theoretical understanding of the Expectation-Maximization (EM)
algorithm's behavior in the context of targeted model misspecification for
overspecified two-component Mixed Linear Regression (2MLR) with unknown
$d$-dimensional regression parameters and mixing weights. In Theorem 5.1 at the
population level, with an unbalanced initial guess for mixing weights, we
establish linear convergence of regression parameters in $O(\log(1/\epsilon))$
steps. Conversely, with a balanced initial guess for mixing weights, we observe
sublinear convergence in $O(\epsilon^{-2})$ steps to achieve the
$\epsilon$-accuracy at Euclidean distance. In Theorem 6.1 at the finite-sample
level, for mixtures with sufficiently unbalanced fixed mixing weights, we
demonstrate a statistical accuracy of $O((d/n)^{1/2})$, whereas for those with
sufficiently balanced fixed mixing weights, the accuracy is $O((d/n)^{1/4})$
given $n$ data samples. Furthermore, we underscore the connection between our
population level and finite-sample level results: by setting the desired final
accuracy $\epsilon$ in Theorem 5.1 to match that in Theorem 6.1 at the
finite-sample level, namely letting $\epsilon = O((d/n)^{1/2})$ for
sufficiently unbalanced fixed mixing weights and $\epsilon = O((d/n)^{1/4})$
for sufficiently balanced fixed mixing weights, we intuitively derive iteration
complexity bounds $O(\log (1/\epsilon))=O(\log (n/d))$ and
$O(\epsilon^{-2})=O((n/d)^{1/2})$ at the finite-sample level for sufficiently
unbalanced and balanced initial mixing weights. We further extend our analysis
in overspecified setting to low SNR regime.

*Ricardo Diaz-Rincon,Muxuan Liang,Adolfo Ramirez-Zamora,Benjamin Shickel*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents a conformal prediction framework to forecast Parkinson's Disease medication needs up to two years in advance, with reliable confidence measures to support clinical trust and optimize symptom management.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Managing Parkinson's Disease medications is challenging due to varying patient progression and treatment responses, requiring systematic prediction methods instead of trial-and-error approaches.

Method: The authors used electronic health records from 631 inpatient admissions and implemented a two-stage conformal prediction framework to identify patients likely needing medication changes and predict levodopa dose adjustments.

Result: The framework achieved statistical reliability with reduced prediction interval lengths compared to traditional methods, delivering precise short-term and broader long-term forecasts.

Conclusion: This approach offers clinicians reliable tools for evidence-based medication management, balancing symptom control with minimized side effects and better patient quality of life.

Abstract: Parkinson's Disease (PD) medication management presents unique challenges due
to heterogeneous disease progression and treatment response. Neurologists must
balance symptom control with optimal dopaminergic dosing based on functional
disability while minimizing side effects. This balance is crucial as inadequate
or abrupt changes can cause levodopa-induced dyskinesia, wearing off, and
neuropsychiatric effects, significantly reducing quality of life. Current
approaches rely on trial-and-error decisions without systematic predictive
methods. Despite machine learning advances, clinical adoption remains limited
due to reliance on point predictions that do not account for prediction
uncertainty, undermining clinical trust and utility. Clinicians require not
only predictions of future medication needs but also reliable confidence
measures. Without quantified uncertainty, adjustments risk premature escalation
to maximum doses or prolonged inadequate symptom control. We developed a
conformal prediction framework anticipating medication needs up to two years in
advance with reliable prediction intervals and statistical guarantees. Our
approach addresses zero-inflation in PD inpatient data, where patients maintain
stable medication regimens between visits. Using electronic health records from
631 inpatient admissions at University of Florida Health (2011-2021), our
two-stage approach identifies patients likely to need medication changes, then
predicts required levodopa equivalent daily dose adjustments. Our framework
achieved marginal coverage while reducing prediction interval lengths compared
to traditional approaches, providing precise predictions for short-term
planning and wider ranges for long-term forecasting. By quantifying
uncertainty, our approach enables evidence-based decisions about levodopa
dosing, optimizing symptom control while minimizing side effects and improving
life quality.

*Petr Spelda,Vit Stritecky*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Better reasoning performance in language models can arise not only from model improvements but also from using benchmarks as learning curricula. Evaluating new tasks is vital for their generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Assessing reasoning capabilities of language models is crucial as they advance and demonstrate improved generalization through intermediate reasoning traces.

Method: The study examined how impactful benchmarks serve as curricula for learning, focusing on the reasoning tasks in a problem from 'Humanity's Last Exam.'

Result: Benchmark-driven selection influenced the model DeepSeek-R1’s performance, showing that some benchmarks double as training tools and affect generalization evaluation.

Conclusion: Using benchmarks as learning tools can blur their role as unbiased test sets, but they are instrumental in guiding reasoning model development and assessing generalization.

Abstract: Evaluation of reasoning language models gained importance after it was
observed that they can combine their existing capabilities into novel traces of
intermediate steps before task completion and that the traces can sometimes
help them to generalize better than past models. As reasoning becomes the next
scaling dimension of large language models, careful study of their capabilities
in critical tasks is needed. We show that better performance is not always
caused by test-time algorithmic improvements or model sizes but also by using
impactful benchmarks as curricula for learning. We call this benchmark-driven
selection of AI and show its effects on DeepSeek-R1 using our sequential
decision-making problem from Humanity's Last Exam. Steering development of AI
by impactful benchmarks trades evaluation for learning and makes novelty of
test tasks key for measuring generalization capabilities of reasoning models.
Consequently, some benchmarks could be seen as curricula for training rather
than unseen test sets.

### [240] [Unpacking the Implicit Norm Dynamics of Sharpness-Aware Minimization in Tensorized Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10435)
*Tianxiao Cao,Kyohei Atarashi,Hisashi Kashima*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'Deviation-Aware Scaling (DAS)'—a novel technique inspired by the implicit regularization behavior of Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM), improving performance with lower computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAM is known for enhancing generalization in overparameterized models but lacks thorough exploration in general tensorized or scale-invariant models.

Method: The paper analyzes SAM's effect on the 'Norm Deviation'—a measure of norm imbalance—in tensorized models using gradient flow analysis. It then proposes DAS, a method that scales core norms in a data-adaptive way to emulate SAM's implicit regularization effect.

Result: DAS demonstrates competitive or better performance compared to SAM in various tasks, such as tensor completion, noisy training, model compression, and parameter-efficient fine-tuning, with reduced computational requirements.

Conclusion: Deviation-Aware Scaling (DAS) effectively captures and amplifies SAM's strengths, offering a computationally efficient alternative for better optimization outcomes in overparameterized models.

Abstract: Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) has been proven to be an effective
optimization technique for improving generalization in overparameterized
models. While prior works have explored the implicit regularization of SAM in
simple two-core scale-invariant settings, its behavior in more general
tensorized or scale-invariant models remains underexplored. In this work, we
leverage scale-invariance to analyze the norm dynamics of SAM in general
tensorized models. We introduce the notion of \emph{Norm Deviation} as a global
measure of core norm imbalance, and derive its evolution under SAM using
gradient flow analysis. We show that SAM's implicit control of Norm Deviation
is governed by the covariance between core norms and their gradient magnitudes.
Motivated by these findings, we propose a simple yet effective method,
\emph{Deviation-Aware Scaling (DAS)}, which explicitly mimics this
regularization behavior by scaling core norms in a data-adaptive manner. Our
experiments across tensor completion, noisy training, model compression, and
parameter-efficient fine-tuning confirm that DAS achieves competitive or
improved performance over SAM, while offering reduced computational overhead.

### [241] [AI-Driven Detection and Analysis of Handwriting on Seized Ivory: A Tool to Uncover Criminal Networks in the Illicit Wildlife Trade](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10219)
*Will Fein,Ryan J. Horwitz,John E. Brown III,Amit Misra,Felipe Oviedo,Kevin White,Juan M. Lavista Ferres,Samuel K. Wasser*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study introduces an AI-driven method to analyze handwritten markings on seized elephant tusks, revealing key forensic links between ivory trafficking seizures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Elephant populations are declining due to the ivory trade, and disrupting trafficking networks remains challenging. While DNA analysis offers strong evidence, it is costly and sometimes impractical, necessitating a cheaper alternative like handwriting analysis.

Method: The researchers developed an AI-driven pipeline to identify and analyze handwritten markings on tusks from 6,085 photographs across eight ivory seizures from 2014 to 2019. Using object detection models, they extracted over 17,000 markings and identified recurring 'signature markings.'

Result: The AI system identified 184 recurring signature markings, 20 of which appeared across multiple seizures, establishing connections between different trafficking events.

Conclusion: AI handwriting analysis is a scalable and cost-effective approach that complements existing forensic methods, filling critical gaps in wildlife crime investigations and strengthening efforts to stop ivory trafficking networks.

Abstract: The transnational ivory trade continues to drive the decline of elephant
populations across Africa, and trafficking networks remain difficult to
disrupt. Tusks seized by law enforcement officials carry forensic information
on the traffickers responsible for their export, including DNA evidence and
handwritten markings made by traffickers. For 20 years, analyses of tusk DNA
have identified where elephants were poached and established connections among
shipments of ivory. While the links established using genetic evidence are
extremely conclusive, genetic data is expensive and sometimes impossible to
obtain. But though handwritten markings are easy to photograph, they are rarely
documented or analyzed. Here, we present an AI-driven pipeline for extracting
and analyzing handwritten markings on seized elephant tusks, offering a novel,
scalable, and low-cost source of forensic evidence. Having collected 6,085
photographs from eight large seizures of ivory over a 6-year period
(2014-2019), we used an object detection model to extract over 17,000
individual markings, which were then labeled and described using
state-of-the-art AI tools. We identified 184 recurring "signature markings"
that connect the tusks on which they appear. 20 signature markings were
observed in multiple seizures, establishing forensic links between these
seizures through traffickers involved in both shipments. This work complements
other investigative techniques by filling in gaps where other data sources are
unavailable. The study demonstrates the transformative potential of AI in
wildlife forensics and highlights practical steps for integrating handwriting
analysis into efforts to disrupt organized wildlife crime.

*Alexander Merkov,David Rohde,Alexandre Gilotte,Benjamin Heymann*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper identifies unobserved confounding issues in recommender systems caused by standard practices, offers simulation studies to illustrate the phenomena, and provides practical mitigation steps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the problem of unobserved confounding, which hampers causal effect estimation in recommendation systems due to common practices such as feature engineering and A/B testing.

Method: The authors used simulation studies to analyze how common practices in recommendation systems introduce confounding and provided practical suggestions for mitigation strategies.

Result: The study demonstrates that practices like feature engineering and A/B testing can lead to unobserved confounding, thereby reducing the performance of recommendation systems.

Conclusion: Recommender system practitioners must be aware of hidden confounding from standard practices and adopt the outlined strategies to mitigate their effects.

Abstract: Unobserved confounding arises when an unmeasured feature influences both the
treatment and the outcome, leading to biased causal effect estimates. This
issue undermines observational studies in fields like economics, medicine,
ecology or epidemiology. Recommender systems leveraging fully observed data
seem not to be vulnerable to this problem. However many standard practices in
recommender systems result in observed features being ignored, resulting in
effectively the same problem. This paper will show that numerous common
practices such as feature engineering, A/B testing and modularization can in
fact introduce confounding into recommendation systems and hamper their
performance. Several illustrations of the phenomena are provided, supported by
simulation studies with practical suggestions about how practitioners may
reduce or avoid the affects of confounding in real systems.

### [243] [Interpretable Machine Learning Model for Early Prediction of Acute Kidney Injury in Critically Ill Patients with Cirrhosis: A Retrospective Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10233)
*Li Sun,Shuheng Chen,Junyi Fan,Yong Si,Minoo Ahmadi,Elham Pishgar,Kamiar Alaei,Maryam Pishgar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study created a LightGBM machine learning model to predict acute kidney injury (AKI) in ICU patients with cirrhosis, achieving high accuracy and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of accurately predicting AKI in critically ill cirrhosis patients, where existing tools lack precision and clinical applicability.

Method: The researchers analyzed 1240 ICU patients from the MIMIC-IV database, employing preprocessing, missing data handling, LASSO feature selection, and SMOTE balancing before training six algorithms. Model performance was evaluated using AUROC and other metrics.

Result: The LightGBM algorithm performed best, achieving an AUROC of 0.808, high accuracy, and a strong negative predictive value. It identified key predictors aligned with AKI mechanisms.

Conclusion: This interpretable model shows potential for early AKI prediction, aiding risk stratification and facilitating clinical decisions. Validation and system integration are necessary steps forward.

Abstract: Background: Cirrhosis is a progressive liver disease with high mortality and
frequent complications, notably acute kidney injury (AKI), which occurs in up
to 50% of hospitalized patients and worsens outcomes. AKI stems from complex
hemodynamic, inflammatory, and metabolic changes, making early detection
essential. Many predictive tools lack accuracy, interpretability, and alignment
with intensive care unit (ICU) workflows. This study developed an interpretable
machine learning model for early AKI prediction in critically ill patients with
cirrhosis.
  Methods: We conducted a retrospective analysis of the MIMIC-IV v2.2 database,
identifying 1240 adult ICU patients with cirrhosis and excluding those with ICU
stays under 48 hours or missing key data. Laboratory and physiological
variables from the first 48 hours were extracted. The pipeline included
preprocessing, missingness filtering, LASSO feature selection, and SMOTE class
balancing. Six algorithms-LightGBM, CatBoost, XGBoost, logistic regression,
naive Bayes, and neural networks-were trained and evaluated using AUROC,
accuracy, F1-score, sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values.
  Results: LightGBM achieved the best performance (AUROC 0.808, 95% CI
0.741-0.856; accuracy 0.704; NPV 0.911). Key predictors included prolonged
partial thromboplastin time, absence of outside-facility 20G placement, low pH,
and altered pO2, consistent with known cirrhosis-AKI mechanisms and suggesting
actionable targets.
  Conclusion: The LightGBM-based model enables accurate early AKI risk
stratification in ICU patients with cirrhosis using routine clinical variables.
Its high negative predictive value supports safe de-escalation for low-risk
patients, and interpretability fosters clinician trust and targeted prevention.
External validation and integration into electronic health record systems are
warranted.

### [244] [Can Transformers Break Encryption Schemes via In-Context Learning?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10235)
*Jathin Korrapati,Patrick Mendoza,Aditya Tomar,Abein Abraham*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores the in-context learning abilities of transformer-based models by applying them to cryptographic function learning tasks like decoding mono-alphabetic substitution and Vigenère ciphers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to study the inductive biases and generalization capabilities of transformers through an application area that poses a structured inference challenge—cryptographic function decoding.

Method: Transformer-based models are trained and assessed on inference tasks involving cryptographic functions like mono-alphabetic substitution and Vigenère ciphers, where they decode cipher texts from small sets of context examples.

Result: Transformers reveal their ability to leverage in-context learning for structured inference tasks like cryptographic decoding despite hidden bijective mappings.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the capacity of in-context learning to tackle cryptographic function challenges, paving the way for evaluating transformer models in highly structured reasoning tasks.

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) has emerged as a powerful capability of
transformer-based language models, enabling them to perform tasks by
conditioning on a small number of examples presented at inference time, without
any parameter updates. Prior work has shown that transformers can generalize
over simple function classes like linear functions, decision trees, even neural
networks, purely from context, focusing on numerical or symbolic reasoning over
underlying well-structured functions. Instead, we propose a novel application
of ICL into the domain of cryptographic function learning, specifically
focusing on ciphers such as mono-alphabetic substitution and Vigen\`ere
ciphers, two classes of private-key encryption schemes. These ciphers involve a
fixed but hidden bijective mapping between plain text and cipher text
characters. Given a small set of (cipher text, plain text) pairs, the goal is
for the model to infer the underlying substitution and decode a new cipher text
word. This setting poses a structured inference challenge, which is well-suited
for evaluating the inductive biases and generalization capabilities of
transformers under the ICL paradigm. Code is available at

### [245] [Pruning and Malicious Injection: A Retraining-Free Backdoor Attack on Transformer Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10243)
*Taibiao Zhao,Mingxuan Sun,Hao Wang,Xiaobing Chen,Xiangwei Zhou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces HPMI, a backdoor attack method for transformers that avoids retraining and architecture changes, achieving high success and robustness against defenses with minimal impact on clean accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformers excel in CV and NLP but are vulnerable to backdoor attacks. Existing attack methods often require intrusive retraining or architecture changes, making them resource-demanding.

Method: HPMI performs head-wise pruning and malicious injection by removing the least important head and inserting a pre-trained malicious head, requiring minimal data and prior knowledge without retraining.

Result: HPMI achieves negligible clean accuracy loss, a 99.55% or higher attack success rate, and circumvents four advanced defense mechanisms across multiple datasets.

Conclusion: HPMI offers a stealthy, effective, and robust approach to transformer backdoor attacks with minimal resource requirements compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Transformer models have demonstrated exceptional performance and have become
indispensable in computer vision (CV) and natural language processing (NLP)
tasks. However, recent studies reveal that transformers are susceptible to
backdoor attacks. Prior backdoor attack methods typically rely on retraining
with clean data or altering the model architecture, both of which can be
resource-intensive and intrusive. In this paper, we propose Head-wise Pruning
and Malicious Injection (HPMI), a novel retraining-free backdoor attack on
transformers that does not alter the model's architecture. Our approach
requires only a small subset of the original data and basic knowledge of the
model architecture, eliminating the need for retraining the target transformer.
Technically, HPMI works by pruning the least important head and injecting a
pre-trained malicious head to establish the backdoor. We provide a rigorous
theoretical justification demonstrating that the implanted backdoor resists
detection and removal by state-of-the-art defense techniques, under reasonable
assumptions. Experimental evaluations across multiple datasets further validate
the effectiveness of HPMI, showing that it 1) incurs negligible clean accuracy
loss, 2) achieves at least 99.55% attack success rate, and 3) bypasses four
advanced defense mechanisms. Additionally, relative to state-of-the-art
retraining-dependent attacks, HPMI achieves greater concealment and robustness
against diverse defense strategies, while maintaining minimal impact on clean
accuracy.

*Yuchen Zhu,Wei Guo,Jaemoo Choi,Guan-Horng Liu,Yongxin Chen,Molei Tao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Masked Diffusion Neural Sampler (MDNS), a method for learning discrete neural samplers to generate samples from challenging, high-dimensional, multi-modal distributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The aim is to address the challenge of sampling from discrete state spaces with large cardinalities and multi-modal distributions, a task relevant to fields like statistical physics and machine learning.

Method: MDNS, a novel framework, aligns two path measures using stochastic optimal control of continuous-time Markov chains and leverages a family of learning objectives for training.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate that MDNS achieves accurate sampling from target distributions, scaling effectively to high-dimensional problems and significantly outperforming other learning-based baselines.

Conclusion: MDNS showcases efficiency and scalability in sampling, with additional ablation and extension studies underlining its effectiveness and versatility.

Abstract: We study the problem of learning a neural sampler to generate samples from
discrete state spaces where the target probability mass function
$\pi\propto\mathrm{e}^{-U}$ is known up to a normalizing constant, which is an
important task in fields such as statistical physics, machine learning,
combinatorial optimization, etc. To better address this challenging task when
the state space has a large cardinality and the distribution is multi-modal, we
propose $\textbf{M}$asked $\textbf{D}$iffusion $\textbf{N}$eural
$\textbf{S}$ampler ($\textbf{MDNS}$), a novel framework for training discrete
neural samplers by aligning two path measures through a family of learning
objectives, theoretically grounded in the stochastic optimal control of the
continuous-time Markov chains. We validate the efficiency and scalability of
MDNS through extensive experiments on various distributions with distinct
statistical properties, where MDNS learns to accurately sample from the target
distributions despite the extremely high problem dimensions and outperforms
other learning-based baselines by a large margin. A comprehensive study of
ablations and extensions is also provided to demonstrate the efficacy and
potential of the proposed framework.

Motivation: The authors aim to enhance functional approximations by developing new exponential neural network operators, particularly under the Max Min and Kantorovich frameworks, to achieve better convergence and general properties in approximation tasks.

Method: The paper employs mathematical and analytical techniques to develop Max Min Kantorovich exponential neural network operators. It studies their convergence properties using tools like modulus of continuity and Orlicz spaces, supported by error representation through graphical methods.

Result: The Max Min Kantorovich exponential neural network operators exhibit strong potential for approximating functions, supported by evaluations on their convergence behavior, error rates, and depiction through illustrations.

Conclusion: The proposed approach proves effective for function approximation tasks, offering advancements in neural network operator design and delivering promising results in convergence and accuracy.

Abstract: In this current work, we propose a Max Min approach for approximating
functions using exponential neural network operators. We extend this framework
to develop the Max Min Kantorovich-type exponential neural network operators
and investigate their approximation properties. We study both pointwise and
uniform convergence for univariate functions. To analyze the order of
convergence, we use the logarithmic modulus of continuity and estimate the
corresponding rate of convergence. Furthermore, we examine the convergence
behavior of the Max Min Kantorovich type exponential neural network operators
within the Orlicz space setting. We provide some graphical representations to
illustrate the approximation error of the function through suitable kernel and
sigmoidal activation functions.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper tackles the issue of fairness in graph anomaly detection (GAD) by proposing a novel framework, DECAF-GAD, which balances performance and fairness through a structural causal model and fairness-guided loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the underexplored issue of fairness in graph anomaly detection, as existing GNN-based models can inherit and amplify biases, resulting in unfair outcomes.

Method: Proposes DECAF-GAD, a framework utilizing a structural causal model for disentangling sensitive attributes and an autoencoder-based architecture along with fairness-guided loss functions for improved fairness in GAD.

Result: DECAF-GAD demonstrates competitive anomaly detection performance while significantly enhancing fairness metrics when tested on synthetic and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully mitigates bias in GAD models, offering a balanced approach to maintaining detection performance while improving fairness. Code is available for further research.

Abstract: Graph anomaly detection (GAD) has become an increasingly important task
across various domains. With the rapid development of graph neural networks
(GNNs), GAD methods have achieved significant performance improvements.
However, fairness considerations in GAD remain largely underexplored. Indeed,
GNN-based GAD models can inherit and amplify biases present in training data,
potentially leading to unfair outcomes. While existing efforts have focused on
developing fair GNNs, most approaches target node classification tasks, where
models often rely on simple layer architectures rather than autoencoder-based
structures, which are the most widely used architecturs for anomaly detection.
To address fairness in autoencoder-based GAD models, we propose
\textbf{D}is\textbf{E}ntangled \textbf{C}ounterfactual \textbf{A}dversarial
\textbf{F}air (DECAF)-GAD, a framework that alleviates bias while preserving
GAD performance. Specifically, we introduce a structural causal model (SCM) to
disentangle sensitive attributes from learned representations. Based on this
causal framework, we formulate a specialized autoencoder architecture along
with a fairness-guided loss function. Through extensive experiments on both
synthetic and real-world datasets, we demonstrate that DECAF-GAD not only
achieves competitive anomaly detection performance but also significantly
enhances fairness metrics compared to baseline GAD methods. Our code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in cloud-native database systems, including high resource dynamism and complex scheduling, which traditional methods struggle to handle efficiently.

Method: Introduces a multi-agent reinforcement learning approach using heterogeneous role-based agent modeling, a reward-shaping mechanism, and a unified multi-agent training framework.

Result: The method outperforms traditional approaches in resource utilization, scheduling latency, policy convergence speed, system stability, and fairness, demonstrating strong generalization.

Conclusion: The proposed method is effective for large-scale scheduling tasks in real-world scenarios, particularly those involving high concurrency, high-dimensional states, and complex dependencies.

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenges of high resource dynamism and scheduling
complexity in cloud-native database systems. It proposes an adaptive resource
orchestration method based on multi-agent reinforcement learning. The method
introduces a heterogeneous role-based agent modeling mechanism. This allows
different resource entities, such as compute nodes, storage nodes, and
schedulers, to adopt distinct policy representations. These agents are better
able to reflect diverse functional responsibilities and local environmental
characteristics within the system. A reward-shaping mechanism is designed to
integrate local observations with global feedback. This helps mitigate policy
learning bias caused by incomplete state observations. By combining real-time
local performance signals with global system value estimation, the mechanism
improves coordination among agents and enhances policy convergence stability. A
unified multi-agent training framework is developed and evaluated on a
representative production scheduling dataset. Experimental results show that
the proposed method outperforms traditional approaches across multiple key
metrics. These include resource utilization, scheduling latency, policy
convergence speed, system stability, and fairness. The results demonstrate
strong generalization and practical utility. Across various experimental
scenarios, the method proves effective in handling orchestration tasks with
high concurrency, high-dimensional state spaces, and complex dependency
relationships. This confirms its advantages in real-world, large-scale
scheduling environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the computational limitations of Gaussian Processes when applied to large datasets or streaming scenarios, where traditional methods like Sparse GPs become intractable.

Method: The paper compares different reduction criteria comprehensively based on their computational complexity and data reduction behavior. It also introduces acceptance criteria to improve data filtering.

Result: The evaluation is conducted on benchmark functions and real-world datasets, including dynamic system identification tasks, providing practical guidelines for selecting reduction criteria.

Conclusion: The research establishes practical recommendations for choosing suitable data reduction criteria in online GP algorithms, enhancing their efficiency for large or streaming datasets.

Abstract: Gaussian Processes (GPs) are widely used for regression and system
identification due to their flexibility and ability to quantify uncertainty.
However, their computational complexity limits their applicability to small
datasets. Moreover in a streaming scenario, more and more datapoints accumulate
which is intractable even for Sparse GPs. Online GPs aim to alleviate this
problem by e.g. defining a maximum budget of datapoints and removing redundant
datapoints. This work provides a unified comparison of several reduction
criteria, analyzing both their computational complexity and reduction behavior.
The criteria are evaluated on benchmark functions and real-world datasets,
including dynamic system identification tasks. Additionally, acceptance
criteria are proposed to further filter out redundant datapoints. This work
yields practical guidelines for choosing a suitable criterion for an online GP
algorithm.

Motivation: To tackle specific challenges in multi-tenant cloud systems, such as privacy risks, diverse resource patterns, and inefficiencies in centralized anomaly detection models.

Method: A federated learning framework where tenants train anomaly detection models locally using their private data, combined with global parameter aggregation. Personalized parameter adjustments ensure tenant-specific adaptability, and Mahalanobis distance aids in computing anomaly scores.

Result: Experimental validations using real cloud platform telemetry data confirm the method's superiority in Precision, Recall, and F1-Score compared to mainstream models, alongside robustness across diverse scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed federated learning method enhances anomaly detection accuracy and stability while preserving data privacy, offering practical applications for resource monitoring in cloud computing.

Abstract: This paper proposes an anomaly detection method based on federated learning
to address key challenges in multi-tenant cloud environments, including data
privacy leakage, heterogeneous resource behavior, and the limitations of
centralized modeling. The method establishes a federated training framework
involving multiple tenants. Each tenant trains the model locally using private
resource usage data. Through parameter aggregation, a global model is
optimized, enabling cross-tenant collaborative anomaly detection while
preserving data privacy. To improve adaptability to diverse resource usage
patterns, a personalized parameter adjustment mechanism is introduced. This
allows the model to retain tenant-specific feature representations while
sharing global knowledge. In the model output stage, the Mahalanobis distance
is used to compute anomaly scores. This enhances both the accuracy and
stability of anomaly detection. The experiments use real telemetry data from a
cloud platform to construct a simulated multi-tenant environment. The study
evaluates the model's performance under varying participation rates and noise
injection levels. These comparisons demonstrate the proposed method's
robustness and detection accuracy. Experimental results show that the proposed
method outperforms existing mainstream models across key metrics such as
Precision, Recall, and F1-Score. It also maintains stable performance in
various complex scenarios. These findings highlight the method's practical
potential for intelligent resource monitoring and anomaly diagnosis in cloud

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method for adapting predictions under source component shifts, using offline decomposition and online mixing approaches to improve performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in online learning with recurring shifts and limitations of model-pool-based methods that fail to capture individual source components.

Method: Offline decomposition via the EM algorithm to learn source components, combined with online convex optimization for adaptive mixing of prediction models.

Result: The proposed method significantly reduces cumulative test loss, outperforming baselines in experiments with real-world regression datasets by up to 67.4%.

Conclusion: The method excels in leveraging shift characteristics, providing superior adaptation performance compared to existing techniques.

Abstract: This paper addresses source component shift adaptation, aiming to update
predictions adapting to source component shifts for incoming data streams based
on past training data. Existing online learning methods often fail to utilize
recurring shifts effectively, while model-pool-based methods struggle to
capture individual source components, leading to poor adaptation. In this
paper, we propose a source component shift adaptation method via an offline
decomposition and online mixing approach. We theoretically identify that the
problem can be divided into two subproblems: offline source component
decomposition and online mixing weight adaptation. Based on this, our method
first determines prediction models, each of which learns a source component
solely based on past training data offline through the EM algorithm. Then, it
updates the mixing weight of the prediction models for precise prediction
through online convex optimization. Thanks to our theoretical derivation, our
method fully leverages the characteristics of the shifts, achieving superior
adaptation performance over existing methods. Experiments conducted on various
real-world regression datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms
baselines, reducing the cumulative test loss by up to 67.4%.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces SynBrain, a generative framework that probabilistically models visual-to-neural transformation, addressing the challenges of biological variability and functional consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is rooted in the challenge of modeling the inherently variable yet functionally consistent visual-to-neural mapping, which traditional deterministic methods fail to achieve.

Method: The authors developed SynBrain, which includes BrainVAE for probabilistically learning neural distributions and a Semantic-to-Neural Mapper for projecting visual semantics into neural response manifolds.

Result: Experimental results indicate that SynBrain outperforms state-of-the-art methods in encoding visual stimuli to fMRI responses and adapts well to new subjects with limited data.

Conclusion: SynBrain not only advances our understanding of neural variability and consistency but also enhances data-scarce neural decoding applications. The method is interpretable, adaptable, and will be made openly accessible.

Abstract: Deciphering how visual stimuli are transformed into cortical responses is a
fundamental challenge in computational neuroscience. This visual-to-neural
mapping is inherently a one-to-many relationship, as identical visual inputs
reliably evoke variable hemodynamic responses across trials, contexts, and
subjects. However, existing deterministic methods struggle to simultaneously
model this biological variability while capturing the underlying functional
consistency that encodes stimulus information. To address these limitations, we
propose SynBrain, a generative framework that simulates the transformation from
visual semantics to neural responses in a probabilistic and biologically
interpretable manner. SynBrain introduces two key components: (i) BrainVAE
models neural representations as continuous probability distributions via
probabilistic learning while maintaining functional consistency through visual
semantic constraints; (ii) A Semantic-to-Neural Mapper acts as a semantic
transmission pathway, projecting visual semantics into the neural response
manifold to facilitate high-fidelity fMRI synthesis. Experimental results
demonstrate that SynBrain surpasses state-of-the-art methods in
subject-specific visual-to-fMRI encoding performance. Furthermore, SynBrain
adapts efficiently to new subjects with few-shot data and synthesizes
high-quality fMRI signals that are effective in improving data-limited
fMRI-to-image decoding performance. Beyond that, SynBrain reveals functional
consistency across trials and subjects, with synthesized signals capturing
interpretable patterns shaped by biological neural variability. The code will
be made publicly available.

Motivation: To enable medical institutions in an ever-changing healthcare landscape to adapt quickly and privacy-preservingly to new tasks or diseases by utilizing experiences from past knowledge through federated learning.

Method: The method involves a global clustering of tasks on the server side, optimization of aggregation weights (inter- and intra-cluster), and a bi-level optimization scheme for personalized task adaptation.

Result: FedKEI showed improved adaptation to new diseases across dermatology, chest X-rays, and retinal OCT datasets, surpassing state-of-the-art approaches.

Conclusion: FedKEI enhances adaptation efficiency in FL by leveraging cross-client and cross-task knowledge, proving its effectiveness in privacy-aware healthcare applications.

Abstract: In healthcare, federated learning (FL) is a widely adopted framework that
enables privacy-preserving collaboration among medical institutions. With large
foundation models (FMs) demonstrating impressive capabilities, using FMs in FL
through cost-efficient adapter tuning has become a popular approach. Given the
rapidly evolving healthcare environment, it is crucial for individual clients
to quickly adapt to new tasks or diseases by tuning adapters while drawing upon
past experiences. In this work, we introduce Federated Knowledge-Enhanced
Initialization (FedKEI), a novel framework that leverages cross-client and
cross-task transfer from past knowledge to generate informed initializations
for learning new tasks with adapters. FedKEI begins with a global clustering
process at the server to generalize knowledge across tasks, followed by the
optimization of aggregation weights across clusters (inter-cluster weights) and
within each cluster (intra-cluster weights) to personalize knowledge transfer
for each new task. To facilitate more effective learning of the inter- and
intra-cluster weights, we adopt a bi-level optimization scheme that
collaboratively learns the global intra-cluster weights across clients and
optimizes the local inter-cluster weights toward each client's task objective.
Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets of different modalities,
including dermatology, chest X-rays, and retinal OCT, demonstrate FedKEI's
advantage in adapting to new diseases compared to state-of-the-art methods.

### [255] [A Vision-Language Pre-training Model-Guided Approach for Mitigating Backdoor Attacks in Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10315)
*Keke Gai,Dongjue Wang,Jing Yu,Liehuang Zhu,Qi Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces CLIP-Fed, a backdoor defense framework leveraging vision-language pre-training models to mitigate backdoor attacks in Federated Learning under Non-IID data distributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods fail to defend against backdoor attacks in FL under heterogeneous client data distributions and lack practicality due to reliance on clean server datasets.

Method: CLIP-Fed integrates pre-aggregation and post-aggregation defense strategies, constructs an augmented server dataset using multimodal language models and frequency analysis, and aligns global model knowledge using prototype contrastive loss and Kullback-Leibler divergence.

Result: Experiments on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-10-LT datasets show average attack success rate reductions by 2.03% and 1.35%, respectively, while improving model performance by 7.92% and 0.48%.

Conclusion: CLIP-Fed effectively addresses privacy concerns, improves defense against backdoor attacks under Non-IID data distributions, and enhances overall model performance compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Existing backdoor defense methods in Federated Learning (FL) rely on the
assumption of homogeneous client data distributions or the availability of a
clean serve dataset, which limits the practicality and effectiveness. Defending
against backdoor attacks under heterogeneous client data distributions while
preserving model performance remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we
propose a FL backdoor defense framework named CLIP-Fed, which leverages the
zero-shot learning capabilities of vision-language pre-training models. By
integrating both pre-aggregation and post-aggregation defense strategies,
CLIP-Fed overcomes the limitations of Non-IID imposed on defense effectiveness.
To address privacy concerns and enhance the coverage of the dataset against
diverse triggers, we construct and augment the server dataset using the
multimodal large language model and frequency analysis without any client
samples. To address class prototype deviations caused by backdoor samples and
eliminate the correlation between trigger patterns and target labels, CLIP-Fed
aligns the knowledge of the global model and CLIP on the augmented dataset
using prototype contrastive loss and Kullback-Leibler divergence. Extensive
experiments on representative datasets validate the effectiveness of CLIP-Fed.
Compared to state-of-the-art methods, CLIP-Fed achieves an average reduction in
ASR, i.e., 2.03\% on CIFAR-10 and 1.35\% on CIFAR-10-LT, while improving
average MA by 7.92\% and 0.48\%, respectively.

*Claire Jie Zhang,Seyed A. Esmaeili,Jamie Morgenstern*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes welfare-centric clustering objectives, introduces algorithms with theoretical guarantees, and shows their superiority over baseline methods on real-world datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in equity-based and cost-focused clustering, and advocate for welfare-centric clustering using group utilities.

Method: Modeling group utilities based on distance and proportional representation, proposing Rawlsian and Utilitarian objectives, and developing novel algorithms with theoretical guarantees.

Result: Empirical evaluations across real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed methods outperform existing fair clustering approaches.

Conclusion: Welfare-centric clustering is a promising alternative to traditional fairness notions, achieving better practical outcomes supported by theoretical guarantees.

Abstract: Fair clustering has traditionally focused on ensuring equitable group
representation or equalizing group-specific clustering costs. However,
Dickerson et al. (2025) recently showed that these fairness notions may yield
undesirable or unintuitive clustering outcomes and advocated for a
welfare-centric clustering approach that models the utilities of the groups. In
this work, we model group utilities based on both distances and proportional
representation and formalize two optimization objectives based on
welfare-centric clustering: the Rawlsian (Egalitarian) objective and the
Utilitarian objective. We introduce novel algorithms for both objectives and
prove theoretical guarantees for them. Empirical evaluations on multiple
real-world datasets demonstrate that our methods significantly outperform
existing fair clustering baselines.

### [257] [A Hierarchical IDS for Zero-Day Attack Detection in Internet of Medical Things Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10346)
*Md Ashraf Uddin,Nam H. Chu,Reza Rafeh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a multi-level Intrusion Detection System (IDS) framework for IoMT devices to tackle zero-day attacks with high accuracy, ensuring data security and applicability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: IoMT systems face vulnerabilities from various cyberattacks, and traditional centralized IDS solutions are unsuitable due to their inefficiency, privacy risks, and inability to address zero-day attacks effectively.

Method: The proposed IDS framework employs a multi-level architecture: the first layer near the Edge uses meta-learning or One-Class Classification for coarse filtering, while subsequent Far Edge and Cloud layers identify specific attack types and novelty.

Result: Experiments conducted using the CICIoMT2024 dataset demonstrate 99.77% accuracy and 97.8% F1-score, showcasing the framework's effectiveness in detecting zero-day attacks and classifying known threats.

Conclusion: This approach addresses key challenges in IoMT cybersecurity, offering a scalable and robust solution that is highly applicable for protecting sensitive medical environments against zero-day threats.

Abstract: The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) is driving a healthcare revolution but
remains vulnerable to cyberattacks such as denial of service, ransomware, data
hijacking, and spoofing. These networks comprise resource constrained,
heterogeneous devices (e.g., wearable sensors, smart pills, implantables),
making traditional centralized Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) unsuitable
due to response delays, privacy risks, and added vulnerabilities. Centralized
IDSs require all sensors to transmit data to a central server, causing delays
or network disruptions in dense environments. Running IDSs locally on IoMT
devices is often infeasible due to limited computation, and even lightweight
IDS components remain at risk if updated models are delayed leaving them
exposed to zero-day attacks that threaten patient health and data security. We
propose a multi level IoMT IDS framework capable of detecting zero day attacks
and distinguishing between known and unknown threats. The first layer (near
Edge) filters traffic at a coarse level (attack or not) using meta-learning or
One Class Classification (OCC) with the usfAD algorithm. Subsequent layers (far
Edge, Cloud) identify attack type and novelty. Experiments on the CICIoMT2024
dataset show 99.77 percentage accuracy and 97.8 percentage F1-score. The first
layer detects zero-day attacks with high accuracy without needing new datasets,
ensuring strong applicability in IoMT environments. Additionally, the
meta-learning approach achieves high.

*Samer Lahoud,Kinda Khawam*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper explores statistical learning in semantic communication, focusing on receivers inferring meaning distributions from sequential observations, and evaluates the trade-off between immediate semantic performance and long-term learnability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To establish a theoretical framework for learning source statistics in semantic communication, emphasizing the importance of enabling receivers to infer underlying meaning distributions effectively.

Method: The study involves proving conditions for learnability, analyzing convergence rates, and quantifying semantic distortion based on estimation errors, supported by experiments on CIFAR-10 to validate theoretical findings.

Result: It is shown that effective transmission matrix rank is crucial for learnability, and that encoding schemes optimized for immediate performance may hinder long-term learning adaptability.

Conclusion: The paper provides insights into the balance between immediate semantic communication performance and the system's adaptability, offering foundational design principles for semantic communication systems.

Abstract: Semantic communication aims to convey meaning rather than bit-perfect
reproduction, representing a paradigm shift from traditional communication.
This paper investigates distribution learning in semantic communication where
receivers must infer the underlying meaning distribution through sequential
observations. While semantic communication traditionally optimizes individual
meaning transmission, we establish fundamental conditions for learning source
statistics when priors are unknown. We prove that learnability requires full
rank of the effective transmission matrix, characterize the convergence rate of
distribution estimation, and quantify how estimation errors translate to
semantic distortion. Our analysis reveals a fundamental trade-off: encoding
schemes optimized for immediate semantic performance often sacrifice long-term
learnability. Experiments on CIFAR-10 validate our theoretical framework,
demonstrating that system conditioning critically impacts both learning rate
and achievable performance. These results provide the first rigorous
characterization of statistical learning in semantic communication and offer
design principles for systems that balance immediate performance with
adaptation capability.

### [259] [eMamba: Efficient Acceleration Framework for Mamba Models in Edge Computing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10370)
*Jiyong Kim,Jaeho Lee,Jiahao Lin,Alish Kanani,Miao Sun,Umit Y. Ogras,Jaehyun Park*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents eMamba, a hardware-oriented acceleration framework for deploying Mamba machine learning models efficiently on edge platforms, achieving high performance, lower latency, lower resources, and retaining competitive accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to optimize the deployment of Mamba models, known for computational efficiency, on resource-constrained edge devices, where current hardware frameworks are lacking.

Method: eMamba replaces complex layers with hardware-aware alternatives, approximates costly operations, and uses approximation-aware neural architecture search to fine-tune parameters for edge deployment.

Result: eMamba achieves comparable accuracy to best-performing models with significantly fewer parameters, enhances hardware performance on edge tasks, and has been successfully implemented on FPGA and ASIC platforms.

Conclusion: eMamba demonstrates that hardware-optimized frameworks can deliver competitive performance and accuracy on edge platforms, significantly outperforming baseline solutions in efficiency and resource utilization.

Abstract: State Space Model (SSM)-based machine learning architectures have recently
gained significant attention for processing sequential data. Mamba, a recent
sequence-to-sequence SSM, offers competitive accuracy with superior
computational efficiency compared to state-of-the-art transformer models. While
this advantage makes Mamba particularly promising for resource-constrained edge
devices, no hardware acceleration frameworks are currently optimized for
deploying it in such environments. This paper presents eMamba, a comprehensive
end-to-end hardware acceleration framework explicitly designed for deploying
Mamba models on edge platforms. eMamba maximizes computational efficiency by
replacing complex normalization layers with lightweight hardware-aware
alternatives and approximating expensive operations, such as SiLU activation
and exponentiation, considering the target applications. Then, it performs an
approximation-aware neural architecture search (NAS) to tune the learnable
parameters used during approximation. Evaluations with Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10,
and MARS, an open-source human pose estimation dataset, show eMamba achieves
comparable accuracy to state-of-the-art techniques using 1.63-19.9$\times$
fewer parameters. In addition, it generalizes well to large-scale natural
language tasks, demonstrating stable perplexity across varying sequence lengths
on the WikiText2 dataset. We also quantize and implement the entire eMamba
pipeline on an AMD ZCU102 FPGA and ASIC using GlobalFoundries (GF) 22 nm
technology. Experimental results show 4.95-5.62$\times$ lower latency and
2.22-9.95$\times$ higher throughput, with 4.77$\times$ smaller area,
9.84$\times$ lower power, and 48.6$\times$ lower energy consumption than
baseline solutions while maintaining competitive accuracy.

### [260] [A Unified Evaluation Framework for Multi-Annotator Tendency Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10393)
*Liyun Zhang,Jingcheng Ke,Shenli Fan,Xuanmeng Sha,Zheng Lian*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces an evaluation framework for Individual Tendency Learning (ITL) methods that model the labeling behaviors of annotators, using two new metrics: Difference of Inter-annotator Consistency (DIC) and Behavior Alignment Explainability (BAE).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap of lacking an evaluation framework that verifies whether ITL methods accurately capture annotator-specific tendencies and provide meaningful behavioral explanations.

Method: The authors propose a unified evaluation framework that employs DIC to quantify the similarity between predicted and actual annotator behaviors, and BAE aligning explainability measures with labeling relevance using Multidimensional Scaling (MDS).

Result: The evaluation framework demonstrates effectiveness in assessing ITL methods, as validated through extensive experimentation.

Conclusion: The framework advances the field by providing a robust way to measure the accuracy and explanatory relevance of ITL methods, filling an existing gap in multi-annotator learning research.

Abstract: Recent works have emerged in multi-annotator learning that shift focus from
Consensus-oriented Learning (CoL), which aggregates multiple annotations into a
single ground-truth prediction, to Individual Tendency Learning (ITL), which
models annotator-specific labeling behavior patterns (i.e., tendency) to
provide explanation analysis for understanding annotator decisions. However, no
evaluation framework currently exists to assess whether ITL methods truly
capture individual tendencies and provide meaningful behavioral explanations.
To address this gap, we propose the first unified evaluation framework with two
novel metrics: (1) Difference of Inter-annotator Consistency (DIC) quantifies
how well models capture annotator tendencies by comparing predicted
inter-annotator similarity structures with ground-truth; (2) Behavior Alignment
Explainability (BAE) evaluates how well model explanations reflect annotator
behavior and decision relevance by aligning explainability-derived with
ground-truth labeling similarity structures via Multidimensional Scaling (MDS).
Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our proposed evaluation
framework.

*Aditya Tomar,Coleman Hooper,Minjae Lee,Haocheng Xi,Rishabh Tiwari,Wonjun Kang,Luca Manolache,Michael W. Mahoney,Kurt Keutzer,Amir Gholami*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces XQuant, a method for reducing memory consumption in LLM inference using low-bit quantization. It achieves extreme memory savings with minimal impact on accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is addressing the challenges of high memory footprint and bandwidth requirements in LLM inference, as hardware improvements have outpaced memory advancements.

Method: XQuant quantizes layer input activations instead of using standard KV caching, enabling on-the-fly rematerialization of Keys and Values. It also introduces XQuant-CL, leveraging cross-layer similarity for further compression.

Result: XQuant achieves up to ∼7.7× memory savings with less than 0.1 perplexity degradation, and XQuant-CL attains up to 12.5× memory savings with minor accuracy loss.

Conclusion: The approach eliminates the memory bottleneck while maintaining near-FP16 accuracy and outperforms existing KV cache quantization methods.

Abstract: Although LLM inference has emerged as a critical workload for many downstream
applications, efficiently inferring LLMs is challenging due to the substantial
memory footprint and bandwidth requirements. In parallel, compute capabilities
have steadily outpaced both memory capacity and bandwidth over the last few
decades, a trend that remains evident in modern GPU hardware and exacerbates
the challenge of LLM inference. As such, new algorithms are emerging that trade
increased computation for reduced memory operations. To that end, we present
XQuant, which takes advantage of this trend, enabling an order-of-magnitude
reduction in memory consumption through low-bit quantization with substantial
accuracy benefits relative to state-of-the-art KV cache quantization methods.
We accomplish this by quantizing and caching the layer input activations X,
instead of using standard KV caching, and then rematerializing the Keys and
Values on-the-fly during inference. This results in an immediate 2$\times$
memory savings compared to KV caching. By applying XQuant, we achieve up to
$\sim 7.7\times$ memory savings with $<0.1$ perplexity degradation compared to
the FP16 baseline. Furthermore, our approach leverages the fact that X values
are similar across layers. Building on this observation, we introduce
XQuant-CL, which exploits the cross-layer similarity in the X embeddings for
extreme compression. Across different models, XQuant-CL attains up to
10$\times$ memory savings relative to the FP16 baseline with only 0.01
perplexity degradation, and 12.5$\times$ memory savings with only $0.1$
perplexity degradation. XQuant exploits the rapidly increasing compute
capabilities of hardware platforms to eliminate the memory bottleneck, while
surpassing state-of-the-art KV cache quantization methods and achieving
near-FP16 accuracy across a wide range of models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces SC2Arena, an advanced benchmark for evaluating large language models (LLMs) in the complex domain of StarCraft II, and StarEvolve, a hierarchical framework designed to enhance strategic planning and tactical execution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to fill the current gaps in existing benchmarks for evaluating LLMs in complex tasks like StarCraft II, which fail to capture key elements such as full game context, diverse action spaces, and playable races.

Method: SC2Arena supports all playable races, low-level actions, and text-based observations for spatial reasoning. StarEvolve employs a hierarchical approach with Planner-Executor-Verifier components and iterative self-correction enhanced by fine-tuning on high-quality data.

Result: Comprehensive analysis with SC2Arena offers new insights into developing generalist agents, and experimental results show StarEvolve's superior performance in strategic planning.

Conclusion: SC2Arena and StarEvolve advance evaluation frameworks for LLMs and demonstrate significant progress in strategic planning, making their code and algorithms publicly accessible for further development.

Abstract: Evaluating large language models (LLMs) in complex decision-making is
essential for advancing AI's ability for strategic planning and real-time
adaptation. However, existing benchmarks for tasks like StarCraft II fail to
capture the game's full complexity, such as its complete game context, diverse
action spaces, and all playable races. To address this gap, we present
SC2Arena, a benchmark that fully supports all playable races, low-level action
spaces, and optimizes text-based observations to tackle spatial reasoning
challenges. Complementing this, we introduce StarEvolve, a hierarchical
framework that integrates strategic planning with tactical execution, featuring
iterative self-correction and continuous improvement via fine-tuning on
high-quality gameplay data. Its key components include a
Planner-Executor-Verifier structure to break down gameplay, and a scoring
system for selecting high-quality training samples. Comprehensive analysis
using SC2Arena provides valuable insights into developing generalist agents
that were not possible with previous benchmarks. Experimental results also
demonstrate that our proposed StarEvolve achieves superior performance in
strategic planning. Our code, environment, and algorithms are publicly

### [263] [RealAC: A Domain-Agnostic Framework for Realistic and Actionable Counterfactual Explanations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10455)
*Asiful Arefeen,Shovito Barua Soumma,Hassan Ghasemzadeh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces RealAC, a framework for generating realistic and actionable counterfactual explanations for AI decisions, enabling practical interpretability while respecting data features and user-defined constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing counterfactual generation methods often rely on rigid, hand-crafted constraints or domain-specific knowledge, making them less generalizable and incapable of capturing complex inter-feature relations. Additionally, these methods lack flexibility to meet user-specified preferences and often produce causally implausible or infeasible explanations.

Method: RealAC aligns the joint distributions of feature pairs between factual and counterfactual instances, preserving complex inter-feature dependencies automatically. It also allows users to freeze attributes by suppressing changes in specified features during the optimization process.

Result: The framework was tested on three synthetic and two real datasets. RealAC outperformed state-of-the-art methods and LLM-based approaches in metrics such as causal edge score, dependency preservation score, and IM1 realism metric, showing better balance between realism and actionability.

Conclusion: RealAC offers a domain-agnostic, causality-aware, and user-centric counterfactual generation framework that improves the practicality and interpretability of AI decisions across diverse applications.

Abstract: Counterfactual explanations provide human-understandable reasoning for
AI-made decisions by describing minimal changes to input features that would
alter a model's prediction. To be truly useful in practice, such explanations
must be realistic and feasible -- they should respect both the underlying data
distribution and user-defined feasibility constraints. Existing approaches
often enforce inter-feature dependencies through rigid, hand-crafted
constraints or domain-specific knowledge, which limits their generalizability
and ability to capture complex, nonlinear relations inherent in data. Moreover,
they rarely accommodate user-specified preferences and suggest explanations
that are causally implausible or infeasible to act upon. We introduce RealAC, a
domain-agnostic framework for generating realistic and actionable
counterfactuals. RealAC automatically preserves complex inter-feature
dependencies without relying on explicit domain knowledge -- by aligning the
joint distributions of feature pairs between factual and counterfactual
instances. The framework also allows end-users to ``freeze'' attributes they
cannot or do not wish to change by suppressing change in frozen features during
optimization. Evaluations on three synthetic and two real datasets demonstrate
that RealAC balances realism with actionability. Our method outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines and Large Language Model-based counterfactual
generation techniques in causal edge score, dependency preservation score, and
IM1 realism metric and offers a solution for causality-aware and user-centric
counterfactual generation.

*Prajit Sengupta,Islem Rekik*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: X-Node is a self-explaining GNN framework that provides faithful, node-level explanations while maintaining competitive accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GNNs lack inherent interpretability, which is critical in clinical applications where decisions must be explainable.

Method: X-Node introduces a self-explaining mechanism using structured context vectors, a Reasoner module for explanations, and a 'text-injection' strategy to integrate explanations into the GNN pipeline.

Result: X-Node achieves competitive classification accuracy on graph datasets derived from MedMNIST and MorphoMNIST while offering per-node explanations.

Conclusion: X-Node improves trustworthiness and interpretability in GNN applications by providing faithful and context-rich node-level explanations.

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art results in
computer vision and medical image classification tasks by capturing structural
dependencies across data instances. However, their decision-making remains
largely opaque, limiting their trustworthiness in high-stakes clinical
applications where interpretability is essential. Existing explainability
techniques for GNNs are typically post-hoc and global, offering limited insight
into individual node decisions or local reasoning. We introduce X-Node, a
self-explaining GNN framework in which each node generates its own explanation
as part of the prediction process. For every node, we construct a structured
context vector encoding interpretable cues such as degree, centrality,
clustering, feature saliency, and label agreement within its local topology. A
lightweight Reasoner module maps this context into a compact explanation
vector, which serves three purposes: (1) reconstructing the node's latent
embedding via a decoder to enforce faithfulness, (2) generating a natural
language explanation using a pre-trained LLM (e.g., Grok or Gemini), and (3)
guiding the GNN itself via a "text-injection" mechanism that feeds explanations
back into the message-passing pipeline. We evaluate X-Node on two graph
datasets derived from MedMNIST and MorphoMNIST, integrating it with GCN, GAT,
and GIN backbones. Our results show that X-Node maintains competitive
classification accuracy while producing faithful, per-node explanations.

*Xinrui Li,Qilin Fan,Tianfu Wang,Kaiwen Wei,Ke Yu,Xu Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces GraphFedMIG, a federated graph learning framework addressing class imbalance using a mutual information-guided generative model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the challenge of statistical heterogeneity and class imbalance in federated graph learning, which leads to biased global models and impaired rare class representation.

Method: GraphFedMIG employs a hierarchical generative adversarial network, with local generators creating feature representations and clustered clients sharing discriminators. It uses mutual information-guided mechanisms for targeted data augmentation.

Result: The framework improves minority-class representation and achieves superior performance compared to baseline methods in experiments across four real-world datasets.

Conclusion: GraphFedMIG effectively mitigates class imbalance in federated graph learning, enhancing the global model's capability to identify rare but critical events.

Abstract: Federated graph learning (FGL) enables multiple clients to collaboratively
train powerful graph neural networks without sharing their private,
decentralized graph data. Inherited from generic federated learning, FGL is
critically challenged by statistical heterogeneity, where non-IID data
distributions across clients can severely impair model performance. A
particularly destructive form of this is class imbalance, which causes the
global model to become biased towards majority classes and fail at identifying
rare but critical events. This issue is exacerbated in FGL, as nodes from a
minority class are often surrounded by biased neighborhood information,
hindering the learning of expressive embeddings. To grapple with this
challenge, we propose GraphFedMIG, a novel FGL framework that reframes the
problem as a federated generative data augmentation task. GraphFedMIG employs a
hierarchical generative adversarial network where each client trains a local
generator to synthesize high-fidelity feature representations. To provide
tailored supervision, clients are grouped into clusters, each sharing a
dedicated discriminator. Crucially, the framework designs a mutual
information-guided mechanism to steer the evolution of these client generators.
By calculating each client's unique informational value, this mechanism
corrects the local generator parameters, ensuring that subsequent rounds of
mutual information-guided generation are focused on producing high-value,
minority-class features. We conduct extensive experiments on four real-world
datasets, and the results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed
GraphFedMIG compared with other baselines.

Abstract: We introduce an output layer for neural networks that ensures satisfaction of
convex constraints. Our approach, $\Pi$net, leverages operator splitting for
rapid and reliable projections in the forward pass, and the implicit function
theorem for backpropagation. We deploy $\Pi$net as a feasible-by-design
optimization proxy for parametric constrained optimization problems and obtain
modest-accuracy solutions faster than traditional solvers when solving a single
problem, and significantly faster for a batch of problems. We surpass
state-of-the-art learning approaches in terms of training time, solution
quality, and robustness to hyperparameter tuning, while maintaining similar
inference times. Finally, we tackle multi-vehicle motion planning with
non-convex trajectory preferences and provide $\Pi$net as a GPU-ready package
implemented in JAX with effective tuning heuristics.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage Joint Embedding Predictive Architectures (JEPAs) for superior models in creating structured state spaces for dynamic systems.

Method: The method integrates sequence embeddings with neural ODEs using loss functions enforcing embedding contraction and Lipschitz constants.

Result: The technique produces structured latent state-space models for a pendulum system based solely on image observations.

Conclusion: This methodology enables new avenues for robust control algorithms and estimation techniques in robotics and dynamic systems.

Abstract: With the advent of Joint Embedding Predictive Architectures (JEPAs), which
appear to be more capable than reconstruction-based methods, this paper
introduces a novel technique for creating world models using continuous-time
dynamic systems from arbitrary observation data. The proposed method integrates
sequence embeddings with neural ordinary differential equations (neural ODEs).
It employs loss functions that enforce contractive embeddings and Lipschitz
constants in state transitions to construct a well-organized latent state
space. The approach's effectiveness is demonstrated through the generation of
structured latent state-space models for a simple pendulum system using only
image data. This opens up a new technique for developing more general control
algorithms and estimation techniques with broad applications in robotics.

TL;DR: ReLU networks often produce noisy gradient-based explanations due to sharp transitions; this paper introduces a spectral framework to analyze and improve explanation smoothness and faithfulness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing gradient-based explanation methods for ReLU networks are noisy and difficult to interpret, pushing for a need to analyze and optimize smoothness and faithfulness.

Method: A spectral framework was introduced to systematically analyze smoothness, faithfulness, and their trade-offs in explanations for ReLU networks.

Result: The study formally defines the "explanation gap" caused by smoothing in post-hoc methods and validates findings through extensive testing across different datasets and methods.

Conclusion: The framework provides a principled approach to understanding and optimizing smoothness-faithfulness trade-offs in explanatory methods for ReLU networks.

Abstract: ReLU networks, while prevalent for visual data, have sharp transitions,
sometimes relying on individual pixels for predictions, making vanilla
gradient-based explanations noisy and difficult to interpret. Existing methods,
such as GradCAM, smooth these explanations by producing surrogate models at the
cost of faithfulness. We introduce a unifying spectral framework to
systematically analyze and quantify smoothness, faithfulness, and their
trade-off in explanations. Using this framework, we quantify and regularize the
contribution of ReLU networks to high-frequency information, providing a
principled approach to identifying this trade-off. Our analysis characterizes
how surrogate-based smoothing distorts explanations, leading to an
``explanation gap'' that we formally define and measure for different post-hoc
methods. Finally, we validate our theoretical findings across different design
choices, datasets, and ablations.

### [269] [Contrastive ECOC: Learning Output Codes for Adversarial Defense](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10491)
*Che-Yu Chou,Hung-Hsuan Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper explores the use of contrastive learning to automate and enhance the generation of error-correcting codebooks for multiclass classification, showcasing better performance against adversarial attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve multiclass classification by addressing the limitations of traditional one-hot encoding and manually constructed error-correcting codebooks, which can be inefficient and dataset-agnostic.

Method: The authors propose three models for automated codebook learning using contrastive learning, which allows the codebooks to be adaptively learned from data rather than manually created.

Result: The proposed models were tested on four datasets and demonstrated stronger robustness to adversarial attacks compared to two baseline methods.

Conclusion: Contrastive learning-based models for codebook generation offer superior adaptability and robustness, presenting a significant advancement over traditional error-correcting output code methods.

Abstract: Although one-hot encoding is commonly used for multiclass classification, it
is not always the most effective encoding mechanism. Error Correcting Output
Codes (ECOC) address multiclass classification by mapping each class to a
unique codeword used as a label. Traditional ECOC methods rely on manually
designed or randomly generated codebooks, which are labor-intensive and may
yield suboptimal, dataset-agnostic results. This paper introduces three models
for automated codebook learning based on contrastive learning, allowing
codebooks to be learned directly and adaptively from data. Across four
datasets, our proposed models demonstrate superior robustness to adversarial
attacks compared to two baselines. The source is available at

*Jiulin Li,Ping Huang,Yexin Li,Shuo Chen,Juewen Hu,Ye Tian*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MAGUS is a modular framework integrating multimodal understanding and generation using separate reasoning and generation phases without requiring joint training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To unify multimodal understanding and generation while addressing challenges associated with rigid pipelines or tightly coupled architectures.

Method: MAGUS employs a two-phase approach: Cognition phase uses multimodal LLM agents for structured dialogue, while Deliberation phase combines reasoning and diffusion-based generation via Growth-Aware Search mechanism.

Result: MAGUS achieves superior performance compared to strong baselines and state-of-the-art systems across benchmarks including image, video, and audio generation, outperforming closed-source systems like GPT-4o.

Conclusion: The framework proves extensible, scalable, and semantically aligned, demonstrating its potential in multimodal applications.

Abstract: Real-world multimodal applications often require any-to-any capabilities,
enabling both understanding and generation across modalities including text,
image, audio, and video. However, integrating the strengths of autoregressive
language models (LLMs) for reasoning and diffusion models for high-fidelity
generation remains challenging. Existing approaches rely on rigid pipelines or
tightly coupled architectures, limiting flexibility and scalability. We propose
MAGUS (Multi-Agent Guided Unified Multimodal System), a modular framework that
unifies multimodal understanding and generation via two decoupled phases:
Cognition and Deliberation. MAGUS enables symbolic multi-agent collaboration
within a shared textual workspace. In the Cognition phase, three
role-conditioned multimodal LLM agents - Perceiver, Planner, and Reflector -
engage in collaborative dialogue to perform structured understanding and
planning. The Deliberation phase incorporates a Growth-Aware Search mechanism
that orchestrates LLM-based reasoning and diffusion-based generation in a
mutually reinforcing manner. MAGUS supports plug-and-play extensibility,
scalable any-to-any modality conversion, and semantic alignment - all without
the need for joint training. Experiments across multiple benchmarks, including
image, video, and audio generation, as well as cross-modal instruction
following, demonstrate that MAGUS outperforms strong baselines and
state-of-the-art systems. Notably, on the MME benchmark, MAGUS surpasses the
powerful closed-source model GPT-4o.

*Dmitrii Dobrynin,Masoud Mohseni,John Paul Strachan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes using deep reinforcement learning to enhance Nonequilibrium Nonlocal Monte Carlo (NMC) algorithms for solving challenging combinatorial optimization problems, outperforming traditional MCMC methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods struggle to solve combinatorial optimization problems in challenging scenarios involving computational phase transitions and overlap-gap-properties.

Method: Deep reinforcement learning is used to train nonlocal transition policies in Nonequilibrium Nonlocal Monte Carlo (NMC) algorithms, using energy changes and geometry of the local energy landscape as reinforcement learning states and rewards.

Result: Trained policies improve efficiency in residual energy, time-to-solution, and diversity of solutions compared to standard MCMC-based and nonlocal simulated annealing methods on 4-SAT benchmarks.

Conclusion: Combining deep reinforcement learning with NMC algorithms enhances exploration and exploitation of solution spaces, providing a superior approach for tackling difficult optimization benchmarks.

Abstract: Optimizing or sampling complex cost functions of combinatorial optimization
problems is a longstanding challenge across disciplines and applications. When
employing family of conventional algorithms based on Markov Chain Monte Carlo
(MCMC) such as simulated annealing or parallel tempering, one assumes
homogeneous (equilibrium) temperature profiles across input. This instance
independent approach was shown to be ineffective for the hardest benchmarks
near a computational phase transition when the so-called overlap-gap-property
holds. In these regimes conventional MCMC struggles to unfreeze rigid
variables, escape suboptimal basins of attraction, and sample high-quality and
diverse solutions. In order to mitigate these challenges, Nonequilibrium
Nonlocal Monte Carlo (NMC) algorithms were proposed that leverage inhomogeneous
temperature profiles thereby accelerating exploration of the configuration
space without compromising its exploitation. Here, we employ deep reinforcement
learning (RL) to train the nonlocal transition policies of NMC which were
previously designed phenomenologically. We demonstrate that the resulting
solver can be trained solely by observing energy changes of the configuration
space exploration as RL rewards and the local minimum energy landscape geometry
as RL states. We further show that the trained policies improve upon the
standard MCMC-based and nonlocal simulated annealing on hard uniform random and
scale-free random 4-SAT benchmarks in terms of residual energy,
time-to-solution, and diversity of solutions metrics.

*Hao Luan,Yi Xian Goh,See-Kiong Ng,Chun Kai Ling*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents Projected Coupled Diffusion (PCD), a test-time framework enabling constrained joint generation using multiple pre-trained diffusion models without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of generating correlated samples from multiple diffusion models while enforcing task-specific constraints without retraining.

Method: PCD introduces a coupled guidance term for coordination between models and a projection step to enforce constraints during generation.

Result: Empirical evaluations demonstrate improved sample coupling and guaranteed constraint satisfaction across applications like image-pair generation, object manipulation, and multi-robot motion planning.

Conclusion: PCD achieves constrained joint generation effectively and efficiently, showcasing its potential in real-world applications without increasing computational burden.

Abstract: Modifications to test-time sampling have emerged as an important extension to
diffusion algorithms, with the goal of biasing the generative process to
achieve a given objective without having to retrain the entire diffusion model.
However, generating jointly correlated samples from multiple pre-trained
diffusion models while simultaneously enforcing task-specific constraints
without costly retraining has remained challenging. To this end, we propose
Projected Coupled Diffusion (PCD), a novel test-time framework for constrained
joint generation. PCD introduces a coupled guidance term into the generative
dynamics to encourage coordination between diffusion models and incorporates a
projection step at each diffusion step to enforce hard constraints.
Empirically, we demonstrate the effectiveness of PCD in application scenarios
of image-pair generation, object manipulation, and multi-robot motion planning.
Our results show improved coupling effects and guaranteed constraint
satisfaction without incurring excessive computational costs.

TL;DR: Applm, powered by the xTrimoPGLM protein language model, excels in allergen prediction tasks and outperforms state-of-the-art methods in realistic scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to create a framework for accurately identifying allergen proteins, addressing public health concerns related to adverse immune responses.

Method: A computational framework, Applm, is built using the xTrimoPGLM language model trained on a vast dataset of protein sequences.

Result: Applm outperformed seven leading methods across diverse tasks, including detecting novel allergens and assessing mutation effects.

Conclusion: Applm leverages advanced protein language modeling to offer superior allergen identification, supported by open-source tools and benchmarks for research advancement.

Abstract: Allergens, typically proteins capable of triggering adverse immune responses,
represent a significant public health challenge. To accurately identify
allergen proteins, we introduce Applm (Allergen Prediction with Protein
Language Models), a computational framework that leverages the 100-billion
parameter xTrimoPGLM protein language model. We show that Applm consistently
outperforms seven state-of-the-art methods in a diverse set of tasks that
closely resemble difficult real-world scenarios. These include identifying
novel allergens that lack similar examples in the training set, differentiating
between allergens and non-allergens among homologs with high sequence
similarity, and assessing functional consequences of mutations that create few
changes to the protein sequences. Our analysis confirms that xTrimoPGLM,
originally trained on one trillion tokens to capture general protein sequence
characteristics, is crucial for Applm's performance by detecting important
differences among protein sequences. In addition to providing Applm as
open-source software, we also provide our carefully curated benchmark datasets
to facilitate future research.

*Zetian Sun,Dongfang Li,Zhuoen Chen,Yuhuai Qin,Baotian Hu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes Gated Reward Accumulation (G-RA), a method for reward shaping in long-horizon RL tasks, particularly in software engineering scenarios, enhancing task completion and modification rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the issue of reward sparsity in long-horizon RL tasks and challenges with existing reward shaping methods in software engineering contexts.

Method: The authors introduce an SWE-oriented RL Framework and Gated Reward Accumulation (G-RA), which accumulates immediate rewards only if high-level rewards surpass a threshold.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that G-RA increases task completion rates (up to 93.8%) and modification rates while avoiding policy degradation from reward misalignment.

Conclusion: G-RA effectively balances immediate and long-term rewards in RL tasks, providing a robust solution for long-horizon challenges in software engineering environments.

Abstract: Reward sparsity in long-horizon reinforcement learning (RL) tasks remains a
significant challenge, while existing outcome-based reward shaping struggles to
define meaningful immediate rewards without introducing bias or requiring
explicit task decomposition. Alternatively, verification-based reward shaping
uses stepwise critics, but misalignment between immediate rewards and long-term
objectives can lead to reward hacking and suboptimal policies. In this work, we
address this problem in the context of software engineering (SWE) tasks, where
multi-turn reasoning and rule-based verification are critical. We introduce the
SWE-oriented RL Framework, a unified system supporting multi-turn interaction,
docker-based execution, and customizable reward functions. Additionally, we
propose Gated Reward Accumulation (G-RA), a novel method that accumulates
immediate rewards only when high-level (long-term) rewards meet a predefined
threshold, ensuring stable RL optimization. Experiments on SWE-bench Verified
and kBench demonstrate that G-RA leads to an increase in completion rates
(47.6\% \rightarrow 93.8\% and 22.0\% \rightarrow 86.0\%) and modification
rates (19.6\% \rightarrow 23.8\% and 12.0\% \rightarrow 42.0\%), while avoiding
policy degradation caused by reward misalignment. Our findings highlight the
importance of balanced reward accumulation in long-horizon RL and provide a
practical solution.

TL;DR: This paper introduces CATE-B, an open-source system leveraging large language models to assist in estimating treatment effects from observational data by guiding users through causal inference processes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the complexity and expertise requirements of estimating treatment effects using observational data, which limit the adoption of advanced causal inference techniques.

Method: CATE-B employs large language models within an agentic framework to assist in building causal models, identifying adjustment sets using a novel criterion, and selecting suitable regression methods based on the data and causal structure.

Result: The paper presents CATE-B as a tool that simplifies treatment effect estimation and provides a benchmarking suite for diverse scenarios and causal complexities.

Conclusion: By integrating causal inference and interactive AI assistance, CATE-B reduces the barriers to performing rigorous causal analysis and establishes a basis for future automated treatment effect estimation benchmarks.

Abstract: Estimating treatment effects (TE) from observational data is a critical yet
complex task in many fields, from healthcare and economics to public policy.
While recent advances in machine learning and causal inference have produced
powerful estimation techniques, their adoption remains limited due to the need
for deep expertise in causal assumptions, adjustment strategies, and model
selection. In this paper, we introduce CATE-B, an open-source co-pilot system
that uses large language models (LLMs) within an agentic framework to guide
users through the end-to-end process of treatment effect estimation. CATE-B
assists in (i) constructing a structural causal model via causal discovery and
LLM-based edge orientation, (ii) identifying robust adjustment sets through a
novel Minimal Uncertainty Adjustment Set criterion, and (iii) selecting
appropriate regression methods tailored to the causal structure and dataset
characteristics. To encourage reproducibility and evaluation, we release a
suite of benchmark tasks spanning diverse domains and causal complexities. By
combining causal inference with intelligent, interactive assistance, CATE-B
lowers the barrier to rigorous causal analysis and lays the foundation for a
new class of benchmarks in automated treatment effect estimation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents unified learning (uGNN), a method to improve model generalizability across heterogeneous medical imaging models under domain-fracture scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the challenge of training heterogeneous models that are locally adapted to specific datasets (e.g., hospitals) while enhancing their generalizability across varying distributions and architectures.

Method: The authors propose a unified learning paradigm, where models (MLPs, CNNs, GNNs) are encoded as graph representations and optimized through a unified GNN (uGNN). This facilitates parameter sharing and knowledge transfer across diverse datasets and architectures.

Result: Unified learning demonstrated improved performance and robustness to unseen data with significant distribution shifts on MorphoMNIST and MedMNIST benchmarks (PneumoniaMNIST and BreastMNIST).

Conclusion: Unified learning offers a promising solution for addressing generalization challenges in medical imaging, showcasing strong robustness across diverse models and distributions.

Abstract: Deep learning models often struggle to maintain generalizability in medical
imaging, particularly under domain-fracture scenarios where distribution shifts
arise from varying imaging techniques, acquisition protocols, patient
populations, demographics, and equipment. In practice, each hospital may need
to train distinct models - differing in learning task, width, and depth - to
match local data. For example, one hospital may use Euclidean architectures
such as MLPs and CNNs for tabular or grid-like image data, while another may
require non-Euclidean architectures such as graph neural networks (GNNs) for
irregular data like brain connectomes. How to train such heterogeneous models
coherently across datasets, while enhancing each model's generalizability,
remains an open problem. We propose unified learning, a new paradigm that
encodes each model into a graph representation, enabling unification in a
shared graph learning space. A GNN then guides optimization of these unified
models. By decoupling parameters of individual models and controlling them
through a unified GNN (uGNN), our method supports parameter sharing and
knowledge transfer across varying architectures (MLPs, CNNs, GNNs) and
distributions, improving generalizability. Evaluations on MorphoMNIST and two
MedMNIST benchmarks - PneumoniaMNIST and BreastMNIST - show that unified
learning boosts performance when models are trained on unique distributions and
tested on mixed ones, demonstrating strong robustness to unseen data with large
distribution shifts. Code and benchmarks: https://github.com/basiralab/uGNN

*Xuanhao Mu,Gökhan Demirel,Yuzhe Zhang,Jianlei Liu,Thorsten Schlachter,Veit Hagenmeyer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents a new upsampling method using Generative Adversarial Transformers (GATs) for energy system time series, reducing RMSE by 9% and improving application accuracy by 13%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional upsampling methods for energy network design are computationally efficient but lead to information loss, noise, or accuracy degradation. Advanced generative models face fundamental limitations in training due to the need for high-resolution data, which is unavailable in practical scenarios.

Method: The paper introduces an upsampling method employing Generative Adversarial Transformers (GATs) that do not require ground-truth high-resolution data for training. This distinguishes it from existing supervised paradigms.

Result: The proposed GAT-based method reduces the root mean square error (RMSE) by 9% in upsampling tasks and improves model predictive control (MPC) accuracy by 13% compared to baseline interpolation methods.

Conclusion: The method demonstrates a significant improvement in upsampling accuracy and practical application performance, providing a promising solution to the challenges in energy system modeling.

Abstract: To bridge the temporal granularity gap in energy network design and operation
based on Energy System Models, resampling of time series is required. While
conventional upsampling methods are computationally efficient, they often
result in significant information loss or increased noise. Advanced models such
as time series generation models, Super-Resolution models and imputation models
show potential, but also face fundamental challenges. The goal of time series
generative models is to learn the distribution of the original data to generate
high-resolution series with similar statistical characteristics. This is not
entirely consistent with the definition of upsampling. Time series
Super-Resolution models or imputation models can degrade the accuracy of
upsampling because the input low-resolution time series are sparse and may have
insufficient context. Moreover, such models usually rely on supervised learning
paradigms. This presents a fundamental application paradox: their training
requires the high-resolution time series that is intrinsically absent in
upsampling application scenarios. To address the mentioned upsampling issue,
this paper introduces a new method utilizing Generative Adversarial
Transformers (GATs), which can be trained without access to any ground-truth
high-resolution data. Compared with conventional interpolation methods, the
introduced method can reduce the root mean square error (RMSE) of upsampling
tasks by 9%, and the accuracy of a model predictive control (MPC) application
scenario is improved by 13%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High deployment costs and scalability issues in existing deep learning-based Graph Anomaly Detection methods.

Method: Utilizes an affinity-gated residual encoder, pseudo-normal and anomalous anchor nodes, and calculates anomaly scores via statistical deviations.

Result: FreeGAD outperformed benchmark methods, showing superior efficiency, accuracy, and scalability across diverse datasets.

Conclusion: The training phase in deep GAD approaches is less impactful than perceived, and FreeGAD offers an effective, training-free alternative for GAD tasks.

Abstract: Graph Anomaly Detection (GAD) aims to identify nodes that deviate from the
majority within a graph, playing a crucial role in applications such as social
networks and e-commerce. Despite the current advancements in deep
learning-based GAD, existing approaches often suffer from high deployment costs
and poor scalability due to their complex and resource-intensive training
processes. Surprisingly, our empirical findings suggest that the training phase
of deep GAD methods, commonly perceived as crucial, may actually contribute
less to anomaly detection performance than expected. Inspired by this, we
propose FreeGAD, a novel training-free yet effective GAD method. Specifically,
it leverages an affinity-gated residual encoder to generate anomaly-aware
representations. Meanwhile, FreeGAD identifies anchor nodes as pseudo-normal
and anomalous guides, followed by calculating anomaly scores through
anchor-guided statistical deviations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
FreeGAD achieves superior anomaly detection performance, efficiency, and
scalability on multiple benchmark datasets from diverse domains, without any
training or iterative optimization.

Motivation: To improve confidence in the results of deep networks by formalizing and addressing reliability issues in existing explanation methods.

Method: The study uses probabilistic and spectral analysis to identify biases and proposes two remedies: a standard perturbation scale mechanism and the SpectralLens aggregation method.

Result: Theoretical findings on spectral biases and inconsistent explanations are validated with quantitative evaluations.

Conclusion: The paper offers theoretical insights and practical tools to enhance the reliability and consistency of explanation methods for deep networks.

Abstract: Understanding the behavior of deep networks is crucial to increase our
confidence in their results. Despite an extensive body of work for explaining
their predictions, researchers have faced reliability issues, which can be
attributed to insufficient formalism. In our research, we adopt novel
probabilistic and spectral perspectives to formally analyze explanation
methods. Our study reveals a pervasive spectral bias stemming from the use of
gradient, and sheds light on some common design choices that have been
discovered experimentally, in particular, the use of squared gradient and input
perturbation. We further characterize how the choice of perturbation
hyperparameters in explanation methods, such as SmoothGrad, can lead to
inconsistent explanations and introduce two remedies based on our proposed
formalism: (i) a mechanism to determine a standard perturbation scale, and (ii)
an aggregation method which we call SpectralLens. Finally, we substantiate our
theoretical results through quantitative evaluations.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper enhances Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning (MORL) by improving sample efficiency in policy gradients through variance-reduction techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MORL extends traditional RL to optimize multiple conflicting objectives simultaneously, addressing trade-offs in complex decision-making tasks.

Method: The study implements variance-reduction techniques to improve sample efficiency while maintaining general assumptions in policy gradient methods for MORL.

Result: The proposed approach reduces the sample complexity of policy gradients, overcoming inefficiencies in existing MORL methods.

Conclusion: Variance-reduced policy gradients offer a scalable and sample-efficient solution to MORL challenges, improving feasibility for large state-action spaces.

Abstract: Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning (MORL) is a generalization of
traditional Reinforcement Learning (RL) that aims to optimize multiple, often
conflicting objectives simultaneously rather than focusing on a single reward.
This approach is crucial in complex decision-making scenarios where agents must
balance trade-offs between various goals, such as maximizing performance while
minimizing costs. We consider the problem of MORL where the objectives are
combined using a non-linear scalarization function. Just like in standard RL,
policy gradient methods (PGMs) are amongst the most effective for handling
large and continuous state-action spaces in MORL. However, existing PGMs for
MORL suffer from high sample inefficiency, requiring large amounts of data to
be effective. Previous attempts to solve this problem rely on overly strict
assumptions, losing PGMs' benefits in scalability to large state-action spaces.
In this work, we address the issue of sample efficiency by implementing
variance-reduction techniques to reduce the sample complexity of policy
gradients while maintaining general assumptions.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper uses Item Response Theory (IRT) to enhance dataset partitioning during ML model validation, demonstrating improved understanding of bias-variance tradeoff and performance issues caused by specific subsets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing validation techniques for ML models often neglect the internal quality and heterogeneity of dataset instances, leading to suboptimal analysis and insights into model performance.

Method: The study applies IRT parameters to characterize instances in datasets, guiding partitioning strategies during validation. It evaluates the impact of these strategies using multiple ML models and datasets.

Result: IRT-based partitioning uncovered informative subgroups within datasets, improved bias-variance understanding, and revealed that high-guessing instances significantly degrade ML model performance.

Conclusion: IRT-informed validation partitions offer an effective way to dissect datasets, optimize ML model analysis, and mitigate issues caused by certain types of data instances.

Abstract: Robust validation of Machine Learning (ML) models is essential, but
traditional data partitioning approaches often ignore the intrinsic quality of
each instance. This study proposes the use of Item Response Theory (IRT)
parameters to characterize and guide the partitioning of datasets in the model
validation stage. The impact of IRT-informed partitioning strategies on the
performance of several ML models in four tabular datasets was evaluated. The
results obtained demonstrate that IRT reveals an inherent heterogeneity of the
instances and highlights the existence of informative subgroups of instances
within the same dataset. Based on IRT, balanced partitions were created that
consistently help to better understand the tradeoff between bias and variance
of the models. In addition, the guessing parameter proved to be a determining
factor: training with high-guessing instances can significantly impair model
performance and resulted in cases with accuracy below 50%, while other
partitions reached more than 70% in the same dataset.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel energy-based model for predicting changes in binding free energy ($\Delta\Delta G$), achieving superior results for protein and antibody engineering compared to current state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the vital task of predicting binding free energy changes ($\Delta\Delta G$) for protein engineering and drug discovery, improving upon existing methods by incorporating physical principles and overcoming the intractability of protein complex conformational distributions.

Method: The method decomposes $\Delta\Delta G$ into a sequence-based component from an inverse folding model and a structure-based component from an energy model, leveraging an energy-based physical inductive bias grounded in statistical mechanics.

Result: The proposed approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art structure and sequence-based deep learning models in predicting $\Delta\Delta G$ and optimizing antibodies for SARS-CoV-2.

Conclusion: The new method provides a tractable and physically grounded framework for $\Delta\Delta G$ prediction, offering improved accuracy and utility in drug discovery and protein engineering applications.

Abstract: Predicting changes in binding free energy ($\Delta\Delta G$) is a vital task
in protein engineering and protein-protein interaction (PPI) engineering for
drug discovery. Previous works have observed a high correlation between
$\Delta\Delta G$ and entropy, using probabilities of biologically important
objects such as side chain angles and residue identities to estimate
$\Delta\Delta G$. However, estimating the full conformational distribution of a
protein complex is generally considered intractable. In this work, we propose a
new approach to $\Delta\Delta G$ prediction that avoids this issue by instead
leveraging energy-based models for estimating the probability of a complex's
conformation. Specifically, we novelly decompose $\Delta\Delta G$ into a
sequence-based component estimated by an inverse folding model and a
structure-based component estimated by an energy model. This decomposition is
made tractable by assuming equilibrium between the bound and unbound states,
allowing us to simplify the estimation of degeneracies associated with each
state. Unlike previous deep learning-based methods, our method incorporates an
energy-based physical inductive bias by connecting the often-used sequence
log-odds ratio-based approach to $\Delta\Delta G$ prediction with a new
$\Delta\Delta E$ term grounded in statistical mechanics. We demonstrate
superiority over existing state-of-the-art structure and sequence-based deep
learning methods in $\Delta\Delta G$ prediction and antibody optimization
against SARS-CoV-2.

*Yihua Wang,Qi Jia,Cong Xu,Feiyu Chen,Yuhan Liu,Haotian Zhang,Liang Jin,Lu Liu,Zhichun Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Multimodal Conditional Information Bottleneck (MCIB) model to improve sarcasm detection by addressing issues with shortcut learning and ineffective modality fusion in existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to overcome the reliance on shortcut learning and ineffective fusion in multimodal sarcasm detection, which undermine the generalization ability of existing models in real-world scenarios.

Method: They constructed a refined version of the MUStARD++ dataset by removing shortcuts and proposed the MCIB model to achieve effective multimodal fusion.

Result: The MCIB model outperformed other methods in sarcasm detection performance, demonstrating improved generalization and avoiding shortcut learning.

Conclusion: Effective modality fusion and avoidance of shortcut learning are critical for improving multimodal sarcasm detection, as evidenced by the proposed MCIB model's success.

Abstract: Multimodal sarcasm detection is a complex task that requires distinguishing
subtle complementary signals across modalities while filtering out irrelevant
information. Many advanced methods rely on learning shortcuts from datasets
rather than extracting intended sarcasm-related features. However, our
experiments show that shortcut learning impairs the model's generalization in
real-world scenarios. Furthermore, we reveal the weaknesses of current modality
fusion strategies for multimodal sarcasm detection through systematic
experiments, highlighting the necessity of focusing on effective modality
fusion for complex emotion recognition. To address these challenges, we
construct MUStARD++$^{R}$ by removing shortcut signals from MUStARD++. Then, a
Multimodal Conditional Information Bottleneck (MCIB) model is introduced to
enable efficient multimodal fusion for sarcasm detection. Experimental results
show that the MCIB achieves the best performance without relying on shortcut
learning.

### [285] [SPHENIC: Topology-Informed Multi-View Clustering for Spatial Transcriptomics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10646)
*Chenkai Guo,Yikai Zhu,Jing Yangum,Renxiang Guan,Por Lip Yee,Guangdun Peng,Dayu Hu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes SPHENIC, an improved method for spatial-transcriptomics clustering, overcoming limitations in topological learning and spatial quality modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for spatial-transcriptomics clustering struggle with noisy topological signals and inadequate spatial neighborhood modeling.

Method: SPHENIC incorporates topological features into clustering networks and introduces a Spatial Constraint and Distribution Optimization Module (SCDOM) for better spatial embeddings.

Result: SPHENIC demonstrated superior clustering performance on 14 benchmark datasets, improving accuracy by 3.31%-6.54% compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: SPHENIC effectively addresses key limitations in spatial-transcriptomics clustering, enhancing both representation stability and spatial embedding quality.

Abstract: By incorporating spatial location information, spatial-transcriptomics
clustering yields more comprehensive insights into cell subpopulation
identification. Despite recent progress, existing methods have at least two
limitations: (i) topological learning typically considers only representations
of individual cells or their interaction graphs; however, spatial
transcriptomic profiles are often noisy, making these approaches vulnerable to
low-quality topological signals, and (ii) insufficient modeling of spatial
neighborhood information leads to low-quality spatial embeddings. To address
these limitations, we propose SPHENIC, a novel Spatial Persistent Homology
Enhanced Neighborhood Integrative Clustering method. Specifically, SPHENIC
incorporates invariant topological features into the clustering network to
achieve stable representation learning. Additionally, to construct high-quality
spatial embeddings that reflect the true cellular distribution, we design the
Spatial Constraint and Distribution Optimization Module (SCDOM). This module
increases the similarity between a cell's embedding and those of its spatial
neighbors, decreases similarity with non-neighboring cells, and thereby
produces clustering-friendly spatial embeddings. Extensive experiments on 14
benchmark spatial transcriptomic slices demonstrate that SPHENIC achieves
superior performance on the spatial clustering task, outperforming existing
state-of-the-art methods by 3.31%-6.54% over the best alternative.

### [286] [Geospatial Diffusion for Land Cover Imperviousness Change Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10649)
*Debvrat Varshney,Vibhas Vats,Bhartendu Pandey,Christa Brelsford,Philipe Dias*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes using generative AI models to improve land-use and land-cover forecasting, demonstrating its feasibility with experiments on impervious surface changes in the U.S.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the lagging ability to forecast land-use and land-cover changes, which are critical for assessing risks and impacts in Earth system processes like hydrology and flood risk.

Method: The authors propose a paradigm using generative AI by framing LULC forecasting as a data synthesis problem and train a diffusion model on historical data for decadal forecasting of imperviousness across the U.S.

Result: The generative model demonstrated better accuracy than a baseline (no change assumption) in forecasting imperviousness over 12 metropolitan areas at resolutions of ≥0.7×0.7 km², achieving lower mean absolute error.

Conclusion: The study concludes that generative models can effectively capture spatiotemporal patterns for forecasting land-use changes and suggests future work in including auxiliary physical data and simulating scenario-based forecasts.

Abstract: Land cover, both present and future, has a significant effect on several
important Earth system processes. For example, impervious surfaces heat up and
speed up surface water runoff and reduce groundwater infiltration, with
concomitant effects on regional hydrology and flood risk. While regional Earth
System models have increasing skill at forecasting hydrologic and atmospheric
processes at high resolution in future climate scenarios, our ability to
forecast land-use and land-cover change (LULC), a critical input to risk and
consequences assessment for these scenarios, has lagged behind. In this paper,
we propose a new paradigm exploiting Generative AI (GenAI) for land cover
change forecasting by framing LULC forecasting as a data synthesis problem
conditioned on historical and auxiliary data-sources. We discuss desirable
properties of generative models that fundament our research premise, and
demonstrate the feasibility of our methodology through experiments on
imperviousness forecasting using historical data covering the entire
conterminous United States. Specifically, we train a diffusion model for
decadal forecasting of imperviousness and compare its performance to a baseline
that assumes no change at all. Evaluation across 12 metropolitan areas for a
year held-out during training indicate that for average resolutions $\geq
0.7\times0.7km^2$ our model yields MAE lower than such a baseline. This finding
corroborates that such a generative model can capture spatiotemporal patterns
from historical data that are significant for projecting future change.
Finally, we discuss future research to incorporate auxiliary information on
physical properties about the Earth, as well as supporting simulation of
different scenarios by means of driver variables.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to classify graphs by converting them into tabular data using Weisfeiler-Leman algorithm variants and applying tabular data techniques. It achieves competitive accuracy while being efficient.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Graph classification faces challenges in balancing accuracy and resource efficiency. A new approach integrating logical frameworks aims to refine methods.

Method: The method involves tabularizing graph data with modified Weisfeiler-Leman algorithm variants and applying tabular data classification models. The expressive power of these variants is theoretically characterized.

Result: Experiments on twelve benchmark datasets show that the approach achieves state-of-the-art accuracy comparable to existing models while being more efficient in terms of time or memory usage.

Conclusion: The proposed method provides a viable, interpretable, and resource-efficient alternative for graph classification, rivaling advanced neural networks and kernels.

Abstract: We present a novel approach for graph classification based on tabularizing
graph data via variants of the Weisfeiler-Leman algorithm and then applying
methods for tabular data. We investigate a comprehensive class of
Weisfeiler-Leman variants obtained by modifying the underlying logical
framework and establish a precise theoretical characterization of their
expressive power. We then test two selected variants on twelve benchmark
datasets that span a range of different domains. The experiments demonstrate
that our approach matches the accuracy of state-of-the-art graph neural
networks and graph kernels while being more time or memory efficient, depending
on the dataset. We also briefly discuss directly extracting interpretable modal
logic formulas from graph datasets.

### [288] [REFN: A Reinforcement-Learning-From-Network Framework against 1-day/n-day Exploitations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10701)
*Tianlong Yu,Lihong Liu,Ziyi Zhou,Fudu Xing,Kailong Wang,Yang Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: REFN is a novel framework using Reinforcement Learning and Large Language Models to enable scalable, efficient, and accurate autonomous defense against network vulnerabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this paper is the growing threat posed by 1 day or n day vulnerabilities due to delayed patching (average MTTP: 60+ days) and the inadequacies of existing defenses like manual patching and error-prone deployment processes.

Method: REFN employs Reinforcement Learning, rather than Human Feedback, to train Large Language Models for generating network filters. It introduces mechanisms like Knowledge Distillation, translating vulnerability context into network actions, and online validation against undesired outputs.

Result: REFN achieved a 21.1% higher accuracy compared to alternatives, reduced patching time to 3.65 hours, and demonstrated scalability to 10,000 devices.

Conclusion: REFN is an effective and scalable solution to address large-scale vulnerability exploitation, marking an important step in training LLMs for autonomous exploit prevention.

Abstract: The exploitation of 1 day or n day vulnerabilities poses severe threats to
networked devices due to massive deployment scales and delayed patching
(average Mean Time To Patch exceeds 60 days). Existing defenses, including host
based patching and network based filtering, are inadequate due to limited
scalability across diverse devices, compatibility issues especially with
embedded or legacy systems, and error prone deployment process (manual patch
validation). To address these issues, we introduce REFN (Reinforcement Learning
From Network), a novel framework that trains Large Language Models (LLMs) to
autonomously generate network filters to prevent 1 day or n day exploitations.
REFN ensures scalability by uniquely employs Reinforcement Learning (RL) driven
by online network rewards instead of traditional Human Feedback (RLHF). REFN
guarantees compatibility via unified deployment on edge security gateways
(Amazon Eero). REFN provides robustness via online validation using real
network traffic. Crucially, REFN addresses three core challenges in training
LLMs for exploit prevention: 1) expanding current LLMs limited vulnerability
fixing expertise via Agentic RAG based Knowledge Distillation, 2) bridging
current LLMs language to network gaps through an RL From VNF Pipeline that
translates language context (vulnerability description) into network
enforcement, 3) addressing the LLM hallucination and non determinism via the
Online Agentic Validation that penalizes erroneous outputs. Evaluated across 22
families of 1 day or n day exploits, REFN demonstrates effectiveness (21.1
percent higher accuracy than alternatives), efficiency (Mean Time To Patch of
3.65 hours) and scalability (easily scale to 10K devices). REFN serves as an
initial step toward training LLMs to rapidly prevent massive scale 1 day or n
day exploitations.

### [289] [Electromagnetic Simulations of Antennas on GPUs for Machine Learning Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10713)
*Murat Temiz,Vemund Bakken*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study develops a GPU-based antenna simulation framework integrated with open-source EM software to generate large data sets for machine learning applications in antenna design and optimization. The framework is fast, cost-effective, and compatible with commercial software results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of data scarcity for machine learning algorithms in antenna design by creating a faster and efficient GPU-based simulation framework.

Method: Utilize GPUs to produce large datasets of antenna simulations with predefined/random parameters, leveraging open-source EM software for scalability and performance comparison with commercial software.

Result: Entry-level GPUs outperform high-end CPUs significantly, and high-end GPUs achieve 18x computational performance over high-end CPUs. Open-source EM software provides results comparable to commercial tools with sufficient spatial resolution.

Conclusion: The GPU-based simulation framework is effective for generating antenna datasets, providing high computational performance and matching commercial software accuracy, thereby facilitating machine learning advancements in antenna design.

Abstract: This study proposes an antenna simulation framework powered by graphics
processing units (GPUs) based on an open-source electromagnetic (EM) simulation
software (gprMax) for machine learning applications of antenna design and
optimization. Furthermore, it compares the simulation results with those
obtained through commercial EM software. The proposed software framework for
machine learning and surrogate model applications will produce antenna data
sets consisting of a large number of antenna simulation results using GPUs.
Although machine learning methods can attain the optimum solutions for many
problems, they are known to be data-hungry and require a great deal of samples
for the training stage of the algorithms. However, producing a sufficient
number of training samples in EM applications within a limited time is
challenging due to the high computational complexity of EM simulations.
Therefore, GPUs are utilized in this study to simulate a large number of
antennas with predefined or random antenna shape parameters to produce data
sets. Moreover, this study also compares various machine learning and deep
learning models in terms of antenna parameter estimation performance. This
study demonstrates that an entry-level GPU substantially outperforms a high-end
CPU in terms of computational performance, while a high-end gaming GPU can
achieve around 18 times more computational performance compared to a high-end
CPU. Moreover, it is shown that the open-source EM simulation software can
deliver similar results to those obtained via commercial software in the
simulation of microstrip antennas when the spatial resolution of the
simulations is sufficiently fine.

*Kejia Fan,Jianheng Tang,Zhirui Yang,Feijiang Han,Jiaxu Li,Run He,Yajiang Huang,Anfeng Liu,Houbing Herbert Song,Yunhuai Liu,Huiping Zhuang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Analytic Personalized Federated Learning (APFL) to improve personalized model training on non-IID data, using a foundation model and dual-stream approach for generalization and personalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to tackle the challenges posed by non-IID data in Personalized Federated Learning, which hinders model generalization and personalization.

Method: APFL utilizes a frozen foundation model for feature extraction and two analytic streams—a shared primary stream for global generalization and a refinement stream for local personalization.

Result: Empirical evaluation demonstrates APFL's accuracy superiority compared to state-of-the-art methods, with gains ranging from 1.10% to 15.45%.

Conclusion: APFL effectively addresses non-IID issues, ensuring models are invariant to data heterogeneity while simultaneously achieving collective generalization and individual personalization.

Abstract: Personalized Federated Learning (PFL) has presented a significant challenge
to deliver personalized models to individual clients through collaborative
training. Existing PFL methods are often vulnerable to non-IID data, which
severely hinders collective generalization and then compromises the subsequent
personalization efforts. In this paper, to address this non-IID issue in PFL,
we propose an Analytic Personalized Federated Learning (APFL) approach via
dual-stream least squares. In our APFL, we use a foundation model as a frozen
backbone for feature extraction. Subsequent to the feature extractor, we
develop dual-stream analytic models to achieve both collective generalization
and individual personalization. Specifically, our APFL incorporates a shared
primary stream for global generalization across all clients, and a dedicated
refinement stream for local personalization of each individual client. The
analytical solutions of our APFL enable its ideal property of heterogeneity
invariance, theoretically meaning that each personalized model remains
identical regardless of how heterogeneous the data are distributed across all
other clients. Empirical results across various datasets also validate the
superiority of our APFL over state-of-the-art baselines, with advantages of at
least 1.10%-15.45% in accuracy.

*Zhipeng Chen,Xiaobo Qin,Youbin Wu,Yue Ling,Qinghao Ye,Wayne Xin Zhao,Guang Shi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper examines how using Pass@k as a reward in reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) can enhance policies' exploration ability and alleviate conservative decision-making, revealing a connection between exploration and exploitation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge in RLVR where using Pass@1 often leads to conservative policies and local optima, emphasizing the importance of identifying a better reward metric for balancing exploration and exploitation.

Method: The authors train a policy model using Pass@k as the reward and derive an analytical solution to understand its advantages. This approach involves refining the advantage function to better integrate exploration and exploitation objectives.

Result: Pass@k-based training proves effective in improving exploration and shows that exploration and exploitation are not inherently conflicting. Analytical derivation enables an optimized balance and provides insights for further advancements.

Conclusion: This study demonstrates the potential of Pass@k in RLVR to enhance both exploration and exploitation, suggesting that advantage design offers a promising research direction for overcoming RLVR limitations.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR), which typically adopts
Pass@1 as the reward, has faced the issues in balancing exploration and
exploitation, causing policies to prefer conservative actions, converging to a
local optimum. Identifying an appropriate reward metric is therefore crucial.
Regarding the prior work, although Pass@k has been used in evaluation, its
connection to LLM exploration ability in RLVR remains largely overlooked. To
investigate this, we first use Pass@k as the reward to train the policy model
(i.e., $\textbf{Pass@k Training}$), and observe the improvement on its
exploration ability. Next, we derive an analytical solution for the advantage
of Pass@k Training, leading to an efficient and effective process. Building on
this, our analysis reveals that exploration and exploitation are not inherently
conflicting objectives, while they can mutually enhance each other. Moreover,
Pass@k Training with analytical derivation essentially involves directly
designing the advantage function. Inspired by this, we preliminarily explore
the advantage design for RLVR, showing promising results and highlighting a
potential future direction.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the quadratic scaling issue in the attention mechanism of transformers and apply them effectively on datasets involving large physical systems.

Method: The authors adapt the Native Sparse Attention mechanism for non-sequential data, implement the Erwin NSA model, and validate it on datasets in three different physical science domains.

Result: The Erwin NSA model achieves performance that matches or exceeds the original Erwin model and successfully reproduces results from the Erwin paper for further validation.

Conclusion: The proposed Erwin NSA model demonstrates an efficient and scalable approach for improving transformer-based models on large-scale physical system datasets.

Abstract: Unlocking the potential of transformers on datasets of large physical systems
depends on overcoming the quadratic scaling of the attention mechanism. This
work explores combining the Erwin architecture with the Native Sparse Attention
(NSA) mechanism to improve the efficiency and receptive field of transformer
models for large-scale physical systems, addressing the challenge of quadratic
attention complexity. We adapt the NSA mechanism for non-sequential data,
implement the Erwin NSA model, and evaluate it on three datasets from the
physical sciences -- cosmology simulations, molecular dynamics, and air
pressure modeling -- achieving performance that matches or exceeds that of the
original Erwin model. Additionally, we reproduce the experimental results from
the Erwin paper to validate their implementation.

*Dong Xu,Zhangfan Yang,Jenna Xinyi Yao,Shuangbao Song,Zexuan Zhu,Junkai Ji*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces IBEX, a pipeline for structure-based drug discovery that tackles data scarcity issues in protein-ligand complexes using information bottleneck theory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation lies in addressing the limitations of existing generative models for protein-ligand complexes, which overfit due to the scarcity of training data and struggle to generalize.

Method: IBEX uses PAC-Bayesian information-bottleneck theory to evaluate sample information density, employs Scaffold Hopping for better generalization, and combines TargetDiff architecture with physics-based molecule refinement techniques.

Result: IBEX raised docking success rates, improved binding scores, increased QED by 25%, and achieved state-of-the-art validity and diversity with reduced extrapolation error.

Conclusion: IBEX demonstrates improved generalization and effectiveness in protein-ligand complex generation, showcasing a promising advancement in data-scarce drug discovery scenarios.

Abstract: Three-dimensional generative models increasingly drive structure-based drug
discovery, yet it remains constrained by the scarce publicly available
protein-ligand complexes. Under such data scarcity, almost all existing
pipelines struggle to learn transferable geometric priors and consequently
overfit to training-set biases. As such, we present IBEX, an
Information-Bottleneck-EXplored coarse-to-fine pipeline to tackle the chronic
shortage of protein-ligand complex data in structure-based drug design.
Specifically, we use PAC-Bayesian information-bottleneck theory to quantify the
information density of each sample. This analysis reveals how different masking
strategies affect generalization and indicates that, compared with conventional
de novo generation, the constrained Scaffold Hopping task endows the model with
greater effective capacity and improved transfer performance. IBEX retains the
original TargetDiff architecture and hyperparameters for training to generate
molecules compatible with the binding pocket; it then applies an L-BFGS
optimization step to finely refine each conformation by optimizing five
physics-based terms and adjusting six translational and rotational degrees of
freedom in under one second. With only these modifications, IBEX raises the
zero-shot docking success rate on CBGBench CrossDocked2020-based from 53% to
64%, improves the mean Vina score from $-7.41 kcal mol^{-1}$ to $-8.07 kcal
mol^{-1}$, and achieves the best median Vina energy in 57 of 100 pockets versus
3 for the original TargetDiff. IBEX also increases the QED by 25%, achieves
state-of-the-art validity and diversity, and markedly reduces extrapolation
error.

*Yu-Heng Hung,Ping-Chun Hsieh,Kai Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of non-stationary dynamics in online restless multi-armed bandits (RMABs) and proposes an algorithm combining sliding window reinforcement learning with UCB to effectively learn transition dynamics and manage variations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional RMAB algorithms struggle with real-world applications due to their assumption of stationary Markov Decision Processes, which often does not hold in dynamic settings like healthcare or recommendation systems.

Method: The authors developed an algorithm that combines sliding window reinforcement learning with an upper confidence bound (UCB) mechanism to adapt to non-stationary transition dynamics, constrained by bounded variation budgets.

Result: They establish a regret bound of $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(N^2 B^{\frac{1}{4}} T^{\frac{3}{4}})$ for their proposed algorithm under a relaxed definition of regret.

Conclusion: This work provides the first foundational theoretical framework for addressing the non-stationary RMAB problem.

Abstract: Online restless multi-armed bandits (RMABs) typically assume that each arm
follows a stationary Markov Decision Process (MDP) with fixed state transitions
and rewards. However, in real-world applications like healthcare and
recommendation systems, these assumptions often break due to non-stationary
dynamics, posing significant challenges for traditional RMAB algorithms. In
this work, we specifically consider $N$-armd RMAB with non-stationary
transition constrained by bounded variation budgets $B$. Our proposed \rmab\;
algorithm integrates sliding window reinforcement learning (RL) with an upper
confidence bound (UCB) mechanism to simultaneously learn transition dynamics
and their variations. We further establish that \rmab\; achieves
$\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(N^2 B^{\frac{1}{4}} T^{\frac{3}{4}})$ regret bound by
leveraging a relaxed definition of regret, providing a foundational theoretical
framework for non-stationary RMAB problems for the first time.

TL;DR: The paper reviews the integration of neuroscience principles with Memory-Augmented Transformers for improved long-context memory, continual learning, and knowledge retention, and suggests future directions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformers, while successful in sequence modeling, struggle with long-range memory retention, continual learning, and integrating knowledge effectively. This paper aims to enhance these capabilities.

Method: The authors provide a unified framework based on neuroscience principles (e.g., multi-timescale memory, selective attention) and taxonomically analyze Memory-Augmented Transformers by objectives, representations, and integration mechanisms.

Result: Key insights include shifts from static to adaptive memory systems, highlighting persistent challenges like scalability and interference, and introducing hierarchical buffering and surprise-based updates as solutions.

Conclusion: The synthesis points to designing cognitively-inspired lifelong-learning Transformer architectures as the way forward for overcoming existing limitations.

Abstract: Memory is fundamental to intelligence, enabling learning, reasoning, and
adaptability across biological and artificial systems. While Transformer
architectures excel at sequence modeling, they face critical limitations in
long-range context retention, continual learning, and knowledge integration.
This review presents a unified framework bridging neuroscience principles,
including dynamic multi-timescale memory, selective attention, and
consolidation, with engineering advances in Memory-Augmented Transformers. We
organize recent progress through three taxonomic dimensions: functional
objectives (context extension, reasoning, knowledge integration, adaptation),
memory representations (parameter-encoded, state-based, explicit, hybrid), and
integration mechanisms (attention fusion, gated control, associative
retrieval). Our analysis of core memory operations (reading, writing,
forgetting, and capacity management) reveals a shift from static caches toward
adaptive, test-time learning systems. We identify persistent challenges in
scalability and interference, alongside emerging solutions including
hierarchical buffering and surprise-gated updates. This synthesis provides a
roadmap toward cognitively-inspired, lifelong-learning Transformer
architectures.

*Robin Staab,Nikola Jovanović,Kimberly Mai,Prakhar Ganesh,Martin Vechev,Ferdinando Fioretto,Matthew Jagielski*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework for Data Minimization in Machine Learning (DMML) to address gaps in understanding and implementation of data minimization principles in AI/ML.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the disconnect in understanding and implementing data minimization principles across various ML privacy and security topics.

Method: The authors introduce a comprehensive framework for DMML, including elements like a unified data pipeline, adversaries, and points of minimization, systematically reviewing the literature on data minimization and adjacent topics.

Result: The paper presents a structured overview with the goal of aiding practitioners and researchers in applying DM principles effectively.

Conclusion: The framework fosters better understanding and wider adoption of data minimization strategies in AI/ML applications.

Abstract: Data minimization (DM) describes the principle of collecting only the data
strictly necessary for a given task. It is a foundational principle across
major data protection regulations like GDPR and CPRA. Violations of this
principle have substantial real-world consequences, with regulatory actions
resulting in fines reaching hundreds of millions of dollars. Notably, the
relevance of data minimization is particularly pronounced in machine learning
(ML) applications, which typically rely on large datasets, resulting in an
emerging research area known as Data Minimization in Machine Learning (DMML).
At the same time, existing work on other ML privacy and security topics often
addresses concerns relevant to DMML without explicitly acknowledging the
connection. This disconnect leads to confusion among practitioners,
complicating their efforts to implement DM principles and interpret the
terminology, metrics, and evaluation criteria used across different research
communities. To address this gap, our work introduces a comprehensive framework
for DMML, including a unified data pipeline, adversaries, and points of
minimization. This framework allows us to systematically review the literature
on data minimization and \emph{DM-adjacent} methodologies, for the first time
presenting a structured overview designed to help practitioners and researchers
effectively apply DM principles. Our work facilitates a unified DM-centric
understanding and broader adoption of data minimization strategies in AI/ML.

*Ari Karchmer,Seth Neel,Martin Pawelczyk*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a protocol enabling resource-constrained parties to verify data attributions provided by computationally powerful entities, ensuring trust through PAC guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the trust gap in data attribution methods, where resource-constrained parties cannot independently verify data attributions provided by computationally rich entities.

Method: The paper proposes an interactive proof protocol between Prover and Verifier, ensuring formal guarantees like PAC verification and computational efficiency.

Result: The protocol enables a Verifier to accept data attributions close to optimal with high probability, or detect deviations by the Prover with minimal computation overhead.

Conclusion: This work ensures trust and efficiency in data attribution verification, making it accessible for parties with limited computational resources.

Abstract: Data attribution methods aim to answer useful counterfactual questions like
"what would a ML model's prediction be if it were trained on a different
dataset?" However, estimation of data attribution models through techniques
like empirical influence or "datamodeling" remains very computationally
expensive. This causes a critical trust issue: if only a few computationally
rich parties can obtain data attributions, how can resource-constrained parties
trust that the provided attributions are indeed "good," especially when they
are used for important downstream applications (e.g., data pricing)? In this
paper, we address this trust issue by proposing an interactive verification
paradigm for data attribution. An untrusted and computationally powerful Prover
learns data attributions, and then engages in an interactive proof with a
resource-constrained Verifier. Our main result is a protocol that provides
formal completeness, soundness, and efficiency guarantees in the sense of
Probably-Approximately-Correct (PAC) verification. Specifically, if both Prover
and Verifier follow the protocol, the Verifier accepts data attributions that
are {\epsilon}-close to the optimal data attributions (in terms of the Mean
Squared Error) with probability 1-{\delta}. Conversely, if the Prover
arbitrarily deviates from the protocol, even with infinite compute, then this
is detected (or it still yields data attributions to the Verifier) except with
probability {\delta}. Importantly, our protocol ensures the Verifier's
workload, measured by the number of independent model retrainings it must
perform, scales only as O(1/{\epsilon}); i.e., independently of the dataset
size. At a technical level, our results apply to efficiently verifying any
linear function over the boolean hypercube computed by the Prover, making them
broadly applicable to various attribution tasks.

Result: Models pre-trained on \ourdataset demonstrate strong performance, outperforming larger-sized models in TDC tasks and producing safer molecule proposals in GuacaMol.

Conclusion: \ourdataset improves prior integration for therapeutic design and enhances molecular safety while maintaining effectiveness. The dataset is publicly available for broader research use.

Abstract: AI-driven discovery can greatly reduce design time and enhance new
therapeutics' effectiveness. Models using simulators explore broad design
spaces but risk violating implicit constraints due to a lack of experimental
priors. For example, in a new analysis we performed on a diverse set of models
on the GuacaMol benchmark using supervised classifiers, over 60\% of molecules
proposed had high probability of being mutagenic. In this work, we introduce
\ourdataset, a dataset of priors for design problems extracted from literature
describing compounds used in lab settings. It is constructed with LLM pipelines
for discovering therapeutic entities in relevant paragraphs and summarizing
information in concise fair-use facts. \ourdataset~ consists of 32.3 million
pairs of natural language facts, and appropriate entity representations (i.e.
SMILES or refseq IDs). To demonstrate the potential of the data, we train LLM,
CLIP, and LLava architectures to reason jointly about text and design targets
and evaluate on tasks from the Therapeutic Data Commons (TDC). \ourdataset~is
highly effective for creating models with strong priors: in supervised
prediction problems that use our data as pretraining, our best models with 15M
learnable parameters outperform larger 2B TxGemma on both regression and
classification TDC tasks, and perform comparably to 9B models on average.
Models built with \ourdataset~can be used as constraints while optimizing for
novel molecules in GuacaMol, resulting in proposals that are safer and nearly
as effective. We release our dataset at
\href{https://huggingface.co/datasets/medexanon/Medex}{huggingface.co/datasets/medexanon/Medex},
and will provide expanded versions as available literature grows.

### [299] [Empirical Investigation into Configuring Echo State Networks for Representative Benchmark Problem Domains](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10887)
*Brooke R. Weborg,Gursel Serpen*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: This paper analyzes Echo State Networks (ESNs), a type of reservoir computing, across four benchmarks and proposes heuristics for their configuration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of understanding and selecting appropriate parameters and architecture for Echo State Networks (ESNs) without requiring extensive prior experience.

Method: A series of experiments were conducted using benchmark tasks spanning different problem domains like time series prediction, pattern generation, chaotic system prediction, and time series classification to analyze the impact of architecture and parameter selections on ESN performance.

Result: The study identifies how variations in architecture, parameter selection, and values influence Echo State Network performance across diverse tasks.

Conclusion: The paper provides domain-specific configuration heuristics and highlights the importance of parameter and architectural choices for optimizing Echo State Network performance.

Abstract: This paper examines Echo State Network, a reservoir computer, performance
using four different benchmark problems, then proposes heuristics or rules of
thumb for configuring the architecture, as well as the selection of parameters
and their values, which are applicable to problems within the same domain, to
help serve to fill the experience gap needed by those entering this field of
study. The influence of various parameter selections and their value
adjustments, as well as architectural changes made to an Echo State Network, a
powerful recurrent neural network configured as a reservoir computer, can be
challenging to fully comprehend without experience in the field, and even some
hyperparameter optimization algorithms may have difficulty adjusting parameter
values without proper manual selections made first. Therefore, it is imperative
to understand the effects of parameters and their value selection on Echo State
Network architecture performance for a successful build. Thus, to address the
requirement for an extensive background in Echo State Network architecture, as
well as examine how Echo State Network performance is affected with respect to
variations in architecture, design, and parameter selection and values, a
series of benchmark tasks representing different problem domains, including
time series prediction, pattern generation, chaotic system prediction, and time
series classification, were modeled and experimented on to show the impact on
the performance of Echo State Network.

*Shweta Salaria,Zhuoran Liu,Nelson Mimura Gonzalez*

Main category: cs.PF

TL;DR: FMwork is introduced for optimizing benchmarking performance evaluations, improving speed and resource utilization in experiments of Foundation Models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the impracticality of evaluating all potential test configurations for Foundation Models due to the complexity and resource constraints.

Method: The FMwork framework integrates benchmarking best practices, focusing on meta-metrics, parameter selection, and strategic cost-performance evaluation.

Result: FMwork achieved up to 24x improvement in speed/resource savings and a further 2.7x gain by reducing output size, while maintaining 96.6% accuracy in tests using Llama 3.1 8B model.

Conclusion: FMwork streamlines benchmarking processes for Foundation Models by providing efficient evaluation strategies, demonstrating significant speed and resource benefits while preserving result accuracy.

Abstract: Benchmarking inference performance (speed) of Foundation Models such as Large
Language Models (LLM) involves navigating a vast experimental landscape to
understand the complex interactions between hardware and software components.
However, evaluating every possible test configuration is impractical,
unfeasible and unnecessary. To address this challenge, we introduce FMwork, a
comprehensive and methodical approach to creating a controlled testing
environment that accurately reflects and characterizes performance. FMwork
comprises a set of benchmkaring best practices with three key components: 1)
meta-metrics, 2) parameter selection, and 3) strategic cost-performance
evaluation. Meta-metrics account for time and resources spent on benchmarking
and the relative accuracy of the results compared to a larger body of
measurements, representing the complete experimental space. FMwork
operationalizes the meta-metrics and provides efficient strategies for
parameter selection and cost-performance analysis. Using the framework, we show
up to 24x improvement (speedup and/or resource savings) running sweeps of
experiments compared to the ground truth. Even already considering a subset of
experiments as reference point (using the power of two for batch sizes),
reducing experimental output size from 1024 to 128 tokens yields another 2.7x
gain while keeping 96.6% accuracy for an evaluation using Llama 3.1 8B model.

### [301] [Generating Compilers for Qubit Mapping and Routing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10781)
*Abtin Molavi,Amanda Xu,Ethan Cecchetti,Swamit Tannu,Aws Albarghouthi*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a unified approach for automatically generating qubit mapping and routing (QMR) compilers for diverse quantum architectures using a domain-specific language (DSL) named Marol, showing competitive performance against specialized compilers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantum computing hardware is diverse and rapidly evolving, requiring adaptive optimization compilers for efficient resource use and error rate reduction. QMR problems arise due to device-specific constraints in qubit connectivity.

Method: The authors propose Marol, a DSL, to formulate abstract QMR problems. The DSL defines these problems in a concise manner, enabling the use of a parametric solver adaptable to various quantum architectures.

Result: Generated compilers based on the proposed approach perform competitively alongside specialized, handwritten compilers in runtime and solution quality, covering a broad spectrum of hardware platforms.

Conclusion: The proposed approach simplifies compiler development for emerging quantum architectures, supporting evolving needs in quantum computing systems.

Abstract: Quantum computers promise to solve important problems faster than classical
computers, potentially unlocking breakthroughs in materials science, chemistry,
and beyond. Optimizing compilers are key to realizing this potential, as they
minimize expensive resource usage and limit error rates. A critical compilation
step is qubit mapping and routing (QMR), which finds mappings from circuit
qubits to qubits on a target device and plans instruction execution while
satisfying the device's connectivity constraints. The challenge is that the
landscape of quantum architectures is incredibly diverse and fast-evolving.
Given this diversity, hundreds of papers have addressed the QMR problem for
different qubit hardware, connectivity constraints, and quantum error
correction schemes.
  We present an approach for automatically generating qubit mapping and routing
compilers for arbitrary quantum architectures. Though each QMR problem is
different, we identify a common core structure-device state machine-that we use
to formulate an abstract QMR problem. Our formulation naturally leads to a
domain-specific language, Marol, for specifying QMR problems-for example, the
well-studied NISQ mapping and routing problem requires only 12 lines of Marol.
We demonstrate that QMR problems, defined in Marol, can be solved with a
powerful parametric solver that can be instantiated for any Marol program. We
evaluate our approach through case studies of important QMR problems from prior
and recent work, covering noisy and fault-tolerant quantum architectures on all
major hardware platforms. Our thorough evaluation shows that generated
compilers are competitive with handwritten, specialized compilers in terms of
runtime and solution quality. We envision that our approach will simplify
development of future quantum compilers as new quantum architectures continue
to emerge.

*Xu Ma,Jiajie Zhang,Fujing Xie,Sören Schwertfeger*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces a WiFi-based localization framework leveraging OpenStreetMap Area Graph (osmAG) for autonomous indoor robotics, achieving improved localization accuracy and scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to provide an effective solution for indoor localization for autonomous robotics, where traditional GPS solutions fail, by utilizing ubiquitous WiFi infrastructure and osmAG data.

Method: The framework combines signal propagation modeling with osmAG's geometric and topological priors. It localizes WiFi Access Points offline using an iterative optimization algorithm and conducts real-time localization online with the enhanced osmAG map.

Result: The proposed method achieved a 3.79 m localization error for APs (35.3% better than trilateration) and localization accuracy of 3.12 m in fingerprinted areas (8.77% better than KNN), and 3.83 m in non-fingerprinted areas (81.05% improvement).

Conclusion: The framework provides a scalable and cost-effective solution for indoor robotic localization, outperforming previous fingerprint-based approaches, especially in areas without fingerprint data. Code and datasets are made openly available to support further research.

Abstract: Global localization is essential for autonomous robotics, especially in
indoor environments where the GPS signal is denied. We propose a novel
WiFi-based localization framework that leverages ubiquitous wireless
infrastructure and the OpenStreetMap Area Graph (osmAG) for large-scale indoor
environments. Our approach integrates signal propagation modeling with osmAG's
geometric and topological priors. In the offline phase, an iterative
optimization algorithm localizes WiFi Access Points (APs) by modeling wall
attenuation, achieving a mean localization error of 3.79 m (35.3\% improvement
over trilateration). In the online phase, real-time robot localization uses the
augmented osmAG map, yielding a mean error of 3.12 m in fingerprinted areas
(8.77\% improvement over KNN fingerprinting) and 3.83 m in non-fingerprinted
areas (81.05\% improvement). Comparison with a fingerprint-based method shows
that our approach is much more space efficient and achieves superior
localization accuracy, especially for positions where no fingerprint data are
available. Validated across a complex 11,025 &m^2& multi-floor environment,
this framework offers a scalable, cost-effective solution for indoor robotic
localization, solving the kidnapped robot problem. The code and dataset are

TL;DR: This paper develops a method to create collision-free trajectories in dynamic environments using Space-Time Graphs of Convex Sets (ST-GCS), bypassing the need for an initial guess to the solver.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of generating collision-free trajectories in cluttered and dynamic environments, where numerous spatial and temporal constraints exist, making it hard to provide an initial guess for numerical solvers.

Method: The authors leverage Space-Time Graphs of Convex Sets (ST-GCS) to compute optimal trajectories. They also derive general GCS-compatible constraints and outline a strategy to adapt these constraints to their framework.

Result: ST-GCS demonstrates its equivalency to standard GCS in static environments and successfully handles dynamic environments to produce optimal, collision-free trajectories.

Conclusion: The ST-GCS framework enhances trajectory planning in dynamic environments by avoiding the need for an initial solver guess and maintaining system performance consistent with static scenarios.

Abstract: In this paper, we create optimal, collision-free, time-dependent trajectories
through cluttered dynamic environments. The many spatial and temporal
constraints make finding an initial guess for a numerical solver difficult.
Graphs of Convex Sets (GCS) and the recently developed Space-Time Graphs of
Convex Sets formulation (ST-GCS) enable us to generate optimal minimum distance
collision-free trajectories without providing an initial guess to the solver.
We also explore the derivation of general GCS-compatible constraints and
document an intuitive strategy for adapting general constraints to the
framework. We show that ST-GCS produces equivalent trajectories to the standard
GCS formulation when the environment is static. We then show ST-GCS operating
in dynamic environments to find minimum distance collision-free trajectories.

Conclusion: The HDDPC framework provides a unified and efficient solution for real-time, robust bipedal locomotion in dynamic environments, validated successfully through practical implementation on the Atalante exoskeleton.

Abstract: Robust bipedal locomotion in exoskeletons requires the ability to dynamically
react to changes in the environment in real time. This paper introduces the
hybrid data-driven predictive control (HDDPC) framework, an extension of the
data-enabled predictive control, that addresses these challenges by
simultaneously planning foot contact schedules and continuous domain
trajectories. The proposed framework utilizes a Hankel matrix-based
representation to model system dynamics, incorporating step-to-step (S2S)
transitions to enhance adaptability in dynamic environments. By integrating
contact scheduling with trajectory planning, the framework offers an efficient,
unified solution for locomotion motion synthesis that enables robust and
reactive walking through online replanning. We validate the approach on the
Atalante exoskeleton, demonstrating improved robustness and adaptability.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces ReconVLA, a model that enhances Vision-Language-Action (VLA) capabilities by improving visual attention allocation for robotic agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLA models struggle to focus visual attention on specific target regions, critical for precise robotic manipulation.

Method: The authors propose an implicit grounding approach using a reconstructive VLA model and a diffusion transformer to reconstruct gaze regions based on visual outputs, enabling fine-grained representation learning.

Result: Experiments in both simulations and real-world settings demonstrate that ReconVLA significantly improves manipulation precision and generalization.

Conclusion: ReconVLA's implicit grounding strategy effectively addresses VLA models' challenges, establishing its efficacy and potential for broad application in robotics.

Abstract: Recent advances in Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have enabled robotic
agents to integrate multimodal understanding with action execution. However,
our empirical analysis reveals that current VLAs struggle to allocate visual
attention to target regions. Instead, visual attention is always dispersed. To
guide the visual attention grounding on the correct target, we propose
ReconVLA, a reconstructive VLA model with an implicit grounding paradigm.
Conditioned on the model's visual outputs, a diffusion transformer aims to
reconstruct the gaze region of the image, which corresponds to the target
manipulated objects. This process prompts the VLA model to learn fine-grained
representations and accurately allocate visual attention, thus effectively
leveraging task-specific visual information and conducting precise
manipulation. Moreover, we curate a large-scale pretraining dataset comprising
over 100k trajectories and 2 million data samples from open-source robotic
datasets, further boosting the model's generalization in visual reconstruction.
Extensive experiments in simulation and the real world demonstrate the
superiority of our implicit grounding method, showcasing its capabilities of
precise manipulation and generalization. Our project page is

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the challenge of robotic source seeking in complex and unknown environments, balancing exploration and exploitation efficiently.

Method: The method involves employing Behavioral Entropy with Prelec's probability weighting function to model normalized signal strength as surrogate probabilities, coupled with a dynamic objective function to adapt robot behavior.

Result: Experimental validation shows BEASST outperforms existing methods, reducing path length by 15% and achieving source localization 20% faster in DARPA SubT and multi-room scenarios.

Conclusion: BEASST offers a theoretically convergent and practically stable framework that advances mobile robot capabilities in source seeking with intelligent and adaptive uncertainty-driven navigation.

Abstract: This paper presents BEASST (Behavioral Entropic Gradient-based Adaptive
Source Seeking for Mobile Robots), a novel framework for robotic source seeking
in complex, unknown environments. Our approach enables mobile robots to
efficiently balance exploration and exploitation by modeling normalized signal
strength as a surrogate probability of source location. Building on Behavioral
Entropy(BE) with Prelec's probability weighting function, we define an
objective function that adapts robot behavior from risk-averse to risk-seeking
based on signal reliability and mission urgency. The framework provides
theoretical convergence guarantees under unimodal signal assumptions and
practical stability under bounded disturbances. Experimental validation across
DARPA SubT and multi-room scenarios demonstrates that BEASST consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving 15% reduction in path length
and 20% faster source localization through intelligent uncertainty-driven
navigation that dynamically transitions between aggressive pursuit and cautious

*Wenqi Zheng,Yutaka Arakawa*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper applies reinforcement learning to multi-modal human activity recognition by using a method named FAVOR, which involves training multimodal large language models (MLLMs) with visual reinforcement learning to improve few-shot recognition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation lies in extending reinforcement learning to enhance generalization and reasoning abilities in multi-modal human activity recognition, especially in scenarios with limited fine-tuning data.

Method: The proposed method, FAVOR, uses MLLMs to generate reasoning-based responses, evaluates them with reward functions, and optimizes the model using the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm. This approach incorporates visual reinforcement learning to improve few-shot recognition.

Result: The method outperforms others, as shown through extensive experiments on four datasets and across five different settings.

Conclusion: FAVOR demonstrates superiority in applying reinforcement learning to enhance multi-modal human activity recognition with explainable reasoning and strong generalization in few-shot settings.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning in large reasoning models enables learning from
feedback on their outputs, making it particularly valuable in scenarios where
fine-tuning data is limited. However, its application in multi-modal human
activity recognition (HAR) domains remains largely underexplored. Our work
extends reinforcement learning to the human activity recognition domain with
multimodal large language models. By incorporating visual reinforcement
learning in the training process, the model's generalization ability on
few-shot recognition can be greatly improved. Additionally, visual
reinforcement learning can enhance the model's reasoning ability and enable
explainable analysis in the inference stage. We name our few-shot human
activity recognition method with visual reinforcement learning FAVOR.
Specifically, our approach first utilizes a multimodal large language model
(MLLM) to generate multiple candidate responses for the human activity image,
each containing reasoning traces and final answers. These responses are then
evaluated using reward functions, and the MLLM model is subsequently optimized
using the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm. In this way, the
MLLM model can be adapted to human activity recognition with only a few
samples. Extensive experiments on four human activity recognition datasets and
five different settings demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method.

*Yu Chen,Shu Miao,Chunyu Wu,Jingsong Mu,Bo OuYang,Xiang Li*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper proposes integrating large language models and anomaly detection into upper-limb exoskeletons to enhance semantic understanding, adaptability to tasks, and safety during human-robot interaction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing upper-limb exoskeletons struggle to understand task semantics or collaboratively plan actions, limiting their adaptability and effectiveness.

Method: The framework integrates large language models for semantic understanding, uses transparent mode for intent capture, employs diffusion-based anomaly detection for monitoring, and refines trajectories and impedance during operation.

Result: The system aligned with user cognition, adapted to different semantic tasks, and reliably handled anomalies during experimental trials.

Conclusion: The semantic-aware framework provides safe and intent-driven assistance in exoskeletons, improving task adaptability and user interaction experience.

Abstract: Upper-limb exoskeletons are primarily designed to provide assistive support
by accurately interpreting and responding to human intentions. In home-care
scenarios, exoskeletons are expected to adapt their assistive configurations
based on the semantic information of the task, adjusting appropriately in
accordance with the nature of the object being manipulated. However, existing
solutions often lack the ability to understand task semantics or
collaboratively plan actions with the user, limiting their generalizability. To
address this challenge, this paper introduces a semantic-aware framework that
integrates large language models into the task planning framework, enabling the
delivery of safe and intent-integrative assistance. The proposed approach
begins with the exoskeleton operating in transparent mode to capture the
wearer's intent during object grasping. Once semantic information is extracted
from the task description, the system automatically configures appropriate
assistive parameters. In addition, a diffusion-based anomaly detector is used
to continuously monitor the state of human-robot interaction and trigger
real-time replanning in response to detected anomalies. During task execution,
online trajectory refinement and impedance control are used to ensure safety
and regulate human-robot interaction. Experimental results demonstrate that the
proposed method effectively aligns with the wearer's cognition, adapts to
semantically varying tasks, and responds reliably to anomalies.

TL;DR: This study introduces a framework to generate dense LiDAR reflectance images from sparse data using non-repeating scanning LiDAR (NRS-LiDAR), addressing limitations of traditional low-cost LiDARs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to overcome the challenge of sparse scan data from low-cost LiDAR sensors to make active vision via LiDAR more applicable in robotic perception tasks.

Method: The authors propose a framework leveraging NRS-LiDAR attributes, focusing on reflectance calibration and dynamic-to-static scene transitions, enabling the densification of reflectance images.

Result: This work provides a dataset for LiDAR reflectance densification, a tailored densification network for NRS-LiDAR, and showcases applications like loop closure and traffic lane detection using dense reflectance images.

Conclusion: The study broadens the usability of low-cost LiDAR sensors by successfully generating dense reflectance images, advancing applications in robotics and autonomous systems.

Abstract: Conventionally, human intuition often defines vision as a modality of passive
optical sensing, while active optical sensing is typically regarded as
measuring rather than the default modality of vision. However, the situation
now changes: sensor technologies and data-driven paradigms empower active
optical sensing to redefine the boundaries of vision, ushering in a new era of
active vision. Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) sensors capture reflectance
from object surfaces, which remains invariant under varying illumination
conditions, showcasing significant potential in robotic perception tasks such
as detection, recognition, segmentation, and Simultaneous Localization and
Mapping (SLAM). These applications often rely on dense sensing capabilities,
typically achieved by high-resolution, expensive LiDAR sensors. A key challenge
with low-cost LiDARs lies in the sparsity of scan data, which limits their
broader application. To address this limitation, this work introduces an
innovative framework for generating dense LiDAR reflectance images from sparse
data, leveraging the unique attributes of non-repeating scanning LiDAR
(NRS-LiDAR). We tackle critical challenges, including reflectance calibration
and the transition from static to dynamic scene domains, facilitating the
reconstruction of dense reflectance images in real-world settings. The key
contributions of this work include a comprehensive dataset for LiDAR
reflectance image densification, a densification network tailored for
NRS-LiDAR, and diverse applications such as loop closure and traffic lane
detection using the generated dense reflectance images.

Method: The paper examines how large models enhance autonomous decision-making (via hierarchical and end-to-end paradigms) and embodied learning methodologies (including imitation and reinforcement learning). It also integrates world models into embodied AI research for the first time.

Result: Large models improve high-level planning, low-level execution, and feedback, as well as Vision-Language-Action models for decision-making. They also aid in imitation learning, reinforcement learning, and world model design, significantly advancing embodied AI.

Conclusion: Despite substantial advancements driven by large models, the quest for human-level intelligence in embodied AI remains incomplete. Continued research is needed to overcome existing challenges and realize AGI through embodied systems.

Abstract: Embodied AI aims to develop intelligent systems with physical forms capable
of perceiving, decision-making, acting, and learning in real-world
environments, providing a promising way to Artificial General Intelligence
(AGI). Despite decades of explorations, it remains challenging for embodied
agents to achieve human-level intelligence for general-purpose tasks in open
dynamic environments. Recent breakthroughs in large models have revolutionized
embodied AI by enhancing perception, interaction, planning and learning. In
this article, we provide a comprehensive survey on large model empowered
embodied AI, focusing on autonomous decision-making and embodied learning. We
investigate both hierarchical and end-to-end decision-making paradigms,
detailing how large models enhance high-level planning, low-level execution,
and feedback for hierarchical decision-making, and how large models enhance
Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models for end-to-end decision making. For
embodied learning, we introduce mainstream learning methodologies, elaborating
on how large models enhance imitation learning and reinforcement learning
in-depth. For the first time, we integrate world models into the survey of
embodied AI, presenting their design methods and critical roles in enhancing
decision-making and learning. Though solid advances have been achieved,
challenges still exist, which are discussed at the end of this survey,
potentially as the further research directions.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the complexities SMEs face in implementing robotic systems due to lack of expertise, dependence on external integrators, and vendor lock-in. Researchers also struggle with managing robot interfaces in intelligent manufacturing system design.

Method: The authors propose a software framework implemented in Python as a prototype. It simplifies the diverse interfaces of robotic systems using an abstraction layer for compatibility across different manufacturers and models.

Result: The framework was tested on a bin-picking cell featuring a Yaskawa Motoman GP4, demonstrating its practical deployability and functionality.

Conclusion: The framework offers an accessible solution for SMEs and researchers by streamlining the deployment and integration of robotic systems, potentially reducing external dependencies and complexity.

Abstract: Developing robotic algorithms and integrating a robotic subsystem into a
larger system can be a difficult task. Particularly in small and medium-sized
enterprises (SMEs) where robotics expertise is lacking, implementing,
maintaining and developing robotic systems can be a challenge. As a result,
many companies rely on external expertise through system integrators, which, in
some cases, can lead to vendor lock-in and external dependency. In the academic
research on intelligent manufacturing systems, robots play a critical role in
the design of robust autonomous systems. Similar challenges are faced by
researchers who want to use robotic systems as a component in a larger smart
system, without having to deal with the complexity and vastness of the robot
interfaces in detail. In this paper, we propose a software framework that
reduces the effort required to deploy a working robotic system. The focus is
solely on providing a concept for simplifying the different interfaces of a
modern robot system and using an abstraction layer for different manufacturers
and models. The Python programming language is used to implement a prototype of
the concept. The target system is a bin-picking cell containing a Yaskawa
Motoman GP4.

Motivation: Existing vision-and-language navigation models struggle to recover from trajectory deviations due to a lack of error correction mechanisms.

Method: The proposed Self-correction Flywheel identifies deviations in error trajectories, generates self-correction data for continued model training, and iteratively improves performance through repeated re-evaluation on training data.

Result: The method achieves state-of-the-art success rates of 65.1% and 69.3% on the R2R-CE and RxR-CE benchmarks, with significant performance improvements of 8.2% and 16.4%, and performs well in real-world robotic environments.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of using training set errors as a resource for iterative model improvement, significantly enhancing the model's navigation and error correction capabilities.

Abstract: Existing vision-and-language navigation models often deviate from the correct
trajectory when executing instructions. However, these models lack effective
error correction capability, hindering their recovery from errors. To address
this challenge, we propose Self-correction Flywheel, a novel post-training
paradigm. Instead of considering the model's error trajectories on the training
set as a drawback, our paradigm emphasizes their significance as a valuable
data source. We have developed a method to identify deviations in these error
trajectories and devised innovative techniques to automatically generate
self-correction data for perception and action. These self-correction data
serve as fuel to power the model's continued training. The brilliance of our
paradigm is revealed when we re-evaluate the model on the training set,
uncovering new error trajectories. At this time, the self-correction flywheel
begins to spin. Through multiple flywheel iterations, we progressively enhance
our monocular RGB-based VLA navigation model CorrectNav. Experiments on R2R-CE
and RxR-CE benchmarks show CorrectNav achieves new state-of-the-art success
rates of 65.1% and 69.3%, surpassing prior best VLA navigation models by 8.2%
and 16.4%. Real robot tests in various indoor and outdoor environments
demonstrate \method's superior capability of error correction, dynamic obstacle
avoidance, and long instruction following.

*Qi Liu,Xiaopeng Zhang,Mingshan Tan,Shuaikang Ma,Jinliang Ding,Yanjie Li*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper presents a multi-agent reinforcement learning method that treats a single humanoid robot's limbs as independent agents to enhance its locomotion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve locomotion capabilities of a single humanoid robot by utilizing cooperative-heterogeneous multi-agent reinforcement learning, a less-explored paradigm.

Method: Developed MASH (multi-agent reinforcement learning for single humanoid locomotion), where each limb is treated as an independent agent sharing a global critic for cooperative learning.

Result: Experiments show that MASH accelerates training and improves cooperation among limbs, outperforming traditional single-agent reinforcement learning methods.

Conclusion: MASH successfully integrates MARL into single humanoid robot control, offering enhanced locomotion strategies and faster training convergence.

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel method to enhance locomotion for a single
humanoid robot through cooperative-heterogeneous multi-agent deep reinforcement
learning (MARL). While most existing methods typically employ single-agent
reinforcement learning algorithms for a single humanoid robot or MARL
algorithms for multi-robot system tasks, we propose a distinct paradigm:
applying cooperative-heterogeneous MARL to optimize locomotion for a single
humanoid robot. The proposed method, multi-agent reinforcement learning for
single humanoid locomotion (MASH), treats each limb (legs and arms) as an
independent agent that explores the robot's action space while sharing a global
critic for cooperative learning. Experiments demonstrate that MASH accelerates
training convergence and improves whole-body cooperation ability, outperforming
conventional single-agent reinforcement learning methods. This work advances
the integration of MARL into single-humanoid-robot control, offering new
insights into efficient locomotion strategies.

### [314] [KDPE: A Kernel Density Estimation Strategy for Diffusion Policy Trajectory Selection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10511)
*Andrea Rosasco,Federico Ceola,Giulia Pasquale,Lorenzo Natale*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: KDPE proposes an improvement over the Diffusion Policy for behavior cloning by filtering harmful trajectories, achieving better performance in simulations and real-world robot tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Behavior cloning struggles to effectively capture multimodality in training data. Existing methods, like Diffusion Policy, face challenges such as susceptibility to outliers and stochastic errors in action trajectory generation.

Method: KDPE employs Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) with a novel manifold-aware kernel to filter harmful robot action trajectories generated by Diffusion Policy. This reduces computational overhead while removing problematic trajectories.

Result: KDPE surpasses Diffusion Policy in both simulated single-arm tasks and real robot experiments, demonstrating reduced error and improved performance.

Conclusion: KDPE offers a practical and computationally efficient solution with better reliability for trajectory generation in robot behavior cloning applications.

Abstract: Learning robot policies that capture multimodality in the training data has
been a long-standing open challenge for behavior cloning. Recent approaches
tackle the problem by modeling the conditional action distribution with
generative models. One of these approaches is Diffusion Policy, which relies on
a diffusion model to denoise random points into robot action trajectories.
While achieving state-of-the-art performance, it has two main drawbacks that
may lead the robot out of the data distribution during policy execution. First,
the stochasticity of the denoising process can highly impact on the quality of
generated trajectory of actions. Second, being a supervised learning approach,
it can learn data outliers from the dataset used for training. Recent work
focuses on mitigating these limitations by combining Diffusion Policy either
with large-scale training or with classical behavior cloning algorithms.
Instead, we propose KDPE, a Kernel Density Estimation-based strategy that
filters out potentially harmful trajectories output of Diffusion Policy while
keeping a low test-time computational overhead. For Kernel Density Estimation,
we propose a manifold-aware kernel to model a probability density function for
actions composed of end-effector Cartesian position, orientation, and gripper
state. KDPE overall achieves better performance than Diffusion Policy on
simulated single-arm tasks and real robot experiments.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces MLM, a reinforcement learning framework that enables quadruped robots with robotic arms to perform multi-task whole-body loco-manipulation autonomously or under teleoperation. Simulation and real-world data were used for training and testing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of achieving efficient multi-task control in whole-body loco-manipulation for quadruped robots equipped with robotic arms.

Method: The authors propose a reinforcement learning framework (MLM) that includes a trajectory library with an adaptive sampling mechanism and a Trajectory-Velocity Prediction policy network, enabling effective multi-task learning and execution.

Result: The approach achieves whole-body behaviors in simulated environments with zero-shot transfer to real-world operations. Ablation and real-world tests demonstrated the framework's robustness and performance in multi-task scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed MLM framework efficiently tackles the problem of balancing multi-task control in quadruped robots and achieves successful deployment both in simulation and real-world scenarios, as verified by experiments.

Abstract: Whole-body loco-manipulation for quadruped robots with arm remains a
challenging problem, particularly in achieving multi-task control. To address
this, we propose MLM, a reinforcement learning framework driven by both
real-world and simulation data. It enables a six-DoF robotic arm--equipped
quadruped robot to perform whole-body loco-manipulation for multiple tasks
autonomously or under human teleoperation. To address the problem of balancing
multiple tasks during the learning of loco-manipulation, we introduce a
trajectory library with an adaptive, curriculum-based sampling mechanism. This
approach allows the policy to efficiently leverage real-world collected
trajectories for learning multi-task loco-manipulation. To address deployment
scenarios with only historical observations and to enhance the performance of
policy execution across tasks with different spatial ranges, we propose a
Trajectory-Velocity Prediction policy network. It predicts unobservable future
trajectories and velocities. By leveraging extensive simulation data and
curriculum-based rewards, our controller achieves whole-body behaviors in
simulation and zero-shot transfer to real-world deployment. Ablation studies in
simulation verify the necessity and effectiveness of our approach, while
real-world experiments on the Go2 robot with an Airbot robotic arm demonstrate
the policy's good performance in multi-task execution.

*Agnes Axelsson,Merle Reimann,Ronald Cumbal,Hannah Pelikan,Divesh Lala*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper explores using ethnographic vignettes to document and analyze failures in human-robot interactions (HRI).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address failures in human-robot interactions that are context-dependent and often undocumented, thereby improving transparency and evaluation in HRI research.

Method: The authors propose the use of ethnographic vignettes, a narrative-focused qualitative methodology, to document failures in HRI systems. They further create examples of these vignettes based on personal experiences.

Result: The study demonstrates how vignettes can clearly communicate failures from multi-disciplinary perspectives, highlight unexpected robot behaviors, and improve transparency about robotic capabilities.

Conclusion: Ethnographic vignettes are a valuable addition to existing HRI evaluation methods as they document rare or context-specific failures, promoting better understanding and research transparency.

Abstract: Although the quality of human-robot interactions has improved with the advent
of LLMs, there are still various factors that cause systems to be sub-optimal
when compared to human-human interactions. The nature and criticality of
failures are often dependent on the context of the interaction and so cannot be
generalized across the wide range of scenarios and experiments which have been
implemented in HRI research. In this work we propose the use of a technique
overlooked in the field of HRI, ethnographic vignettes, to clearly highlight
these failures, particularly those that are rarely documented. We describe the
methodology behind the process of writing vignettes and create our own based on
our personal experiences with failures in HRI systems. We emphasize the
strength of vignettes as the ability to communicate failures from a
multi-disciplinary perspective, promote transparency about the capabilities of
robots, and document unexpected behaviours which would otherwise be omitted
from research reports. We encourage the use of vignettes to augment existing
interaction evaluation methods.

*Mehdi Heydari Shahna,Jouni Mattila*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper presents a hierarchical control system for heavy-duty wheeled mobile robots (WMRs), combining deep neural networks (DNNs) with robust adaptive control (RAC) and safety layers, validated via real-time experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deploying deep neural networks for control in heavy-duty wheeled mobile robots remains challenging due to strict international standards and vulnerability to disturbances and faults.

Method: A hierarchical control system was designed consisting of DNNs for high-precision primary control and two safety layers: a low-level RAC to handle disturbances and a high-level layer for shutdowns under extreme conditions.

Result: The approach demonstrated uniform exponential stability and adhered to safety standards. Real-time tests on a 6,000 kg WMR verified its effectiveness.

Conclusion: The synthesis of DNN and RAC policies ensures system robustness and safety, offering a viable solution for heavy-duty WMR control under challenging conditions.

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) can enable precise control while maintaining low
computational costs by circumventing the need for dynamic modeling. However,
the deployment of such black-box approaches remains challenging for heavy-duty
wheeled mobile robots (WMRs), which are subject to strict international
standards and prone to faults and disturbances. We designed a hierarchical
control policy for heavy-duty WMRs, monitored by two safety layers with
differing levels of authority. To this end, a DNN policy was trained and
deployed as the primary control strategy, providing high-precision performance
under nominal operating conditions. When external disturbances arise and reach
a level of intensity such that the system performance falls below a predefined
threshold, a low-level safety layer intervenes by deactivating the primary
control policy and activating a model-free robust adaptive control (RAC)
policy. This transition enables the system to continue operating while ensuring
stability by effectively managing the inherent trade-off between system
robustness and responsiveness. Regardless of the control policy in use, a
high-level safety layer continuously monitors system performance during
operation. It initiates a shutdown only when disturbances become sufficiently
severe such that compensation is no longer viable and continued operation would
jeopardize the system or its environment. The proposed synthesis of DNN and RAC
policy guarantees uniform exponential stability of the entire WMR system while
adhering to safety standards to some extent. The effectiveness of the proposed
approach was further validated through real-time experiments using a 6,000 kg
WMR.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces an open-source simulation tool for modeling magnetic soft robots using the SOFA framework, emphasizing user-friendliness and practical application.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for specialized, accessible tools to accurately model and simulate the deformation of magnetic soft robots under external magnetic fields.

Method: Developed a simulation interface integrated with SOFA that allows intuitive control, material property definition, stress analysis, and real-time deformation observation.

Result: Demonstrated the functionality using four benchmark models, and showcased accessibility for varying expertise levels of researchers.

Conclusion: The software serves as a bridge between theoretical modeling and practical design, with ongoing plans for refining accuracy through experimental validation and comparison with advanced solvers.

Abstract: Soft robots, particularly magnetic soft robots, require specialized
simulation tools to accurately model their deformation under external magnetic
fields. However, existing platforms often lack dedicated support for magnetic
materials, making them difficult to use for researchers at different expertise
levels. This work introduces an open-source, user-friendly simulation interface
using the Simulation Open Framework Architecture (SOFA), specifically designed
to model magnetic soft robots. The tool enables users to define material
properties, apply magnetic fields, and observe resulting deformations in real
time. By integrating intuitive controls and stress analysis capabilities, it
aims to bridge the gap between theoretical modeling and practical design. Four
benchmark models - a beam, three- and four-finger grippers, and a butterfly -
demonstrate its functionality. The software's ease of use makes it accessible
to both beginners and advanced researchers. Future improvements will refine
accuracy through experimental validation and comparison with industry-standard
finite element solvers, ensuring realistic and predictive simulations of
magnetic soft robots.

*Matteo Luperto,Valerii Stakanov,Giacomo Boracchi,Nicola Basilico,Francesco Amigoni*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper presents a method to improve autonomous exploration performance by using saliency maps to focus on significant areas of the environment, showing better exploration outcomes in experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional exploration strategies prioritize maximizing explored area but often neglect the importance of certain environment sections that could lead to large unknown area discovery.

Method: The authors propose leveraging saliency maps generated by a neural network to identify high-interest exploration areas and implement a termination criterion to determine exploration sufficiency.

Result: Through experiments, the method improved exploration efficiency by influencing robot behaviors toward significant environment sections.

Conclusion: Using saliency-based approaches in exploration strategies helps robots prioritize critical areas, resulting in more effective autonomous exploration systems.

Abstract: Autonomous exploration is a widely studied problem where a robot
incrementally builds a map of a previously unknown environment. The robot
selects the next locations to reach using an exploration strategy. To do so,
the robot has to balance between competing objectives, like exploring the
entirety of the environment, while being as fast as possible. Most exploration
strategies try to maximise the explored area to speed up exploration; however,
they do not consider that parts of the environment are more important than
others, as they lead to the discovery of large unknown areas. We propose a
method that identifies \emph{saliency areas} as those areas that are of high
interest for exploration, by using saliency maps obtained from a neural network
that, given the current map, implements a termination criterion to estimate
whether the environment can be considered fully-explored or not. We use
saliency areas to bias some widely used exploration strategies, showing, with
an extensive experimental campaign, that this knowledge can significantly
influence the behavior of the robot during exploration.

*Alessandro Adami,Aris Synodinos,Matteo Iovino,Ruggero Carli,Pietro Falco*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces a framework using Reinforcement Learning and Genetic Programming to automatically design Stack of Tasks (SoT) hierarchies for robots, improving adaptability and reducing reliance on expert design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Managing redundancy in modern robotic systems for reliable and flexible multi-tasking often relies on expert-designed Stack of Tasks. The paper aims to overcome their limitations by offering an automated, user-friendly approach.

Method: The authors propose a system combining Reinforcement Learning and Genetic Programming to automatically learn task hierarchies and parameters. A cost function, based on metrics like precision, safety, and execution time, guides the learning.

Result: The framework is validated through simulations and experiments with YuMi mobile manipulators. The learned SoTs demonstrate dynamic adaptability to environmental changes, competing objectives, and robust task execution.

Conclusion: The study provides a general and accessible redundancy management solution, advancing human-centered robot programming and reducing dependence on expert intervention in robot control design.

Abstract: Modern robotic systems, such as mobile manipulators, humanoids, and aerial
robots with arms, often possess high redundancy, enabling them to perform
multiple tasks simultaneously. Managing this redundancy is key to achieving
reliable and flexible behavior. A widely used approach is the Stack of Tasks
(SoT), which organizes control objectives by priority within a unified
framework. However, traditional SoTs are manually designed by experts, limiting
their adaptability and accessibility. This paper introduces a novel framework
that automatically learns both the hierarchy and parameters of a SoT from
user-defined objectives. By combining Reinforcement Learning and Genetic
Programming, the system discovers task priorities and control strategies
without manual intervention. A cost function based on intuitive metrics such as
precision, safety, and execution time guides the learning process. We validate
our method through simulations and experiments on the mobile-YuMi platform, a
dual-arm mobile manipulator with high redundancy. Results show that the learned
SoTs enable the robot to dynamically adapt to changing environments and inputs,
balancing competing objectives while maintaining robust task execution. This
approach provides a general and user-friendly solution for redundancy
management in complex robots, advancing human-centered robot programming and
reducing the need for expert design.

*Troi Williams*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes the SET Perceptual Factors Framework to systematically analyze and model factors affecting the reliability of robot perception in autonomous systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Safety and public trust in autonomous systems hinge on reliable robot perception, which is often compromised by environmental challenges. Failures in perception can lead to accidents and diminished trust.

Method: The SET (Self, Environment, and Target) Perceptual Factors Framework uses SET State Trees to categorize the origin of environmental factors and SET Factor Trees to model how these impact tasks like object detection. It also employs Perceptual Factor Models to quantify task-specific uncertainties.

Result: The framework provides a structured approach to identifying, modeling, and quantifying perceptual risks, thereby supporting safety assurances and fostering trust in autonomous systems.

Conclusion: This structured and transparent framework fosters rigorous safety assurances and public understanding, aiming to enhance both the reliability of autonomous systems and societal trust in their deployment.

Abstract: Future autonomous systems promise significant societal benefits, yet their
deployment raises concerns about safety and trustworthiness. A key concern is
assuring the reliability of robot perception, as perception seeds safe
decision-making. Failures in perception are often due to complex yet common
environmental factors and can lead to accidents that erode public trust. To
address this concern, we introduce the SET (Self, Environment, and Target)
Perceptual Factors Framework. We designed the framework to systematically
analyze how factors such as weather, occlusion, or sensor limitations
negatively impact perception. To achieve this, the framework employs SET State
Trees to categorize where such factors originate and SET Factor Trees to model
how these sources and factors impact perceptual tasks like object detection or
pose estimation. Next, we develop Perceptual Factor Models using both trees to
quantify the uncertainty for a given task. Our framework aims to promote
rigorous safety assurances and cultivate greater public understanding and trust
in autonomous systems by offering a transparent and standardized method for
identifying, modeling, and communicating perceptual risks.

*Henry Powell,Guy Laban,Emily S. Cross*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Developed a multimodal attention network and novel loss function to enhance social robots' ability to recognize human self-disclosure; achieved significant improvement in model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the need for computational systems capable of accurately modeling subjective self-disclosure in human social interactions. This is particularly important given the increasing role of social robots in human environments.

Method: The paper uses a multimodal attention network inspired by emotion recognition models. It trains this network on a self-collected video corpus and introduces a novel scale-preserving cross-entropy loss function to improve classification and regression performance.

Result: The best-performing model trained on the novel loss function achieved an F1 score of 0.83, an improvement of 0.48 over the best baseline model.

Conclusion: The research makes substantial progress towards enabling social robots to comprehend self-disclosures, a critical aspect of social cognition for effective human-robot interactions.

Abstract: Subjective self-disclosure is an important feature of human social
interaction. While much has been done in the social and behavioural literature
to characterise the features and consequences of subjective self-disclosure,
little work has been done thus far to develop computational systems that are
able to accurately model it. Even less work has been done that attempts to
model specifically how human interactants self-disclose with robotic partners.
It is becoming more pressing as we require social robots to work in conjunction
with and establish relationships with humans in various social settings. In
this paper, our aim is to develop a custom multimodal attention network based
on models from the emotion recognition literature, training this model on a
large self-collected self-disclosure video corpus, and constructing a new loss
function, the scale preserving cross entropy loss, that improves upon both
classification and regression versions of this problem. Our results show that
the best performing model, trained with our novel loss function, achieves an F1
score of 0.83, an improvement of 0.48 from the best baseline model. This result
makes significant headway in the aim of allowing social robots to pick up on an
interaction partner's self-disclosures, an ability that will be essential in
social robots with social cognition.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces CVIRO, a consistent visual-inertial-ranging odometry system using Lie groups to address key consistency issues in systems relying on UWB for drift mitigation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To solve consistency issues in UWB-aided VIO systems caused by incorrect observability and neglect of UWB anchor calibration uncertainty, which degrade localization performance.

Method: The proposed CVIRO system integrates UWB anchor states into the system's state estimation, uses Lie group properties to maintain observability consistency, and accounts for calibration uncertainty.

Result: CVIRO ensures consistent estimation, maintains the system’s correct unobservable subspace, and shows superior localization accuracy and consistency in simulations and experiments.

Conclusion: CVIRO effectively addresses the key challenges in UWB-aided VIO systems by ensuring consistency and improving localization accuracy.

Abstract: Ultra Wideband (UWB) is widely used to mitigate drift in visual-inertial
odometry (VIO) systems. Consistency is crucial for ensuring the estimation
accuracy of a UWBaided VIO system. An inconsistent estimator can degrade
localization performance, where the inconsistency primarily arises from two
main factors: (1) the estimator fails to preserve the correct system
observability, and (2) UWB anchor positions are assumed to be known, leading to
improper neglect of calibration uncertainty. In this paper, we propose a
consistent and tightly-coupled visual-inertial-ranging odometry (CVIRO) system
based on the Lie group. Our method incorporates the UWB anchor state into the
system state, explicitly accounting for UWB calibration uncertainty and
enabling the joint and consistent estimation of both robot and anchor states.
Furthermore, observability consistency is ensured by leveraging the invariant
error properties of the Lie group. We analytically prove that the CVIRO
algorithm naturally maintains the system's correct unobservable subspace,
thereby preserving estimation consistency. Extensive simulations and
experiments demonstrate that CVIRO achieves superior localization accuracy and
consistency compared to existing methods.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a reinforcement learning approach using the A2C algorithm to optimize Earth observation satellite orbital parameters for precise coverage while addressing increasing LEO congestion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to tackle challenges associated with deploying satellites in increasingly congested Low Earth Orbit, ensuring mission safety and efficient operations amidst risks like collisions.

Method: The method involves using the A2C reinforcement learning algorithm within a custom OpenAI Gymnasium environment, modeling orbital dynamics via Markov Decision Process and adjusting key orbital parameters for mission goals.

Result: The A2C approach outperformed PPO, achieving 5.8x higher rewards and converging 31.5x faster, demonstrating both superior performance and computational efficiency.

Conclusion: Reinforcement learning, particularly the A2C algorithm, is shown as a scalable and computationally efficient solution for adaptive mission planning in congested LEO scenarios.

Abstract: The increasing congestion of Low Earth Orbit (LEO) poses persistent
challenges to the efficient deployment and safe operation of Earth observation
satellites. Mission planners must now account not only for mission-specific
requirements but also for the increasing collision risk with active satellites
and space debris. This work presents a reinforcement learning framework using
the Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C) algorithm to optimize satellite orbital
parameters for precise terrestrial coverage within predefined surface radii. By
formulating the problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) within a custom
OpenAI Gymnasium environment, our method simulates orbital dynamics using
classical Keplerian elements. The agent progressively learns to adjust five of
the orbital parameters - semi-major axis, eccentricity, inclination, right
ascension of ascending node, and the argument of perigee-to achieve targeted
terrestrial coverage. Comparative evaluation against Proximal Policy
Optimization (PPO) demonstrates A2C's superior performance, achieving 5.8x
higher cumulative rewards (10.0 vs 9.263025) while converging in 31.5x fewer
timesteps (2,000 vs 63,000). The A2C agent consistently meets mission
objectives across diverse target coordinates while maintaining computational
efficiency suitable for real-time mission planning applications. Key
contributions include: (1) a TLE-based orbital simulation environment
incorporating physics constraints, (2) validation of actor-critic methods'
superiority over trust region approaches in continuous orbital control, and (3)
demonstration of rapid convergence enabling adaptive satellite deployment. This
approach establishes reinforcement learning as a computationally efficient
alternative for scalable and intelligent LEO mission planning.

TL;DR: FormalGrad is a framework that integrates formal methods into iterative LLM-based code generation, improving correctness, robustness, and efficiency in generated code.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle to ensure correctness, robustness, and efficiency in code generation, especially in domains with strict constraints.

Method: FormalGrad uses code as a differentiable variable, applies structured feedback and formal constraints as pseudo-gradients to iteratively refine generated solutions.

Result: FormalGrad achieved up to 27% absolute improvement on HumanEval and 41% relative improvement on LiveCodeBench V6 benchmarks compared to strong baselines.

Conclusion: FormalGrad enhances AI-assisted software development by providing robust, efficient, and formally justified code suitable for high-stakes applications.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities
in code generation, they often produce solutions that lack guarantees of
correctness, robustness, and efficiency. The limitation is acute in domains
requiring strict constraints. FormalGrad introduces a principled framework that
integrates formal methods directly into an iterative LLM-based generation loop.
It uniquely treats code as a differentiable variable, converting structured
feedback and formal constraints into a textual pseudo-gradient. This gradient
guides the model to iteratively refine solutions, ensuring they are not only
functional but also robust and formally justified. We evaluate FormalGrad on
the HumanEval, HumanEval+, and LiveCodeBench benchmarks. Our implementation
outperforms strong baselines, achieving an absolute improvement of up to 27% on
HumanEval and a 41% relative improvement on the challenging LiveCodeBench V6.
FormalGrad generates formally justified code that is robust and efficient,
paving the way for reliable AI-assisted software development in high-stakes
applications.

TL;DR: Saracoder improves repository-level code completion by addressing semantic misguidance, redundancy, and ambiguity, surpassing current baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing retrieval-augmented code completion systems heavily rely on superficial text similarity, causing semantic and structural issues and struggles with symbol ambiguity.

Method: Saracoder introduces a Hierarchical Feature Optimization module to refine semantic and structural relationships, and an External-Aware Identifier Disambiguator to resolve cross-file ambiguities.

Result: Saracoder significantly outperforms benchmarks like CrossCodeEval and RepoEval-Updated across various programming languages and models.

Conclusion: Systematic refinement across semantic, structural, and external symbol dimensions dramatically enhances repository-level code completion systems.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for repository-level code completion
commonly relies on superficial text similarity, leading to results plagued by
semantic misguidance, redundancy, and homogeneity, while also failing to
resolve external symbol ambiguity. To address these challenges, we introduce
Saracoder, a Hierarchical Feature-Optimized retrieval framework. Its core
Hierarchical Feature Optimization module systematically refines candidates by
distilling deep semantic relationships, pruning exact duplicates, assessing
structural similarity with a novel graph-based metric that weighs edits by
their topological importance, and reranking results to maximize both relevance
and diversity. Furthermore, an External-Aware Identifier Disambiguator module
accurately resolves cross-file symbol ambiguity via dependency analysis.
Extensive experiments on the challenging CrossCodeEval and RepoEval-Updated
benchmarks demonstrate that Saracoder significantly outperforms existing
baselines across multiple programming languages and models. Our work proves
that systematically refining retrieval results across multiple dimensions
provides a new paradigm for building more accurate and robust repository-level
code completion systems.

Motivation: Current AI coding assistants either provide single-point completions or require time-consuming context-switching due to chat-based editing, creating a suboptimal workflow.

Method: The authors propose Next Edit Prediction, curate relevant datasets, and train models via supervised fine-tuning. They also benchmark performance using fine-tuned and baseline models.

Result: Fine-tuned models for Next Edit Prediction showed promising results, with several novel findings improving the understanding of predicting sequential developer edits.

Conclusion: This study establishes a new paradigm of proactive interaction in coding environments by anticipating developer edits rather than waiting for explicit instructions, paving the way for future advancements.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has led to the
widespread adoption of AI-powered coding assistants integrated into a
development environment. On one hand, low-latency code completion offers
completion suggestions but is fundamentally constrained to the cursor's current
position. On the other hand, chat-based editing can perform complex
modifications, yet forces developers to stop their work, describe the intent in
natural language, which causes a context-switch away from the code. This
creates a suboptimal user experience, as neither paradigm proactively predicts
the developer's next edit in a sequence of related edits. To bridge this gap
and provide the seamless code edit suggestion, we introduce the task of Next
Edit Prediction, a novel task designed to infer developer intent from recent
interaction history to predict both the location and content of the subsequent
edit. Specifically, we curate a high-quality supervised fine-tuning dataset and
an evaluation benchmark for the Next Edit Prediction task. Then, we conduct
supervised fine-tuning on a series of models and performed a comprehensive
evaluation of both the fine-tuned models and other baseline models, yielding
several novel findings. This work lays the foundation for a new interaction
paradigm that proactively collaborate with developers by anticipating their
following action, rather than merely reacting to explicit instructions.

### [328] [On the synchronization between Hugging Face pre-trained language models and their upstream GitHub repository](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10157)
*Ajibode Adekunle,Abdul Ali Bangash,Bram Adams,Ahmed E. Hassan*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The study investigates coordination challenges in Pretrained Language Model (PTLM) development across GitHub and Hugging Face, identifying synchronization issues that affect model updates and consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the coordination challenges between GitHub upstream development and Hugging Face downstream distribution of PTLMs, ensuring models are consistent and up-to-date across platforms.

Method: Conducted a mixed-method study of 325 PTLM families from GitHub and Hugging Face, analyzing commit activities and synchronization patterns across platforms.

Result: Identified eight distinct synchronization patterns and structural disconnects, including isolated changes and repository abandonment, which can lead to outdated or inconsistent models.

Conclusion: Recognizing and addressing these synchronization patterns are vital for improving cross-platform oversight and traceability in PTLM release workflows.

Abstract: Pretrained language models (PTLMs) have advanced natural language processing
(NLP), enabling progress in tasks like text generation and translation. Like
software package management, PTLMs are trained using code and environment
scripts in upstream repositories (e.g., GitHub, GH) and distributed as variants
via downstream platforms like Hugging Face (HF). Coordinating development
between GH and HF poses challenges such as misaligned release timelines,
inconsistent versioning, and limited reuse of PTLM variants. We conducted a
mixed-method study of 325 PTLM families (904 HF variants) to examine how commit
activities are coordinated. Our analysis reveals that GH contributors typically
make changes related to specifying the version of the model, improving code
quality, performance optimization, and dependency management within the
training scripts, while HF contributors make changes related to improving model
descriptions, data set handling, and setup required for model inference.
Furthermore, to understand the synchronization aspects of commit activities
between GH and HF, we examined three dimensions of these activities -- lag
(delay), type of synchronization, and intensity -- which together yielded eight
distinct synchronization patterns. The prevalence of partially synchronized
patterns, such as Disperse synchronization and Sparse synchronization, reveals
structural disconnects in current cross-platform release practices. These
patterns often result in isolated changes -- where improvements or fixes made
on one platform are never replicated on the other -- and in some cases,
indicate an abandonment of one repository in favor of the other. Such
fragmentation risks exposing end users to incomplete, outdated, or behaviorally
inconsistent models. Hence, recognizing these synchronization patterns is
critical for improving oversight and traceability in PTLM release workflows.

### [329] [Bridging Solidity Evolution Gaps: An LLM-Enhanced Approach for Smart Contract Compilation Error Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10517)
*Likai Ye,Mengliang Li,Dehai Zhao,Jiamou Sun,Xiaoxue Ren*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper explores Solidity version evolution challenges, evaluates LLMs for solving compilation errors, and proposes SMCFIXER, a framework achieving high accuracy in addressing these issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the challenges posed by frequent updates in Solidity versions and the limitations of current tools in resolving version-based compilation errors.

Method: Conducted an empirical study to quantify the Solidity version change issues, evaluated multiple LLMs in addressing these problems, and designed a novel framework called SMCFIXER with three core mechanisms: code slicing, knowledge retrieval, and iterative patching.

Result: The study shows that 81.68% of contracts have cross-version compilation issues, with LLM capabilities dependent on prompt engineering and not highly efficient for semantic errors. SMCFIXER improves Solidity migration success rates by 24.24% over GPT-4o.

Conclusion: SMCFIXER outperforms baseline models by combining expert knowledge retrieval with iterative LLM-based repair, making it a valuable solution for Solidity version migration challenges.

Abstract: Solidity, the dominant smart contract language for Ethereum, has rapidly
evolved with frequent version updates to enhance security, functionality, and
developer experience. However, these continual changes introduce significant
challenges, particularly in compilation errors, code migration, and
maintenance. Therefore, we conduct an empirical study to investigate the
challenges in the Solidity version evolution and reveal that 81.68% of examined
contracts encounter errors when compiled across different versions, with 86.92%
of compilation errors.
  To mitigate these challenges, we conducted a systematic evaluation of large
language models (LLMs) for resolving Solidity compilation errors during version
migrations. Our empirical analysis across both open-source (LLaMA3, DeepSeek)
and closed-source (GPT-4o, GPT-3.5-turbo) LLMs reveals that although these
models exhibit error repair capabilities, their effectiveness diminishes
significantly for semantic-level issues and shows strong dependency on prompt
engineering strategies. This underscores the critical need for domain-specific
adaptation in developing reliable LLM-based repair systems for smart contracts.
  Building upon these insights, we introduce SMCFIXER, a novel framework that
systematically integrates expert knowledge retrieval with LLM-based repair
mechanisms for Solidity compilation error resolution. The architecture
comprises three core phases: (1) context-aware code slicing that extracts
relevant error information; (2) expert knowledge retrieval from official
documentation; and (3) iterative patch generation for Solidity migration.
Experimental validation across Solidity version migrations demonstrates our
approach's statistically significant 24.24% improvement over baseline GPT-4o on
real-world datasets, achieving near-perfect 96.97% accuracy.

*Souhaila Serbout,Diana Carolina Muñoz Hurtado,Hassan Atwi,Edoardo Riggio,Cesare Pautasso*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces EvoScat, an interactive visualization tool for analyzing large historical datasets related to software artifact evolution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Studying the evolution of software projects involves analyzing large datasets of historical changes, which can be challenging due to scale and complexity.

Method: EvoScat uses interactive density scatterplots and offers flexible configuration for visualizing and analyzing historical datasets of software artifacts.

Result: The tool showcases its capability with datasets of artifacts such as OpenAPI descriptions and GitHub workflows across repositories, enabling tailored analyses for different needs.

Conclusion: EvoScat facilitates scalable and configurable visualization, helping researchers gain insights into software evolution and artifact comparisons.

Abstract: Long lived software projects encompass a large number of artifacts, which
undergo many revisions throughout their history. Empirical software engineering
researchers studying software evolution gather and collect datasets with
millions of events, representing changes introduced to specific artifacts. In
this paper, we propose EvoScat, a tool that attempts addressing temporal
scalability through the usage of interactive density scatterplot to provide a
global overview of large historical datasets mined from open source
repositories in a single visualization. EvoScat intents to provide researchers
with a mean to produce scalable visualizations that can help them explore and
characterize evolution datasets, as well as comparing the histories of
individual artifacts, both in terms of 1) observing how rapidly different
artifacts age over multiple-year-long time spans 2) how often metrics
associated with each artifacts tend towards an improvement or worsening. The
paper shows how the tool can be tailored to specific analysis needs (pace of
change comparison, clone detection, freshness assessment) thanks to its support
for flexible configuration of history scaling and alignment along the time
axis, artifacts sorting and interactive color mapping, enabling the analysis of
millions of events obtained by mining the histories of tens of thousands of
software artifacts. We include in this paper a gallery showcasing datasets
gathering specific artifacts (OpenAPI descriptions, GitHub workflow
definitions) across multiple repositories, as well as diving into the history
of specific popular open source projects.

TL;DR: The paper unifies diverse analytical methods across unsupervised learning, network science, and neuroscience, addressing issues like circular analyses and redundant explanations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle the challenge of integrating and unifying diverse scientific data analyses, avoiding circular reasoning and fostering simplified interpretability.

Method: The study identifies equivalences uniting clustering, dimensionality reduction, network centrality, and dynamical methods, and provides an open-source toolbox for implementation.

Result: It demonstrates unified analytical frameworks and provides tools for simplifying the interpretation of structural and dynamical analyses in brain-imaging and network neuroscience.

Conclusion: The work advances scientific integration by offering a unified perspective and practical tools to streamline diverse analytical approaches in modern science.

Abstract: Modern scientific fields face the challenge of integrating a wealth of data,
analyses, and results. We recently showed that a neglect of this integration
can lead to circular analyses and redundant explanations. Here, we help advance
scientific integration by describing equivalences that unify diverse analyses
of datasets and networks. We describe equivalences across analyses of
clustering and dimensionality reduction, network centrality and dynamics, and
popular models in imaging and network neuroscience. First, we equate
foundational objectives across unsupervised learning and network science (from
k means to modularity to UMAP), fuse classic algorithms for optimizing these
objectives, and extend these objectives to simplify interpretations of popular
dimensionality reduction methods. Second, we equate basic measures of
connectional magnitude and dispersion with six measures of communication,
control, and diversity in network science and network neuroscience. Third, we
describe three semi-analytical vignettes that clarify and simplify the
interpretation of structural and dynamical analyses in imaging and network
neuroscience. We illustrate our results on example brain-imaging data and
provide abct, an open multi-language toolbox that implements our analyses.
Together, our study unifies diverse analyses across unsupervised learning,
network science, imaging neuroscience, and network neuroscience.

*Satrajit S. Ghosh*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: The paper advocates for transforming scientific infrastructure into a dynamic, AI-aligned ecosystem to overcome inefficiencies, boost reproducibility, and accelerate scientific discovery, using neuroscience as a case study.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional scientific infrastructure struggles with inefficiencies like data silos and lack of reproducibility. Advances in AI present an opportunity to modernize and optimize these systems, especially in neuroscience, where data growth and clinical relevance demand smarter infrastructure.

Method: The paper proposes a set of operational guidelines to develop decentralized, self-learning, and self-correcting AI-infused infrastructure, emphasizing global coordination, ethical practices, and equitable contributions beyond publications.

Result: Adopting dynamic AI-aligned infrastructure could eliminate inefficiencies, improve data interoperability and reproducibility, and enhance human-AI collaboration in neuroscience and other scientific domains.

Conclusion: Prioritizing intelligent infrastructure as a cornerstone for knowledge generation could accelerate scientific progress, translating neuroscientific insights into societal benefits, while serving as a model for other fields.

Abstract: Infrastructure shapes societies and scientific discovery. Traditional
scientific infrastructure, often static and fragmented, leads to issues like
data silos, lack of interoperability and reproducibility, and unsustainable
short-lived solutions. Our current technical inability and social reticence to
connect and coordinate scientific research and engineering leads to
inefficiencies and impedes progress. With AI technologies changing how we
interact with the world around us, there is an opportunity to transform
scientific processes. Neuroscience's exponential growth of multimodal and
multiscale data, and urgent clinical relevance demand an infrastructure itself
learns, coordinates, and improves. Using neuroscience as a stress test, this
perspective argues for a paradigm shift: infrastructure must evolve into a
dynamic, AI-aligned ecosystem to accelerate science. Building on several
existing principles for data, collective benefit, and digital repositories, I
recommend operational guidelines for implementing them to create this dynamic
ecosystem, aiming to foster a decentralized, self-learning, and self-correcting
system where humans and AI can collaborate seamlessly. Addressing the chronic
underfunding of scientific infrastructure, acknowledging diverse contributions
beyond publications, and coordinating global efforts are critical steps for
this transformation. By prioritizing an intelligent infrastructure as a central
scientific instrument for knowledge generation, we can overcome current
limitations, accelerate discovery, ensure reproducibility and ethical
practices, and ultimately translate neuroscientific understanding into tangible
societal benefits, setting a blueprint for other scientific domains.

*Christopher Pinier,Sonia Acuña Vargas,Mariia Steeghs-Turchina,Dora Matzke,Claire E. Stevenson,Michael D. Nunez*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: The paper explores whether large language models (LLMs) mimic human neurocognition in abstract reasoning, comparing LLMs' performance and neural representations to humans in an abstract reasoning task.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To examine if LLMs exhibit similarities with human neurocognition and brain mechanisms during abstract reasoning, and to explore shared principles between biological and artificial intelligence.

Method: The study tested eight open-source LLMs and human participants on an abstract-pattern-completion task, analyzing performance patterns and fixation-related potentials (FRPs) recorded with EEG.

Result: The largest LLMs (~70 billion parameters) showed human-like accuracy and difficulty profiles. Intermediate layers of LLMs clustered abstract pattern categories, with clustering strength correlating with task performance. Moderate correlations were found between LLM layers' representational geometries and human frontal FRPs.

Conclusion: LLMs may mirror certain aspects of human neurocognition in abstract reasoning, suggesting a shared representational space for abstract patterns between artificial and biological systems.

Abstract: This study investigates whether large language models (LLMs) mirror human
neurocognition during abstract reasoning. We compared the performance and
neural representations of human participants with those of eight open-source
LLMs on an abstract-pattern-completion task. We leveraged pattern type
differences in task performance and in fixation-related potentials (FRPs) as
recorded by electroencephalography (EEG) during the task. Our findings indicate
that only the largest tested LLMs (~70 billion parameters) achieve
human-comparable accuracy, with Qwen-2.5-72B and DeepSeek-R1-70B also showing
similarities with the human pattern-specific difficulty profile. Critically,
every LLM tested forms representations that distinctly cluster the abstract
pattern categories within their intermediate layers, although the strength of
this clustering scales with their performance on the task. Moderate positive
correlations were observed between the representational geometries of
task-optimal LLM layers and human frontal FRPs. These results consistently
diverged from comparisons with other EEG measures (response-locked ERPs and
resting EEG), suggesting a potential shared representational space for abstract
patterns. This indicates that LLMs might mirror human brain mechanisms in
abstract reasoning, offering preliminary evidence of shared principles between
biological and artificial intelligence.

### [334] [Excessive Screen Time is Associated with Mental Health Problems and ADHD in US Children and Adolescents: Physical Activity and Sleep as Parallel Mediators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10062)
*Ying Dai,Na Ouyang*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: Screen time exceeding 4 hours per day is associated with higher risks of anxiety, depression, behavior issues, and ADHD during the pandemic in children and adolescents, partly mediated by physical inactivity, irregular bedtime, and inadequate sleep.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the impact of excessive screen time on mental health and ADHD in children and adolescents during the pandemic and explore potential mediators like physical activity, sleep duration, and bedtime regularity.

Method: Researchers analyzed data from 50,231 US children aged 6–17 years using natural effect models and structural equation modeling to identify associations and mediators.

Result: Screen time ≥4 hours daily correlated with increased anxiety (aOR=1.45), depression (aOR=1.65), behavioral problems (aOR=1.17), and ADHD (aOR=1.21). Mediators like physical activity (30.2–39.3%) and bedtime irregularity (18.2–25.7%) significantly influenced these associations.

Conclusion: Excessive screen time worsens mental health and ADHD, partly through its impact on physical activity and sleep. Interventions focusing on improving physical activity, sleep duration, and bedtime regularity are essential.

Abstract: To examine associations between screen time and anxiety, depression, behavior
or conduct problems, and ADHD among children and adolescents during the
pandemic, and to assess whether physical activity, sleep duration, and bedtime
regularity mediate these associations. Data from 50231 US children and
adolescents aged 6 to 17 years in the 2020 to 2021 National Survey of Childrens
Health were analyzed. Exact natural effect models and structural equation
modeling assessed mediation by physical activity, short sleep duration, and
irregular bedtime. We found that daily screen time equal or more than 4 hours
was linked to higher risks of anxiety (aOR = 1.45, 95% CI 1.32, 1.58),
depression (aOR = 1.65, 95% CI 1.41, 1.93), behavior or conduct problems (aOR =
1.17, 95% CI 1.05, 1.30), and ADHD (aOR = 1.21, 95% CI 1.11, 1.33). Physical
activity accounted for 30.2% to 39.3% of the association, irregular bedtime for
18.2% to 25.7%, and short sleep duration for 2.77% to 7.34%. Excessive screen
time was associated with poorer mental health and ADHD, partly explained by
reduced physical activity, irregular bedtime, and insufficient sleep.
Interventions should promote physical activity, regular sleep routines, and
adequate sleep duration to effectively mitigate mental health issues and ADHD
among children and adolescents.

### [335] [Dynamical Alignment: A Principle for Adaptive Neural Computation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10064)
*Xia Chen*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'Dynamical Alignment,' showing that fixed neural structures can operate in different computational modes based on input dynamics rather than architecture. It reveals a critical mode transition that enhances performance in spiking neural networks (SNNs), offering insights into adaptive computation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To challenge the assumption that computational power of neural networks is solely determined by static architecture and explore how input dynamics can govern computational modes, particularly in spiking neural networks.

Method: Developing and studying an encoding framework where static inputs are transformed into dynamic trajectories to analyze computational modes (dissipative and expansive), governed by phase space dynamics and temporal alignment.

Result: The paper identifies two computational modes: a 'dissipative' mode for energy-efficient sparse coding, and an 'expansive' mode for enhanced representational power, allowing SNNs to equal or exceed traditional artificial networks.

Conclusion: This study highlights how dynamic input alignment can shape computations in fixed network architectures, providing a novel perspective for AI development by prioritizing adaptive and dynamic inputs over static architecture designs.

Abstract: The computational capabilities of a neural network are widely assumed to be
determined by its static architecture. Here we challenge this view by
establishing that a fixed neural structure can operate in fundamentally
different computational modes, driven not by its structure but by the temporal
dynamics of its input signals. We term this principle 'Dynamical Alignment'.
  Applying this principle offers a novel resolution to the long-standing
paradox of why brain-inspired spiking neural networks (SNNs) underperform. By
encoding static input into controllable dynamical trajectories, we uncover a
bimodal optimization landscape with a critical phase transition governed by
phase space volume dynamics. A 'dissipative' mode, driven by contracting
dynamics, achieves superior energy efficiency through sparse temporal codes. In
contrast, an 'expansive' mode, driven by expanding dynamics, unlocks the
representational power required for SNNs to match or even exceed their
artificial neural network counterparts on diverse tasks, including
classification, reinforcement learning, and cognitive integration.
  We find this computational advantage emerges from a timescale alignment
between input dynamics and neuronal integration. This principle, in turn,
offers a unified, computable perspective on long-observed dualities in
neuroscience, from stability-plasticity dilemma to segregation-integration
dynamic. It demonstrates that computation in both biological and artificial
systems can be dynamically sculpted by 'software' on fixed 'hardware', pointing
toward a potential paradigm shift for AI research: away from designing complex
static architectures and toward mastering adaptive, dynamic computation
principles.

### [336] [Linking GFAP Levels to Speech Anomalies in Acute Brain Injury: A Simulation Based Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10130)
*Shamaley Aravinthan,Bin Hu*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: The paper explores the relationship between glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) levels and acute speech anomalies following brain injury, using a simulated patient cohort and machine learning models to demonstrate potential diagnostic applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether GFAP, a biomarker for brain injuries, can provide insights into acute speech disruptions, with an aim to improve early diagnosis and triage strategies.

Method: The study used a simulated cohort of 200 virtual patients with varying lesion specifics, onset times, and severities. GFAP kinetics and lesion-specific speech anomalies were modeled. Ensemble machine-learning models were applied, and causal relationships were assessed through statistical inference methods to analyze associations.

Result: GFAP levels correlated with speech anomaly severity (Spearman rho = 0.48), with strong correlations in cortical lesions. Machine learning achieved an AUC of 0.86 with combined GFAP and voice data. GFAP elevation independently increased probabilities of speech anomalies by 32-35%.

Conclusion: The findings establish a simulated link between GFAP and speech anomalies, suggesting potential for combined biochemical-voice diagnostics to enhance early brain injury evaluation. However, clinical validation is needed with real-world data.

Abstract: Background: Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) is a biomarker for
intracerebral hemorrhage and traumatic brain injury, but its link to acute
speech disruption is untested. Speech anomalies often emerge early after
injury, enabling rapid triage.
  Methods: We simulated a cohort of 200 virtual patients stratified by lesion
location, onset time, and severity. GFAP kinetics followed published
trajectories; speech anomalies were generated from lesion-specific
neurophysiological mappings. Ensemble machine-learning models used GFAP,
speech, and lesion features; robustness was tested under noise, delays, and
label dropout. Causal inference (inverse probability of treatment weighting and
targeted maximum likelihood estimation) estimated directional associations
between GFAP elevation and speech severity.
  Findings: GFAP correlated with simulated speech anomaly severity (Spearman
rho = 0.48), strongest for cortical lesions (rho = 0.55). Voice anomalies
preceded detectable GFAP rise by a median of 42 minutes in cortical injury.
Classifier area under the curve values were 0.74 (GFAP only), 0.78 (voice
only), and 0.86 for the fused multimodal model, which showed higher sensitivity
in mild or ambiguous cases. Causal estimates indicated higher GFAP increased
the modeled probability of moderate-to-severe speech anomalies by 32 to 35
percent, independent of lesion site and onset time.
  Conclusion: These results support a link between GFAP elevation and speech
anomalies in acute brain injury and suggest integrated biochemical-voice
diagnostics could improve early triage, especially for cortical injury.
Findings are simulation-based and require validation in prospective clinical
studies with synchronized GFAP assays and speech recordings.

TL;DR: The Algonauts 2025 Challenge focused on predicting fMRI brain responses while participants watched 80 hours of movies; winners predicted brain activity for unseen films.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge aimed to advance computational neuroscience by testing brain-prediction models with complex, multimodal movie stimuli.

Method: Competing models had to predict whole-brain fMRI activity in 1,000 parcels for participants viewing movies, using 65 hours of training data and additional validation datasets.

Result: The challenge revealed top-performing models capable of predicting brain activity, with winners excelling in out-of-distribution film predictions.

Conclusion: The competition highlights progress in brain decoding and sets a foundation for exploring more methods in multimodal neuroimaging and brain encoding research.

Abstract: The Algonauts 2025 Challenge just wrapped up a few weeks ago. It is a
biennial challenge in computational neuroscience in which teams attempt to
build models that predict human brain activity from carefully curated stimuli.
Previous editions (2019, 2021, 2023) focused on still images and short videos;
the 2025 edition, which concluded last month (late July), pushed the field
further by using long, multimodal movies. Teams were tasked with predicting
fMRI responses across 1,000 whole-brain parcels across four participants in the
dataset who were scanned while watching nearly 80 hours of naturalistic movie
stimuli. These recordings came from the CNeuroMod project and included 65 hours
of training data, about 55 hours of Friends (seasons 1-6) plus four feature
films (The Bourne Supremacy, Hidden Figures, Life, and The Wolf of Wall
Street). The remaining data were used for validation: Season 7 of Friends for
in-distribution tests, and the final winners for the Challenge were those who
could best predict brain activity for six films in their held-out
out-of-distribution (OOD) set. The winners were just announced and the top team
reports are now publicly available. As members of the MedARC team which placed
4th in the competition, we reflect on the approaches that worked, what they
reveal about the current state of brain encoding, and what might come next.

*Jyotishka Datta,Nicholas G. Polson*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper extends prediction-powered inference (PPI) to handle informative labeling using inverse probability weighting (IPW), integrating design-based survey sampling ideas into prediction-assisted inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to improve prediction-powered inference (PPI) for situations with informative labeling, addressing scenarios where labeling probabilities vary across units.

Method: The authors substitute PPI’s unweighted bias-correction term with an inverse probability weighted (IPW) version, using classical Horvitz--Thompson or Hájek formulations to manage varying labeling probabilities.

Result: Simulations show that IPW-adjusted PPI performs effectively even when inclusion probabilities are estimated instead of known, preserving nominal coverage and variance-reduction benefits.

Conclusion: This approach successfully unifies survey sampling methodologies with modern prediction-assisted inference, producing valid estimators for cases with uneven labeling probabilities.

Abstract: Prediction-powered inference (PPI) is a recent framework for valid
statistical inference with partially labeled data, combining model-based
predictions on a large unlabeled set with bias correction from a smaller
labeled subset. We show that PPI can be extended to handle informative labeling
by replacing its unweighted bias-correction term with an inverse probability
weighted (IPW) version, using the classical Horvitz--Thompson or H\'ajek forms.
This connection unites design-based survey sampling ideas with modern
prediction-assisted inference, yielding estimators that remain valid when
labeling probabilities vary across units. We consider the common setting where
the inclusion probabilities are not known but estimated from a correctly
specified model. In simulations, the performance of IPW-adjusted PPI with
estimated propensities closely matches the known-probability case, retaining
both nominal coverage and the variance-reduction benefits of PPI.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper adapts machine unlearning to dynamic online environments, proposing efficient algorithms with reduced memory and computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current machine unlearning assumes static i.i.d training setups, which are not realistic for modern ML pipelines that operate on dynamic, continuous data streams.

Method: The paper introduces regret, sample complexity, and deletion capacity metrics for online unlearning, tightens regret bounds, and replaces Hessian inversion with an online L-BFGS optimization approach.

Result: Regret bounds are improved to logarithmic $
abla{O}(
ln{T})$, eliminating expensive Hessian inversions and reducing memory footprint.

Conclusion: Efficient unlearning approaches are proposed for online ML, extending model lifespan and improving adaptability without costly retraining.

Abstract: Machine unlearning work assumes a static, i.i.d training environment that
doesn't truly exist. Modern ML pipelines need to learn, unlearn, and predict
continuously on production streams of data. We translate the notion of the
batch unlearning scenario to the online setting using notions of regret, sample
complexity, and deletion capacity. We further tighten regret bounds to a
logarithmic $\mathcal{O}(\ln{T})$, a first for a machine unlearning algorithm.
And we swap out an expensive Hessian inversion with online variant of L-BFGS
optimization, removing a memory footprint that scales linearly with time. Such
changes extend the lifespan of an ML model before expensive retraining, making
for a more efficient unlearning process.

TL;DR: The paper establishes tight, non-asymptotic bounds for generalized first-order iterative algorithms with Gaussian matrices, linking their behavior to a conditionally Gaussian process.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Provide a unified and tight analysis framework for generalized iterative algorithms, addressing limitations in existing AMP proofs and avoiding asymptotic assumptions.

Method: Construct a coupling between iterates of first-order methods and a conditionally Gaussian process through state evolution recursion, and compare them directly.

Result: Obtains dimension-free bounds under mild conditions and demonstrates their sharpness using Wasserstein distance lower bounds.

Conclusion: Unified AMP theory for Gaussian matrices presented, relying on direct comparison and avoiding separability or asymptotics.

Abstract: We establish non-asymptotic bounds on the finite-sample behavior of
generalized first-order iterative algorithms -- including gradient-based
optimization methods and approximate message passing (AMP) -- with Gaussian
data matrices and full-memory, non-separable nonlinearities. The central result
constructs an explicit coupling between the iterates of a generalized
first-order method and a conditionally Gaussian process whose covariance
evolves deterministically via a finite-dimensional state evolution recursion.
This coupling yields tight, dimension-free bounds under mild Lipschitz and
moment-matching conditions. Our analysis departs from classical inductive AMP
proofs by employing a direct comparison between the generalized first-order
method and the conditionally Gaussian comparison process. This approach
provides a unified derivation of AMP theory for Gaussian matrices without
relying on separability or asymptotics. A complementary lower bound on the
Wasserstein distance demonstrates the sharpness of our upper bounds.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches for Differentially Private Stochastic PCA either require an excessively large sample size or suffer from poor utility due to added DP noise, particularly for estimating subspaces of dimension k > 1.

Method: The authors develop an algorithm that estimates the top k eigenvectors while preserving differential privacy. They achieve this by addressing both sample size scalability and noise reduction issues.

Result: The algorithm provides near-optimal statistical error for estimating the top eigenvectors with sample size scaling as O(d). The method is shown to outperform existing baselines in both theory and experiments.

Conclusion: This work generalizes Differentially Private PCA methods to subspaces beyond k=1, achieving better trade-offs and matching theoretical lower bounds up to a factor of k. Its practical advantages are demonstrated experimentally.

Abstract: Given $n$ i.i.d. random matrices $A_i \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times d}$ that share
a common expectation $\Sigma$, the objective of Differentially Private
Stochastic PCA is to identify a subspace of dimension $k$ that captures the
largest variance directions of $\Sigma$, while preserving differential privacy
(DP) of each individual $A_i$. Existing methods either (i) require the sample
size $n$ to scale super-linearly with dimension $d$, even under Gaussian
assumptions on the $A_i$, or (ii) introduce excessive noise for DP even when
the intrinsic randomness within $A_i$ is small. Liu et al. (2022a) addressed
these issues for sub-Gaussian data but only for estimating the top eigenvector
($k=1$) using their algorithm DP-PCA. We propose the first algorithm capable of
estimating the top $k$ eigenvectors for arbitrary $k \leq d$, whilst overcoming
both limitations above. For $k=1$ our algorithm matches the utility guarantees
of DP-PCA, achieving near-optimal statistical error even when $n =
\tilde{\!O}(d)$. We further provide a lower bound for general $k > 1$, matching
our upper bound up to a factor of $k$, and experimentally demonstrate the
advantages of our algorithm over comparable baselines.

*Mary Chriselda Antony Oliver,Emmanuel Hartman,Tom Needham*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper extends the Conic Gromov-Wasserstein (CGW) distance, a method for comparing probability densities in different structures, to broader scenarios and provides new theoretical insights and a scalable solution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve the Gromov-Wasserstein (GW) optimal transport framework, making it applicable to cases involving unequal measures, robustness to outliers, and generalizing beyond metric measure spaces.

Method: The authors reformulate CGW in terms of semi-couplings, extend it beyond metric spaces to networks and hypernetworks, and propose a scalable block coordinate ascent algorithm for computation.

Result: They establish fundamental properties of CGW, such as scaling behavior, variational convergence, and robustness. Additionally, they provide theoretical bounds and validate their computational approach through synthetic and real-world experiments.

Conclusion: The CGW metric is shown to be a robust, scalable, and generalized tool for comparing complex data structures, furthering its utility in analyzing structured datasets.

Abstract: The Gromov-Wasserstein (GW) variant of optimal transport, designed to compare
probability densities defined over distinct metric spaces, has emerged as an
important tool for the analysis of data with complex structure, such as
ensembles of point clouds or networks. To overcome certain limitations, such as
the restriction to comparisons of measures of equal mass and sensitivity to
outliers, several unbalanced or partial transport relaxations of the GW
distance have been introduced in the recent literature. This paper is concerned
with the Conic Gromov-Wasserstein (CGW) distance introduced by
S\'{e}journ\'{e}, Vialard, and Peyr\'{e}. We provide a novel formulation in
terms of semi-couplings, and extend the framework beyond the metric measure
space setting, to compare more general network and hypernetwork structures.
With this new formulation, we establish several fundamental properties of the
CGW metric, including its scaling behavior under dilation, variational
convergence in the limit of volume growth constraints, and comparison bounds
with established optimal transport metrics. We further derive quantitative
bounds that characterize the robustness of the CGW metric to perturbations in
the underlying measures. The hypernetwork formulation of CGW admits a simple
and provably convergent block coordinate ascent algorithm for its estimation,
and we demonstrate the computational tractability and scalability of our
approach through experiments on synthetic and real-world high-dimensional and
structured datasets.

### [343] [Memorisation and forgetting in a learning Hopfield neural network: bifurcation mechanisms, attractors and basins](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10765)
*Adam E. Essex,Natalia B. Janson,Rachel A. Norris,Alexander G. Balanov*

Main category: math.DS

TL;DR: This paper investigates memory formation and catastrophic forgetting in an 81-neuron Hopfield network undergoing Hebbian learning, uncovering mechanisms through bifurcations and attractor dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of understanding how artificial neural networks (ANNs) process information, form memories, and develop issues like spurious memories and catastrophic forgetting.

Method: The authors analyze memory formation mechanisms in an 81-neuron Hopfield network using bifurcation theory, focusing on how stimuli alter connection weights to create or destroy attractors and their basins.

Result: They identify pitchfork and saddle-node bifurcations as the processes behind memory formation and forgetting, associating attractor basins with true or spurious memories and stable manifolds with boundary representations.

Conclusion: The comprehensive approach reveals that memory formation and forgetting in ANNs stem from the same fundamental mechanism, and the method is universally applicable to recurrent neural networks. The findings could improve strategies for addressing ANN flaws.

Abstract: Despite explosive expansion of artificial intelligence based on artificial
neural networks (ANNs), these are employed as "black boxes'', as it is unclear
how, during learning, they form memories or develop unwanted features,
including spurious memories and catastrophic forgetting. Much research is
available on isolated aspects of learning ANNs, but due to their high
dimensionality and non-linearity, their comprehensive analysis remains a
challenge. In ANNs, knowledge is thought to reside in connection weights or in
attractor basins, but these two paradigms are not linked explicitly. Here we
comprehensively analyse mechanisms of memory formation in an 81-neuron Hopfield
network undergoing Hebbian learning by revealing bifurcations leading to
formation and destruction of attractors and their basin boundaries. We show
that, by affecting evolution of connection weights, the applied stimuli induce
a pitchfork and then a cascade of saddle-node bifurcations creating new
attractors with their basins that can code true or spurious memories, and an
abrupt disappearance of old memories (catastrophic forgetting). With successful
learning, new categories are represented by the basins of newly born point
attractors, and their boundaries by the stable manifolds of new saddles. With
this, memorisation and forgetting represent two manifestations of the same
mechanism. Our strategy to analyse high-dimensional learning ANNs is universal
and applicable to recurrent ANNs of any form. The demonstrated mechanisms of
memory formation and of catastrophic forgetting shed light on the operation of
a wider class of recurrent ANNs and could aid the development of approaches to
mitigate their flaws.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the complexity and experimental uncertainty in biological systems, and make Bayesian optimization more accessible to practitioners without a strong statistical background.

Method: The review provides an intuitive and practical framework for Bayesian optimization while identifying open challenges and application areas in bioprocess engineering and machine learning.

Result: The review highlights the key features and benefits of Bayesian optimization and identifies challenges in biological systems that require specialized extensions to classical methods.

Conclusion: Bayesian optimization is promising for bioprocess engineering, but it needs specific adaptations and better accessibility for practitioners to unlock its full potential in experimental sciences.

Abstract: Bayesian optimization has become widely popular across various experimental
sciences due to its favorable attributes: it can handle noisy data, perform
well with relatively small datasets, and provide adaptive suggestions for
sequential experimentation. While still in its infancy, Bayesian optimization
has recently gained traction in bioprocess engineering. However,
experimentation with biological systems is highly complex and the resulting
experimental uncertainty requires specific extensions to classical Bayesian
optimization. Moreover, current literature often targets readers with a strong
statistical background, limiting its accessibility for practitioners.
  In light of these developments, this review has two aims: first, to provide
an intuitive and practical introduction to Bayesian optimization; and second,
to outline promising application areas and open algorithmic challenges, thereby
highlighting opportunities for future research in machine learning.

TL;DR: The paper investigates the robustness and imperceptibility of adversarial attacks on ASR models and explores potential defense mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and improve the robustness and perception-related aspects of adversarial attacks on Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems and propose effective defense mechanisms.

Method: The study involves verifying the robustness of current adversarial attacks on ASR models, optimizing them for improved imperceptibility by relaxing suppression objectives, and testing low-pass filter defenses.

Result: The findings show that relaxing the optimization objective improves attack imperceptibility and a low-pass filter can act as a potential defense.

Conclusion: Adversarial attacks on ASR can be made more imperceptible by adjusting their objectives, and low-pass filters may serve as an effective line of defense against such attacks.

Abstract: Currently, Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) models are deployed in an
extensive range of applications. However, recent studies have demonstrated the
possibility of adversarial attack on these models which could potentially
suppress or disrupt model output. We investigate and verify the robustness of
these attacks and explore if it is possible to increase their imperceptibility.
We additionally find that by relaxing the optimisation objective from complete
suppression to partial suppression, we can further decrease the
imperceptibility of the attack. We also explore possible defences against these
attacks and show a low-pass filter defence could potentially serve as an
effective defence.

*Chenggang Chen,Zhiyu Yang*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper benchmarks 11 deep learning models in bioacoustic tasks, revealing that fine-tuning and dimensionality reduction improve performance but pose challenges in separating background sounds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the efficacy and limitations of audio-pretrained deep learning models in bioacoustic applications, focusing on fine-tuning and embedding quality.

Method: The study evaluates 11 deep learning models' embeddings by reducing their dimensionality and clustering them, comparing models with and without fine-tuning.

Result: Without fine-tuning, audio-pretrained models perform worse than fine-tuned AlexNet, struggle to separate labeled sounds from background noise, yet ResNet achieves this. Fine-tuned models show performance improvement when fewer background sounds are included.

Conclusion: Fine-tuning is crucial for audio-pretrained deep learning models in bioacoustics, and embedding quality must be verified after this process. ResNet shows promise in handling background noise better.

Abstract: Bioacoustics, the study of animal sounds, offers a non-invasive method to
monitor ecosystems. Extracting embeddings from audio-pretrained deep learning
(DL) models without fine-tuning has become popular for obtaining bioacoustic
features for tasks. However, a recent benchmark study reveals that while
fine-tuned audio-pretrained VGG and transformer models achieve state-of-the-art
performance in some tasks, they fail in others. This study benchmarks 11 DL
models on the same tasks by reducing their learned embeddings' dimensionality
and evaluating them through clustering. We found that audio-pretrained DL
models 1) without fine-tuning even underperform fine-tuned AlexNet, 2) both
with and without fine-tuning fail to separate the background from labeled
sounds, but ResNet does, and 3) outperform other models when fewer background
sounds are included during fine-tuning. This study underscores the necessity of
fine-tuning audio-pretrained models and checking the embeddings after
fine-tuning. Our codes are available:

TL;DR: The paper proposes PuttNet, a neural network for reducing artifacts caused by speech enhancement models, and shows its effectiveness in improving speech quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Speech enhancement models remove noise from noisy speech but often introduce artifacts, which degrade audio quality, motivating the need for better post-processing methods.

Method: The authors introduce PuttNet, a post-processing neural network, and propose an alternating mechanism between speech enhancement models and PuttNet for better results.

Result: The proposed method achieves better perceptual quality scores (PESQ), speech intelligibility scores (STOI), and noise intrusiveness scores (CBAK) compared to using only speech enhancement models.

Conclusion: Alternating between speech enhancement models and PuttNet improves overall speech quality and avoids the pitfalls of repeated use of a single model, backed by graphical analysis.

Abstract: Speech enhancement using artificial neural networks aims to remove noise from
noisy speech signals while preserving the speech content. However, speech
enhancement networks often introduce distortions to the speech signal, referred
to as artifacts, which can degrade audio quality. In this work, we propose a
post-processing neural network designed to mitigate artifacts introduced by
speech enhancement models. Inspired by the analogy of making a `Putt' after an
`Approach' in golf, we name our model PuttNet. We demonstrate that alternating
between a speech enhancement model and the proposed Putt model leads to
improved speech quality, as measured by perceptual quality scores (PESQ),
objective intelligibility (STOI), and background noise intrusiveness (CBAK)
scores. Furthermore, we illustrate with graphical analysis why this alternating
Approach outperforms repeated application of either model alone.

TL;DR: The paper addresses cross-domain performance issues in deepfake speech detection by introducing the Fake Speech Wild (FSW) dataset from social media and improving detection methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deepfake speech poses real-world risks on social media, yet existing detection methods falter in diverse, non-public datasets.

Method: The authors created the FSW dataset, employed benchmarks using advanced SSL-based countermeasures (CMs), and explored data augmentation strategies.

Result: Augmenting public datasets with FSW significantly reduced the average equal error rate (EER) to 3.54%, enhancing detection robustness.

Conclusion: Combining public datasets with the FSW demonstrates improved performance and robustness in real-world deepfake speech detection scenarios.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of speech generation technology has led to the
widespread proliferation of deepfake speech across social media platforms.
While deepfake audio countermeasures (CMs) achieve promising results on public
datasets, their performance degrades significantly in cross-domain scenarios.
To advance CMs for real-world deepfake detection, we first propose the Fake
Speech Wild (FSW) dataset, which includes 254 hours of real and deepfake audio
from four different media platforms, focusing on social media. As CMs, we
establish a benchmark using public datasets and advanced selfsupervised
learning (SSL)-based CMs to evaluate current CMs in real-world scenarios. We
also assess the effectiveness of data augmentation strategies in enhancing CM
robustness for detecting deepfake speech on social media. Finally, by
augmenting public datasets and incorporating the FSW training set, we
significantly advanced real-world deepfake audio detection performance,
achieving an average equal error rate (EER) of 3.54% across all evaluation
sets.

Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: The study introduces an explainable multimodal framework for fact-checking, utilizing content, social media, and graph-based features to deliver interpretable insights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid spread of misinformation coupled with limited effectiveness of simple labeling systems necessitates a more robust and explainable method for evaluating content trustworthiness.

Method: The framework comprises a misinformation classifier enhanced with explainability techniques, leveraging multimodal input sources like text content, social media dynamics, and graph-based features.

Result: Experiments revealed that using multimodal data improves classification accuracy, and a new evaluation protocol showed the framework’s ability to generate human-understandable, trustworthy explanations.

Conclusion: The proposed framework offers an effective approach to combating misinformation through improved prediction capability and clear, interpretable explanations, fostering trust and understanding.

Abstract: The global spread of misinformation and concerns about content
trustworthiness have driven the development of automated fact-checking systems.
Since false information often exploits social media dynamics such as "likes"
and user networks to amplify its reach, effective solutions must go beyond
content analysis to incorporate these factors. Moreover, simply labelling
content as false can be ineffective or even reinforce biases such as automation
and confirmation bias. This paper proposes an explainable framework that
combines content, social media, and graph-based features to enhance
fact-checking. It integrates a misinformation classifier with explainability
techniques to deliver complete and interpretable insights supporting
classification decisions. Experiments demonstrate that multimodal information
improves performance over single modalities, with evaluations conducted on
datasets in English, Spanish, and Portuguese. Additionally, the framework's
explanations were assessed for interpretability, trustworthiness, and
robustness with a novel protocol, showing that it effectively generates
human-understandable justifications for its predictions.

TL;DR: This study introduces SABIA, a hybrid deep learning model for classifying opioid-related behaviors on social media, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding opioid misuse on social media is hindered by informal language, slang, and complex communication patterns.

Method: The authors developed a hybrid BERT-BiLSTM-3CNN deep learning model (SABIA). They processed Reddit data: preprocessing, representation, fine-tuning, and classification into five categories.

Result: SABIA outperformed baseline models, improving accuracy by 9.30%, and demonstrated robustness compared to seven previous studies.

Conclusion: The study highlights the efficacy of hybrid deep learning models like SABIA in detecting opioid-related behaviors, aiding public health initiatives.

Abstract: Social media platforms have become valuable tools for understanding public
health challenges by offering insights into patient behaviors, medication use,
and mental health issues. However, analyzing such data remains difficult due to
the prevalence of informal language, slang, and coded communication, which can
obscure the detection of opioid misuse. This study addresses the issue of
opioid-related user behavior on social media, including informal expressions,
slang terms, and misspelled or coded language. We analyzed the existing
Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) technique and
developed a BERT-BiLSTM-3CNN hybrid deep learning model, named SABIA, to create
a single-task classifier that effectively captures the features of the target
dataset. The SABIA model demonstrated strong capabilities in capturing
semantics and contextual information. The proposed approach includes: (1) data
preprocessing, (2) data representation using the SABIA model, (3) a fine-tuning
phase, and (4) classification of user behavior into five categories. A new
dataset was constructed from Reddit posts, identifying opioid user behaviors
across five classes: Dealers, Active Opioid Users, Recovered Users,
Prescription Users, and Non-Users, supported by detailed annotation guidelines.
Experiments were conducted using supervised learning. Results show that SABIA
achieved benchmark performance, outperforming the baseline (Logistic
Regression, LR = 0.86) and improving accuracy by 9.30%. Comparisons with seven
previous studies confirmed its effectiveness and robustness. This study
demonstrates the potential of hybrid deep learning models for detecting complex
opioid-related behaviors on social media, supporting public health monitoring
and intervention efforts.

*Birgit Nierula,Mustafa Tevfik Lafci,Anna Melnik,Mert Akgül,Farelle Toumaleu Siewe,Sebastian Bosse*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: This paper investigates physiological and perceptual responses to personal space violations by virtual avatars, focusing on effects of facial expressions and interaction phases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to fill a gap in understanding phase-specific physiological responses and the role of facial expressions in personal space violations, particularly in VR environments.

Method: Sixteen participants underwent experiments in a 2x2 factorial design manipulating personal space (intrusion vs. respect) and facial expressions (neutral vs. angry), while physiological markers (SCR, HRV) and discomfort ratings were recorded.

Result: SCR response was higher during the standing phase of personal space violations, angry facial expressions reduced HRV and increased discomfort ratings, but did not alter SCR responses.

Conclusion: Distinct physiological measures reflect different aspects of spatial and threat responses, offering insights for enhancing social behavior modeling in VR and optimizing avatar interactions.

Abstract: Proxemics, the study of spatial behavior, is fundamental to social
interaction and increasingly relevant for virtual reality (VR) applications.
While previous research has established that users respond to personal space
violations in VR similarly as in real-world settings, phase-specific
physiological responses and the modulating effects of facial expressions remain
understudied. We investigated physiological and subjective responses to
personal space violations by virtual avatars, to understand how threatening
facial expressions and interaction phases (approach vs. standing) influence
these responses. Sixteen participants experienced a 2x2 factorial design
manipulating Personal Space (intrusion vs. respect) and Facial Expression
(neutral vs. angry) while we recorded skin conductance response (SCR), heart
rate variability (HRV), and discomfort ratings. Personal space boundaries were
individually calibrated using a stop-distance procedure. Results show that SCR
responses are significantly higher during the standing phase compared to the
approach phase when personal space was violated, indicating that prolonged
proximity within personal space boundaries is more physiologically arousing
than the approach itself. Angry facial expressions significantly reduced HRV,
reflecting decreased parasympathetic activity, and increased discomfort
ratings, but did not amplify SCR responses. These findings demonstrate that
different physiological modalities capture distinct aspects of proxemic
responses: SCR primarily reflects spatial boundary violations, while HRV
responds to facial threat cues. Our results provide insights for developing
comprehensive multi-modal assessments of social behavior in virtual
environments and inform the design of more realistic avatar interactions.

Method: A formative diary study with 16 professionals was conducted, followed by the design of ParseJargon. A controlled experiment and a follow-up field study were executed to compare its effectiveness and validate real-world applicability.

Result: Personalized jargon support via ParseJargon significantly improved comprehension and engagement, while general-purpose support negatively impacted engagement. Validation in real-world scenarios showed usability and practical value.

Conclusion: Personalized jargon management systems, such as ParseJargon, have notable potential in improving interdisciplinary and educational communications, with important implications for designing personalized tools.

Abstract: Effective interdisciplinary communication is frequently hindered by
domain-specific jargon. To explore the jargon barriers in-depth, we conducted a
formative diary study with 16 professionals, revealing critical limitations in
current jargon-management strategies during workplace meetings. Based on these
insights, we designed ParseJargon, an interactive LLM-powered system providing
real-time personalized jargon identification and explanations tailored to
users' individual backgrounds. A controlled experiment comparing ParseJargon
against baseline (no support) and general-purpose (non-personalized) conditions
demonstrated that personalized jargon support significantly enhanced
participants' comprehension, engagement, and appreciation of colleagues' work,
whereas general-purpose support negatively affected engagement. A follow-up
field study validated ParseJargon's usability and practical value in real-time
meetings, highlighting both opportunities and limitations for real-world
deployment. Our findings contribute insights into designing personalized jargon
support tools, with implications for broader interdisciplinary and educational
applications.

Motivation: The motivation is to leverage pre-trained large-scale foundation models for generalized neural state estimation, bypassing the need for patient-specific training.

Method: The authors train a foundation model on 24-day chronic deep brain stimulation data and use an optimized loss function to mitigate frequency bias in electrophysiological data.

Result: The model effectively decodes Parkinson's disease symptoms using leave-one-subject-out cross-validation without requiring individualized training.

Conclusion: The research demonstrates the potential of foundation models in enabling generalized and scalable neural decoding capacities for therapeutic applications.

Abstract: Neural decoding of pathological and physiological states can enable

present an optimized pre-training loss function for neural electrophysiological

functions due to the 1-over-f power law. We show in a downstream task the
decoding of Parkinson's disease symptoms with leave-one-subject-out

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between imprecise natural language prompts and the complex, precise control of knobs or sliders, facilitating intuitive yet highly adjustable task control.

Method: The authors propose an MCP server combined with unique prompt design criteria and utilize the Claude LLM to process natural language for generating, debugging, and managing OSC messages.

Result: Their system successfully demonstrates 14 examples of practical QA use cases, showing effective natural language-driven OSC message generation and management while enhancing human-machine interaction.

Conclusion: MCP2OSC empowers human creativity and offers a new perspective on integrating LLMs into multimedia device control, suggesting its potential as a universal control mechanism.

Abstract: Text prompts enable intuitive content creation but may fall short in
achieving high precision for intricate tasks; knob or slider controls offer
precise adjustments at the cost of increased complexity. To address the gap
between knobs and prompts, a new MCP (Model Context Protocol) server and a
unique set of prompt design criteria are presented to enable exploring
parametric OSC (OpenSoundControl) control by natural language prompts.
Demonstrated by 14 practical QA examples with best practices and the
generalized prompt templates, this study finds Claude integrated with the
MCP2OSC server effective in generating OSC messages by natural language,
interpreting, searching, and visualizing OSC messages, validating and debugging
OSC messages, and managing OSC address patterns. MCP2OSC enhances human-machine

electrodermal signals of 30 participants exposed to short emotion-evoking
videos. Feature selection was performed using the Terminating-Random
Experiments (T-Rex) method, which performs variable selection systematically
controlling a user-defined target False Discovery Rate. Remarkably, among all
candidate features, only two electrodermal-derived features exhibited
reproducible and statistically significant associations with arousal, achieving
a 100\% confirmation rate. These results highlight the necessity of rigorous
reproducibility assessments in physiological features selection, an aspect
often overlooked in Affective Computing. Our approach is particularly promising
for applications in safety-critical environments requiring trustworthy and
reliable white box models, such as mental disorder recognition and human-robot
interaction systems.

Result: The offered lecture notes enable understanding of DL’s applications in quantum fields and offer strategies to mitigate its risks and limitations.

Conclusion: Machine Learning, particularly DL, is transformative but must be applied thoughtfully and responsibly in quantum sciences to maintain rigor while advancing research.

Abstract: Scientific progress is tightly coupled to the emergence of new research
tools. Today, machine learning (ML)-especially deep learning (DL)-has become a
transformative instrument for quantum science and technology. Owing to the
intrinsic complexity of quantum systems, DL enables efficient exploration of
large parameter spaces, extraction of patterns from experimental data, and
data-driven guidance for research directions. These capabilities already
support tasks such as refining quantum control protocols and accelerating the
discovery of materials with targeted quantum properties, making ML/DL literacy
an essential skill for the next generation of quantum scientists. At the same
time, DL's power brings risks: models can overfit noisy data, obscure causal
structure, and yield results with limited physical interpretability.
Recognizing these limitations and deploying mitigation strategies is crucial
for scientific rigor. These lecture notes provide a comprehensive,
graduate-level introduction to DL for quantum applications, combining
conceptual exposition with hands-on examples. Organized as a progressive
sequence, they aim to equip readers to decide when and how to apply DL
effectively, to understand its practical constraints, and to adapt AI methods
responsibly to problems across quantum physics, chemistry, and engineering.

### [358] [Mitigating Exponential Mixed Frequency Growth through Frequency Selection and Dimensional Separation in Quantum Machine Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10533)
*Michael Poppel,David Bucher,Maximilian Zorn,Nico Kraus,Jonas Stein,Claudia Linnhoff-Popien*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper investigates why quantum machine learning models often fail at regression tasks and proposes methods to reduce computational complexity and improve training efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantum computing promises computational speedups, and quantum machine learning has emerged to leverage this potential, particularly using angle encoding techniques for function approximation. However, practical challenges such as training failures persist.

Method: The researchers performed two controlled experiments analyzing quantum models and proposed two techniques—frequency selection and dimensional separation—to address parameter growth issues.

Result: Using the new techniques, they successfully fit challenging functions, reduced parameter requirements, and demonstrated their approach on both simulated environments and real quantum hardware.

Conclusion: The proposed methods expand the range of solvable problems for quantum machine learning, making practical use of current quantum hardware more feasible.

Abstract: To leverage the potential computational speedup of quantum computing (QC),
research in quantum machine learning (QML) has gained increasing prominence.
Angle encoding techniques in QML models have been shown to generate truncated
Fourier series, offering asymptotically universal function approximation
capabilities. By selecting efficient feature maps (FMs) within quantum
circuits, one can leverage the exponential growth of Fourier frequencies for
improved approximation. In multi-dimensional settings, additional input
dimensions induce further exponential scaling via mixed frequencies. In
practice, however, quantum models frequently fail at regression tasks. Through
two white-box experiments, we show that such failures can occur even when the
relevant frequencies are present, due to an insufficient number of trainable
parameters.
  In order to mitigate the double-exponential parameter growth resulting from
double-exponentially growing frequencies, we propose frequency selection and
dimensional separation as techniques to constrain the number of parameters,
thereby improving trainability. By restricting the QML model to essential
frequencies and permitting mixed frequencies only among feature dimensions with
known interdependence, we expand the set of tractable problems on current
hardware. We demonstrate the reduced parameter requirements by fitting two
white-box functions with known frequency spectrum and dimensional
interdependencies that could not be fitted with the default methods. The
reduced parameter requirements permit us to perform training on a noisy quantum
simulator and to demonstrate inference on real quantum hardware.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new three-qubit entangling gate that executes control-control-target and control-target-target operations in a single step, improving efficiency and robustness for quantum computation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address inefficiency and potential errors in quantum circuits caused by decomposing three-qubit operations into multiple two-qubit gates, the authors sought to develop a native three-qubit entangling gate for improved fidelity and faster operations.

Method: The authors used a hybrid optimization technique to amplify desired multiqubit interactions while suppressing unwanted couplings. This approach allowed them to design a robust three-qubit gate inspired by cross-resonance mechanisms.

Result: The gate enabled high-performance tasks such as preparing GHZ triplet states, implementing Toffoli-class operations, and a controlled-ZZ gate, aiding in enhanced stabilizer measurements for quantum error correction.

Conclusion: This work demonstrates the potential of leveraging native multiqubit interactions in developing advanced superconducting quantum processors, paving the way for co-designed circuit architectures and protocols.

Abstract: We present a native three-qubit entangling gate that exploits engineered
interactions to realize control-control-target and control-target-target
operations in a single coherent step. Unlike conventional decompositions into
multiple two-qubit gates, our hybrid optimization approach selectively
amplifies desired interactions while suppressing unwanted couplings, yielding
robust performance across the computational subspace and beyond. The new gate
can be classified as a cross-resonance gate. We show it can be utilized in
several ways, for example, in GHZ triplet state preparation, Toffoli-class
logic demonstrations with many-body interactions, and in implementing a
controlled-ZZ gate. The latter maps the parity of two data qubits directly onto
a measurement qubit, enabling faster and higher-fidelity stabilizer
measurements in surface-code quantum error correction. In all these examples,
we show that the three-qubit gate performance remains robust across Hilbert
space sizes, as confirmed by testing under increasing total excitation numbers.
This work lays the foundation for co-designing circuit architectures and
control protocols that leverage native multiqubit interactions as core elements
of next-generation superconducting quantum processors.

*Juvenal Bassa,Vidya Manian,Sudhir Malik,Arghya Chattopadhyay*

Main category: physics.data-an

TL;DR: The paper presents an ensemble neural network model to classify jet types in particle physics, utilizing 2D histograms for jet data representation, achieving better performance than individual networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The complexity of jets originating from quarks and gluons makes them difficult to classify using traditional methods, necessitating advanced machine learning techniques.

Method: The researchers employ an ensemble of two neural networks with jet data represented as 2D histograms, testing both binary and multi-class classification using the JetNet dataset.

Result: The Ensemble Model demonstrates superior classification performance over single-network models for various jet classes: Top Quarks, Light Quarks, and W/Z bosons.

Conclusion: The proposed ensemble approach effectively captures jet features, offering a robust solution for jet tagging tasks in particle physics.

Abstract: Jet classification in high-energy particle physics is important for
understanding fundamental interactions and probing phenomena beyond the
Standard Model. Jets originate from the fragmentation and hadronization of
quarks and gluons, and pose a challenge for identification due to their
complex, multidimensional structure. Traditional classification methods often
fall short in capturing these intricacies, necessitating advanced machine
learning approaches. In this paper, we employ two neural networks
simultaneously as an ensemble to tag various jet types. We convert the jet data
to two-dimensional histograms instead of representing them as points in a
higher-dimensional space. Specifically, this ensemble approach, hereafter
referred to as Ensemble Model, is used to tag jets into classes from the JetNet
dataset, corresponding to: Top Quarks, Light Quarks (up or down), and W and Z
bosons. For the jet classes mentioned above, we show that the Ensemble Model
can be used for both binary and multi-categorical classification. This ensemble
approach learns jet features by leveraging the strengths of each constituent
network achieving superior performance compared to either individual network.

*Sanghoon Lee,Hyung-Seok Park,Jiyeong Chae,Kyung-Joon Park*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a probabilistic latency analysis (PLA) to address reliability and latency challenges in ROS 2 DDS communication over lossy wireless networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to tackle the challenges of optimizing reliability and latency in ROS 2 DDS communication, given the complexities in wireless network configurations and parameter tuning.

Method: The authors propose a discrete-state probabilistic latency analysis (PLA) approach, which systematically analyzes middleware and transport-level events to compute retransmission probabilities and latency distributions.

Result: Experiments across 270 scenarios validate PLA, showing strong alignment between analytical predictions and observed results regarding retransmission, latency, and reliability under various network conditions.

Conclusion: PLA provides an analytical framework for understanding and optimizing ROS 2 DDS communication in wireless robotic systems, helping practitioners fine-tune parameters for better performance.

Abstract: Robot Operating System 2 (ROS 2) is now the de facto standard for robotic
communication, pairing UDP transport with the Data Distribution Service (DDS)
publish-subscribe middleware. DDS achieves reliability through periodic
heartbeats that solicit acknowledgments for missing samples and trigger
selective retransmissions. In lossy wireless networks, the tight coupling among
heartbeat period, IP fragmentation, and retransmission interval obscures end to
end latency behavior and leaves practitioners with little guidance on how to
tune these parameters. To address these challenges, we propose a probabilistic
latency analysis (PLA) that analytically models the reliable transmission
process of ROS 2 DDS communication using a discrete state approach. By
systematically analyzing both middleware level and transport level events, PLA
computes the steady state probability distribution of unacknowledged messages
and the retransmission latency. We validate our PLA across 270 scenarios,
exploring variations in packet delivery ratios, message sizes, and both
publishing and retransmission intervals, demonstrating a close alignment
between analytical predictions and experimental results. Our findings establish
a theoretical basis to systematically optimize reliability, latency, and
performance in wireless industrial robotics.

TL;DR: The paper proposes DINOMotion, a deep learning framework aimed at accurate tissue motion tracking in 2D-Cine MRI-guided radiotherapy, overcoming challenges like large misalignments and interpretability issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in existing motion tracking methods used in MRI-guided radiotherapy, such as difficulty handling large misalignments and lack of interpretability.

Method: Developed DINOMotion, based on DINOv2 with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) layers, which leverages deep learning to detect corresponding landmarks for image registration, reducing trainable parameters and enhancing efficiency.

Result: DINOMotion achieved impressive Dice scores (92.07% for kidney, 90.90% for liver, 95.23% for lung) and low Hausdorff distances, processing scans in 30ms and outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: DINOMotion is an effective and interpretable real-time motion tracking solution that addresses the challenges of large misalignments in 2D-Cine MRI-guided radiotherapy.

Abstract: Accurate tissue motion tracking is critical to ensure treatment outcome and
safety in 2D-Cine MRI-guided radiotherapy. This is typically achieved by
registration of sequential images, but existing methods often face challenges
with large misalignments and lack of interpretability. In this paper, we
introduce DINOMotion, a novel deep learning framework based on DINOv2 with
Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) layers for robust, efficient, and interpretable
motion tracking. DINOMotion automatically detects corresponding landmarks to
derive optimal image registration, enhancing interpretability by providing
explicit visual correspondences between sequential images. The integration of
LoRA layers reduces trainable parameters, improving training efficiency, while
DINOv2's powerful feature representations offer robustness against large
misalignments. Unlike iterative optimization-based methods, DINOMotion directly
computes image registration at test time. Our experiments on volunteer and
patient datasets demonstrate its effectiveness in estimating both linear and
nonlinear transformations, achieving Dice scores of 92.07% for the kidney,
90.90% for the liver, and 95.23% for the lung, with corresponding Hausdorff
distances of 5.47 mm, 8.31 mm, and 6.72 mm, respectively. DINOMotion processes
each scan in approximately 30ms and consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
methods, particularly in handling large misalignments. These results highlight
its potential as a robust and interpretable solution for real-time motion
tracking in 2D-Cine MRI-guided radiotherapy.

Conclusion: CNN-based models with integrated explainability are viable tools for fast, accurate, and interpretable lung cancer screening, especially in resource-limited areas.

Abstract: Early detection of lung cancer is critical to improving survival outcomes. We
present a deep learning framework for automated lung cancer screening from
chest computed tomography (CT) images with integrated explainability. Using the
IQ-OTH/NCCD dataset (1,197 scans across Normal, Benign, and Malignant classes),
we evaluate a custom convolutional neural network (CNN) and three fine-tuned
transfer learning backbones: DenseNet121, ResNet152, and VGG19. Models are
trained with cost-sensitive learning to mitigate class imbalance and evaluated
via accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC. While ResNet152
achieved the highest accuracy (97.3%), DenseNet121 provided the best overall
balance in precision, recall, and F1 (up to 92%, 90%, 91%, respectively). We
further apply Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) to visualize evidence
contributing to predictions, improving clinical transparency. Results indicate
that CNN-based approaches augmented with explainability can provide fast,
accurate, and interpretable support for lung cancer screening, particularly in
resource-limited settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to bridge the gap between deep learning-based surgical video analysis research and its real-world clinical applications by addressing critical challenges such as data annotation scarcity and domain variation.

Method: The research includes benchmarking neural network architectures, developing novel models, introducing semi-supervised learning frameworks (DIST, SemiVT-Surge, ENCORE), and releasing two surgical datasets (GynSurg, Cataract-1K) to improve video analysis performance while minimizing reliance on labeled data.

Result: The research delivered state-of-the-art performance in surgical video analysis tasks by using advanced models trained with minimal data. The release of two datasets also facilitates reproducibility and development in the field.

Conclusion: The work contributes to scalable and robust AI solutions for surgical video analysis, supporting real-world clinical applications and impacting surgical care and training through generalizable models.

Abstract: Advances in surgical video analysis are transforming operating rooms into
intelligent, data-driven environments. Computer-assisted systems support full
surgical workflow, from preoperative planning to intraoperative guidance and
postoperative assessment. However, developing robust and generalizable models
for surgical video understanding remains challenging due to (I) annotation
scarcity, (II) spatiotemporal complexity, and (III) domain gap across
procedures and institutions. This doctoral research aims to bridge the gap
between deep learning-based surgical video analysis in research and its
real-world clinical deployment. To address the core challenge of recognizing
surgical phases, actions, and events, critical for analysis, I benchmarked
state-of-the-art neural network architectures to identify the most effective
designs for each task. I further improved performance by proposing novel
architectures and integrating advanced modules. Given the high cost of expert
annotations and the domain gap across surgical video sources, I focused on
reducing reliance on labeled data. We developed semi-supervised frameworks that
improve model performance across tasks by leveraging large amounts of unlabeled
surgical video. We introduced novel semi-supervised frameworks, including DIST,
SemiVT-Surge, and ENCORE, that achieved state-of-the-art results on challenging
surgical datasets by leveraging minimal labeled data and enhancing model
training through dynamic pseudo-labeling. To support reproducibility and
advance the field, we released two multi-task datasets: GynSurg, the largest
gynecologic laparoscopy dataset, and Cataract-1K, the largest cataract surgery
video dataset. Together, this work contributes to robust, data-efficient, and
clinically scalable solutions for surgical video analysis, laying the
foundation for generalizable AI systems that can meaningfully impact surgical
care and training.

TL;DR: A simplified image denoising algorithm (Haar-tSVD) combines nonlocal self-similarity and PCA with Haar transform, achieving fast, parallelizable denoising with strong results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for speedy and effective image denoising is rising because of the rapid development of imaging devices and the abundance of image data.

Method: The method leverages the Haar transform and tensor-singular value decomposition (t-SVD) to unify global and local patch correlations into a single-step denoising approach, without requiring learned local bases.

Result: Experiments demonstrate the method's success across real-world denoising tasks, offering strong noise removal and detail preservation. Public datasets and code make it accessible.

Conclusion: Haar-tSVD is efficient, robust, and adaptable for various real-world image denoising tasks, balancing speed and performance while eliminating the need for computationally expensive local learning schemes.

Abstract: The advancement of imaging devices and countless image data generated
everyday impose an increasingly high demand on efficient and effective image
denoising. In this paper, we present a computationally simple denoising
algorithm, termed Haar-tSVD, aiming to explore the nonlocal self-similarity
prior and leverage the connection between principal component analysis (PCA)
and the Haar transform under circulant representation. We show that global and
local patch correlations can be effectively captured through a unified
tensor-singular value decomposition (t-SVD) projection with the Haar transform.
This results in a one-step, highly parallelizable filtering method that
eliminates the need for learning local bases to represent image patches,
striking a balance between denoising speed and performance. Furthermore, we
introduce an adaptive noise estimation scheme based on a CNN estimator and
eigenvalue analysis to enhance the robustness and adaptability of the proposed
method. Experiments on different real-world denoising tasks validate the
efficiency and effectiveness of Haar-tSVD for noise removal and detail
preservation. Datasets, code and results are publicly available at

Motivation: The rapid growth of user-generated video content has amplified the need for effective no-reference perceptual video quality assessment tools, crucial for large-scale monitoring on platforms without pristine references.

Method: The model uses spatio-temporal fragmentation driven by inter-frame variations and analyzes quality-sensitive regions at different scales, extracting 2D and 3D features to effectively represent these variations.

Result: Experiments on five UGC datasets show competitive performance among state-of-the-art models, ranking top 2 in accuracy with high rank correlation (e.g., DIVA-VQA-L: 0.898) and superior runtime efficiency.

Conclusion: The proposed NR-VQA method balances high accuracy with low runtime complexity, proving it to be a robust solution for large-scale video quality monitoring of UGC.

Abstract: The rapid growth of user-generated (video) content (UGC) has driven increased
demand for research on no-reference (NR) perceptual video quality assessment
(VQA). NR-VQA is a key component for large-scale video quality monitoring in
social media and streaming applications where a pristine reference is not
available. This paper proposes a novel NR-VQA model based on spatio-temporal
fragmentation driven by inter-frame variations. By leveraging these inter-frame
differences, the model progressively analyses quality-sensitive regions at
multiple levels: frames, patches, and fragmented frames. It integrates frames,
fragmented residuals, and fragmented frames aligned with residuals to
effectively capture global and local information. The model extracts both 2D
and 3D features in order to characterize these spatio-temporal variations.
Experiments conducted on five UGC datasets and against state-of-the-art models
ranked our proposed method among the top 2 in terms of average rank correlation
(DIVA-VQA-L: 0.898 and DIVA-VQA-B: 0.886). The improved performance is offered
at a low runtime complexity, with DIVA-VQA-B ranked top and DIVA-VQA-L third on
average compared to the fastest existing NR-VQA method. Code and models are

TL;DR: FROGENT, a Full-Process Drug Design Agent, integrates multiple AI tools and databases to simplify drug discovery workflows, far outperforming existing models and agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current drug discovery tools are fragmented across platforms, making processes cumbersome for scientists. The goal is to build an integrated framework streamlining these processes.

Method: FROGENT utilizes a Large Language Model, the Model Context Protocol, and integrates various databases, tools, and task-specific AI models to dynamically execute tasks in drug discovery workflows.

Result: FROGENT demonstrated superior performance on eight benchmarks, tripling baseline performance in hit-finding and doubling it in interaction profiling, while surpassing advanced agents and commercial models like GPT-4o.

Conclusion: Streamlining drug discovery using FROGENT can significantly enhance researcher productivity and demonstrates both superior performance and real-world applicability.

Abstract: Powerful AI tools for drug discovery reside in isolated web apps, desktop
programs, and code libraries. Such fragmentation forces scientists to manage
incompatible interfaces and specialized scripts, which can be a cumbersome and
repetitive process. To address this issue, a Full-pROcess druG dEsign ageNT,

Language Model and the Model Context Protocol to integrate multiple dynamic
biochemical databases, extensible tool libraries, and task-specific AI models.
This agentic framework allows FROGENT to execute complicated drug discovery
workflows dynamically, including component tasks such as target identification,
molecule generation and retrosynthetic planning. FROGENT has been evaluated on
eight benchmarks that cover various aspects of drug discovery, such as
knowledge retrieval, property prediction, virtual screening, mechanistic
analysis, molecular design, and synthesis. It was compared against six
increasingly advanced ReAct-style agents that support code execution and
literature searches. Empirical results demonstrated that FROGENT triples the
best baseline performance in hit-finding and doubles it in interaction
profiling, significantly outperforming both the open-source model Qwen3-32B and
the commercial model GPT-4o. In addition, real-world cases have been utilized
to validate the practicability and generalization of FROGENT. This development
suggests that streamlining the agentic drug discovery pipeline can
significantly enhance researcher productivity.

### [371] [Advances in Logic-Based Entity Resolution: Enhancing ASPEN with Local Merges and Optimality Criteria](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10504)
*Zhliang Xiang,Meghyn Bienvenu,Gianluca Cima,Víctor Gutiérrez-Basulto,Yazmín Ibáñez-García*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: ASPEN+ is a system for entity resolution that supports local merges and provides new optimality criteria for selecting solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods for entity resolution often rely on global merges, which can lead to inaccuracies when data values need localized distinctions, such as differentiating between similar names like 'J. Lee' being 'Joy Lee' or 'Jake Lee.'

Method: ASPEN+ introduces functionalities for local merges and optimality criteria. These include minimizing rule violations and maximizing supportive rules for entity merges. The approach is formalized, analyzed computationally, and evaluated experimentally.

Result: Experimental evaluations on real-world datasets showed improved accuracy and runtime in entity resolution when using ASPEN+ with local merges and new optimality measures.

Conclusion: ASPEN+ successfully enhances entity resolution by supporting localized merges and offering more effective criteria for optimal solutions, leading to better performance in practical scenarios.

Abstract: In this paper, we present ASPEN+, which extends an existing ASP-based system,
ASPEN,for collective entity resolution with two important functionalities:
support for local merges and new optimality criteria for preferred solutions.
Indeed, ASPEN only supports so-called global merges of entity-referring
constants (e.g. author ids), in which all occurrences of matched constants are
treated as equivalent and merged accordingly. However, it has been argued that
when resolving data values, local merges are often more appropriate, as e.g.
some instances of 'J. Lee' may refer to 'Joy Lee', while others should be
matched with 'Jake Lee'. In addition to allowing such local merges, ASPEN+
offers new optimality criteria for selecting solutions, such as minimizing rule
violations or maximising the number of rules supporting a merge. Our main
contributions are thus (1) the formalisation and computational analysis of
various notions of optimal solution, and (2) an extensive experimental
evaluation on real-world datasets, demonstrating the effect of local merges and
the new optimality criteria on both accuracy and runtime.

### [372] [Efficient Methods for Accurate Sparse Trajectory Recovery and Map Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10460)
*Wei Tian,Jieming Shi,Man Lung Yiu*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: The study introduces TRMMA and MMA, efficient methods aimed at improving trajectory recovery and map matching for sparse GPS data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges posed by sparsely-sampled trajectories and their misalignment with road networks, which hinder the precision required for various applications.

Method: The approach uses MMA as a classification method for aligning sparse GPS points to road segments, leveraging embeddings for patterns and directional data. TRMMA builds upon this by utilizing a dual-transformer encoding process to recover missing trajectory points effectively.

Result: Experiments on 4 large datasets show that TRMMA and MMA outperform existing methods in both quality and efficiency.

Conclusion: TRMMA and MMA are demonstrated as robust techniques for trajectory recovery and map matching, significantly improving data quality in low-sampling GPS trajectories.

Abstract: Real-world trajectories are often sparse with low-sampling rates (i.e., long
intervals between consecutive GPS points) and misaligned with road networks,
yet many applications demand high-quality data for optimal performance. To
improve data quality with sparse trajectories as input, we systematically study
two related research problems: trajectory recovery on road network, which aims
to infer missing points to recover high-sampling trajectories, and map
matching, which aims to map GPS points to road segments to determine underlying
routes. In this paper, we present efficient methods TRMMA and MMA for accurate
trajectory recovery and map matching, respectively, where MMA serves as the
first step of TRMMA. In MMA, we carefully formulate a classification task to
map a GPS point from sparse trajectories to a road segment over a small
candidate segment set, rather than the entire road network. We develop
techniques in MMA to generate effective embeddings that capture the patterns of
GPS data, directional information, and road segments, to accurately align
sparse trajectories to routes. For trajectory recovery, TRMMA focuses on the
segments in the route returned by MMA to infer missing points with position
ratios on road segments, producing high-sampling trajectories efficiently by
avoiding evaluation of all road segments. Specifically, in TRMMA, we design a
dual-transformer encoding process to cohesively capture latent patterns in
trajectories and routes, and an effective decoding technique to sequentially
predict the position ratios and road segments of missing points. We conduct
extensive experiments to compare TRMMA and MMA with numerous existing methods
for trajectory recovery and map matching, respectively, on 4 large real-world
datasets. TRMMA and MMA consistently achieve the best result quality, often by
a significant margin.

### [373] [Layer-Wise Analysis of Self-Supervised Representations for Age and Gender Classification in Children's Speech](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10332)
*Abhijit Sinha,Harishankar Kumar,Mohit Joshi,Hemant Kumar Kathania,Shrikanth Narayanan,Sudarsana Reddy Kadiri*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: This study examines how Wav2Vec2 SSL models handle age and gender classification in children's speech, finding early layers capture speaker traits and achieving high classification accuracies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper explores challenges in classifying age and gender from children's speech due to variability in vocal patterns and examines how SSL models perform in this domain.

Method: The authors conduct a layer-wise analysis of four Wav2Vec2 variants using the PFSTAR and CMU Kids datasets, applying PCA to enhance feature reduction and classification performance.

Result: The Wav2Vec2-large-lv60 model achieves high classification accuracy: 97.14% age and 98.20% gender on CMU Kids, and other configurations perform well on PFSTAR.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that children's speech traits are better captured in the early layers of SSL models, offering insights for child-specific speech interfaces.

Abstract: Children's speech presents challenges for age and gender classification due
to high variability in pitch, articulation, and developmental traits. While
self-supervised learning (SSL) models perform well on adult speech tasks, their
ability to encode speaker traits in children remains underexplored. This paper
presents a detailed layer-wise analysis of four Wav2Vec2 variants using the
PFSTAR and CMU Kids datasets. Results show that early layers (1-7) capture
speaker-specific cues more effectively than deeper layers, which increasingly
focus on linguistic information. Applying PCA further improves classification,
reducing redundancy and highlighting the most informative components. The
Wav2Vec2-large-lv60 model achieves 97.14% (age) and 98.20% (gender) on CMU
Kids; base-100h and large-lv60 models reach 86.05% and 95.00% on PFSTAR. These
results reveal how speaker traits are structured across SSL model depth and
support more targeted, adaptive strategies for child-aware speech interfaces.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cloud classification is vital for accurate atmospheric retrievals, climate modeling, and weather forecasting.

Method: A Support Vector Machine (SVM) technique combined with Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and focused channel selection is used for cloud classification.

Result: The proposed method yielded 88.30% correlation with reference labels and demonstrated strong alignment with MODIS cloud masks, with notable discrepancies in polar regions.

Conclusion: The CISVM method is robust, efficient, and adaptable for automated cloud detection in diverse scenarios, making it fit for use in operational systems and future missions like ESA's FORUM.

Abstract: Cloud detection is essential for atmospheric retrievals, climate studies, and
weather forecasting. We analyze infrared radiances from the Infrared
Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI) onboard Meteorological Operational
(MetOp) satellites to classify scenes as clear or cloudy.
  We apply the Support Vector Machine (SVM) approach, based on kernel methods
for non-separable data. In this study, the method is implemented for Cloud
Identification (CISVM) to classify the test set using radiances or brightness
temperatures, with dimensionality reduction through Principal Component
Analysis (PCA) and cloud-sensitive channel selection to focus on the most
informative features. Our best configuration achieves 88.30 percent agreement
with reference labels and shows strong consistency with cloud masks from the
Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), with the largest
discrepancies in polar regions due to sensor differences.
  These results demonstrate that CISVM is a robust, flexible, and efficient
method for automated cloud classification from infrared radiances, suitable for
operational retrievals and future missions such as Far infrared Outgoing
Radiation Understanding and Monitoring (FORUM), the ninth European Space Agency
Earth Explorer Mission.

Abstract: Cancer is recognized as a complex group of diseases, contributing to the
highest global mortality rates, with increasing prevalence and a trend toward
affecting younger populations. It is characterized by uncontrolled
proliferation of abnormal cells, invasion of adjacent tissues, and metastasis
to distant organs. Garcinia cowa, a traditional medicinal plant widely used in
Southeast Asia, including Vietnam, is employed to treat fever, cough,
indigestion, as a laxative, and for parasitic diseases. Numerous xanthone
compounds isolated from this species exhibit a broad spectrum of biological
activities, with some showing promise as anti cancer and antimalarial agents.

Rubraxanthone, Garcinone D, Norcowanin, Cowanol, and Cowaxanthone alongside
their primary protein targets (TNF, CTNNB1, SRC, NFKB1, and MTOR), providing
critical insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying their anti-cancer
effects. The Graph Attention Network algorithm demonstrated superior predictive
performance, achieving an R2 of 0.98 and an RMSE of 0.02 after data
augmentation, highlighting its accuracy in predicting pIC50 values for xanthone

*Andrea Urgolo,Monika Stipsitz,Helios Sanchis-Alepuz*

Main category: physics.comp-ph

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of monitoring degradation in IGBT modules using machine learning-based virtual sensing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need to track degradation states in IGBT modules to ensure reliability and performance, particularly in demanding applications where physical access to components is limited.

Method: Machine learning-based virtual sensing techniques are utilized to estimate degradation states and generate full temperature maps from limited sensor data.

Result: Using synthetic data, the method achieved high accuracy, showing a mean absolute error of 1.17% in estimating solder layer degradation and a maximum relative error of 4.56% in surface temperature reproduction.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the potential of machine learning-based virtual sensing to accurately monitor IGBT module degradation and temperature profiles, providing an alternative to direct measurements.

Abstract: Monitoring the degradation state of Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistor (IGBT)
modules is essential for ensuring the reliability and longevity of power
electronic systems, especially in safety-critical and high-performance
applications. However, direct measurement of key degradation indicators - such
as junction temperature, solder fatigue or delamination - remains challenging
due to the physical inaccessibility of internal components and the harsh
environment. In this context, machine learning-based virtual sensing offers a
promising alternative by bridging the gap from feasible sensor placement to the
relevant but inaccessible locations. This paper explores the feasibility of
estimating the degradation state of solder layers, and the corresponding full
temperature maps based on a limited number of physical sensors. Based on
synthetic data of a specific degradation mode, we obtain a high accuracy in the
estimation of the degraded solder area (1.17% mean absolute error), and are
able to reproduce the surface temperature of the IGBT with a maximum relative
error of 4.56% (corresponding to an average relative error of 0.37%).

*Haoran Sun,Daoqi Liu,Hongyu Zhou,Maokun Li,Shenheng Xu,Fan Yang*

Main category: physics.comp-ph

TL;DR: The paper introduces a physics-informed deep learning framework, DeepCSI, to address inverse scattering problems in electromagnetic imaging. It allows for fast and accurate medium reconstruction under diverse measurement conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inverse scattering problems are fundamental in fields like electromagnetic imaging but are challenging due to their nonlinear nature and the diversity of measurement scenarios.

Method: DeepCSI uses a residual multilayer perceptron (ResMLP) to model current distributions, combining traditional principles such as contrast source inversion with modern neural operator techniques to linearize the problem and reduce computational cost. A hybrid loss function ensures robustness.

Result: Simulations and experiments show that DeepCSI achieves high-precision reconstruction across different conditions, including phaseless and multi-frequency data, outperforming traditional methods in efficiency and accuracy.

Conclusion: DeepCSI offers a universal and efficient solution to complex inverse scattering problems, simplifying and improving upon traditional methods while being versatile across scenarios.

Abstract: Inverse scattering problems are critical in electromagnetic imaging and
medical diagnostics but are challenged by their nonlinearity and diverse
measurement scenarios. This paper proposes a physics-informed deep contrast
source inversion framework (DeepCSI) for fast and accurate medium
reconstruction across various measurement conditions. Inspired by contrast
source inversion (CSI) and neural operator methods, a residual multilayer
perceptron (ResMLP) is employed to model current distributions in the region of
interest under different transmitter excitations, effectively linearizing the
nonlinear inverse scattering problem and significantly reducing the
computational cost of traditional full-waveform inversion. By modeling medium
parameters as learnable tensors and utilizing a hybrid loss function that
integrates state equation loss, data equation loss, and total variation
regularization, DeepCSI establishes a fully differentiable framework for joint
optimization of network parameters and medium properties. Compared with
conventional methods, DeepCSI offers advantages in terms of simplicity and
universal modeling capabilities for diverse measurement scenarios, including
phase-less and multi-frequency observation. Simulations and experiments
demonstrate that DeepCSI achieves high-precision, robust reconstruction under
full-data, phaseless data, and multifrequency conditions, outperforming
traditional CSI methods and providing an efficient and universal solution for
complex inverse scattering problems.

*Greg Sadler,Nathan Sherburn*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: The paper introduces "Legal Zero-Days" as vulnerabilities in legal systems exploitable by AI for societal disruptions and presents a risk model and evaluation method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To highlight the overlooked risks associated with AI exploiting vulnerabilities in legal frameworks, emphasizing societal and governance implications.

Method: A risk model for Legal Zero-Days is proposed, supported by the 2017 Australian dual citizenship crisis as an example, along with a methodology for evaluating AI's capacity to identify such vulnerabilities.

Result: The study finds current AI systems lacking in reliably identifying impactful Legal Zero-Days but warns of future systems with this potential.

Conclusion: Legal Zero-Days pose significant risks, indicating the need for proactive legal and technological mitigation strategies as AI advances.

Abstract: We introduce the concept of "Legal Zero-Days" as a novel risk vector for
advanced AI systems. Legal Zero-Days are previously undiscovered
vulnerabilities in legal frameworks that, when exploited, can cause immediate
and significant societal disruption without requiring litigation or other
processes before impact. We present a risk model for identifying and evaluating
these vulnerabilities, demonstrating their potential to bypass safeguards or
impede government responses to AI incidents. Using the 2017 Australian dual
citizenship crisis as a case study, we illustrate how seemingly minor legal
oversights can lead to large-scale governance disruption. We develop a
methodology for creating "legal puzzles" as evaluation instruments for
assessing AI systems' capabilities to discover such vulnerabilities. Our
findings suggest that while current AI models may not reliably find impactful
Legal Zero-Days, future systems may develop this capability, presenting both
risks and opportunities for improving legal robustness. This work contributes
to the broader effort to identify and mitigate previously unrecognized risks
from frontier AI systems.

TL;DR: This paper investigates how U.S.-based NLP practitioners perceive and address data equity issues, linking their insights to broader governance frameworks and recommending participatory solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to explore how NLP practitioners, directly involved in dataset development and deployment, approach equity challenges in light of organizational, systemic, and governance constraints.

Method: The authors employed a 2024 questionnaire and focus group to gather insights from U.S.-based NLP data practitioners about their views on fairness, organizational pressures, and emerging governance initiatives.

Result: Findings highlight tensions between commercial priorities and equity commitments, the need for participatory workflows, and critiques of insufficient governance measures like diversity washing.

Conclusion: Structural governance reforms are essential to empower NLP practitioners and ensure community consent, enabling more equitable data practices.

Abstract: While research has focused on surfacing and auditing algorithmic bias to
ensure equitable AI development, less is known about how NLP practitioners -
those directly involved in dataset development, annotation, and deployment -
perceive and navigate issues of NLP data equity. This study is among the first
to center practitioners' perspectives, linking their experiences to a
multi-scalar AI governance framework and advancing participatory
recommendations that bridge technical, policy, and community domains. Drawing
on a 2024 questionnaire and focus group, we examine how U.S.-based NLP data
practitioners conceptualize fairness, contend with organizational and systemic
constraints, and engage emerging governance efforts such as the U.S. AI Bill of
Rights. Findings reveal persistent tensions between commercial objectives and
equity commitments, alongside calls for more participatory and accountable data
workflows. We critically engage debates on data diversity and diversity
washing, arguing that improving NLP equity requires structural governance
reforms that support practitioner agency and community consent.

TL;DR: This paper evaluates machine-learned potentials for biomolecular simulations, assessing factors such as model size, training data composition, and long-range interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore and evaluate the potential of universal machine-learned architectures for biomolecular simulations, which have been underexplored in this domain.

Method: Equivariant message-passing architectures are trained on the SPICE-v2 dataset and assessed across benchmarks and molecular simulations with varying compositions and electrostatics treatments.

Result: While larger models improve benchmark accuracy, they do not consistently yield improved simulation properties. Dataset composition affects predictions, and long-range electrostatics exhibit system-specific impacts.

Conclusion: Challenges like imbalanced datasets and evaluation practices limit the current applicability of universal machine-learned potentials in biomolecular simulations.

Abstract: Universal machine-learned potentials promise transferable accuracy across
compositional and vibrational degrees of freedom, yet their application to
biomolecular simulations remains underexplored. This work systematically
evaluates equivariant message-passing architectures trained on the SPICE-v2
dataset with and without explicit long-range dispersion and electrostatics. We
assess the impact of model size, training data composition, and electrostatic
treatment across in- and out-of-distribution benchmark datasets, as well as
molecular simulations of bulk liquid water, aqueous NaCl solutions, and
biomolecules, including alanine tripeptide, the mini-protein Trp-cage, and
Crambin. While larger models improve accuracy on benchmark datasets, this trend
does not consistently extend to properties obtained from simulations. Predicted
properties also depend on the composition of the training dataset. Long-range
electrostatics show no systematic impact across systems. However, for Trp-cage,
their inclusion yields increased conformational variability. Our results
suggest that imbalanced datasets and immature evaluation practices currently
challenge the applicability of universal machine-learned potentials to
biomolecular simulations.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle to efficiently handle mixed data types and personalize search rankings, necessitating a more integrative and scalable framework.

Method: The model combines tabular and non-tabular data using pre-trained TinyBERT embeddings, introduces a new sampling method for customer diversity, and implements scalable relevance labels derived from behavioral metrics.

Result: The proposed model outperformed baselines like XGBoost and TabNet, showing substantial improvements in handling mixed data types and personalized ranking.

Conclusion: Integrating advanced embeddings, multi-task learning, and customer behavior data significantly enhances personalized product search outcomes, showcasing the model's effectiveness.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel model architecture for optimizing
personalized product search ranking using a multi-task learning (MTL)
framework. Our approach uniquely integrates tabular and non-tabular data,
leveraging a pre-trained TinyBERT model for semantic embeddings and a novel
sampling technique to capture diverse customer behaviors. We evaluate our model
against several baselines, including XGBoost, TabNet, FT-Transformer, DCN-V2,
and MMoE, focusing on their ability to handle mixed data types and optimize
personalized ranking. Additionally, we propose a scalable relevance labeling
mechanism based on click-through rates, click positions, and semantic
similarity, offering an alternative to traditional human-annotated labels.
Experimental results show that combining non-tabular data with advanced
embedding techniques in multi-task learning paradigm significantly enhances
model performance. Ablation studies further underscore the benefits of
incorporating relevance labels, fine-tuning TinyBERT layers, and TinyBERT
query-product embedding interactions. These results demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach in achieving improved personalized product search
ranking.

*Michael Weiss,Robert Rosenbach,Christian Eggenberger*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: This paper examines how optimizing product recommendation rankings for click-through rate (CTR) compares to optimizing for order-submit-rate (OSR), finding that OSR optimization leads to a significant increase in Gross Merchandise Value (GMV).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand which optimization objective (CTR vs. OSR) better aligns with e-commerce business goals such as maximizing Gross Merchandise Value (GMV).

Method: The study conducted an online A/B test comparing CTR and OSR optimization strategies for product recommendation rankings.

Result: Optimizing for OSR resulted in a GMV uplift more than five times larger compared to CTR optimization, while ensuring new product discovery was not compromised.

Conclusion: OSR-based optimization offers substantial advantages over CTR, directly supporting business goals and providing better feature importance insights for recommendation models.

Abstract: Ranking product recommendations to optimize for a high click-through rate
(CTR) or for high conversion, such as add-to-cart rate (ACR) and
Order-Submit-Rate (OSR, view-to-purchase conversion) are standard practices in
e-commerce. Optimizing for CTR appears like a straightforward choice: Training
data (i.e., click data) are simple to collect and often available in large
quantities. Additionally, CTR is used far beyond e-commerce, making it a
generalist, easily implemented option. ACR and OSR, on the other hand, are more
directly linked to a shop's business goals, such as the Gross Merchandise Value
(GMV). In this paper, we compare the effects of using either of these
objectives using an online A/B test. Among our key findings, we demonstrate
that in our shops, optimizing for OSR produces a GMV uplift more than five
times larger than when optimizing for CTR, without sacrificing new product
discovery. Our results also provide insights into the different feature
importances for each of the objectives.

*Ze Liu,Xianquan Wang,Shuochen Liu,Jie Ma,Huibo Xu,Yupeng Han,Zhe Yang,Kai Zhang,Longfei Li,Jun Zhou*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: This paper introduces CrossDenoise, a lightweight framework to improve recommendation accuracy by mitigating noisy implicit feedback using user, item, and interaction-specific factors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to tackle the persistent issue of noisy implicit feedback in recommender systems, which degrades accuracy and limits practical implementation due to existing methods' inefficiency or complexity.

Method: The proposed CrossDenoise disentangles noise estimation into user, item, and interaction factors, calculates entity reputation using rank-based loss mapping, and uses interaction weights from empirical cumulative distribution functions. It is computationally efficient and requires minimal hyperparameter tuning.

Result: CrossDenoise consistently outperformed state-of-the-art baselines in terms of accuracy (e.g., 27.01% NDCG@50 gain) across various benchmarks and models while maintaining negligible computational overhead.

Conclusion: CrossDenoise effectively separates clean and noisy samples, offers robustness across hyperparameter settings, and provides a scalable, practical solution for improving recommender systems.

Abstract: Recommender systems heavily rely on implicit feedback, which is inherently
noisy due to false positives and negatives, severely degrading recommendation
accuracy. Existing denoising strategies often overlook entity-aware modeling,
suffer from high computational overhead, or demand excessive hyperparameter
tuning, limiting their real-world applicability. We propose CrossDenoise, a
novel and lightweight framework that addresses these challenges by
disentangling noise estimation into user-, item-, and interaction-specific
factors. Leveraging empirical observations that show significant heterogeneity
in user and item noise propensities, CrossDenoise computes entity reputation
factors (user/item reliability) via a rank-based linear mapping of average
training losses. These are fused with interaction-level weights derived from an
empirical cumulative distribution function (ECDF) of individual losses. This
design is model-agnostic, computationally efficient, and requires only two
intuitive hyperparameters. Extensive experiments on ML-1M, Yelp, and
Amazon-book datasets, across GMF, NeuMF, and CDAE backbones, demonstrate that
CrossDenoise consistently and significantly outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines. For instance, it achieves up to 27.01% NDCG@50 gain on Yelp with
NeuMF, while incurring negligible computational and memory overhead. Our
analysis confirms that CrossDenoise effectively separates clean from noisy
samples and remains robust under varied hyperparameter settings. It offers a
practical and scalable solution for denoising implicit feedback.

Main category: cond-mat.mtrl-sci

TL;DR: The paper introduces a neural network model, SCMS-PINN v35, to accurately predict band structures in 2D materials like graphene while preserving symmetry and physics-informed constraints. It achieves high predictive accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle to balance computational efficiency and physical accuracy in predicting electronic band structures of 2D materials.

Method: The study presents SCMS-PINN v35, which uses a multi-head ResNet-6 architecture leveraging 31 physics-informed features, progressive Dirac constraint scheduling, and enforced symmetry preservation through systematic averaging.

Result: The model reduced training loss by 99.99%, achieved Dirac point gap predictions within 30.3 μeV, and average errors of 53.9 meV (valence) and 40.5 meV (conduction) while fully preserving C6v symmetry.

Conclusion: SCMS-PINN v35 establishes a promising framework for expanding physics-informed machine learning to accelerate material discovery in 2D systems.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of electronic band structures in two-dimensional
materials remains a fundamental challenge, with existing methods struggling to
balance computational efficiency and physical accuracy. We present the
Symmetry-Constrained Multi-Scale Physics-Informed Neural Network (SCMS-PINN)
v35, which directly learns graphene band structures while rigorously enforcing
crystallographic symmetries through a multi-head architecture. Our approach
introduces three specialized ResNet-6 pathways -- K-head for Dirac physics,
M-head for saddle points, and General head for smooth interpolation --
operating on 31 physics-informed features extracted from k-points. Progressive
Dirac constraint scheduling systematically increases the weight parameter from
5.0 to 25.0, enabling hierarchical learning from global topology to local
critical physics. Training on 10,000 k-points over 300 epochs achieves 99.99\%
reduction in training loss (34.597 to 0.003) with validation loss of 0.0085.
The model predicts Dirac point gaps within 30.3 $\mu$eV of theoretical zero and
achieves average errors of 53.9 meV (valence) and 40.5 meV (conduction) across
the Brillouin zone. All twelve C$_{6v}$ operations are enforced through
systematic averaging, guaranteeing exact symmetry preservation. This framework
establishes a foundation for extending physics-informed learning to broader
two-dimensional materials for accelerated discovery.

### [385] [Accelerating exoplanet climate modelling: A machine learning approach to complement 3D GCM grid simulations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10827)
*Alexander Plaschzug,Amit Reza,Ludmila Carone,Sebastian Gernjak,Christiane Helling*

Main category: astro-ph.EP

TL;DR: The paper investigates using machine learning models to predict the 3D temperature and wind structures of tidally-locked gaseous exoplanets, offering a computationally efficient alternative to traditional general circulation models (GCMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing capability of telescopes necessitates more advanced and efficient 3D climate models to interpret exoplanet observational data, given the challenges posed by the computational intensity of existing GCMs.

Method: The authors introduced a 3D GCM grid based on 60 hot Jupiters and tested two machine learning models (DNN and XGBoost) to reproduce atmospheric features. Selected planets observed by PLATO were used for validation against traditional methods.

Result: The dense neural network achieved high accuracy, predicting gas temperatures to within 32 ppm of traditional methods for most cases, with minimal deviations.

Conclusion: Machine learning models like DNN offer a fast, reliable tool to predict atmospheric structures of exoplanets, supplementing traditional GCM methods without significant loss in quality for most parameters.

Abstract: With the development of ever-improving telescopes capable of observing
exoplanet atmospheres in greater detail and number, there is a growing demand
for enhanced 3D climate models to support and help interpret observational data
from space missions like CHEOPS, TESS, JWST, PLATO, and Ariel. However, the
computationally intensive and time-consuming nature of general circulation
models (GCMs) poses significant challenges in simulating a wide range of
exoplanetary atmospheres. This study aims to determine whether machine learning
(ML) algorithms can be used to predict the 3D temperature and wind structure of
arbitrary tidally-locked gaseous exoplanets in a range of planetary parameters.
A new 3D GCM grid with 60 inflated hot Jupiters orbiting A, F, G, K, and M-type
host stars modelled with Exorad has been introduced. A dense neural network
(DNN) and a decision tree algorithm (XGBoost) are trained on this grid to
predict local gas temperatures along with horizontal and vertical winds. To
ensure the reliability and quality of the ML model predictions, WASP-121 b,
HATS-42 b, NGTS-17 b, WASP-23 b, and NGTS-1 b-like planets, which are all
targets for PLATO observation, are selected and modelled with ExoRad and the
two ML methods as test cases. The DNN predictions for the gas temperatures are
to such a degree that the calculated spectra agree within 32 ppm for all but
one planet, for which only one single HCN feature reaches a 100 ppm difference.
The developed ML emulators can reliably predict the complete 3D temperature
field of an inflated warm to ultra-hot tidally locked Jupiter around A to
M-type host stars. It provides a fast tool to complement and extend traditional
GCM grids for exoplanet ensemble studies. The quality of the predictions is
such that no or minimal effects on the gas phase chemistry, hence on the cloud
formation and transmission spectra, are to be expected.

### [386] [CATNet: A geometric deep learning approach for CAT bond spread prediction in the primary market](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10208)
*Dixon Domfeh,Saeid Safarveisi*

Main category: q-fin.PR

TL;DR: This paper introduces CATNet, a model using relational graph convolutional networks to predict CAT bond spreads, outperforming traditional and benchmark methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional CAT bond pricing models fail to account for the complex, relational, and networked data in these instruments, necessitating a paradigm shift.

Method: The authors employ Relational Graph Convolutional Networks (R-GCN) to model the CAT bond market as a graph and include network topology measures as features for prediction tasks.

Result: CATNet achieves superior predictive performance compared to a Random Forest benchmark and provides interpretability by revealing how network features relate to industry factors like reputation and influence.

Conclusion: The study offers a new perspective on CAT bond pricing, emphasizing the role of network connectivity and proving the effectiveness of graph-based models for both accuracy and market insight generation.

Abstract: Traditional models for pricing catastrophe (CAT) bonds struggle to capture
the complex, relational data inherent in these instruments. This paper
introduces CATNet, a novel framework that applies a geometric deep learning
architecture, the Relational Graph Convolutional Network (R-GCN), to model the
CAT bond primary market as a graph, leveraging its underlying network structure
for spread prediction. Our analysis reveals that the CAT bond market exhibits
the characteristics of a scale-free network, a structure dominated by a few
highly connected and influential hubs. CATNet demonstrates high predictive
performance, significantly outperforming a strong Random Forest benchmark. The
inclusion of topological centrality measures as features provides a further,
significant boost in accuracy. Interpretability analysis confirms that these
network features are not mere statistical artifacts; they are quantitative
proxies for long-held industry intuition regarding issuer reputation,
underwriter influence, and peril concentration. This research provides evidence
that network connectivity is a key determinant of price, offering a new
paradigm for risk assessment and proving that graph-based models can deliver
both state-of-the-art accuracy and deeper, quantifiable market insights.

### [387] [A Robust Pipeline for Differentially Private Federated Learning on Imbalanced Clinical Data using SMOTETomek and FedProx](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10017)
*Rodrigo Tertulino*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: Federated Learning combined with Differential Privacy addresses data privacy in collaborative health research but involves a trade-off with clinical data utility, particularly under class imbalance. Methods to mitigate this were explored and optimized.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address privacy concerns in health research while maintaining clinical data utility, tackling challenges posed by class imbalance and non-IID data.

Method: The paper implemented an FL framework for cardiovascular risk prediction, incorporating SMOTETomek for handling data imbalance and tuning FedProx for non-IID data optimization.

Result: Hybrid SMOTETomek improved recall, while tuned FedProx outperformed FedAvg in handling non-IID data. A non-linear trade-off between privacy (epsilon) and utility was observed, identifying an optimal privacy-utility balance at epsilon 9.0 with over 77% recall.

Conclusion: The study provides a practical framework for creating secure and effective diagnostic models using heterogeneous healthcare data, balancing privacy guarantees with clinical utility.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) presents a groundbreaking approach for collaborative
health research, allowing model training on decentralized data while
safeguarding patient privacy. FL offers formal security guarantees when
combined with Differential Privacy (DP). The integration of these technologies,
however, introduces a significant trade-off between privacy and clinical
utility, a challenge further complicated by the severe class imbalance often
present in medical datasets. The research presented herein addresses these
interconnected issues through a systematic, multi-stage analysis. An FL
framework was implemented for cardiovascular risk prediction, where initial
experiments showed that standard methods struggled with imbalanced data,
resulting in a recall of zero. To overcome such a limitation, we first
integrated the hybrid Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique with Tomek
Links (SMOTETomek) at the client level, successfully developing a clinically
useful model. Subsequently, the framework was optimized for non-IID data using
a tuned FedProx algorithm. Our final results reveal a clear, non-linear
trade-off between the privacy budget (epsilon) and model recall, with the
optimized FedProx consistently out-performing standard FedAvg. An optimal
operational region was identified on the privacy-utility frontier, where strong
privacy guarantees (with epsilon 9.0) can be achieved while maintaining high
clinical utility (recall greater than 77%). Ultimately, our study provides a
practical methodological blueprint for creating effective, secure, and accurate
diagnostic tools that can be applied to real-world, heterogeneous healthcare
data.

### [388] [Context Misleads LLMs: The Role of Context Filtering in Maintaining Safe Alignment of LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10031)
*Jinhwa Kim,Ian G. Harris*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Context Filtering model to tackle jailbreak attacks on Large Language Models (LLMs), improving safety without affecting performance, acting as a plug-and-play solution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the growing safety and ethical risks posed by jailbreak attacks on LLMs, especially where malicious users exploit adversarial inputs to trigger harmful responses.

Method: The study develops a Context Filtering model as a pre-processing method that eliminates unreliable context and uncovers genuine user intent, designed for enhancing LLM safety while maintaining performance.

Result: The proposed model reduced Attack Success Rates of jailbreak attacks by up to 88%, maintaining original LLM helpfulness, and achieved state-of-the-art results in balancing safety and usefulness.

Conclusion: The Context Filtering model proves highly effective in enhancing LLM safety against jailbreak attacks while preserving performance, and it is adaptable to both white-box and black-box models without requiring fine-tuning.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown significant advancements in
performance, various jailbreak attacks have posed growing safety and ethical
risks. Malicious users often exploit adversarial context to deceive LLMs,
prompting them to generate responses to harmful queries. In this study, we
propose a new defense mechanism called Context Filtering model, an input
pre-processing method designed to filter out untrustworthy and unreliable
context while identifying the primary prompts containing the real user intent
to uncover concealed malicious intent. Given that enhancing the safety of LLMs
often compromises their helpfulness, potentially affecting the experience of
benign users, our method aims to improve the safety of the LLMs while
preserving their original performance. We evaluate the effectiveness of our
model in defending against jailbreak attacks through comparative analysis,
comparing our approach with state-of-the-art defense mechanisms against six
different attacks and assessing the helpfulness of LLMs under these defenses.
Our model demonstrates its ability to reduce the Attack Success Rates of
jailbreak attacks by up to 88% while maintaining the original LLMs'
performance, achieving state-of-the-art Safety and Helpfulness Product results.
Notably, our model is a plug-and-play method that can be applied to all LLMs,
including both white-box and black-box models, to enhance their safety without
requiring any fine-tuning of the models themselves. We will make our model
publicly available for research purposes.

### [389] [Cognitive Cybersecurity for Artificial Intelligence: Guardrail Engineering with CCS-7](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10033)
*Yuksel Aydin*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper identifies seven cognitive vulnerabilities in language models and studies how they align or differ from human cognitive security benchmarks, emphasizing the need for model-specific safety evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and mitigate cognitive vulnerabilities in language models, inspired by similar vulnerabilities in human cognition, to improve their behavioral alignment and functional reliability.

Method: Developed CCS-7 (a taxonomy of cognitive vulnerabilities), performed a randomized controlled trial to benchmark humans, and evaluated cognitive security interventions across 12,180 experiments on seven language model architectures.

Result: The study revealed varying responses of different architectures to interventions, with certain vulnerabilities being effectively mitigated while others (e.g., source interference) worsened dramatically in some models. Humans showed consistent moderate improvement.

Conclusion: Cognitive safety in language models is model-specific, requiring architecture-aware testing and tailored interventions to ensure reliable deployment.

Abstract: Language models exhibit human-like cognitive vulnerabilities, such as
emotional framing, that escape traditional behavioral alignment. We present
CCS-7 (Cognitive Cybersecurity Suite), a taxonomy of seven vulnerabilities
grounded in human cognitive security research. To establish a human benchmark,
we ran a randomized controlled trial with 151 participants: a "Think First,
Verify Always" (TFVA) lesson improved cognitive security by +7.9% overall. We
then evaluated TFVA-style guardrails across 12,180 experiments on seven diverse
language model architectures. Results reveal architecture-dependent risk
patterns: some vulnerabilities (e.g., identity confusion) are almost fully
mitigated, while others (e.g., source interference) exhibit escalating
backfire, with error rates increasing by up to 135% in certain models. Humans,
in contrast, show consistent moderate improvement. These findings reframe
cognitive safety as a model-specific engineering problem: interventions
effective in one architecture may fail, or actively harm, another, underscoring
the need for architecture-aware cognitive safety testing before deployment.

### [390] [Certifiably robust malware detectors by design](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10038)
*Pierre-Francois Gimenez,Sarath Sivaprasad,Mario Fritz*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper addresses the vulnerabilities of machine-learning-based malware detectors against adversarial attacks and proposes a robust model architecture for malware analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional machine-learning-based malware detectors achieve high accuracy but are susceptible to adversarial modifications that evade detection while maintaining software functionality.

Method: The authors propose a model architecture that enables certifiably robust malware detection by design and introduce ERDALT as a framework to empirically learn robust detectors.

Result: The proposed solutions are validated and compared against existing methods, demonstrating robust malware detection capabilities with minimal compromise on detection performance.

Conclusion: The findings suggest that certifiably robust detectors can significantly enhance machine learning techniques in malware analysis, ensuring reliable performance in adversarial scenarios.

Abstract: Malware analysis involves analyzing suspicious software to detect malicious
payloads. Static malware analysis, which does not require software execution,
relies increasingly on machine learning techniques to achieve scalability.
Although such techniques obtain very high detection accuracy, they can be
easily evaded with adversarial examples where a few modifications of the sample
can dupe the detector without modifying the behavior of the software. Unlike
other domains, such as computer vision, creating an adversarial example of
malware without altering its functionality requires specific transformations.
We propose a new model architecture for certifiably robust malware detection by
design. In addition, we show that every robust detector can be decomposed into
a specific structure, which can be applied to learn empirically robust malware
detectors, even on fragile features. Our framework ERDALT is based on this
structure. We compare and validate these approaches with machine-learning-based
malware detection methods, allowing for robust detection with limited reduction
of detection performance.

### [391] [Multi-task Adversarial Attacks against Black-box Model with Few-shot Queries](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10039)
*Wenqiang Wang,Yan Xiao,Hao Lin,Yangshijie Zhang,Xiaochun Cao*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: CEMA is a black-box adversarial attack method for multi-task text models that efficiently utilizes adversarial text transferability and minimizes query requirements for practical applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text adversarial attacks struggle in practical scenarios due to the need for extensive shared internal features, high query counts, and limitations in handling multiple task types.

Method: CEMA uses a plug-and-play deep-level substitute model trained for text classification. It generates multiple adversarial candidates across tasks, selects effective ones, and enables efficient black-box attacks across diverse applications.

Result: CEMA achieves significant attack success across multi-task settings, targeting tasks like translation, summarization, and text-to-image generation with minimal queries. It also successfully attacks major commercial APIs and large language models.

Conclusion: CEMA bridges the gap between theoretical and practical adversarial attack applications, offering a versatile and query-efficient solution for real-world multi-task scenarios.

Abstract: Current multi-task adversarial text attacks rely on abundant access to shared
internal features and numerous queries, often limited to a single task type. As
a result, these attacks are less effective against practical scenarios
involving black-box feedback APIs, limited queries, or multiple task types. To
bridge this gap, we propose \textbf{C}luster and \textbf{E}nsemble
\textbf{M}ulti-task Text Adversarial \textbf{A}ttack (\textbf{CEMA}), an
effective black-box attack that exploits the transferability of adversarial
texts across different tasks. CEMA simplifies complex multi-task scenarios by
using a \textit{deep-level substitute model} trained in a
\textit{plug-and-play} manner for text classification, enabling attacks without
mimicking the victim model. This approach requires only a few queries for
training, converting multi-task attacks into classification attacks and
allowing attacks across various tasks.
  CEMA generates multiple adversarial candidates using different text
classification methods and selects the one that most effectively attacks
substitute models.
  In experiments involving multi-task models with two, three, or six
tasks--spanning classification, translation, summarization, and text-to-image
generation--CEMA demonstrates significant attack success with as few as 100
queries. Furthermore, CEMA can target commercial APIs (e.g., Baidu and Google
Translate), large language models (e.g., ChatGPT 4o), and image-generation
models (e.g., Stable Diffusion V2), showcasing its versatility and
effectiveness in real-world applications.

*Jane Carney,Kushal Upreti,Gaby G. Dagher,Tim Andersen*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces a blockchain-based framework, "Sys," to detect data poisoning attacks in federated learning using a decentralized judge model verified through client consensus.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the vulnerability of federated learning to data poisoning attacks while preserving the decentralized nature and privacy of clients' data.

Method: The paper proposes "Sys," a framework that uses blockchain technology to decentralize the server role and incorporates a judge model from client consensus to detect poisoned model updates.

Result: The implementation confirms that "Sys" is robust against data poisoning attacks and scalable in creating the judge model.

Conclusion: The proposed framework enhances the integrity of federated learning systems by enabling effective and scalable detection of poisoned updates without compromising privacy or decentralization.

Abstract: Federated learning enhances traditional deep learning by enabling the joint
training of a model with the use of IoT device's private data. It ensures
privacy for clients, but is susceptible to data poisoning attacks during
training that degrade model performance and integrity. Current poisoning
detection methods in federated learning lack a standardized detection method or
take significant liberties with trust. In this paper, we present \Sys, a novel
blockchain-enabled poison detection framework in federated learning. The
framework decentralizes the role of the global server across participating
clients. We introduce a judge model used to detect data poisoning in model
updates. The judge model is produced by each client and verified to reach
consensus on a single judge model. We implement our solution to show \Sys is
robust against data poisoning attacks and the creation of our judge model is
scalable.

*Pallavi Zambare,Venkata Nikhil Thanikella,Ying Liu*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces the MAESTRO framework to evaluate and eliminate security issues in autonomous agent systems using LLMs, demonstrating practical vulnerabilities and proposing defense strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address security risks associated with combining Large Language Models (LLMs) and autonomous agents in network monitoring and decision-making systems.

Method: MAESTRO framework with seven-layer threat modeling architecture was employed to identify, evaluate, and address vulnerabilities. A prototype using Python, LangChain, and WebSockets was implemented and tested with various modules such as memory and anomaly detection.

Result: Two threat cases were validated: (i) resource denial-of-service via traffic replay, and (ii) memory poisoning by tampering with agent logs, causing performance degradation such as delayed telemetry updates and increased computational load.

Conclusion: The study confirms MAESTRO's effectiveness in threat mapping and risk scoring while suggesting a defense-in-depth approach, including memory isolation, real-time validation, and cross-layer protection, to enhance the reliability of agentic AI in adversarial scenarios.

Abstract: When combining Large Language Models (LLMs) with autonomous agents, used in
network monitoring and decision-making systems, this will create serious
security issues. In this research, the MAESTRO framework consisting of the
seven layers threat modeling architecture in the system was used to expose,
evaluate, and eliminate vulnerabilities of agentic AI. The prototype agent
system was constructed and implemented, using Python, LangChain, and telemetry
in WebSockets, and deployed with inference, memory, parameter tuning, and
anomaly detection modules. Two practical threat cases were confirmed as
follows: (i) resource denial of service by traffic replay denial-of-service,
and (ii) memory poisoning by tampering with the historical log file maintained
by the agent. These situations resulted in measurable levels of performance
degradation, i.e. telemetry updates were delayed, and computational loads were
increased, as a result of poor system adaptations. It was suggested to use a
multilayered defense-in-depth approach with memory isolation, validation of
planners and anomaly response systems in real-time. These findings verify that
MAESTRO is viable in operational threat mapping, prospective risk scoring, and
the basis of the resilient system design. The authors bring attention to the
importance of the enforcement of memory integrity, paying attention to the
adaptation logic monitoring, and cross-layer communication protection that
guarantee the agentic AI reliability in adversarial settings.

*Aydin Zaboli,Junho Hong*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper proposes an advanced security framework tailored for energy management systems, addressing vulnerabilities through a combination of generative AI-based anomaly detection and multimodal analysis techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to tackle cybersecurity vulnerabilities and system problems in EMSs, which have become a pressing concern due to dynamic and interconnected attack vectors within modern supervisory control and data acquisition systems.

Method: The framework includes a multi-point attack model to identify vulnerabilities, employs GenAI-based anomaly detection for identifying threats, and proposes a SoM-GI methodology integrating visual markers and rule-based reasoning to enhance detection accuracy.

Result: Validation on the IEEE 14-Bus system confirms the framework effectively detects threats under various scenarios and identifies inconsistencies via visual analysis.

Conclusion: The integrated framework combines numerical, visual, and linguistic methods, offering enhanced protection for EMSs against diverse cyber threats and system errors.

Abstract: This paper elaborates on an extensive security framework specifically
designed for energy management systems (EMSs), which effectively tackles the
dynamic environment of cybersecurity vulnerabilities and/or system problems
(SPs), accomplished through the incorporation of novel methodologies. A
comprehensive multi-point attack/error model is initially proposed to
systematically identify vulnerabilities throughout the entire EMS data
processing pipeline, including post state estimation (SE) stealth attacks, EMS
database manipulation, and human-machine interface (HMI) display corruption
according to the real-time database (RTDB) storage. This framework acknowledges
the interconnected nature of modern attack vectors, which utilize various
phases of supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) data flow. Then,
generative AI (GenAI)-based anomaly detection systems (ADSs) for EMSs are
proposed for the first time in the power system domain to handle the scenarios.
Further, a set-of-mark generative intelligence (SoM-GI) framework, which
leverages multimodal analysis by integrating visual markers with rules
considering the GenAI capabilities, is suggested to overcome inherent spatial
reasoning limitations. The SoM-GI methodology employs systematic visual
indicators to enable accurate interpretation of segmented HMI displays and
detect visual anomalies that numerical methods fail to identify. Validation on
the IEEE 14-Bus system shows the framework's effectiveness across scenarios,
while visual analysis identifies inconsistencies. This integrated approach
combines numerical analysis with visual pattern recognition and linguistic
rules to protect against cyber threats and system errors.

TL;DR: NetMoniAI is an AI framework combining local node monitoring and centralized analysis to improve network security, now open-source.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve network security monitoring with decentralized AI for scalable and efficient analysis.

Method: Two-layer architecture: autonomous micro-agents for node-level traffic analysis paired with centralized controllers for system-wide threat detection.

Result: The framework scales efficiently, reduces redundancy, accelerates response times, and maintains accuracy.

Conclusion: NetMoniAI demonstrates effective, scalable network security monitoring using agentic AI, available open-source for replication and adaptation.

Abstract: In this paper, we present NetMoniAI, an agentic AI framework for automatic
network monitoring and security that integrates decentralized analysis with
lightweight centralized coordination. The framework consists of two layers:
autonomous micro-agents at each node perform local traffic analysis and anomaly
detection. A central controller then aggregates insights across nodes to detect
coordinated attacks and maintain system-wide situational awareness. We
evaluated NetMoniAI on a local micro-testbed and through NS-3 simulations.
Results confirm that the two-tier agentic-AI design scales under resource
constraints, reduces redundancy, and improves response time without
compromising accuracy. To facilitate broader adoption and reproducibility, the
complete framework is available as open source. This enables researchers and
practitioners to replicate, validate, and extend it across diverse network
environments and threat scenarios. Github link:

### [396] [Searching for Privacy Risks in LLM Agents via Simulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10880)
*Yanzhe Zhang,Diyi Yang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper explores the privacy threat posed by malicious LLM-based agents using adaptive, interactive dialogues to extract sensitive information. It introduces a simulation-based framework to iteratively improve attack and defense strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM-based agents can engage dynamically, making privacy attacks unpredictable and hard to manually detect. Hence, there is a need for frameworks to model and address these threats.

Method: A simulation framework involving three roles—data subject, data sender, and data recipient—was developed. LLMs were used as optimizers in a parallel search algorithm to improve attacker and defender strategies iteratively.

Result: Attack strategies evolved from simple to complex, involving impersonation and consent forgery, while defense mechanisms grew more sophisticated, employing state machines for identity verification.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully identified transferable attack and defense strategies, providing a practical utility for enhancing privacy-aware LLM agents.

Abstract: The widespread deployment of LLM-based agents is likely to introduce a
critical privacy threat: malicious agents that proactively engage others in
multi-turn interactions to extract sensitive information. These dynamic
dialogues enable adaptive attack strategies that can cause severe privacy
violations, yet their evolving nature makes it difficult to anticipate and
discover sophisticated vulnerabilities manually. To tackle this problem, we
present a search-based framework that alternates between improving attacker and
defender instructions by simulating privacy-critical agent interactions. Each
simulation involves three roles: data subject, data sender, and data recipient.
While the data subject's behavior is fixed, the attacker (data recipient)
attempts to extract sensitive information from the defender (data sender)
through persistent and interactive exchanges. To explore this interaction space
efficiently, our search algorithm employs LLMs as optimizers, using parallel
search with multiple threads and cross-thread propagation to analyze simulation
trajectories and iteratively propose new instructions. Through this process, we
find that attack strategies escalate from simple direct requests to
sophisticated multi-turn tactics such as impersonation and consent forgery,
while defenses advance from rule-based constraints to identity-verification
state machines. The discovered attacks and defenses transfer across diverse
scenarios and backbone models, demonstrating strong practical utility for
building privacy-aware agents.

*Varsha Sen,Biswash Basnet*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper addresses the threat of False Data Injection Attacks (FDIAs) in smart grids, particularly in Home Area Networks (HANs). It introduces a machine learning framework using ANN and Bidirectional LSTM for attack detection and classification, validated with synthetic data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address vulnerabilities in smart grids, particularly HANs, which are targeted by FDIAs due to less stringent security, enabling attackers to disrupt operations without triggering alarms.

Method: A machine learning framework using an ANN for real-time detection and a Bidirectional LSTM for classifying FDIA types; synthetic data was used to train and test models.

Result: Experimental results show the proposed models effectively detect and classify FDIAs, providing a scalable and resilient solution for enhancing cybersecurity in smart grids.

Conclusion: The work offers a promising machine learning-based solution for detecting and mitigating FDIAs, contributing to cyber defense mechanisms for smart grid resilience, particularly at residential endpoints.

Abstract: False Data Injection Attacks (FDIAs) pose a significant threat to smart grid
infrastructures, particularly Home Area Networks (HANs), where real-time
monitoring and control are highly adopted. Owing to the comparatively less
stringent security controls and widespread availability of HANs, attackers view
them as an attractive entry point to manipulate aggregated demand patterns,
which can ultimately propagate and disrupt broader grid operations. These
attacks undermine the integrity of smart meter data, enabling malicious actors
to manipulate consumption values without activating conventional alarms,
thereby creating serious vulnerabilities across both residential and
utility-scale infrastructures. This paper presents a machine learning-based
framework for both the detection and classification of FDIAs using residential
energy data. A real-time detection is provided by the lightweight Artificial
Neural Network (ANN), which works by using the most vital features of energy
consumption, cost, and time context. For the classification of different attack
types, a Bidirectional LSTM is trained to recognize normal, trapezoidal, and
sigmoid attack shapes through learning sequential dependencies in the data. A
synthetic time-series dataset was generated to emulate realistic household
behaviour. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed models are
effective in identifying and classifying FDIAs, offering a scalable solution
for enhancing grid resilience at the edge. This work contributes toward
building intelligent, data-driven defence mechanisms that strengthen smart grid
cybersecurity from residential endpoints.

*Yuhao Sun,Yihua Zhang,Gaowen Liu,Hongtao Xie,Sijia Liu*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper introduces Water4MU, a machine unlearning approach utilizing digital watermarking and bi-level optimization for precise unlearning, ensuring model utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the gap of data-level adjustments in existing machine unlearning methods for better control and effectiveness in regulatory compliance.

Method: Proposes Water4MU, a framework based on digital watermarking and bi-level optimization where the upper level minimizes unlearning difficulty and the lower level independently trains the model.

Result: Experimental validation shows Water4MU's superior performance in both image classification and generation tasks, especially in challenging scenarios.

Conclusion: Water4MU enhances machine unlearning via precise data removal without compromising model utility for unrelated tasks, outperforming existing approaches.

Abstract: With the increasing demand for the right to be forgotten, machine unlearning
(MU) has emerged as a vital tool for enhancing trust and regulatory compliance
by enabling the removal of sensitive data influences from machine learning (ML)
models. However, most MU algorithms primarily rely on in-training methods to
adjust model weights, with limited exploration of the benefits that data-level
adjustments could bring to the unlearning process. To address this gap, we
propose a novel approach that leverages digital watermarking to facilitate MU
by strategically modifying data content. By integrating watermarking, we
establish a controlled unlearning mechanism that enables precise removal of
specified data while maintaining model utility for unrelated tasks. We first
examine the impact of watermarked data on MU, finding that MU effectively
generalizes to watermarked data. Building on this, we introduce an
unlearning-friendly watermarking framework, termed Water4MU, to enhance
unlearning effectiveness. The core of Water4MU is a bi-level optimization (BLO)
framework: at the upper level, the watermarking network is optimized to
minimize unlearning difficulty, while at the lower level, the model itself is
trained independently of watermarking. Experimental results demonstrate that
Water4MU is effective in MU across both image classification and image
generation tasks. Notably, it outperforms existing methods in challenging MU
scenarios, known as "challenging forgets".

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current cybersecurity efforts struggle with alert fatigue, high false-positive rates, and the unstructured nature of CTI, which complicates manual analysis and effective incident response.

Method: The authors propose a hybrid retrieval mechanism integrating NLP-based similarity searches in CTI vector databases and standardized external CTI queries, coupled with an LLM-powered response generation module. This framework generates actionable incident strategies which are assessed by both an auxiliary LLM and cybersecurity experts.

Result: Empirical validation demonstrated enhanced accuracy, contextualization, and efficiency in IR processes. The framework reduced analyst workload and response latency in both real-world and simulated scenarios.

Conclusion: The work showcases the potential of LLM-driven CTI integration in improving autonomous cybersecurity operations, setting the stage for adaptive, intelligent frameworks.

Abstract: Effective incident response (IR) is critical for mitigating cyber threats,
yet security teams are overwhelmed by alert fatigue, high false-positive rates,
and the vast volume of unstructured Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) documents.
While CTI holds immense potential for enriching security operations, its
extensive and fragmented nature makes manual analysis time-consuming and
resource-intensive. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-based framework that leverages Large
Language Models (LLMs) to automate and enhance IR by integrating dynamically
retrieved CTI. Our approach introduces a hybrid retrieval mechanism that
combines NLP-based similarity searches within a CTI vector database with
standardized queries to external CTI platforms, facilitating context-aware
enrichment of security alerts. The augmented intelligence is then leveraged by
an LLM-powered response generation module, which formulates precise,
actionable, and contextually relevant incident mitigation strategies. We
propose a dual evaluation paradigm, wherein automated assessment using an
auxiliary LLM is systematically cross-validated by cybersecurity experts.
Empirical validation on real-world and simulated alerts demonstrates that our
approach enhances the accuracy, contextualization, and efficiency of IR,
alleviating analyst workload and reducing response latency. This work
underscores the potential of LLM-driven CTI fusion in advancing autonomous
security operations and establishing a foundation for intelligent, adaptive
cybersecurity frameworks.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the conditional version of the classical regret-capacity theorem and its applications in universal prediction and information measures.

Method: Derivation and mathematical formalization of conditional regret-capacity theorem; applying it to binary memoryless sources and extending to Rényi information measures.

Result: Establishment of conditional regret-capacity theorem, its application to binary memoryless sources, and generalization to conditional Rényi information.

Conclusion: The paper reveals connections between conditional Rényi divergence and Sibson's mutual information, providing insights for information theory and universal prediction.

Abstract: We derive a conditional version of the classical regret-capacity theorem.
This result can be used in universal prediction to find lower bounds on the
minimal batch regret, which is a recently introduced generalization of the
average regret, when batches of training data are available to the predictor.
As an example, we apply this result to the class of binary memoryless sources.
Finally, we generalize the theorem to R\'enyi information measures, revealing a
deep connection between the conditional R\'enyi divergence and the conditional
Sibson's mutual information.

### [401] [Estimating Covariance for Global Minimum Variance Portfolio: A Decision-Focused Learning Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10776)
*Juchan Kim,Inwoo Tae,Yongjae Lee*

Main category: q-fin.PM

TL;DR: The paper applies decision-focused learning (DFL) to improve portfolio optimization, outperforming traditional prediction-focused methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional portfolio optimization methods rely on parameter estimation using mean-squared error (MSE), which does not directly optimize portfolio decisions, potentially leading to suboptimal outcomes.

Method: The study adopts decision-focused learning (DFL) to construct global minimum-variance portfolios (GMVPs), deriving the gradient of decision loss and analyzing properties such as principal components.

Result: Empirical evaluations demonstrate that traditional MSE-based methods often fail to produce optimal allocations, whereas DFL-based methods deliver superior decision performance consistently.

Conclusion: DFL, by focusing on decision quality rather than prediction error, enhances the construction of GMVPs, offering improved portfolio allocations and reduced volatility.

Abstract: Portfolio optimization constitutes a cornerstone of risk management by
quantifying the risk-return trade-off. Since it inherently depends on accurate
parameter estimation under conditions of future uncertainty, the selection of
appropriate input parameters is critical for effective portfolio construction.
However, most conventional statistical estimators and machine learning
algorithms determine these parameters by minimizing mean-squared error (MSE), a
criterion that can yield suboptimal investment decisions. In this paper, we
adopt decision-focused learning (DFL) - an approach that directly optimizes
decision quality rather than prediction error such as MSE - to derive the
global minimum-variance portfolio (GMVP). Specifically, we theoretically derive
the gradient of decision loss using the analytic solution of GMVP and its
properties regarding the principal components of itself. Through extensive
empirical evaluation, we show that prediction-focused estimation methods may
fail to produce optimal allocations in practice, whereas DFL-based methods
consistently deliver superior decision performance. Furthermore, we provide a
comprehensive analysis of DFL's mechanism in GMVP construction, focusing on its
volatility reduction capability, decision-driving features, and estimation
characteristics.

### [402] [Online selective conformal inference: adaptive scores, convergence rate and optimality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10336)
*Pierre Humbert,Ulysse Gazin,Ruth Heller,Etienne Roquain*

Main category: math.ST

TL;DR: The paper proposes an extension (OnlineSCI) to the Adaptive Conformal Inference (ACI) method, allowing selective predictions with controlled error rates in online settings, demonstrated through theory and experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the Adaptive Conformal Inference (ACI) method by enabling selective prediction tasks while ensuring error control in supervised online settings over a long horizon.

Method: Developed OnlineSCI, an extended algorithm incorporating adaptive capability to update point-prediction algorithms in real time, with theoretical proofs for controlling instantaneous error rates and convergence rates for selective tasks.

Result: Theoretical guarantees are established for OnlineSCI's effectiveness in selective prediction tasks, including classification with abstention and online testing, under mild conditions. Adaptive versions show convergence to optimal solutions, with explicit rates demonstrated empirically through experiments.

Conclusion: OnlineSCI extends the functionalities of ACI by allowing selective inferences in an adversarial setting while controlling error rates and demonstrating strong theoretical guarantees and practical performance.

Abstract: In a supervised online setting, quantifying uncertainty has been proposed in
the seminal work of \cite{gibbs2021adaptive}. For any given point-prediction
algorithm, their method (ACI) produces a conformal prediction set with an
average missed coverage getting close to a pre-specified level $\alpha$ for a
long time horizon. We introduce an extended version of this algorithm, called
OnlineSCI, allowing the user to additionally select times where such an
inference should be made. OnlineSCI encompasses several prominent online
selective tasks, such as building prediction intervals for extreme outcomes,
classification with abstention, and online testing. While OnlineSCI controls
the average missed coverage on the selected in an adversarial setting, our
theoretical results also show that it controls the instantaneous error rate
(IER) at the selected times, up to a non-asymptotical remainder term.
Importantly, our theory covers the case where OnlineSCI updates the
point-prediction algorithm at each time step, a property which we refer to as
{\it adaptive} capability. We show that the adaptive versions of OnlineSCI can
convergence to an optimal solution and provide an explicit convergence rate in
each of the aforementioned application cases, under specific mild conditions.
Finally, the favorable behavior of OnlineSCI in practice is illustrated by
numerical experiments.

### [403] [Bayesian Models for Joint Selection of Features and Auto-Regressive Lags: Theory and Applications in Environmental and Financial Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10055)
*Alokesh Manna,Sujit K. Ghosh*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Bayesian framework for selecting variables in linear regression models with autocorrelated errors, improving predictive accuracy and model robustness in time series applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Time series models require methods to capture temporal dependencies in data, such as lagged variables and autocorrelated errors, which are crucial in fields like finance and meteorology.

Method: It uses hierarchical Bayesian models with spike-and-slab priors, coupled with a two-stage MCMC algorithm, for efficient variable selection under high-dimensional settings.

Result: The framework showed improved variable selection accuracy, predictive performance, and robustness to autocorrelated noise in simulations and real-world applications.

Conclusion: This methodology is effective for interpreting and forecasting in autoregressive contexts, outperforming existing approaches in accuracy and robustness while handling high-dimensional challenges.

Abstract: We develop a Bayesian framework for variable selection in linear regression
with autocorrelated errors, accommodating lagged covariates and autoregressive
structures. This setting occurs in time series applications where responses
depend on contemporaneous or past explanatory variables and persistent
stochastic shocks, including financial modeling, hydrological forecasting, and
meteorological applications requiring temporal dependency capture. Our
methodology uses hierarchical Bayesian models with spike-and-slab priors to
simultaneously select relevant covariates and lagged error terms. We propose an
efficient two-stage MCMC algorithm separating sampling of variable inclusion
indicators and model parameters to address high-dimensional computational
challenges. Theoretical analysis establishes posterior selection consistency
under mild conditions, even when candidate predictors grow exponentially with
sample size, common in modern time series with many potential lagged variables.
Through simulations and real applications (groundwater depth prediction, S&P
500 log returns modeling), we demonstrate substantial gains in variable
selection accuracy and predictive performance. Compared to existing methods,
our framework achieves lower MSPE, improved true model component
identification, and greater robustness with autocorrelated noise, underscoring
practical utility for model interpretation and forecasting in autoregressive
settings.

*Daniel Semchin,Emile d'Angremont,Marco Lorenzi,Boris Gutman*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: The study introduces the COMIND model, which leverages structural brain connectivity to model neurodegenerative disease trajectories in a scalable way, evaluated using both simulated and PPMI datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a scalable mechanistic model for clinical and research use in neurodegenerative disease progression, addressing issues of heterogeneity and parameter overload in existing models.

Method: A new model called Connectome-based Monotonic Inference of Neurodegenerative Dynamics (COMIND) was developed, combining diffusion and logistic approaches with structural brain connectivity to ensure monotonic trajectories and a limited parameter set.

Result: The model demonstrated scalability and flexibility with simulated data and PPMI datasets, showing it could generalize without reducing biomarker numbers.

Conclusion: COMIND provides a scalable and effective framework for studying neurodegenerative dynamics, overcoming limitations of existing models.

Abstract: Mechanistic models of progressive neurodegeneration offer great potential
utility for clinical use and novel treatment development. Toward this end,
several connectome-informed models of neuroimaging biomarkers have been
proposed. However, these models typically do not scale well beyond a small
number of biomarkers due to heterogeneity in individual disease trajectories
and a large number of parameters. To address this, we introduce the
Connectome-based Monotonic Inference of Neurodegenerative Dynamics (COMIND).
The model combines concepts from diffusion and logistic models with structural
brain connectivity. This guarantees monotonic disease trajectories while
maintaining a limited number of parameters to improve scalability. We evaluate
our model on simulated data as well as on the Parkinson's Progressive Markers
Initiative (PPMI) data. Our model generalizes to anatomical imaging
representations from a standard brain atlas without the need to reduce
biomarker number.

### [405] [Estimating carbon pools in the shelf sea environment: reanalysis or model-informed machine learning?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10178)
*Jozef Skakala*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: This paper introduces a neural network ensemble trained on a coupled physics-biogeochemistry model to estimate carbon pools in shelf seas, offering a cost-effective alternative to traditional reanalysis models and complementing observational data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the sparsity and high uncertainty in available data for carbon pools in shelf seas and offer a cost-efficient alternative to expensive reanalysis models.

Method: The study trains a neural network ensemble using a model free run simulation to learn the relationship between observable variables and carbon pools, subsequently applying it to reanalysis outputs to reproduce and estimate carbon pools.

Result: In the North-West European Shelf Sea environment, the neural network ensemble effectively reproduced the reanalysis outputs for carbon pools and provided uncertainty quantifications that are missing in the existing reanalysis.

Conclusion: Model-informed machine learning, specifically neural network ensembles, could serve as a viable, cost-efficient alternative to expensive reanalyses and complement observational data in estimating carbon pools.

Abstract: Shelf seas are important for carbon sequestration and carbon cycle, but
available in situ, or satellite data for carbon pools in the shelf sea
environment are often sparse, or highly uncertain. Alternative can be provided
by reanalyses, but these are often expensive to run. We propose to use an
ensemble of neural networks (NN) to learn from a coupled
physics-biogeochemistry model the relationship between the directly observable
variables and carbon pools. We demonstrate for North-West European Shelf (NWES)
sea environment, that when the NN trained on a model free run simulation is
applied to the NWES reanalysis, it is capable to reproduce the reanalysis
outputs for carbon pools. Moreover, unlike the existing NWES reanalysis, the NN
ensemble is also capable to provide uncertainty information for the pools. We
focus on explainability of the results and demonstrate potential use of the NNs
for future climate what-if scenarios. We suggest that model-informed machine
learning presents a viable alternative to expensive reanalyses and could
complement observational data, wherever they are missing and/or highly
uncertain.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of efficiently solving nonlinear filtering problems with robust convergence and computational feasibility.

Method: The authors use nonlinear Feynman--Kac representations and deep BSDE methods, combined with neural networks to approximate unnormalized filtering densities.

Result: The method's convergence rate was theoretically validated and demonstrated through two numerical examples, achieving promising computational accuracy.

Conclusion: The proposed approach enables efficient offline training for online application with mixed error bounds and practical convergence for filtering problems.

Abstract: A novel approximate Bayesian filter based on backward stochastic differential
equations is introduced. It uses a nonlinear Feynman--Kac representation of the
filtering problem and the approximation of an unnormalized filtering density
using the well-known deep BSDE method and neural networks. The method is
trained offline, which means that it can be applied online with new
observations. A mixed a priori-a posteriori error bound is proved under an
elliptic condition. The theoretical convergence rate is confirmed in two
numerical examples.
